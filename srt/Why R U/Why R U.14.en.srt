You didn't help me at all.

How did you get here?

Zon told me.

Zon.

Why didn't you tell me the issue with my dad?

43

Because I didn't want you to fight with him.

44
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,360
This made me fight with him even more, Tutor.

hating each other.

Saifah! Why are you saying this?

You're breaking the mood. The mood is going so well.

Are you going to do "something"?

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,679
Nothing. We haven't gotten done managing our stuff,

so we're going to do it now.

Haven't done it yet because you were managing stuff?

00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,820
You said that you talked with, Fight.

What was it about?

161
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,460
What were you guys talking about?

00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,840
You tell him!

Well, well, well.

164
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,920
We were consulting. You talked with Fight.

Isn't it a good thing?

166
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,460
You should talk to him though.

00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,700
If you look at each other like this,

168
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,599
you'll get pregnant.

169
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:13,220
I think we'd better go.

170
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,779
- Sure.
- All right.

171
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,760
Let's go.

172
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,160
Cheers!

173
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,839
See you in the morning.

174
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,720
Let's go.

175
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,680
Wait up, Fight.

176
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,659
Wait for me.

177
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,580
What were you talking about with Saifah and Zon?

178
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,820
Nothing.

179
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,699
The reason why I'm here, I've just found out too.

180
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,380
I'm just done clearing myself.

181
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,980
I'm not blaming you though.

182
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,800
And this morning,

183
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,020
you didn't show up.

184
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,799
I missed you so much. Did you know that?

185
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,120
What?

186
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,540
I missed you!

187
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,980
And how do I get over missing you?

188
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,680
Fight! You pervert.

189
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,310
Fight, what are you doing?

190
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,000
You like it like this?

191
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,020
You like this, don't you?

192
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,800
Can I take back what is mine?

193
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,090
Fight.

194
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,930
If you want to take back what is yours...

195
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,750
then may I show my ownership?

196
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,820
Okay, Tutor.

197
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,560
Okay.

198
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,500
Are you okay?

199
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,000
I just stretched myself. I'm achy.

200
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,100
Will you play the guitar until dawn?

201
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,100
I'll do it for a while.

202
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,500
Then.

203
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,400
You'd better go to sleep first.

204
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,200
You have music in your heart...

205
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,200
don't you want to have Zon in your heart?

206
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
Okay, I'll go to sleep.

207
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,800
I do want...

208
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,800
And Zon...

209
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
do you want to have Saifah in your heart, right?

210
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
♫ Or did I already love you from the beginning? ♫

211
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,800
♫ I liked you, but it wasn't true ♫

212
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,800
♫ Why did I eventually fall for you? ♫

213
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,400
♫ I liked you, but it wasn't true ♫

214
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,300
♫ Why did I eventually fall for you? ♫

215
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,300
♫ I liked you, but it wasn't true ♫

216
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,200
♫ If it's not... ♫

217
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,700
Are you sure?

218
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:05,509
Yes. I'm sure.

219
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,900
I promise...

220
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,200
that I'll have only you.

221
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,000
I'll give in to you only.

222
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,400
♫ Please, someone in heaven, please tell me ♫

223
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:15,000
♫ This kind of scenario ♫

224
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,300
♫ That's what people call love, right? Is this love?
And if this is love ♫

225
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,500
♫ That's what people call love, right? Is this love?
And if this is love ♫

226
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,800
♫ I've never experienced this before. Is this love? ♫

227
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,000
♫ That I'm trembling and out of control ♫

228
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,600
♫ My heart is shaken, is this real?
Who has said that this is love? ♫

229
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,700
My Zon is getting better and better every day.

230
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Go take a shower.

231
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,200
Go.

232
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,700
Take a shower.

233
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,600
Let's take a shower together.

234
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,600
You don't know how to take a shower alone or what?

235
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,700
Let's take a shower together.

236
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,400
No.

237
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,900
You go.

238
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,000
Go and take a shower.

239
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,400
Let's go together.

240
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,100
No.

241
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,000
Take a shower together!

242
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,400
No!

243
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,400
You go and take a shower!

244
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,300
Get out..!

245
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,600
- Take a shower!
- I won't.

246
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,300
I miss it, do you?

247
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,700
Thank you, Fight, for coming here to me.

248
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,520
If you didn't come, I would have been so lonely.

249
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,700
Ah... It's like....

250
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,569
I think we're falling into the novel...

251
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,699
Ahh... No... I...

252
00:30:29,699 --> 00:30:31,839
I'll invite you guys...

253
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,930
to go for a walk at the beach.

254
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,430
Will you?

255
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,270
But... you don't need to hurry.

256
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,100
Do you want to, Fight?

257
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,119
But Tutor wants to.

258
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:51,080
Please.

259
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,859
Please, Fight. Please.

260
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,339
Please... go...

261
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,170
Let's go...

262
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,330
Then go.

263
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:01,200
You're so cute.

264
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,719
What's wrong with you?

265
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,029
Nothing.

266
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,120
Then follow us downstairs.

267
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,930
Okay, we will.

268
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,610
Leave them alone.

269
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:26,269
Fight, so this means we didn't lock the door all night long.

270
00:31:26,269 --> 00:31:28,399
I don't see any problems.

271
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,860
Fight.

272
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,759
- You're hurting me.
- Why didn't you lock the door?

273
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,720
Why? Are you shy?

274
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,539
- Are you?
- I'm not.

275
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,930
- I'm not.
- Fight.

276
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,590
- I'm not.
- Fight.

277
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:41,960
Why didn't you lock the door?

278
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:52,720
♫ Can't you feel the love that I gave you? ♫

279
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,920
Does nobody feel like swimming in the sea?

280
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,649
Just seeing the view is enough.

281
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,470
The beach.

282
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,150
Let's swim in the sea.

283
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,940
No.

284
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,040
It depends on you.

285
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,989
Your boyfriend is kind of showing off.

286
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:11,720
Maybe because my possessiveness can't reach him.

287
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,320
We'll go back soon. Can't I show off just a bit?

288
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,250
No!

289
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,620
I'm possessive!

290
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,480
- Are you?
- I'm possessive!

291
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,319
- Pardon me?
- I'm possessive!

292
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:26,840
Put on your shirt now!

293
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,180
Let's swim first.

294
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,960
No.

295
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,979
Go with me and I'll put on my shirt.

296
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,240
- Come on.
- No.

297
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,080
Bring your shirt with you!

298
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,920
Later.

299
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,209
Thank you.

300
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,500
Thank you...

301
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,209
For...

302
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,970
For becoming part of my life.

303
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,450
It's me who has to say thank you.

304
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,529
For becoming part of my life.

305
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:16,439
Or... I should say thanks to Zol, too?

306
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:17,779
It doesn't matter.

307
00:34:17,779 --> 00:34:20,269
Whatever it is,

308
00:34:20,269 --> 00:34:23,710
thanks for making us meet.

309
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,950
- Why does it have to be this person?
- Why does it have to be this person?

310
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,410
- Right!
- Right!

311
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,380
Let's swim in the sea.

312
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,760
Okay.

313
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,579
But...

314
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:32,169
Wait, I'm not finished yet.

315
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,460
I'll say...

316
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,740
"Okay, baby"

317
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:43,680
♫ Why do I have to love this person? I don't know either ♫

318
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,790
♫ I've never met someone who makes me crazy like you ♫

319
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,850
Can I ride on your back?

320
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,880
Come on.

321
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,569
I'll ride now.

322
00:35:58,569 --> 00:36:02,790
- One, two...
- So heavy!

323
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,340
Just joking.

324
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,919
Look.

325
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,000
Don't take off your shirt again. I'm possessive.

326
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23,140
I'm possessive, too.

327
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,369
Tutor.

328
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,160
What is it?

329
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,989
Have you ever thought that we would be like this?

330
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:48,279
I don't know either...

331
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,090
but everything that happens...

332
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,360
is from my feelings.

333
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,970
Is it because of love?

334
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,160
Is it?

335
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:14,600
♫ You are the flower in my heart ♫

336
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:21,360
♫ You are the gift. You made me find a new world ♫

337
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:29,110
♫ You are the only one ♫

338
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:39,820
♫ You are my long-awaited dream ♫

339
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:46,600
♫ You are the beautiful love that lights up my day
when I have no one left ♫

340
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:54,140
♫ You are my greatest love ♫

341
00:37:54,200 --> 00:38:05,000
♫ You are the reality that keeps my heart warm all the time ♫

342
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,690
Enough.

343
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,799
You want to swim, don't you?

344
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,999
Let's go. Let's swim.

345
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:29,060
♫ Because I believe in the love that I've found ♫

346
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:33,960
♫ No matter how difficult it is ♫

347
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,720
♫ I'm ready to get hurt ♫

348
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,940
♫ And I will make it meaningful ♫

349
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,880
♫ Because I believe there's someone in this world ♫

350
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,130
♫ Who can fill my heart ♫

351
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:53,520
♫ Although I'm going to fall apart at the end, I'm ready ♫

352
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,810
♫ Although I'm going to fall apart at the end, I'm ready ♫

353
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:00,830
♫ Because I believe in the love that I've found ♫

354
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:06,040
♫ No matter how difficult it is ♫

355
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,600
♫ I'm ready to get hurt ♫

356
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:14,900
♫ And I will make it meaningful ♫

357
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,319
And this is the story of the four of us.

358
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:25,820
My love began with a dream or thought that everything happened

359
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,420
because of my sister's novel.

360
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:41,299
Life is just this.

361
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,200
For my life...

362
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,540
I had to fight on my own.

363
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:52,590
Until I met Fight, who has changed my life.

364
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:01,020
Finally, ones who I want to say thanks to,

365
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:05,300
are my friends who kept telling me to be in the real world

366
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,970
as well as my sister who made me learn.

367
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:46,800
And Saifah, who teaches me how to love.

368
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,500
However, the love between me and Saifah

369
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:58,500
is from me who writes it myself, not anyone else.

370
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,800
It's like the story of the four of us.

371
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,400
Each person learns different things.

372
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,600
Some people might learn that finding their own happiness

373
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:15,600
is important for another's happiness.

374
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,600
Because it's life.

375
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,000
Real life that is not a novel.

376
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,100
♫ Because I believe in the love that I've found ♫

377
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,800
♫ No matter how difficult it is ♫

378
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,600
♫ I'm ready to get hurt ♫

379
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,000
♫ And I will make it meaningful ♫

380
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,800
♫ Because I believe there's someone in this world ♫

381
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,000
♫ Who can fill my heart ♫

382
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:56,100
♫ Although I'm going to fall apart at the end, I'm ready ♫

383
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
♫ I used to miss the old love and I dreamed of him often ♫

384
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,200
♫ Waiting for the day to meet ♫

385
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:14,400
♫ I don't know who that person is,
the imaginary one in my mind ♫

386
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,600
♫ Well, it doesn't look like you ♫

387
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,800
♫ If it's not rue, than it's a trick ♫

388
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,900
♫ The more you are quiet, the more I get attacked ♫

389
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:31,200
♫ Even I don't understand you, you want to warn against me ♫

390
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,600
♫ If you don't love one, then why do you care? ♫

391
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:41,300
♫ If you don't love one, then why do you care? ♫

392
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,600
♫ Is this love? Or is this just a broken heart? ♫

393
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:52,600
♫ I've fallen into a hole, swarming like a dream ♫

394
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:58,800
♫ A true story or miracle are hard to resist ♫

395
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,200
♫ If this is love, then what should I do? ♫

396
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:09,200
♫ What if I can't control my heart?
And what should I do if you know? ♫

397
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:15,400
♫ I'll have to give up on fighting it, and give in to you ♫

398
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,800
♫ In case it's true love, then how will I know... ♫

399
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:42,000
♫ That you have the same feeling for me?
 ♫

400
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,200
♫ Is it because of weird crying out?
Or is it because I want to take a risk? ♫

401
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:50,200
♫ I will try to open my mind for a day ♫

402
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,400
♫ The definition of love depends on one who creates it ♫

403
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,600
♫ Love is about heart and not about body ♫

404
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,600
♫ Your heart might be given to anyone ♫

405
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,700
♫ But my heart is only for you to stay ♫

406
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,800
♫ I could be whatever to you, ♫

407
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,000
♫ If only I had you beside me ♫

408
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
♫ I could be your friend, your brother or whatever ♫

409
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:12,200
♫ If only we knew we feel the same ♫

410
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,400
♫ Is this love? Or is this just a broken heart? ♫

411
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:26,400
♫ I've fallen into a hole, swarming like a dream ♫

412
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:32,700
♫ A true story or miracle are hard to resist ♫

413
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:37,800
♫ If this is love, then what should I do? ♫

414
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:43,100
♫ What if I can't control my heart?
And what should I do if you know? ♫

415
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:49,900
♫ I'll have to give up on fighting it, and give in to you ♫
