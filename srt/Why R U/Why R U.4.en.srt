00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,820
You like boys, don't you?

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,259
What are you talking about?

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,323
You like boys.

4
00:00:11,324 --> 00:00:12,904
You!

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,399
You like boys.

00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:16,719
Tutor!

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,860
You like boys.

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,580
What the heck have you done?

9
00:00:22,581 --> 00:00:23,749
Well, what nonsense are you talking about?

10
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,539
Have you lost your mind!?

11
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,869
You kept talking nonsense... it was annoying!

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,150
But you should not have done it.

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,780
Tutor!

14
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:42,452
Don't let anyone know about this.

00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,010
♫ I used to miss the old love and I dreamed of him often ♫

♫ Waiting for the day to meet ♫

[Why R U - The Series]

25
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,530
Tutor, why did you come back alone?

26
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,040
What about Fighter?

27
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,129
I asked you to bring him back. Where is he?

28
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,830
He'll be back soon.

29
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,960
Soon.

30
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,360
Tutor, what's wrong with you?

31
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,880
You look so stressed.

32
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,620
What's on your mind?

33
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,879
Hwahwa.

34
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,919
What?

35
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,039
Well... can I ask you something?

36
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,060
Go for it.

37
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,600
Do you like him that much?

38
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,830
Why are you suddenly asking me this?

39
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,590
I... I just want to know. Just answer me.

40
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,210
Do I like him so much...?

41
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:09,900
To be honest.

42
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,520
I don't know if I like him so much or not.

43
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,650
But if I stop seeing him now, I would be sad for sure.

44
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:27,960
You asked me because you're afraid that you may not be my priority, aren't you?

45
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,030
It's not like that Hwahwa.

46
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,000
Well, don't overthink this,

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,890
because you are always

48
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,930
my first priority.

49
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:51,030
So... I think I better go home.

50
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,770
You want to come with me? I can take you home.

51
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,690
I'm okay, I will have Fighter take me home.

52
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:07,289
Tutor, it's late-night already, you should go home.

53
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:11,689
Go home! Text me when you get home too.

54
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:14,960
Okay, so I'm leaving.

55
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,730
You're drunk, so please take well care of yourself.

56
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,010
Okay.

57
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,290
Fighter is coming.

58
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,930
Bye-bye.

59
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,530
Day, are you drunk?

60
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,290
A little.

61
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,280
I just woke up and thought it was a dream.

62
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,500
What's the problem between Tutor and Fighter?

63
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,939
Well, it should be nothing.

64
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:53,220
Then why did both of them leave for home so early?

65
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,000
Fighter is not taking you home?

66
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,840
Well, do you want me to take you home?

67
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,620
I'll take you home.

68
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,920
Oh, Fighter!

69
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,259
So, Day, I'm going home. See you later.

70
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:18,679
Get home safe.

71
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,140
Okay.

72
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,254
I wish you happiness.

73
00:07:41,805 --> 00:07:45,479
"Ta-da! Finally, the poll results have been announced."

74
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:49,814
"Club's member is Saifah, an engineer's sophomore."

75
00:07:49,815 --> 00:07:54,419
"And the non-member is Zon, a communication arts' sophomore."

76
00:07:54,419 --> 00:08:00,720
"Come and join our singer-songwriter project of the Soccer Club soon. Yay!"

77
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,040
Yay, right?

78
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,000
No way! I'm not going to join this piece-of-crap project!

79
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,700
You help me hit on Zon, dude.

80
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:38,340
He will be mine on the project day.

81
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,840
What the heck? Hitting on me?

82
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,599
I have to hide from him forever, don't I!?

83
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,940
I barely get to sleep.

84
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,940
Fighter, please leave me alone. If anyone sees, what would they think of us?

85
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,619
I don't like when you're with him.

86
00:08:57,619 --> 00:09:00,719
Let me tell you something, get over your moodiness.

87
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,680
Kiss me.

88
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:05,495
Tutor!

89
00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:08,300
Nooo! Tutor!

90
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,760
Zon, me and Fighter are dating.

91
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,950
So it's not unusual for any couple.

92
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,640
Zon.

93
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,240
Why are you sleeping here?

94
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,539
Err... I...

95
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:31,560
Got lost in a dream, right?

96
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,699
How did you know?

97
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:38,060
You told me many times, so I've learned by heart.

98
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,357
Zon, believe me, don't overthink.

99
00:09:41,357 --> 00:09:45,494
If you overthink, it will be like the Law of Attraction.

100
00:09:45,494 --> 00:09:48,330
Yeah, I don't want to overthink, either,

101
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,720
but there're a lot of things to think about lately.

102
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,542
Get some rest, dude.

103
00:09:53,543 --> 00:09:54,499
Yes.

104
00:09:54,499 --> 00:09:58,000
Oh, I just thought of it!

105
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,250
I saw you and Fighter kissing in my dream.

106
00:10:01,258 --> 00:10:04,129
Plus, you were so proud of it.

107
00:10:04,129 --> 00:10:06,817
Crazy! No way!

108
00:10:06,817 --> 00:10:08,769
For real! It felt so real.

109
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:12,430
I think you've read too much of your sister's fiction.

110
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,469
Hey, Tutor, let's go to class.

111
00:10:15,469 --> 00:10:16,969
Let's go.

112
00:10:16,969 --> 00:10:19,223
Bye for now.

113
00:10:19,224 --> 00:10:21,630
Wait.

114
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,130
Are you not going to say hi to me...

115
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,220
My Zon?

116
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:31,199
The heck "my Zon"! I don't want to argue with you.

117
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:35,099
But if you want to bug me, do it as you did before, please.

118
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:37,579
You doin it like this, I'm not used to it.

119
00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:42,800
Wait, wait, wait! Did I miss something, huh?

120
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,820
Your friend told other people that he's going to play songs with me.

121
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
Let me tell you something.

122
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,920
I... won't play with you.

123
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,760
Won't play?

124
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,160
It's your choice because... I-am-going-to-play.

125
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,919
I-will-never-play.

126
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:07,909
I-am-going-to-play.

127
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:10,899
- I-will-never-play.
- I-am-going-to-play.

128
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,490
Stop!

129
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:25,820
It-is-enough.

130
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,810
Okay? Let's go.

131
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,770
I'm already satisfied, so let's go.

132
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,909
Zon, go to your class. Saifah, let's go to our class.

133
00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:37,530
Wait, wait.

134
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,820
Bye for now, my Zon.

135
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,890
Don't tease him! Go!

136
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,210
Go!

137
00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:00,190
Saifah, why have you been friendly to him lately?

138
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:11,610
Well, never mind. It's good that I don't have to worry.

139
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,590
I just feel like teasing him.

140
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:17,800
I have so much fun when I tease him.

141
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,630
Don't tease him too much. He's already haunted.

142
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,290
Go!

143
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,900
What's wrong? You look stressed.

144
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,670
I had a sleepless night.

145
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,410
Sleepless or stressed out about the Socer Club's polls?

146
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,410
You know too much!

147
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,610
Of course! You don't have to be stressed.

148
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,230
If you don't want to join, just tell them.

149
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,629
Yeah, I know. I won't join.

150
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:57,980
Hey, Zon!

151
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,470
Come here.

152
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,200
Soda is with Luktarn,

153
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,900
I reckon they're going to talk about that for sure.

154
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,890
Let's go and finish this.

155
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,789
Hello, Soda and Luktarn.

156
00:13:21,789 --> 00:13:24,569
Zon, I have something to talk with you about.

157
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:27,929
Okay, I'm not going to beat around the bush.

158
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:30,470
So you know that the Soccer Club

159
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:35,320
has a singer-songwriter project between the club's members and non-members, right?

160
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:39,349
Yes, I know a little bit.

161
00:13:39,349 --> 00:13:43,509
Well, the non-member guy that got the highest score is you, Zon.

162
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:48,390
So I'm going to ask if you're okay with the project?

163
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,760
Well... I... I...

164
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,930
I don't know how to play guitar.

165
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,150
Well, okay, if you're worried about this then don't worry.

166
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:09,309
Because all the Soccer Club's members know how to play guitar.

167
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:11,910
They all can teach you, no worries.

168
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:17,409
Let's do this! Let Champ play guitar and you sing only. I'll tell him for you.

169
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:20,549
- So tricky!
- The club president doesn't even know this!

170
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:22,369
Can you just be quiet, huh!?

171
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:25,690
Soda, one more time, please?

172
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,569
I like it.

173
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,269
Please, Zon.

174
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,130
Please.

175
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,050
Err... I... I really don't want to play. I'm sorry.

176
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:51,570
Wait. Okay. One sec, Zon. Calm down.

177
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:55,409
Let's do this... You just think of it as the university's project, all right?

178
00:14:55,409 --> 00:14:59,350
Well, we'll sell tickets and for the money we get,

179
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,030
we will use to buy sports equipment

180
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,660
for poor and suburban children.

181
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:07,050
And that you will get to make merit.

182
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,250
Besides, imagine the one who gets the highest score doesn't come and join,

183
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,030
who would buy tickets?

184
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:15,409
- What a pity!
- Right?

185
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,213
I'm really sorry, I really don't want to join.

186
00:15:20,213 --> 00:15:23,313
Zon.

187
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,169
What's wrong with your neck?

188
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:31,050
Convince him.

189
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:37,409
My dear friend, Zon. Please don't embarrass me anymore than this.

190
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:40,010
Please say yes to this project.

191
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:45,270
Junior, you have known me for so long,

192
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,300
so you already know that I don't like joining activities.

193
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,590
But you need to have a first time. There's a first time of everything.

194
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:56,109
Enough! Zon, the class will start in five minutes. Let's just go.

195
00:15:56,109 --> 00:15:57,689
Hey! Professor is not arriving yet, no need to rush.

196
00:15:57,689 --> 00:15:59,990
You shut your mouth! Go away!

197
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,410
Soda and Luktarn, I'm sorry. I'll have to go to the class now.

198
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,860
- I'm sorry.
- Zon, wait, Zon!

199
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,680
Zon... Zon... Zon...

200
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:15,110
Zon, can you reconsider it, please?

201
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,129
- Saifah.
- What?

202
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:25,809
May I go to the toilet?

203
00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:27,549
- Pee?
- My eyes hurt.

204
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:30,369
- Why don't you see a doctor?
- Um, go to the toilet first.

205
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:33,730
Huh, what kind of person are you?

206
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,689
- You like boys.
- Tutor!

207
00:16:51,689 --> 00:16:54,020
You like boys.

208
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,280
Hey, Tutor.

209
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,340
Are you okay?

210
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,059
You are acting like a drunk person.

211
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:18,470
Um, it's nothing, I'm okay.

212
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,730
Hello, Fighter. Hi, Dew.

213
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,920
Let's go, quickly.

214
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,289
Hey! Dew, I have to go.

215
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:54,840
What? Go where? Wait!

216
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,889
What's happening?

217
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,339
I think I forgot my phone?

218
00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:15,519
See? You're acting strange.

219
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:17,029
Strange how?

220
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,729
You shouldn't even have a sip of alcohol.

221
00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:21,499
I didn't.

222
00:18:21,499 --> 00:18:26,059
Saifah, you can go back first. You're in a hurry, aren't you?

223
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:27,999
Can you really go back by yourself?

224
00:18:27,999 --> 00:18:31,499
Of course! See you tomorrow.

225
00:18:31,499 --> 00:18:33,999
Okay, see you tomorrow. Take care!

226
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:35,720
See you.

227
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,380
Fighter, is that my phone?

228
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,780
What do you think?

229
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,750
Give it to me!

230
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,940
Quickly!

231
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,799
Why do I have to give it to you?

232
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,979
Fighter.

233
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:17,400
Why do you call my name so often? Huh?

234
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,400
Please return my phone.

235
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,030
You have to promise me first.

236
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:36,860
Don't tell anyone what happened last night.

237
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,770
You ask me to keep promising things.

238
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:50,120
I really want to know if you're abnormal or you're feeling something.

239
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,600
What do you mean by "abnormal"?

240
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,580
Are you thinking...

241
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,000
that I like you, Tutor?

242
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:29,180
Well, whether I want to tell anyone, it's my business.

243
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,319
Hello, Junior. What's up?

244
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:48,179
Zon, I forgot something in the Soccer Club's room.

245
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:50,599
Can you get it for me? It's in the locker.

246
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,399
Um, is there anyone else who can do this for you?

247
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:56,219
No one else, it's only you.

248
00:20:56,219 --> 00:21:00,580
You have to find the locker, and then grab my stuff and go.

249
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,140
What the heck! Why do I have to do this?

250
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,270
Is there anyone outside? Who are you?

251
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,460
Zon, bring me a towel.

252
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,179
Which one, I don't know.

253
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:26,680
It's on the upper row, the leftmost one.

254
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,139
Where are you?

255
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,060
This room.

256
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,500
Here!

257
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,840
Hey! What're you doing?

258
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,560
I'm kidding you.

259
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,760
Thank you.

260
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,040
Yep.

261
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,940
What brings you to my club?

262
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,860
Junior, he asked me to get his stuff.

263
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,310
It figures!

264
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,050
That's why he called me.

265
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:57,820
Don't tell me he made this up to make us meet.

266
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,990
You became smarter.

267
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:08,500
Perhaps, he wants us to join the Cute Boy project?

268
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,020
But let me tell you this,

269
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,620
no matter what,

270
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,820
I won't join the project with you.

271
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,000
It's up to you! I'm easy.

272
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,760
Are you thinking I'm going to kiss you?

273
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,820
Nope!

274
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,680
I will do more.

275
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,460
What's wrong with you?

276
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,860
Hey! Zon?

277
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,870
What kind of person are you ,

278
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,660
acting bashful like girls in Korean dramas?

279
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:43,110
Hey! Do you think it's really good to ask the Cute Boy Fanpage to help with our club activities?

280
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:49,720
I think it is the best option or no one would buy the tickets.

281
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,760
Last year, not many people came.

282
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,290
We could buy only a small number of sports goods for donation.

283
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,400
It wasn't worth it.

284
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,679
Hey, you guys can go back first. I have something to do.

285
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,480
See you tomorrow.

286
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,659
Tanthai, you have to stay.

287
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:13,979
But I have to dine out with my mom and hang out with…

288
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,419
Stop talking!

289
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:20,170
Umm, on that day,

290
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:26,500
the reason I skipped the club was Jia…

291
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,960
Stop!

292
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,050
I'm not talking about that...

293
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:33,810
I'm not talking about that.

294
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,420
What do you want to say?

295
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,359
Next month, we're going to have a soccer match with another university.

296
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:40,379
So what?

297
00:25:40,379 --> 00:25:42,179
Do you want to be in the starting line-up?

298
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:44,270
I do really want to!

299
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:50,110
But you guys never see my potential.

300
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:52,170
I know you are a good player.

301
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:55,430
But many people are doing better in your position.

302
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:59,320
If you think like that, why did you ask me?

303
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,259
You touch me too often; do you have feelings for me?

304
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:04,759
Can I?

305
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:07,299
You're speaking nonsense.

306
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:13,019
Well, you just have to ask Zon to play music for our club. Can you?

307
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:18,039
Japan, Soda just told us that Zon doesn't want to join.

308
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:21,500
Moreover, Zon and Saifah don't get along well with each other.

309
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,179
He cannot even play the guitar.

310
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,920
It doesn't matter.

311
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,540
Just make it happen. I'm counting on you!

312
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,919
It depends on you whether to grab it or let it go.

313
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:34,959
I have helped you.

314
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:37,299
I must grab it, Bro.

315
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:39,670
I have to go, I have to do something.

316
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,690
Hey, one more thing!

317
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:48,840
On the day you're going to play, a scout from U23 Thai National Soccer Team will come.

318
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,080
Your opportunity has come. Try your best!

319
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,679
Hello.

320
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:11,919
Hi, Saifah. Are you free to talk?

321
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,599
Yes, I am.

322
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:18,660
I think you know, it's about the Soccer Club.

323
00:27:20,879 --> 00:27:23,020
Then, I'm going to say it now.

324
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:30,190
The one who received the highest votes for the Soccer Club is you, Saifah.

325
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:31,150
Okay.

326
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,670
I will tell you again about the practice room.

327
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:38,440
I'm coordinating with the Soccer Club.

328
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,079
No problem, you can tell me later.

329
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:49,830
And the non-member of the club who won the vote... is who?

330
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:52,759
He is Zon from the Faculty of Communication Arts.

331
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:57,189
I think you know him well, right? A friend of Tanthai.

332
00:27:57,189 --> 00:28:00,079
Somehow.

333
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:03,300
But the thing is Zon doesn't accept our request.

334
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,790
We're so stressed out right now.

335
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:10,200
I don't know if he'll do it eventually?

336
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,570
Don't worry.

337
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:18,839
I will confirm that again about the one who's going to play the music with you.

338
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:23,260
Okay, update me later.

339
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,450
Okay, I won't bother you anymore.

340
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,820
Have a good night, Saifah.

341
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,049
All right, everyone! Let's take a 10-minute break. Then, we're going to continue.

342
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:43,610
I have to check the Nungnarong fan page.

343
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:46,810
They have just uploaded a new video clip which is really good!

344
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,650
You guys, let's find something to eat. I'm hungry.

345
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,549
- What?
- Let's eat.

346
00:28:57,549 --> 00:28:59,569
You go. I'm too tired.

347
00:28:59,569 --> 00:29:00,880
I'll join you.

348
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,860
Are you two going to join?

349
00:29:02,869 --> 00:29:05,329
No, I don't feel like it.

350
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:08,590
I want to go to the toilet. Let's go.

351
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,150
[Please keep clean.]

352
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,229
I don't want to wear it.

353
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,029
Just wear it, so you will be safe.

354
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:28,589
But it's tight.

355
00:29:28,589 --> 00:29:32,320
Don't tell me… during the daytime?

356
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,830
It's not what I think, is it?

357
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:40,649
If you are not using the toilet, please do not obstruct the path, Mr. Zon.

358
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,509
What's wrong?

359
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:45,029
Somebody is inside.

360
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:47,349
Yes, there should be!

361
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:56,669
Are you telling me they are having sex?

362
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,550
What the heck?

363
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,089
I told you I don't want to wear it. It's tight.

364
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,690
Just wear it. We are freshmen.

365
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:13,570
Our seniors will punish you if you don't wear it.

366
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,890
Smile for what?

367
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:58,430
Hi, Blue. Why are you still here?

368
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:01,729
I have soccer training.

369
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:04,770
The Soccer Club?

370
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,609
Yep!

371
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:11,690
Then, let me tell you straight.

372
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:18,350
May I ask you to be a character in my fiction?

373
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,330
Please.

374
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,890
Yes.

375
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:30,929
Because it's Candy Zol's fiction, that's why I accept it.

376
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,090
Cute, you're so kind.

377
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:36,630
Not like my older brother.

378
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:42,570
Older brother? Zon?

379
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:47,250
I think he became well-known because of your fiction. Am I right?

380
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,049
He doesn't think so.

381
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:52,629
- Believe it or not, he doesn't talk to me at all.
- Seriously?

382
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:59,330
Perhaps, he is not used to this field.

383
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:04,509
You're talking like you are used to it. You read my fiction, right?

384
00:32:04,509 --> 00:32:09,000
Nope... Umm... Yep, I read it.

385
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,870
Indeed, I like it.

386
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:16,200
It widens my vision.

387
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:23,430
Well, who's going to be my couple in the fiction?

388
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,249
Um, it's Dew.

389
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:32,330
What! Dew, the fourth-year student?

390
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:35,069
Irasshaimase! (Welcome)

391
00:32:35,069 --> 00:32:39,889
Oh, that's a crime, Zol.

392
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:43,300
A crime for BL lovers, it's fine.

393
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:47,190
I promise I will make it soft.

394
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:54,089
Well, can you assign my character to be with someone else?

395
00:32:54,089 --> 00:32:57,410
Like... Champ is okay.

396
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:04,809
Um... let me think about it.

397
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:08,810
Anyway, I can say you have consented, right?

398
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:11,969
Tag! May I go?

399
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,369
Okay. Bye-bye.

400
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:16,260
Next year, Dew-Blue must be number one.

401
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,370
Okay!

402
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,550
Am I really going to be a part of the fiction?

403
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,330
Yes!

404
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,400
What should we actually do?

405
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,300
Our fan page has already announced it was Zon.

406
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:36,450
If Zon cannot join, besides losing our faces, your tickets won't be sold.

407
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,290
Huh! Things are going wrong!

408
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:44,160
Can we pause this for a moment?

409
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:47,649
Soda, I'm recommending that you not announce the line-up change yet.

410
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,870
Just wait a little bit longer if anything changes.

411
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,570
Okay? I'm leaving.

412
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:04,089
After the water break, you can take a shower and rest.

413
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:08,270
Thanks for today. See you tomorrow, same time and same place.

414
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:11,769
And about the team practice, let's wait until we have more people.

415
00:34:11,769 --> 00:34:15,080
- Okay? That's it.
- Understood!

416
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,030
Hey, why didn't you say anything?

417
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,929
Here is your water, Japan.

418
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:21,169
You are juicy, aren't you?

419
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:23,569
Nope, Bro.

420
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:26,810
Here is your water, Champ.

421
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:29,170
Here, this is for you, Dew.

422
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,810
What? I only drink mineral water.

423
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,210
Mineral water?

424
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:38,270
Dew, when did you start drinking mineral water?

425
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,229
Normally, I really drink mineral water.

426
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:43,510
I don't drink this. I drink mineral water.

427
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:48,669
I'm sorry. I didn't prepare mineral water for you. Can you have this one instead?

428
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:52,189
Go and find mineral water for me. Now!

429
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,420
But…

430
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,050
But…?

431
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:59,470
No, give me mineral water.

432
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:04,649
- No!
- Take it!

433
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:09,269
- I will drink mineral water.
- Take it!

434
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,570
You should take a break, Blue.

435
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:22,330
Hurry up!

436
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:26,509
You love teasing our junior.

437
00:35:26,509 --> 00:35:30,650
What's wrong with you? Why did you do that?

438
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,370
I like to tease him.

439
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,690
Hubby!

440
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:46,890
Look at that, girls! That muscle, that sweat, that's so great.

441
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,130
Calm yourself down. He belongs to your friend.

442
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:52,250
Really? Is he hot?

443
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:58,330
Have you lost your mind? No one talks about that openly.

444
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,850
That's full.

445
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,750
Fighter!

446
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,550
Hwahwa, what's up?

447
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:46,450
I know you are practicing, so I….

448
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:50,030
Here you are.

449
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,609
I brought you some water.

450
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:55,930
Thanks a lot. May I continue my practice?

451
00:36:55,930 --> 00:37:00,310
Fighter, I'm waiting for you right here.

452
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:02,480
Tell me whenever you're done.

453
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,010
You better go back first.

454
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:15,069
Okay, that's good. Actually, I have something to do.

455
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:19,290
So, do your best! Don't get hurt.

456
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,390
Are you okay?

457
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:38,109
Hey, I'm okay. I'm very okay, girls.

458
00:37:38,109 --> 00:37:40,690
May I go back now?

459
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:43,890
I've just realized I have something to do.

460
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:47,710
Don't be too worried about that.

461
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:01,400
Hwahwa, what's wrong?

462
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,210
You asked me to see you all of a sudden.

463
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:08,930
Tutor, I have something to discuss with you.

464
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:12,170
What do you want to talk to me about?

465
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:19,610
I feel that Fighter is acting strange to me.

466
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:23,410
Well, how?

467
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:28,830
I understand that Fighter and I are not a couple,

468
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:33,290
but everyone knows we're seeing each other.

469
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:41,470
He doesn't do things like people who are seeing each other do.

470
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:47,670
Like what other people do?

471
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:52,370
I want somewhat clarity.

472
00:38:53,690 --> 00:39:00,569
So, what you want is a love confession, right?

473
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,350
Nope.

474
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:10,799
Um, we have never had sex.

475
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,820
Hwahwa!

476
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:18,100
At least, it would be a piece of evidence showing

477
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:22,900
he feels toward me more than a friend.

478
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,940
Even kissing, we have never done.

479
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,160
Don't you think it's strange?

480
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,700
Tutor?

481
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,980
Tutor?

482
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,240
Are you listening to me?

483
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,520
I'm listening to you.

484
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:12,839
Hwahwa, listen to me. I think there's nothing.

485
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:18,200
Perhaps, he's just a gentleman.

486
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:23,080
So, he doesn't do such things.

487
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:27,919
Why are men so cruel? I don't want to love anymore.

488
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:32,219
Go and love each other, those mean guys.

489
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:37,760
Hwahwa, listen.

490
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,140
You must calm down.

491
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:47,190
If you feel uncomfortable or cannot stop thinking about it,

492
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,550
you have me.

493
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:50,460
I'm right here ready to talk.

494
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,219
Thanks, Tutor.

495
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,820
I have to go.

496
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,140
Tutor!

497
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,320
Tutor!

498
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:27,180
What were you talking about with Hwahwa?

499
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,300
That's my business!

500
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,900
Why don't you ask Hwahwa?

501
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,079
What were you talking about?

502
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,220
She is feeling uneasy.

503
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,920
If you want to know, you should ask Hwahwa by yourself.

504
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,139
Why do you care so much about Hwahwa?

505
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:46,120
You said you don't have feelings for Hwahwa, didn't you?

506
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:51,099
When will you stop getting involved between Hwahwa and me?

507
00:41:51,099 --> 00:41:53,999
Well, when will you stop playing this?

508
00:41:53,999 --> 00:41:57,279
You have been acting like this since student orientation time.

509
00:41:57,279 --> 00:41:59,390
You hugged and kissed me.

510
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:01,660
Men don't play together like this!

511
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:06,420
Because you get on my nerves, Tutor.

512
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:10,440
Let me ask. How is it abnormal?

513
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,219
[5 Months earlier]
Don't think too much Hwahwa.

514
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,340
I think you should spend more time with Fighter.

515
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,579
Maybe, sometimes, you should give him more space as well.

516
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:27,660
Getting too close, he might feel uncomfortable.

517
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:31,640
That's all right. I'm ready to give you advice anytime.

518
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,400
You understand me more than I thought.

519
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:46,340
I don't understand you. I just said something neutral.

520
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,580
What?

521
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,640
What?

522
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,099
Just that!

523
00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:08,599
What are you doing?

524
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:12,879
Can't I just talk to someone who understands me?

525
00:43:12,879 --> 00:43:16,540
You don't need to come this close.

526
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:26,200
Why? Are you afraid I will do something?

527
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,900
No!

528
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,640
I'm afraid that someone will misunderstand us.

529
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,570
One more thing,

530
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:41,770
I understand Hwahwa, not you. Understood?

531
00:43:41,779 --> 00:43:44,660
If you don't have anything else to say, may I leave now?

532
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,020
What are you doing?

533
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:04,060
What if I want to know and understand you,

534
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,940
can you tell me?

535
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:11,040
It's not fun. What if somebody sees this?

536
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,640
You are my junior, I can do whatever.

537
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,150
May I ask you seriously? Whenever we are alone,

538
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,440
why do you love playing like this?

539
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,200
I just want to tease you.

540
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,259
[Hey, you!]

541
00:44:46,259 --> 00:44:52,900
[Someone said they saw you and Fighter were about to kiss at the faculty building.]

542
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:57,960
[Me? Kissing, Saifah?]

543
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,519
[He just teased me like he always did.]

544
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:02,759
[He just brought his face very close to my face, that's it.]

545
00:45:02,759 --> 00:45:09,980
[Why does he like to do that?]

546
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:12,520
[Nothing, he just loves to tease me.]

547
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,699
[If I didn't know he was seeing Hwahwa, I would think he likes you.]

548
00:45:14,699 --> 00:45:16,719
[No men play with each other like this.]

549
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:21,450
Yes, I just want to tease you.

550
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,820
Do you do it with everyone you want to tease?

551
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,310
Why? It's just only you.

552
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:32,600
♫ This is unexpected, my heart still isn't so sure
about how to start loving ♫

553
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,870
♫ I've never known about how real love is supposed to be ♫

554
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:41,860
♫ Until the day you existed, a cold-hearted person like me
was changed, I still don't get it ♫

555
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:45,820
Okay! I have to go.

556
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:50,030
♫ No one knows why ♫

557
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:54,820
♫ I still want to figure it out ♫

558
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:59,180
[Let's have a gang meeting now at the circle ground.]

559
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:02,880
[Let me take a break. I just finished my class.]

560
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,720
[Everyone in the gang is waiting for you.]

561
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,420
[You will force me to play music, right? I won't do it no matter what.]

562
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:13,280
[Be rational.]

563
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,760
[Okay, Okay.. I'll tell you why.]

564
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,930
[Hurry up!]

565
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:49,980
What are you doing behind me? You frightened the hell out of me.

566
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,580
Wait. Talk with me first.

567
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,039
What?

568
00:46:57,039 --> 00:46:58,639
I have something to talk to you about.

569
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:01,500
With me? What?

570
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:07,470
You…. don't want to play music with me, do you?

571
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:11,789
Yes, I don't want to jump into Yaoi fiction.

572
00:47:11,789 --> 00:47:13,049
Yaoi?

573
00:47:13,049 --> 00:47:16,970
So be it!! You won't know about it. I am going now.

574
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:19,740
Next time, don't do this. I don't like it.

575
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:30,980
You easily fall down.

576
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:40,480
Hey, Zol is so fierce.

577
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,810
Why did she match Saifah and Zon?

578
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:50,979
Oh, so fierce. I think I have to read this fiction.

579
00:47:50,979 --> 00:47:55,600
Stop! That's why I don't agree with it.

580
00:47:55,600 --> 00:48:01,080
If I agree, everyone might think I am Saifah's boyfriend.

581
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,170
You are afraid of other people.

582
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:05,340
Why did you swear with her?

583
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,230
What did you think?

584
00:48:08,309 --> 00:48:11,090
I was furious at that time!

585
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:13,780
She told me that I was Saifah's boyfriend.

586
00:48:13,789 --> 00:48:17,190
I made a slip to swear it

587
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:22,220
because I thought she would delete the fiction.

588
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:27,800
So you guys, please don't invite me to the Soccer Club.

589
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,530
I will not do it.

590
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:31,640
Then, don't join.

591
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,640
Junior, stop forcing him.

592
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,620
Why do you smile?

593
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,579
May I hit you? Why do you laugh?

594
00:48:44,579 --> 00:48:47,559
Nothing, I won't force him.

595
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:52,730
But I think the reason why you won't agree is

596
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,950
because you are afraid of falling in love with him. Right?

597
00:48:55,950 --> 00:48:59,880
I think so. Moreover, he is so handsome.

598
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,710
Whoever is close to him may vacillate.

599
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:05,790
Especially you, Zon. I think you might vacillate.

600
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:09,270
Or you are afraid?

601
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:14,340
I just fear that the fiction will control my life.

602
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:16,269
You didn't agree cause you were afraid, right?

603
00:49:16,269 --> 00:49:18,019
- You are a coward.
- The coward.

604
00:49:18,019 --> 00:49:19,479
- Piece of crap.
- Humble.

605
00:49:19,479 --> 00:49:21,319
- Short.
- Callow.

606
00:49:21,319 --> 00:49:23,330
- High.
- Insole.

607
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:24,850
I'm pissed!

608
00:49:26,299 --> 00:49:27,589
I agree to do this.

609
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:32,189
- Yeah, yeah.
- Completed!! Yeah!

610
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:34,490
I'll call Soda first.

611
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:39,780
See you, see you.

612
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,619
I can't refuse, right?

613
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:49,620
Yes! Then, I will find some dessert for you.

614
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,840
- Do you want to go?
- Okay. go!

615
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:54,370
Let me go with you.

616
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:00,260
Why are you so stupid? Zon!!

617
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:11,390
I do everything, starting with taking a note,

618
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:16,770
collecting documents, then relocating documents.

619
00:50:18,879 --> 00:50:20,989
Damn!

620
00:50:20,989 --> 00:50:23,490
Professor, let me help you.

621
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,010
Okay. For sure, help me, please.

622
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:32,180
Oh, for goodness sake! It is blown away.

623
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,860
Please help me.

624
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:36,610
It's good that you came, please help me.

625
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:39,830
Everything is spread out there.

626
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:45,730
What's happened to me? If both of you didn't come, it would have been pretty bad.

627
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:48,350
Over there too. Collect it.

628
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,120
Hello.

629
00:50:56,270 --> 00:51:00,400
There is an urgent meeting, right? Okay.

630
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:09,929
Well, may I bother your time to take it to my room?

631
00:51:09,929 --> 00:51:13,840
Yes, Of course. Uhh. Professor... Where is your room?

632
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,749
- Building A.
- Building A.

633
00:51:15,749 --> 00:51:19,850
Yes, building A. May I commit it to your care? Please help me.

634
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:23,050
Sure!

635
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:25,710
You, let me help.

636
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,130
I can carry two boxes.

637
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,390
Never mind, give me three boxes.

638
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:37,550
Okay. Thanks….

639
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:49,249
Go.

640
00:51:49,249 --> 00:51:54,030
Fighter, do you know where the room is?

641
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,740
Follow me.

642
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,880
Here it is!

643
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:19,750
Are you tired? Can I help you?

644
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:23,270
Never mind, I can carry them.

645
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,100
Then go.

646
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:32,510
It's this room Fighter.

647
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:38,450
Let me help!

648
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,900
You held my hand again.

649
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:55,610
Who? It's you that held my hand.

650
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:00,760
You are generous, aren't you?

651
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,770
Umm, thank you too.

652
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:06,690
Go!

653
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:31,250
Hey, Fighter. The door was locked.

654
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,500
Is anyone here?

655
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:41,010
I think we should find another way.

656
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,479
Normally, there is more than one exit to a building.

657
00:53:47,479 --> 00:53:52,160
Then, you go right and I will go left. Are you okay?

658
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,020
Go!

659
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:59,990
Fighter.

660
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,430
Fighter.

661
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:05,420
Fighter!

662
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:10,550
Are you teasing me? Fighter.

663
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:29,600
♫ This is unexpected, my heart still isn't so sure
about how to start loving ♫

664
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:33,680
♫ I've never known about how real love is supposed to be ♫

665
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,760
[Next Episode]
Can you teach me English?

666
00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:43,150
I do understand if you expel me.

667
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:48,740
When will you give me your Line ID?

668
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,690
Are you ready to see your buddy...

669
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:55,250
One... two... three.

670
00:57:55,259 --> 00:57:57,220
I am sorry but I....

671
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,850
♫ Please, someone in Heaven, tell me ♫

672
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:11,510
♫ This kind of scenario ♫

673
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:16,960
♫ That's what people call love, right? Is this love?
And if this is love ♫

674
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,580
♫ I've never experienced this before. Is this love? ♫

675
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:26,910
♫ That I'm trembling and out of control ♫
