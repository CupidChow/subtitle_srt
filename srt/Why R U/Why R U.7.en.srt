00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,300
Do you like men?

2
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:11,819
Answer me!

3
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,900
Fight!!

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,010
Answer!

5
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,160
Is this your answer?

6
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,239
I just wanted to tell you that

7
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,350
what I did that day...

8
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,759
was the same as I did today.

9
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,820
What does it mean to you...

10
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,600
today?

11
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,630
I just...

12
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
I just want to tease you, Tutor.

13
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,409
I'm leaving then.

14
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,350
See you tomorrow.

♫ I used to miss the old love and I dreamed of him often ♫

16
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,980
♫ Waiting for the day to meet ♫

17

♫ I don't know who that person is,

19
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,080

[Why R U - The Series]

26
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,320
Hello, Hwahwa.

27
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,540
Yes, I'm waiting in front of the faculty.

28
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,900
I see. That's why you kept me waiting in front of the faculty for so long.

29
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,550
Well… I want to talk to you face to face.

30
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,460
Then we'll talk later when you're free.

31
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,030
Hey!

32
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,309
Fight.

33
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,370
Why do you intentionally not pick up my call?

34
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,000
Fight... well...

35
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,329
About the day before.

36
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,930
I told you.

37
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,720
I'm just teasing you.

38
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,360
Listen. If you did not take this seriously, why should you be serious?

39
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,100
What time do you finish class today? I'll pick you up.

40
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,269
And then go to your room so you can tutor me.

41
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:57,439
I'm busy.

42
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,570
I have to work at Kae's cafe today.

43
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,910
I'm leaving.

44
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,050
Toilet right? And he was suddenly in the toilet while I was there, too.

45
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,279
I was just touching his ass for a bit.

46
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,359
Good evening. Here's the menu from our cafe.

47
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:29,290
Right now, we have a new menu. It's very delicious.

48
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:33,600
- Is it that delicious?
- Yes, it really is!

49
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,149
I see but I think the staff is way more delicious.

50
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,100
I see.

51
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,430
Well, what is this menu? Can you read it for me, please?

52
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,449
This one? This is a sandwich.

53
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,629
Sandwich?

54
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:52,349
- Ooh! Sandwich it is.
- It's good then.

55
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:55,609
Look! I can't read it over here. Can you read it for me, please?

56
00:06:55,609 --> 00:06:56,940
This one is...

57
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,910
This... These are Crab Sticks, Tuna.

58
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:05,719
Chicken breast and salad dressing.

59
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:08,129
He's really handsome. His skin is so good.

60
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,700
Please, service us.

61
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,460
His skin is so good.

62
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,059
Hey! Why are you here, Fight?

63
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,820
Go wait outside!

64
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,100
He is my boyfriend.

65
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,950
Please respect him...

66
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,840
if you come here again next time.

67
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,000
Or else...

68
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,660
What did you say to them?

69
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,200
I just said that...

70
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,800
you were my boyfriend.

71
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,110
And… we made love last night.

72
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,700
Oh! That was so harsh!

73
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,109
Why did you say that?

74
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,270
I was helping you, Tutor!

75
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,440
I told you to quit that job and just tutor me only.

76
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,819
Nope.

77
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,950
And... why did you come here today?

78
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,250
I was just free, so I came to see you.

79
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,500
You are annoying!

80
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,620
You said it!

81
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,440
Fight.

82
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,150
Am I annoying you?

83
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,379
But... you have to be with me for a long time.

84
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:18,780
♫ Please, someone in heaven, please tell me ♫

85
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,570
♫ This kind of scenario ♫

86
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:27,980
♫ That's what people call love, right? Is this love?
And if this is love ♫

87

♫ I've never experienced this before. Is this love? ♫

88
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,550
I mean you have to tutor me for a long time.

89
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,679
I'm busy.

90
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,969
You said that I could not meet you at your dorm!

91
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,999
So I came here.

92
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,839
To pick you up to tutor me at home.

93
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,199
I don't have books with me.

94
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,350
A person like you didn't prepare books, huh?

95
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,450
Fight.

96
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,600
You Koala Bear!

97
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,840
Nothing.

98
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,100
I saw your house and it reminds me of mine.

99
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,320
Is that your dad?

100
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,659
Yes.

101
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,969
Hey. How long will you keep exploring my house?

102
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,349
Then you lead me.

103
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,330
I don't know where your room is.

104
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,570
Follow me.

105
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,600
What's wrong?

106
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,900
Why are you making a pouty face?

107
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,470
I told you that I wanted to read a book in my room.

108
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,050
But you kept bothering me.

109
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,530
Anyway. You're with me now.

110
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:20,149
Look! Don't be so serious.

111
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,799
Just chill! You can pass the exam easily.

112
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,009
Look at me! I'm chilling.

113
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:37,740
A person who failed English 4 has. no. right. to. say. that!

114
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,510
Come, come, come.

115
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,670
Teach me English and I'll read it myself.

116
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,599
Will you, Mr. Tutor?

117
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,630
Do you also have this side of you?

118
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,360
What side?

119
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:15,030
A non-power-crazed side and a non-pouty face like this!

120
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,500
What are you doing?

121
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,730
You missed.

122
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,250
Let's study! Come, I'll teach you.

123
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,660
Let's go. See?

124
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:36,569
I'll teach you about "-ing" verb because you have to take the English 4 exam.

125
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:41,060
I think "-ing," "-es," and "-ses" are important.

126
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,000
What are you looking at?

127
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,019
Oh... I was looking at my teacher.

128
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,730
Yeah, whatever, keep studying.

129
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:56,459
Nope, you have to answer this way. Let's take a look at the previous page.

130
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,650
Let's try doing as suggested. It will be easier.

131
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,850
Keep doing it.

132
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:10,999
Fat with "s".

133
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,929
Who's fat?

134
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,569
Mee (Mr. Bear).

135
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,019
- Fat is written as fat. Right?
- Yeah.

136
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,949
Right? It means fat.

137
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,679
This one, too. It's written "bear".

138
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,670
- Bear.
- Koala bear.

139
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,599
- Oh! Koala bear.
- Yep.

140
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,970
I'm not that stupid, Tutor! I know this.

141
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,350
This is a koala. You see?

142
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,780
Yes.

143
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,370
Dad.

144
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,630
This is my father, Tutor.

145
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,500
Good evening, Uncle.

146
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,239
Good Evening, son.

147
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,250
Dad, this is Tutor.

148
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,979
I hired him to teach me.

149
00:15:06,979 --> 00:15:08,850
He's really good at studying.

150
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,250
I see.

151
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,700
I'll leave him with you because Fighter is not good at studying.

152
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,640
He keeps playing gamse all day.

153
00:15:18,649 --> 00:15:20,109
Dad!

154
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,329
Hey. Have you seen Hwahwa?

155
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,419
Not really, Dad.

156
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,039
If you want to ask me about Hwahwa then I have to go.

157
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,619
No, no.

158
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,930
I'm about to leave actually. Make yourself comfortable.

159
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,149
See you later, Uncle.

160
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,850
See you.

161
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,610
What's wrong?

162
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,350
Talking about Hwahw made you worried?

163
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,220
Have you seen Hwahwa?

164
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,000
Not really.

165
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,090
See you tomorrow.

166
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,610
Up to you then.

167
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:10,150
Come, I'll give you a lift.

168
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,030
Baby, I miss you so much.

169
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:23,949
What a begging face. What do you want? Let me know.

170
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,970
Meowwww.

171
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,079
Meowww.

172
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,800
You're making this begging face, what do you want?

173
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,340
(Is P'J a guy like this?)

174
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,760
Meowwwwwww.

175
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,260
Hey! Tai!

176
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,530
- Meow
- Meow.

177
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:58,770
You're making me feel so good.

178
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,999
And about what you just saw, this cat belongs to my mom.

179
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,230
My mom raised him this way, so I have to do it the same way as she does. Get it?

180
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,330
I don't like cats actually. No big deal!

181
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,719
Do not make fun of me! Understood?

182
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:14,160
When you are with me, you don't have to keep up your appearance actually.

183
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,490
I think you being like this...

184
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,200
is kind of cute.

185
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,320
Cute?

186
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,570
Meoww.

187
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:36,300
And what are you doing here by the way?

188
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,350
You know what, it's Junior.

189
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,630
He had an appointment with me to play soccer.

190
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,819
I called him but he didn't pick up.

191
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:47,059
He LINEd me that he was taking a shower.

192
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,039
And I suddenly met him by chance.

193
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,570
But you know what, I have found something more surprising.

194
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,940
What?

195
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,409
I've found a giant cat.

196
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,279
Meow.

197
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,129
You're making fun of me again.

198
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,259
And stop touching my body, you keep touching my body.

199
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,399
You were fooled by him.

200
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,520
He went out with Soda a while ago.

201
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,040
You are stupid!.

202
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:16,430
Junior! He always chooses women first,

203
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,730
but I think your cat is cute.

204
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,199
Can I play with him?

205
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,600
Sure.

206
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,000
I think...

207
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,170
he is quite cute.

208
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,420
And he's cringing.

209
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,680
I think his eyes are really beautiful.

210
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,670
Well then, I'm going home.

211
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,949
You should leave now.

212
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,770
Well...

213
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm leaving.

214
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,750
Meowww.

215
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,170
I'm leaving.

216
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,980
I'm leaving.

217
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:58,430
Holy! I was kissed on the hand.

218
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,430
What?

219
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:26,900
I just happen...

220
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,880
to want to buy a new guitar.

221
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,680
But I don't know which one I should buy.

222
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,550
Do you have any recommendations?

223
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:38,219
I do have a lot.

224
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,140
It depends on your budget.

225
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,500
Oh, so...

226
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,810
Anything around 3,000-5,000 baht. Is it okay?

227
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,120
There is.

228
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,270
I'll send you a link via LINE.

229
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,740
And... you have to take me to buy it.

230
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,620
If I'm free though.

231
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,300
Please be free for me.

232
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,549
I want you to be there to help me choose.

233
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,070
Please...

234
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,600
Yesss!

235
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,250
Did you hear what I said?

236
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,330
When will you be free anyway?

237
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,650
You sure you can come?

238
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,799
I'm sure.

239
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,500
Then, let's go on Saturday before the show.

240
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,959
Is it okay?

241
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,920
- I think so.
- Okay. Ditto! I booked you!

242
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,110
You can't go anywhere with anyone else!

243
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,850
Understood?

244
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,080
Did you hear what I said?

245
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,040
I did.

246
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,440
Okay. Right on!

247
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,800
A willing sound, please!

248
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,259
Are you forcing me?

249
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,580
I'm not.

250
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:56,960
It's just... I wanted to hear a sound that was more kind of willing.

251
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,860
Sure. As you wish, Mr. Zon.

252
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,619
I'll help you choose it.

253
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,679
Was this pleased you enough?

254
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,710
Okay. Thank you.

255
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,270
Ah, I'll send you a link.

256
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,659
Don't forget to check it out though.

257
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,220
That's it.

258
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:20,150
♫ Or was it when our eyes met, you then bewitched me? ♫

259
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:25,420
♫ How is it possible that you are the one? ♫

260
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:30,060
♫ I can't figure it out, I was standing still
then you suddenly came into my life ♫

261
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:36,280
♫ How many reasons are there that make
people love each other? ♫

262
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,720
Here, Fight

263
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,620
Fight.

264
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,840
Why are you throwing the vegetables away?

265
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,620
I don't eat Chinese kale.

266
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,140
And why didn't you let me know?

267
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,280
So I wouldn't order it.

268
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,130
Hey! It's okay.

269
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,960
I can eat it.

270
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,240
I'll eat only crispy fried pork.

271
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,480
You went out of your way to buy it for me.

272
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,780
What are you doing, Tutor?

273
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,170
You don't eat Chinese kale, don't you?

274
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,160
And what will you eat then?

275
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,060
I can eat only Chinese kale

276
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,260
Tutor.

277
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:37,099
You know what? All my life,

278
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,640
there has been no one who has ever done something like this for me before.

279
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,400
You're the first one.

280
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,920
- Hey!
- Hey! Fight

281
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,660
I'm sorry.

282
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,340
Are you wet?

283
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,020
Why is your heart beating so fast?

284
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,180
You heard it?

285
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:22,960
♫ What should I do with the truth that I'm facing? ♫

286
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,530
♫ What should I do with this "I love you" feeling? ♫

287
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:33,940
♫ Even the truth was not as I expected ♫

288
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:39,340
♫ I don't know what tomorrow will be ♫

289
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:49,400
I think I should leave.

290
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,260
I'll give you a lift.

291
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,340
It's fine, I'll go by myself today.

292
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,100
Then I'll get you a taxi.

293
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,559
Hello, Zon.

294
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,340
Where are you?

295
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,400
I'm on my way to the classroom.

296
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,900
You'd better hurry.

297
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,899
What's wrong with you?

298
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,280
Why are you covered with a blanket?

299
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,519
It was cold up there.

300
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,620
So I came to wait for you down here.

301
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,480
Are you sick?

302
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,659
No, you're not.

303
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,040
The aircon up there might be broken.

304
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,840
It was strangely cold.

305
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,220
About the show, what song are we going to sing?

306
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,720
I have thought about it.

307
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,200
But I'm not sure you're going to like it or not.

308
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,719
What song? Is the meaning good?

309
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,320
It's called "Why R U"?.

310
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:49,900
♫ Why do I have to love this person? I don't know eighter ♫

311
00:28:49,900 --> 00:29:01,600
♫ I've never met someone who makes me crazy like you ♫

312
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:05,630
♫ Why do I have to love this person? I don't know either ♫

313
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:11,800
♫ How can my heart suddenly have you in it? ♫

314
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:16,460
♫ The more I think, the more I don't understand ♫

315
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,600
This song is good

316
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,460
Good meaning.

317
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,800
Then I'll figure it out the chords.

318
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,030
I'll be the lead vocal.

319
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,259
But...

320
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,320
You know what?

321
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,759
It's almost showtime.

322
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,239
Rehearsal time is not enough.

323
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:55,260
I think from now on, on Friday and Saturday,

324
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,410
can I sleep over in your room?

325
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,039
Sure. Come.

326
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,400
Let's sleep together.

327
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,300
Will you tease me again?

328
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,800
Don't tease me again.

329
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,900
I was... haunted by the novel.

330
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,400
Why?

331
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,300
Do I look like a person in your imagination?

332
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,579
Do you think we became close too fast?

333
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,000
Look, Zon!

334
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,800
If people do really hate each other,

335
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,100
they would not be like this.

336
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,639
Unless...

337
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,399
I think we better hurry to rehearse the music.

338
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,359
We've been wasting a lot of time.

339
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,659
The music room is boring.

340
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,400
I want to do something different.

341
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,500
Something different? How?

342
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,000
Let's go to the rooftop.

343
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,600
The rooftop?

344
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,400
You sure?

345
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,000
I am.

346
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,400
Let's go.

347
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,500
I'm coming.

348
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,200
Are we not practicing guitar?

349
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,800
Yes, we will.

350
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,600
Can't I enjoy the moment first?

351
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,400
The stars are beautiful.

352
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,400
It is beautiful.

353
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,800
Take my picture for me.

354
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,100
Ask me nicely.

355
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,300
Mr. Saifah...

356
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
take my picture.

357
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,500
Not like this.

358
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,500
Can you take my picture?

359
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,800
Not bad.

360
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,400
Mr. Saifah.

361
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,800
Yes, Sir.

362
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,500
Can you take a picture of Zon, please?

363
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,800
Really cute.

364
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,000
One, two, three.

365
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,100
Awesome, Zon, that's all you can do?

366
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,400
One, two, three.

367
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,600
Yeah.

368
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,600
Okay, I've got my picture.

369
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,400
It's your turn.

370
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,200
What?

371
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
You already took mine,

372
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,200
now it's your turn.

373
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,800
Here... right here.

374
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,700
Hold the guitar.

375
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,100
Okay, I'll do it.

376
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,600
One, two, three.

377
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,800
Smile a little more.

378
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,200
One, two, three.

379
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,200
Okay.

380
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,000
I think...

381
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,900
Taking selfies is lonely.

382
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,000
Let's do it together.

383
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,000
Take a photo together...

384
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,500
One, two, three.

385
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,400
One more time.

386
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,900
One, two, three.

387
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,200
Why am I so handsome?

388
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,400
One, two, three.

389
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,800
One, two, three.

390
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,800
Get closer.

391
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,200
Yeah, you're handsome.

392
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,300
Take the photo already.

393
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,400
So we can enjoy the night.

394
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,200
Are we going to start playing the guitar, Mr. Zon?

395
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,600
We can play it here.

396
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,400
Good.

397
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,400
Today, you can play the guitar

398
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,300
and I'll have the music notes open for you.

399
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
Are you going to sing?

400
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,400
Okay, Mr. Zon.

00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,900
♫ Just thinking about it, my heart throbs ♫

416
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,500
Hey, Zon!

417
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,600
Fight, come here.

418
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,800
I have something to tell you.

419
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,200
What do you need to tell me?

420
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,400
Why? Can't you speak more respectfully to me?

421
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,800
Yes.

422
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,600
As long as you don't try to control me,

423
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,400
then I'll speak nicely to you.

424
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,800
What now, Pa?

425
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,700
I don't know what you're thinking.

426
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,070
Hwahwa's Mom told me

427
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:17,300
she's been crying and you are ignoring her.

428
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,000
Who are you with? You need to introduce your new girl to me.

429
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,700
I'm not with anyone.

430
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,800
- But...
- Stop!

431
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,400
Tomorrow, you will ask Hwahwa for her forgiveness.

432
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,800
Do you understand?

433
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,400
What you did makes me look bad.

434
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,000
You know I'm dating Hwahwa's mom,

435
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,800
and our business deal is almost sealed.

436
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,800
- What's that got to do with me?
- Yes, it does.

437
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,000
You have to do it for me.

438
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,600
Hwahwa hasn't done anything wrong.

439
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,700
You need to focus and start to think.

440
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,200
Start thinking of your future.

441
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,400
I need to see that you and Hwahwa are getting along.

442
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,700
You just need to be nice to her if she starts being demanding.

443
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,400
I believe she will listen to you because she loves you.

444
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,400
- But I—
- No excuses!

445
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,000
No more talking about this matter.

446
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,200
This is an order, just do it!

447
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,400
Hwahwa.

448
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,200
Fight.

449
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,500
You asked to meet up. Is everything okay?

450
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,800
I need to talk to you.

451
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,300
This thing between us...

452
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,320
Fight, if you are going to stop seeing me...

453
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,700
I won't let you.

454
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,300
Calm down, Hwahwa.

455
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,800
Why do I need to calm down?

456
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,600
If you are going to be this way...

457
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,400
I will have to tell my mom.

458
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,100
And I will tell your father, too.

459
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,000
Every time we have a problem,

460
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
why do you have to bring my father into it?

461
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,500
It's between us.

462
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
Just between us?!

463
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,200
Are you sure it's just the two of us?

464
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,400
Why did you do that? You've been taking care of me.

465
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,600
You told everyone that we were seeing each other.

466
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,600
Fight, do you know?

467
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,400
I never once felt I was the only one for you.

468
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:57,100
You still want to say that it's just between the two of us?

469
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,000
Answer me!

470
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,200
Are my feelings not important?!

471
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,800
I do have feelings for you!

472
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,700
But you are not the one for me.

473
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,600
I'm sorry, Hwahwa.

474
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,200
Please leave, Fight.

475
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,700
Leave now!

476
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,900
I told you to leave!

477
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:10,389
You look like you ran away from home with your husband.

478
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,659
Whose husband?

479
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,600
I think it's a soon-to-be husband, they haven't had sex yet.

480
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,700
Or did they?

481
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,400
I think they already did.

482
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,600
Maybe your dad.

483
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,400
Why are you getting into my business?

484
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,900
Why don't you just do what you need to do?

485
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,700
That's right... we need to make a banner for the concert.

486
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,800
Let's go, Natee.

487
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,500
Tee? It's Tan!

488
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,000
I meant you tell him for me.

489
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,200
Let's hurry or else your brother will be upset.

490
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,600
Yeah, the last person is in trouble.

491
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,100
Hurry the fuck up!

492
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,400
If there's nothing else,

493
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,800
I'll get going. See you.

494
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,100
I'll be leaving.

495
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,400
Leaving where? Come with me first.

496
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,400
What the heck?

497
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,200
Day...

498
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,200
I think Fight is going to break up with me.

499
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,700
He said that I am not the one for him.

500
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,800
I don't understand what he means.

501
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,600
I think you should be strong.

502
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,200
Once you get over it,

503
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,000
it will make you stronger.

504
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,100
No! I don't get it.

505
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,000
I don't know what to do, I don't accept this.

506
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,400
What do I do with all my feelings?

507
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,800
I don't know exactly what to do. I'm feeling lost.

508
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,000
You know...

509
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,200
perhaps Fight had been trying to tell me all this time.

510
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,600
Maybe it's because I keep on holding him back...

511
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,100
hoping for us to return to be what we were before.

512
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,800
But why would he bring this up all of a sudden?

513
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,200
Oh... Maybe I am too demanding?

514
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,000
I think I know, I will talk to him again.

515
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,700
Hwahwa, calm down.

516
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,200
Why do I need to calm down, Day?

517
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,600
If I clear things up with him,

518
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,600
he might understand.

519
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,600
Then he might ask me to be his girlfriend.

520
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,600
Is it so hard for men to ask a girl to be their girlfriend?

521
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,100
Hwa...

522
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,600
Will you be my girlfriend?

523
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,300
So, are you okay with it?

524
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,800
Are you okay?

525
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,400
I'm okay.

526
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,900
The way you look at my friend...

527
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,900
You like him?

528
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,100
I like him more than I like you.

529
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,200
Who's bag is it?

530
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,400
It's my bag.

531
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,800
Why did you bring it?

532
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,600
I already told you.

533
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,100
From now on, every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday,

534
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:47,500
I'll be spending the night at your place.

535
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,200
I thought you were joking.

536
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,000
Are you for real?

537
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,500
Why would I be joking?

538
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,200
Or can't I sleep here?

539
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,500
No.

540
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,800
Yes, you can sleep here.

541
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,100
Let's start practicing.

542
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,400
Spending the night at my place,

543
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:19,400
aren't you afraid of falling in love with me, like in the novel?

544
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,800
Zon.

545
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,400
Hurry up, let's practice playing the guitar.

546
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,400
Okay.

547
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,000
Starting.

548
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,900
You look stressed.

549
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:43,200
It is a hard subject...

550
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,600
Let's do it this way,

551
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,500
you go ahead with your studies.

552
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,500
For today, I want to study the Hydro subject.

553
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,500
I have a quiz tomorrow.

554
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,300
You can read and I'll study.

555
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:01,000
But aren't you too stressed with it?

556
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:04,659
The subject quiz score is just a small percentage.

557
00:50:04,659 --> 00:50:07,030
It's a small percentage but it still matters.

558
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:11,210
I'm going to read it first.

559
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,700
Fight, give my book back.

560
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:23,959
No.

561
00:50:23,959 --> 00:50:26,329
Give it back.

562
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:28,250
Nope.

563
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:36,560
Give me back my book.

564
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:39,690
I won't give it back.

565
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:32,109
I think we should stop here.

566
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:37,860
Fight.

567
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:44,490
Do you have any idea... of what you're doing?

568
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,510
I know.

569
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:51,580
I'm going with the flow.

570
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,900
I just want to tease you, Tutor.

571
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:06,579
If that's how you think, I have nothing to say.

572
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:16,679
Do you actually think, I like you, Tutor?

573
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,490
Are you still in denial?

574
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:24,750
Look at how far we've come.

575
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,949
Or do you disagree?

576
00:52:27,949 --> 00:52:31,800
If you think I actually like you,

577
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,390
then prove it, Tutor.

578
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:40,250
Prove it to me, show me how I feel.

579
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,590
Do you dare?

580
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:00,890
Tutor!

581
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:19,540
You like men, right?

582
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:30,380
I think we should stop.

583
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:56,780
Don't forget to ask yourself

584
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,710
about how you feel about me.

585
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:18,830
Who says I want to kiss you?!

586
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,590
[Next Episode]
I won't. I won't.

587
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:20,700
- I won't
- You won't?

588
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,530
Get up!

589
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:25,900
But if you have to work abroad,

590
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,210
you should have already known for a long time. Right?

591
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:29,600
Why are you just telling me now?

592
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,470
Fight!

593
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,700
If we look into each other's eyes, the first person to look away,

594
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:42,260
is the one who has feelings for the other person.

595
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:46,060
One. Two. Three.
