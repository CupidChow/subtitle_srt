1
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,029
Tong.

2
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,469
What's up, little puppy?

3
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,309
Hey! You're a big boy but still cringing, huh?

4
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:26,489
Let me help you bring this in.

5
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,550
- The luggage, too.
- Sure.

6
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,910
Let's come inside, I'll follow you.

7
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,619
My room is a bit messy. I was just finishing tutoring.

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,340
Well, let's sit and talk, Tutor.

9
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,759
How are you doing?

10
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,899
I'm doing fine.

11
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,099
You're coming to Bangkok. Why didn't you let me know first?

12
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,520
Or… did you get a full-time job?

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,019
Well... I did.

14
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,799
It's a full-time job with a high salary.

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,499
There're travel expenses, OT, and many good benefits

16
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,479
That's good.

17
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,079
I don't want you to work as a freelancer.

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,080
Because when you were working as a freelancer, you worked hard and it made you sick.

19
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:30,239
This means that if you have to work in Bangkok, then you can stay with me. Right?

20
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,500
Are you not working in Bangkok?

21
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,709
I'm not.

22
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:59,530
Well, the headquarters... is in... Germany.

23
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,229
Well, but I can go back and forth, Tor.

24
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:08,909
It's like a company visit and traveling. It will be fun.

25
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,330
It should be okay.

26
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,590
But if you have to work abroad,

27
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,049
you should have already known for a long time. Right?

28
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,350
Why are you just telling me now?

29
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:36,049
Actually, I have done interviews, applying for visas, and work permits for a while.

30
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:41,090
But the reason I decided to tell you today,

31
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:45,330
is because I'll fly in two days.

32
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,529
Hey!! Look at you face.

33
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,329
It's good that I got this job.

34
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:02,529
If I had told you first, then you would be mad and wouldn't let me go.

35
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,289
And I have to drop my guard anyway.

36
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,629
And about Mom, you don't have to be worried.

37
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:12,469
I have thought about it thoroughly that accepting this job was good for everyone.

38
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,990
So no need to be worried.

39
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,169
I got a job I love, which used to be my dream job.

40
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,730
Aren't you really happy for me?

41
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,229
- Tongta.
- What?

42
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,629
I'm glad for you.

43
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,870
And very much so.

44
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,290
I knew that you would understand me.

45
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,949
Look! Now you have no one to be clinging to, huh?

46
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,410
Indeed.

47
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,329
Now you understand me.

48
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,670
Yep.

49
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:19,249
Then I'll go take a shower. I am so exhausted from the trip.

50
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,889
Sure.

51
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,749
But tomorrow let's sit down and talk about your issues, Tutor.

52
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,450
I can see that there's something on your mind.

53
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,840
Sure.

54
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,789
- I'll take a shower then.
- Sure.

Songbook.

68
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,789
Let's take a look.

69
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,530
What do we have here?

70
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:08,310
My first kiss and the change of feelings.

71
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,830
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Hey!

72
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,589
Let's practice.

73
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,150
First chord.

74
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,010
C major 7.

75
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,589
- C major 7.
- Okay.

76
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:48,190
Do it like this.

77
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,450
- Middle finger.
- Middle finger.

78
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,449
Line 4.

79
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,329
Second fret, Middle finger.

80
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,329
Line 5. Line 3.

81
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,710
Well, I like reading this kind of book.

82
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,290
There's nothing about it.

83
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,730
Yeah, I know.

84
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,020
Hold the guitar like this.

85
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,110
Does this work?

86
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,870
Next is D chord.

87
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,070
Like this?

88
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,169
Nope.

89
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,709
It has to be like this.

90
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,150
What about this?

91
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,349
Shit!

92
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,189
Will you stop it or not, Zon?

93
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,409
What? This!

94
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:40,390
Sound like this.

95
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,900
Zon!! No more practice.

96
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,909
I'll play the guitar, you sing.

97
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:47,349
- You sure?
- I am.

98
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:48,690
Sure.

99
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,690
- Let's sing.
- Okay.

100
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,529
- Start with Chorus.
- What song are we gonna sing?

101
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,450
"Why R U?"

102
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,929
That's right, "Why R U?"

103
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,730
Come. Start with the chorus.

104
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,770
Three, two, one.

105
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:19,510
♪ Why do I have to love this person? I don't know either ♪

106
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:31,470
♪ I've never met someone who makes me crazy like you ♪

107
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:37,029
♪ Why do I have to love this person? I want to know as well ♪

108
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:41,409
♪ How can my heart suddenly have you in it? ♪

109
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,350
I forgot the lyrics.

110
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,969
Were you a diver?

111
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,010
I'm a lover.

112
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,780
Will you stop it or not?

113
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,509
What?

114
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,490
Are we going to make up after all?

115
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,950
This!

116
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,849
We are... We're cool.

117
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,609
Now you have become confident.

118
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,010
You rejected it at first.

119
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,609
I have to be confident.

120
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,929
If I'm not, how could it turn out well?

121
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,129
Then should we write a new song and sing it?

122
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,629
No need to do a cover.

123
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,889
- You're in?
- I'm in.

124
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,649
You've been obedient lately.

125
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,189
Be like this more often.

126
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,030
I like it.

127
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,110
I like it, too.

128
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,889
Well, I'm...

129
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:30,110
I didn't mean that I like you.

130
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,629
Do you have a mood disorder?

131
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,530
Bipolar?

132
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,590
I'm not.

133
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,370
Stop acting like a female lead in a Korean novel.

134
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,989
You should go to sleep.

135
00:10:57,989 --> 00:11:00,069
Who's a female lead in the novel!

136
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,689
I'm going to sleep.

137
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,349
You're playing?

138
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,680
What are you doing, Zon?

139
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,610
Enough!

140
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,830
Hey! Stop, Zon!

141
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,389
What are you doing Zon? Stop!

142
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,329
- There you go!
- No!

143
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,689
- A lover?
- No!

144
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,990
I'm not a lover.

145
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,130
You! It's you!

146
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,910
I'm going to sleep!

147
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,530
Put it back.

148
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,230
You teased me and still asked me to put it back!

149
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,429
- What?
- Huh?
- I'm not moving.

150
00:11:58,429 --> 00:11:59,649
What are you doing? I'm not moving.

151
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:01,570
I'm not moving.

152
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,790
What are you doing?

153
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,130
That's all.

154
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,530
Good night.

155
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,780
What's wrong with you? You're all curled up.

156
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,430
Hand me a blanket, please.

157
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,710
Last night you took my blanket away.

158
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,330
I'm sorry.

159
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,650
Next time you can wake me up. No need to be considerate.

160
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,310
Well, I dreamed about you last night.

161
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,150
About me?

162
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,050
What was it about?

163
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,850
I forgot.

164
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:34,310
Then I'll go brush my teeth.

165
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,070
Sure.

166
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,070
Aren't you acting strange today?

167
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,970
Normally, you have to be the first one to go brush your teeth, right?

168
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,510
I'm sleepy today.

169
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,210
You go first.

170
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,950
Let me sleep more.

171
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,830
Hey, you can't.

172
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,970
Let's brush your teeth first and get ready.

173
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,330
Or else you'll keep sleeping. I don't want to wake you up twice.

174
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,330
Umm, you go first.

175
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,170
Go take a shower.

176
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,890
I said, get up! Let's go!

177
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:06,629
No. You go take a shower.

178
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:07,950
Get up!!

179
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,969
You go first.

180
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,850
Go! I'll go after you.

181
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,730
Are you going to do it or not?

182
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:16,049
- I won't.
- You won't?

183
00:15:17,009 --> 00:15:18,330
Get up!

184
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,690
Well...

185
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,310
I'll go first.

186
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,430
You, Sai! Ouch!

187
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,170
You, baby Saifah!

188
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,450
What the heck! Why are you working right now!?

189
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,270
Meow.

190
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,360
What's wrong with him?

191
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,830
Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.

192
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,630
Hey, Tai!

193
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:45,730
I can see why you like sitting here alone quite often.

194
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:49,790
You were waiting to feed the cats, right?

195
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,790
And what's wrong with that?

196
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,730
Oh, this is not embarrassing at all.

197
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:00,990
In fact, being an animal lover is quite cute though.

198
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,530
Right? Right?

199
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,730
Don't bug me!

200
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:10,550
Why? You have a problem?

201
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,430
What's wrong with you?

202
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:20,170
But I have never thought that you would be like this.

203
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,590
But don't be afraid.

204
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,450
I'm not telling anyone.

205
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,250
If you want to tell.

206
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,990
You can do it.

207
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,729
Everybody loves animals.

208
00:17:30,729 --> 00:17:32,229
It's not strange.

209
00:17:32,229 --> 00:17:35,329
Well... You are an animal lover.

210
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:37,950
Have you ever thought about loving a kid?

211
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,230
What are you talking about? I'm leaving.

212
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:47,570
Take me (noo = rat) with you, huh?

213
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,850
What kind of rat is this big?

214
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:53,070
- Okay. Go, go.
- You like cats but why can't you like rats, too?

215
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,130
You're so cringy.

216
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,529
- Come.
- I'll come with you.

217
00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:57,029
Go. Go.

218
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:59,270
You're so heavy.

219
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,030
Are you okay?

220
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,630
I'm leaving then.

221
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:21,530
Hey! Don't you have anything to say to me?

222
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:27,070
Well... Well, I don't know what to say.

223
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,050
That scene is still coming up in my mind.

224
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,470
I have never done it before.

225
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,069
What?

226
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:36,889
Never?

227
00:18:36,889 --> 00:18:39,450
Yes, never.

228
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:48,830
Then you have to sleep with me more often.

229
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,930
So you can get used to it.

230
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,210
Get used to what!? It's time for class!

231
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,090
Wait.

232
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,450
Look!

233
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,069
You like being innocent.

234
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,090
I believe...

235
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:06,450
that novel writers have an excellent imagination.

236
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,450
Today, we'll be busking.

237
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,710
Just chilling.

238
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,230
What?

239
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:17,190
When did you know about this? Why did you just tell me now?

240
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,529
- Last night.
- Last night?

241
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:21,409
Woah! Can I not go?

242
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:24,130
I'm... I'm... I'm not confident.

243
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,750
Hey! I'm out. I don't want to go.

244
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,570
You can do it.

245
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,350
You got me.

246
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,589
No.

247
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:33,029
- I have a class.
- No!

248
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:34,010
- See you in the evening.
- No!

249
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:37,349
- Bye-bye.
- Hey!!

250
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,810
How can I do it?

251
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:58,520
Tai, are your friends still coming?

252
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,970
It's late.

253
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,229
Bring it on!

254
00:20:04,229 --> 00:20:05,550
Meow.

255
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:09,290
Hey! You always keep teasing me like this!

256
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,269
- Why?
- Enough.

257
00:20:10,269 --> 00:20:11,849
I can't tease you anymore?

258
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:13,850
You can.

259
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,089
- You can.
- They'll be here.

260
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:19,269
Are they going to survive this?

261
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:21,990
Hellooooooooo. Helloooooo.

262
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,910
- Hellooooooooo. Helloooooo.
- What are you guys doing?

263
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,670
- Hey! What's up, Bro?
- What's up, man?

264
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:30,719
- Are you gay?
- Howdy?

265
00:20:30,719 --> 00:20:32,369
No more playing.

266
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:34,589
Hey! Yo!

267
00:20:34,589 --> 00:20:36,889
Hey! Be confident!

268
00:20:36,889 --> 00:20:38,009
Are you gay?

269
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:41,409
Hey! Right?

270
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:42,550
Hey!

271
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,330
Put it down.

272
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,449
Let's manage everything. It's really late.

273
00:20:46,449 --> 00:20:48,459
You two, get yourself ready.

274
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:49,789
Set the chord and you can start playing.

275
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:51,650
Too late.

276
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,309
- Hey!
- Let's go!

277
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,110
- Let's get to work.
- Dealt.

278
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,489
It's dirty here.

279
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,830
- Go, Tai.
- Hey, Tai.

280
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,230
Thank you very much for bringing your friends to help us.

281
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,960
It's fine.

282
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:15,010
I can give you more than this.

283
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,970
Thanks a lot.

284
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,530
That's enough.

285
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,690
Are you okay?

286
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,330
Well… I'm nervous.

287
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,790
I have never sung a song in front of this many people before.

288
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:52,170
This is my first time.

289
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,169
We should leave then. You don't have to do it.

290
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:02,790
Wait up!

291
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,750
Let's give it a try.

292
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:13,160
I saw our friends put a lot of effort into this.

293
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,550
I don't want to drag them down.

294
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,289
They worked hard.

295
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:20,310
Let's give it a shot!

296
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,220
You sure you can do it?

297
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,870
I'm sure. But...

298
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,869
I'm so nervous.

299
00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:47,189
My hands are freaking cold.

300
00:22:47,189 --> 00:22:49,350
Touch them, if you don't believe me.

301
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,069
What's wrong with you?

302
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:57,310
They're really cold indeed.

303
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,709
Did you have to act this big?

304
00:22:59,709 --> 00:23:01,850
I don't want you to be stressed out

305
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,470
Your hand, please.

306
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,110
How is it?

307
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,450
Good.

308
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,469
Well, what about this?

309
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,830
Better?

310
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:52,130
Better.

311
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,150
The other one, please.

312
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:10,930
Are you okay?

313
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,630
I mean…

314
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:25,180
Are you okay having me beside you?

315
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,010
I'm okay.

316
00:24:38,089 --> 00:24:40,390
This is a university, not a hotel.

317
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,070
Will you do it?

318
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,249
Well, I'll...

319
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:47,330
Will you play music? Hurry up.

320
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:56,189
Come on, buddy.

321
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,330
You!

322
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,649
Sorry.

323
00:25:05,649 --> 00:25:07,730
Please sit.

324
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:35,710
♫ We used to walk past each other ♫

325
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:40,730
♫ We knew each other, but treated each other like strangers ♫

326
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:44,190
♫ I didn't like you at all ♫

327
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:49,170
♫ I couldn't even imagine being close to you ♫

328
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:55,710
♫ Thinking about it again ♫

329
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,810
♫ It was like there was a magic spell cast upon us ♫

330
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:05,000
♫ and we got closer ♫

331

♫ I never thought that I could ever love you ♫

332
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,410
Hey! You have a beautiful voice.

333
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:22,890
♫ Just thinking about it, my heart throbs ♫

334
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,669
I mean it. You do have a beautiful voice.

335
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:31,119
No need to sing it alone quietly.

336
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,800
Even if it's not that quiet.

337
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,930
Let's do your best when you're performing.

338
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:42,810
You can do it.

339
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:50,230
♫ The more I think, the more my head aches
The more I think, the scarier it is ♫

340
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:56,290
♫ Or did I already love you from the beginning? ♫

341
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,550
Well done.

342
00:28:00,316 --> 00:28:01,916
Tutor.

343
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,600
Surprise!

344
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,319
Miss the old times, Tong?

345
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,679
Yeah.

346
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,220
Then...

347
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,139
Did you forget something?

348
00:28:19,139 --> 00:28:20,970
This.

349
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:27,040
You haven't opened it yet.

350
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,580
Put it up first.

351
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,797
Then, we can start eating now, Tong.

352
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,567
Not yet.

353
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:43,289
Wait, we don't have everything ready yet.

354
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:44,819
How could you forget it, Tutor?

355
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:46,809
Pork dipped in egg.

356
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:49,899
Your pork dipped in an egg is the best!

357
00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:53,639
- Of course.
- Okay, I'll make you a dipping sauce.

358
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,249
Is everything the same, Tutor?

359
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,399
Yes, it's the same.

360
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:02,530
My recipe is delicious, it's the best!

361
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,250
Looks yummy.

362
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:14,179
The dipping sauce is ready.

363
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:16,050
It's good.

364
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,760
Thinking about it, I miss the old times.

365
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,570
Same taste?

366
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,139
Yes, delicious as always.

367
00:29:32,139 --> 00:29:34,159
I remember you love to eat shrimp.

368
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,629
- That's right.
- Isn't that right?

369
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,160
"A little".

370
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,079
Looks yummy.

371
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,030
It's not hot anymore, I'm starving.

372
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,190
We can eat now.

373
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,060
- Here, Tutor.
- Thank you.

374
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,780
Eat slowly.

375
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,819
It's delicious, I haven't had it in a while.

376
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:11,979
Especially, this pork dipped in egg.

377
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:13,450
You can have a lot more since you like it.

378
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,280
Wait, wait, wait.

379
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,810
Cheers!

380
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:20,060
One, two, three.

381
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,210
I'm so full, Tong.

382
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:29,470
I haven't eaten like this in a long time, Tong.

383
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,279
- Should I have some more?
- Wait.

384
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,240
I'm full.

385
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,509
I have something for you. I'll be right back.

386
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,560
Here.

387
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,640
What is it, Tong?

388
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,930
It's a reminder gift.

389
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,080
Tong, why would you say that?

390
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:11,390
I don't want to get emotional.

391
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:16,459
No sadness. I just want to give it to you.

392
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:19,420
It can be a reminder of the person you are.

393
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:25,860
But why a cactus?

394
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,850
Have you heard?

395
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:34,800
True love is like a cactus.

396
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,819
I heard... love is like a plant.

397
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:48,839
You need to nurture it, water it, for it to grow.

398
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,359
Yeah.

399
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,390
But this is a cactus.

400
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:56,879
All trees need water.

401
00:31:56,879 --> 00:32:02,259
Even a cactus. It might look strong,

402
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:07,119
but deep down, it still needs water.

403
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:10,059
It has to act strong.

404
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:13,020
Nevertheless,

405
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,560
just a drop of water...

406
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,730
can help the heart to be happy and complacent.

407
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:29,769
Do as you wish.

408
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:33,200
You don't need to pretend to be strong all the time.

409
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,530
Then this cactus will grow strong and beautiful.

410
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:44,660
Please water it for me, Tutor.

411
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,280
Thank you, Teacher.

412
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:53,520
Teacher.

413
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,100
I already cooked, you clean up.

414
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,349
Tong, we need to help each other clean up.

415
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,560
Clean up, student Tutor.

416
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:18,959
I just realized you do need water as well.

417
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:27,979
Have you eaten it before?

418
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,079
No, not yet. Do you want to go eat together?

419
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:32,499
- It's so good.
- Really?

420
00:33:32,499 --> 00:33:33,760
Tutor!

421
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,150
Hwahwa.

422
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,950
Day.

423
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,559
How is Tong?

424
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,889
I missed her. When is she leaving?

425
00:33:50,889 --> 00:33:53,190
Tomorrow, I think.

426
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,289
Too bad, I want to send her off but I'm busy.

427
00:33:58,289 --> 00:34:02,810
Then... please tell her I'll miss her.

428
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:10,460
Hwahwa, are you doing okay?

429
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,890
Okay.

430
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,539
I'm really okay.

431
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:18,400
Why?

432
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:26,889
At this moment... Okay.

433
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:30,620
Do the two of you have some sort of secret?

434
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,280
- Nooo!
- Nothing.

435
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,260
Nothing...

436
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,680
Hey, Tutor. You have a class, right?

437
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,329
- Hurry up, you're going to be late.
- Are you telling me to leave?

438
00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:49,759
No, I worry you might be late for class. Go, go, go!

439
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,899
- Bye-bye, Tutor.
- Bye-bye.

440
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,330
- See you, Tutor.
- See ya.

441
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,450
Too bad, Tutor doesn't know.

442
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,439
I didn't look suspicious, right?

443
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,099
Are you sure?

444
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,859
Day, where is your class?

445
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:08,340
- I'll drop you off.
- I'll drop you off.

446
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,449
We think the same.

447
00:35:10,449 --> 00:35:13,080
- Let's go.
- Let's go to class.

448
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,000
I'll walk you to your class.

449
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,779
[Fighter: Why aren't you answering my call. Are we still tutoring at your place?]

450
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:29,360
[Fighter: Do you still think about the other day? I also want to talk to you, too.]

451
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:37,390
Don't forget to ask yourself.

452
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,200
How do you feel about me?

453
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:55,840
[Fighter: Are you okay with it?
Fighter: I'll come to see you.]

454
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:00,649
What's wrong with you?

455
00:36:00,649 --> 00:36:02,509
What are you thinking.?

456
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:04,370
Tong.

457
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,749
Tong, why are you coming downstairs?

458
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:13,949
I want to see to you.

459
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,070
My flight is tomorrow.

460
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:19,560
I was waiting for you, but you didn't come up.

461
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,550
Tong.

462
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,870
Are you worrying about something?

463
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,970
I'm not, Tong.

464
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:37,280
I'm thinking too much.

465
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,130
Still saying "no"?

466
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,800
Did you not understand what we talked about yesterday?

467
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,560
I'm your sister, we've been together all our lives.

468
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,530
I can tell what you're thinking.

469
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:58,130
Do you have anything you want to tell me?

470
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,050
You can tell me.

471
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:10,019
All right, as your older sister, I'll use my right.

472
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:14,489
Then... let's play an open-mind game.

473
00:37:14,489 --> 00:37:16,460
I'll start first.

474
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:25,710
I'm going to be honest and tell you.

475
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:31,850
Tutor, do you know when I went to apply for the job abroad...

476
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,630
I wasn't confident at all.

477
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:42,700
I was... nervous and scared.

478
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,450
Even though I'm leaving tomorrow, I'm still worried.

479
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,100
Tutor, do you know what helps me get through it?

480
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,809
Hardship.

481
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:02,160
I don't want to see our family facing any more hardship, Tutor.

482
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,270
I'll be the one to get rid of our debts.

483
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:11,089
And then... take care of your tuition, too.

484
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:17,100
One more important thing, Tutor.

485
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:25,050
I want you to stop worrying about money, Tutor.

486
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:28,200
I promise I'll send everything to you.

487
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,810
Why are you crying? You're a grown man.

488
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,970
I'm not crying.

489
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,860
You're crying.

490
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,390
I already said everything.

491
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,539
It's your turn, Tutor.

492
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:54,800
You are not allowed to say, "It's nothing."

493
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,470
Tong...

494
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:13,020
What if... we kiss someone...

495
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,950
and we have feelings for that person.

496
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:21,770
Do we need another reason for it?

497
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,490
Kiss.

498
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:30,400
You don't need a reason to kiss someone, Tutor.

499
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,049
But you want my help to find any reasons.

500
00:39:35,049 --> 00:39:38,130
There are only a few reasons to kiss someone.

501
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,940
It could be... teasing.

502
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,490
Want...

503
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:48,090
Desire...

504
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,699
It feels good.

505
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:53,780
Or it could be... love.

506
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,429
If you are not serious about it,

507
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:07,030
a kiss is just a kiss.

508
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:14,369
But if you keep thinking about it all the time,

509
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:16,979
then it's special.

510
00:40:16,979 --> 00:40:19,939
It's a matter of good feelings.

511
00:40:19,939 --> 00:40:22,049
It can develop...

512
00:40:22,049 --> 00:40:24,549
or turn into love.

513
00:40:24,549 --> 00:40:27,680
What if you kiss someone of the same gender?

514
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,410
Tutor,

515
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,610
first of all,

516
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,830
you need to step away from what society thinks is a norm.

517
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:54,129
It doesn't matter about gender, age, or status.

518
00:40:54,129 --> 00:40:58,119
Or whatever that keeps your heart close.

519
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:00,089
Leave it, throw it away.

520
00:41:00,089 --> 00:41:03,090
Love is love.

521
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:04,959
Gender is not a factor.

522
00:41:04,959 --> 00:41:07,560
Neither is status.

523
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,530
It's all about what you feel.

524
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,379
Well, then have him send me off tomorrow.

525
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:23,709
Tong.

526
00:41:23,709 --> 00:41:26,859
Well, you have to take me to the airport tomorrow anyway.

527
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,859
Have him meet us.

528
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:30,730
I want to meet him.

529
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:36,229
Okay.

530
00:41:36,229 --> 00:41:38,829
- I'll send him a message.
- It's okay, I'll message him myself.

531
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,809
- It's okay.
- You don't know him.

532
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,929
[Tutor: How about this? Are you available tomorrow?]

533
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:48,350
[Tutor: I have something to talk to you about too.]

534
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,339
Zen, come sit here. Hurry up!

535
00:41:56,339 --> 00:41:58,520
What the heck is wrong with you?

536
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,599
Are you meeting someone?

537
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,269
You know this person.

538
00:42:05,269 --> 00:42:07,159
You'll see once they get here.

539
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,030
Nong Zol.

540
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:11,430
How did you know?

541
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:16,879
It's okay, I said "Hi" on Facebook and she happens to admire you.

542
00:42:16,879 --> 00:42:18,919
She has some work for us,

543
00:42:18,919 --> 00:42:21,289
so I invited her here. That's it.

544
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:23,039
Then, does Zon know

545
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:24,669
that you are courting her?

546
00:42:24,669 --> 00:42:26,319
Please don't tell him.

547
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:30,369
He will kill me if he knows. Okay?

548
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:32,480
Zen and Tee, hello.

549
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,530
Have you ordered anything yet?

550
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:37,149
No, I have not.

551
00:42:37,149 --> 00:42:40,779
You can order anything you want, I'll pay.

552
00:42:40,779 --> 00:42:43,260
Tee, are you sick?

553
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,569
This is my normal voice.

554
00:42:47,569 --> 00:42:51,410
If you don't like it, I can change it back to my old voice.

555
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,040
Okay?

556
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,739
You said you need our help, for what?

557
00:43:00,739 --> 00:43:05,040
Wait, don't rush her! Let her order food first.

558
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,349
That's okay, Tee. I can tell you now.

559
00:43:07,349 --> 00:43:11,749
My faculty wants us to take a survey about social media.

560
00:43:11,749 --> 00:43:15,949
I don't know who else to ask, and then you sent me a message.

561
00:43:15,949 --> 00:43:18,879
Can I trouble Zen and Tee to help me?

562
00:43:18,879 --> 00:43:22,640
Of course, I agree.

563
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,809
Yes, yes, right.

564
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,089
- Okay.
- Yes, yes.

565
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:29,290
Okay...

566
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:31,319
- Okay.
- Okay.

567
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,719
What do I need to do?

568
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:37,999
Not much, I will just follow the two of you to take pictures.

569
00:43:37,999 --> 00:43:41,200
Kind of like a tie-in project,

570
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,150
emphasizing Boys' Love.

571
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:45,649
Zen and Tee, are okay with it?

572
00:43:45,649 --> 00:43:48,420
- Okay, I agree.
- Well...

573
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:51,639
- You agree, right?
- Err, yes, yes.

574
00:43:51,639 --> 00:43:55,720
- Err, I agree.
- It's too easy.

575
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,570
Help her, she is the sister of the person you are in love with.

576
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:06,129
- Thank you for your help.
- Okay.

577
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:07,559
Then, can we start now?

578
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,790
Yes, we can.

579
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,929
I think this is your best look.

580
00:44:19,929 --> 00:44:21,589
I'll take a picture now.

581
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:24,430
Okay. One, two, three.

582
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:33,899
Hello.

583
00:44:33,899 --> 00:44:39,689
Today, we have to a cafe. A very popular one.

584
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:45,309
If you haven't eaten here yet, it means you haven't been here yet.

585
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:52,560
Today, I'm not here alone. I'm here with one of my best friends. That's Zen.

586
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,250
Yes, Sir.

587
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:58,149
As we have said, this cafe has many delicious foods.

588
00:44:58,149 --> 00:45:01,019
Especially, cold cocoa drinks.

589
00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:04,329
- Looks delicious.
- Yes.

590
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,890
My mouth is watering.

591
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:10,120
Let's taste it.

592
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:18,309
Our nose is touching.

593
00:45:18,309 --> 00:45:21,019
It's a moment.

594
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:22,740
One more time.

595
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,599
Our nose is touching again.

596
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:30,400
Too bad, another moment.

597
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:36,610
Next, we will try the chocolate cake.

598
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,049
Oops, it's on my nose.

599
00:45:43,049 --> 00:45:46,199
I spilled it, too bad.

600
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,690
Wipe it clean.

601
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,510
A moment again.

602
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:58,490
One more bite, please.

603
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,849
I spill it again.

604
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:06,940
It's too bad.

605
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:10,109
Is it sweet, Sir?

606
00:46:10,109 --> 00:46:12,559
- Yes, it is sweet.
- Moment.

607
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:19,750
That is all for today. We'll have to say goodbye. Goodbye.

608
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,840
Be careful.

609
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,470
Where is your boyfriend?

610
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:54,409
I don't have a boyfriend, Tong.

611
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,200
Do you mean Fight?

612
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,500
Fight might be inside already.

613
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:10,530
- Are you shy?
- I'm not shy.

614
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,760
Fight.

615
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,569
Hello, Tong.

616
00:47:26,569 --> 00:47:27,729
Hi.

617
00:47:27,729 --> 00:47:29,069
You're Fighter, right?

618
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:30,540
Yes.

619
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:43,069
Tong, I need to go to the restroom.

620
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:44,479
Didn't you just go?

621
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,100
I have a stomachache. I'll be right back.

622
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,360
I'll be back in a minute.

623
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,199
I'll help, Tong.

624
00:47:56,199 --> 00:47:57,189
Okay.

625
00:47:57,189 --> 00:47:59,870
We can take it there.

626
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:19,920
Fight.

627
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:22,760
Yes, Tong.

628
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,700
Thank you for sending me off today.

629
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:29,629
That's okay, Tong. I don't mind at all.

630
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,999
I can tell you are willing to.

631
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:38,450
Yes.

632
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:41,140
You don't need to be tense.

633
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,480
I already know about you and Tutor.

634
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,750
Tutor... What did he tell you?

635
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:56,759
Well... that the two of you have an unclear relationship right now.

636
00:48:56,759 --> 00:48:59,309
But Tutor didn't tell me everything.

637
00:48:59,309 --> 00:49:01,450
I can guess it.

638
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,000
Fight.

639
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:10,790
Can I ask you to look after Tutor for me?

640
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:16,049
My little brother might look like a strong person,

641
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:19,840
and he usually pretends that he is okay,

642
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,110
but the truth isthat he is not.

643
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:27,180
Tutor... He still needs encouragement.

644
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,799
He needs someone to lean on.

645
00:49:29,799 --> 00:49:31,849
To hold his hands.

646
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:35,260
Telling him you'll never leave him.

647
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:39,940
I, myself, have to leave.

648
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:42,780
Tutor doesn't have anyone else.

649
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,900
But he still has you.

650
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:50,949
Then I'll tell you one secret about Tutor.

651
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:52,550
Do you want to know?

652
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:56,740
Yes, I wanna know, Tong.

653
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:02,210
Tutor loves the beach. Really, a lot.

654
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:06,799
But since our family has some problems,

655
00:50:06,799 --> 00:50:10,590
I never had a chance to take him there.

656
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:15,719
Fight, if you have some free time, you should invite Tutor to the beach.

657
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,259
Maybe whatever issues...

658
00:50:18,259 --> 00:50:21,459
that's confusing you...

659
00:50:21,459 --> 00:50:23,520
they might get better.

660
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:27,159
Thank you, Tong.

661
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:29,260
I'll give it a try.

662
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,160
What are you too talking about?

663
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,990
Nothing.

664
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:45,860
Why don't you get up?

665
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,579
Get up.

666
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:50,219
I want to sit next to my sister.

667
00:50:50,219 --> 00:50:51,779
Hurry up.

668
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:56,380
Sit here, he's also my little brother.

669
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:03,460
What did you say to my sister?

670
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:08,920
Why Tong...

671
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,809
How long are you two going to stare at each other?

672
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:12,750
My flight has been announced.

673
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:14,110
Okay.

674
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:17,519
Tong.

675
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:19,110
Yes.

676
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:24,549
Don't be sad, I'm leaving abroad for work.

677
00:51:24,549 --> 00:51:26,249
I'm not going to die.

678
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,639
Tong.

679
00:51:27,639 --> 00:51:31,140
Please don't say it like that, it's a bad omen.

680
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,510
I won't say it again.

681
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:42,060
No more sad face, okay?

682
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:50,040
Fight.

683
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:54,180
Please take care of Tutor.

684
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,550
Of course.

685
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,650
I have to leave now, Tutor.

686
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:18,509
Take care of yourself, okay?

687
00:52:18,509 --> 00:52:19,910
Yes.

688
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:25,100
♫ I have heard before ♫

689
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:31,160
♫ that if we love someone ♫

690
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:41,200
♫ And if that person thinks the same, that would be happiness ♫

691
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,520
Calm down.

692
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:25,600
It's okay.

693
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:28,590
It's all right.

694
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:37,130
It's all right.

695
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:40,200
It will be better soon,

696
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:45,080
Trust me.

697
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:29,010
Let's go. Let's go home.

698
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,010
I have something to talk to you about.

699
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:05,360
Are you feeling better now?

700
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,160
I'm okay now.

701
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,659
Actually,

702
00:57:18,659 --> 00:57:20,960
now that I think about it,

703
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:26,039
Tong has been doing the right thing.

704
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:31,180
Because everything she did, she did it for our family.

705
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:37,880
Thank you, for being beside me.

706
00:57:40,610 --> 00:57:42,560
Don't worry about it.

707
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:46,310
You are getting clever.

708
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:49,300
You understood it so fast.

709
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:55,180
Fight,

710
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:58,000
I think...

711
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:05,340
it's getting late. Let's go home.

712
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:13,980
Wait a second.

713
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,560
Do you actually think..

714
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:34,330
I have feelings for you?

715
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,390
I don't really know...

716
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,630
how you feel about me.

717
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:50,369
The person who owns their feelings...

718
00:58:50,369 --> 00:58:55,210
should be the one who knows what they really feel.

719
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:58,459
I have a theory.

720
00:58:58,459 --> 00:59:03,980
It's a test of how we feel about the person in front of us.

721
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:08,430
Do you want to try it with me?

722
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,810
How do we test it?

723
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:13,819
I forgot to tell you.

724
00:59:13,819 --> 00:59:16,220
When we like someone...

725
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:19,800
we can't say no to the person we like.

726
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,840
Do you still want to try it?

727
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,889
The theory said...

728
00:59:29,889 --> 00:59:32,500
if we look into each other's eyes,

729
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:36,769
the first person who looks away within ten seconds

730
00:59:36,769 --> 00:59:40,900
is the one who has feelings for the other person.

731
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:43,600
On the other hand,

732
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,349
if we stare longer than ten seconds,

733
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:51,000
it means we don't like each other.

734
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,630
Are you ready?

735
01:00:12,404 --> 01:00:13,864
One.

736
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:17,610
Two.

737
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:20,470
Three.

738
01:00:42,076 --> 01:00:43,526
Ten.

739
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:47,640
Nine.

740
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:50,300
Eight.

741
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:53,290
Seven.

742
01:00:55,930 --> 01:00:57,320
Six.

743
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,430
Five.

744
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:03,990
Four.

745
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:09,670
Three.

746
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:32,250
♫ I can no longer stop my heart ♫

747
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:38,540
♫ Because inside my heart, it's full of love ♫

748
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:48,600
♫ I loved you from that day, but I have to hide it ♫

749
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:54,090
♫ I can no longer keep these feelings ♫

750
01:01:54,090 --> 01:02:00,460
♫ I will tell you how much I love you ♫

751
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:08,380
♫ Even though I'm afraid that it will hurt, I can't keep it hidden anymore ♫

752
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,300
Fight.

753
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:21,500
Fight, are you sure

754
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:25,000
about what you just did?

755
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:31,200
I've known my feelings for you for a long time.

756
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:38,510
Can I prove it one more time?

757
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:10,900
If you want me to prove it to you, I can.

758
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:16,050
But can I prove it somewhere else?

759
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:31,840
♫ I can no longer stop my heart ♫

760
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:38,210
♫ Because inside my heart, it's full of love ♫

761
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:41,220
♫ Because inside my heart, it's full of love ♫

762
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,470
About going to the beach, I'll manage everything.

763
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:44,900
Bye-bye.

764
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:51,790
Mom, I...

765
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:58,600
- Can I not perform anymore?
- Hold on tight.

766
01:04:05,290 --> 01:04:09,710
I only have you. You're the person I've been searching for.
