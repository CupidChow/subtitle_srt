Actually,

54
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,470
I've experienced so many challenges in my life.

55
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,370
I wrote a sci-fi novel.

56
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,950
I accepted Zol's challenge.

57

I also accepted your challenge to play music.

And the latest one,

59
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:25,390
I accepted the challenge to write a Yaoi novel.

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:35,290
But you've got so many things back from those challenges.

why don't you look at the person right next to you?

Thank you for singing our song so well.

169
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,950
The songwriter is awesome.

170
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:22,730
It will be better if the songwriter has a singer as his boyfriend.

171
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,990
You're crazy.

172
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,350
I'm so obvious. You still don't know the answer?

♫ Just thinking about it, my heart throbs ♫

192
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:23,560
♫ I wonder what makes me love you ♫

193
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,400
♫ Or was it when our eyes met, you then bewitched me? ♫

194
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,310
♫ How is it possible that you are the one? ♫

195
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,830
♫ I can't figure it out, I was standing still
then you suddenly came into my life ♫

196
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:41,000
♫ How many reasons are there that make
people love each other? ♫

197
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,610
♫ The more I think, the more my head aches
The more I think, the scarier it is ♫

198
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:52,030
♫ Or did I already love you from the beginning? ♫

199
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,010
What are you doing?

200
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,510
I'm drawing a cover for my new novel.

201
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,210
Can I see it?

202
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:12,410
It will be released next year anyway.

203
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,670
I'll look at it next year then.

204
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,610
You're so stingy.
