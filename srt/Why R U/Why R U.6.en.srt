1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,500
Come in.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,100
Come in! What are you looking at?

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,700
- Oh man, it's pouring rain without any notice.
- Yup.

4
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,100
Not like any novels!

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,910
This is not a novel.

6
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:28,700
It's nature. Rain is falling as mother nature intended.

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,200
Why are you taking it so seriously?

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:38,300
Shit. I end up sleeping with him just like in a Yaoi fiction.

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,300
No.

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,300
According to the novel,

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,700
there will be a scene when a man is helping to dry the hair of his loved one.

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,600
Oh shit. It's happening.

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,600
I'm going home.

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,800
Am I dreaming or this is real?

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,200
Why are we getting along so well in a small span of time?

16
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,800
If I let you kiss me right now...

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,500
I might find out if this is a dream or reality.

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,200
Is this really for real?!

19
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,300
Hey.

20
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,500
Go, take a shower.

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,900
I know.

22
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,100
Move.

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,000
Hey, don't forget to lock the door. Okay?

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,200
If something happens to you, I can't help it!!

25
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,700
Stop!

26
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,600
Where's my bracelet?

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Anything else?

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,700
Nope, nothing else.

29
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,400
Would you like to have one order of Saifah, sir?

30
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,800

00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,200
No, it's you! What did you do?

44
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,300
You hugged me!!!

45
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,600
No, you hugged me!!!

46
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,200
- You hugged me first.
- No, you started first.

47
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,600
Oh, yup, we are hugging each other.

48
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,400
Did you do anything else to me?

49
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,600
No, I didn't do anything to you.

50
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
It was my first time!!!

51
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,700
I just said I didn't do anything.

Shit... Did you use protection?

Hi.

71
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,400
What's wrong?

72
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:48,200
Wow, Wow, Wow... Why did you come to class early today?

73
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,800
Normally, you would get to class after the professor, right?

74
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,200
Well, why? Today, I want to be a good student.

75
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,600
Hmm... Are you sure, really?

76
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,900
Where're Natee and Junior?

77
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,000
I don't know, haven't seen them yet.

78
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
- Hello, everyone.
-There he is.

79
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,400
Hi!

80
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,400
You didn't answer my text last night.

81
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,200
Sorry, I was busy.

82
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,900
Busy??? What did you do?

83
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,000
I... I missed the bus.

84
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,600
So I had to spend a night in Saifah's room.

85
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,600
Saifah!!!

86
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Oh, wow, Saifah's room!!!

87
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,400
Hold on a second.

88
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,600
I want to know.

89
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,600
Where did you get this bracelet from?

90
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,000
You don't usually wear bracelets, right?

91
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,400
Well, I bought it. It cost me 1,000 baht.

92
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,800
In my opinion, Zon's bracelet made with a guitar pick looks cool.

93
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,500
The guitar pick from your bracelet, can it be used to play?

94
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,600
Yes, it can be used for real.

95
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,000
I spent a thousand baht for it, why it wouldn't work?

96
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,100
Oh, wow... a thousand baht guitar pick.

97
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,700
You really invested in it, just for only one concert, huh?

98
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Well, Saifah said that, since I wanted to learn,

99
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,200
might as well invest money into it,

100
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,700
just in case you might want to keep playing.

101
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,270
Saifah said that?

102
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,200
Fuck you!

103
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,300
You usually don't invest in anything.

104
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,400
Yes.

105
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,200
You must be hiding something or some sort of secret behind it, right?

106
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,600
Students, please have a seat.

107
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,500
It's time to start, aren't you all going to study?

108
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,000
Yes, sir!

109
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,400
Man... a little more and we would find out the truth.

110
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,200
Don't be nosy, go take a seat.

111
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:49,000
For students who don't have study sheets, you can get them here.

112
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,000
Zon and Zen, can you get a study sheet for the three of us?

113
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,800
Go get it, since I already asked.

114
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,300
My legs are tired.

115
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,800
I'm still tired from playing football yesterday.

116
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,600
Can you go get the study sheets, my hips are sore.

117
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,800
Okay, no problem. Be right back.

118
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,800
They're only a few causes for sore hips, right?

119
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,600
Number one.

120
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,800
You over used your hips.

121
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,790
Number two.

122
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:29,800
The hips are taking too much impact from a force.

123
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,300
Or.....

124
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,400
I can hear what you guys are talking about.

125
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,400
- It's nothing.
- Shit!

126
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,300
I fell off the bed, that's all. Okay?

127
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,800
Are you hiring?

128
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,800
Where should we go out tonight?

129
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,200
Go out? No, I'm tired from shopping.

130
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,700
We walked a lot.

131
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,600
- Come on. Let's go, okay?
- Hey, Fight, Fight!

132
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,300
Is that your junior, Tutor?

133
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,000
Hey, Dew, I have to go.

134
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,400
- Where are you going?
- I got to go.

135
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,590
I have to run. I'll text you, okay?

136
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,700
You're going to text me!!!

137
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,100
You say that and leave me behind again.

138
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,890
Oh, yeah.

139
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
Thank you, Tee.

140
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,600
Here you go, Zol.

141
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,600
-Thank you, Zen.
- Okay.

142
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
You're nice as always.

143
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,500
Thank you.

144
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,100
- Thank you, Tee.
- Yup.

145
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,000
Why so cute....?

146
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,100
What are you talking about?

147
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,000
Your cheek is so soft...

148
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,600
What the hell?

149
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,800
Hello, Junior.

150
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,600
Really... Okay. I'll be right there.

151
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,400
Hey, Junior said Jay found a place for Saifah and Zon to play music.

152
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,600
Really?

153
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,500
Do you want to take a look?

154
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,300
I haven't asked my parent's permission.

155
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,600
You're a little boy, I see.

156
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,800
Okay, I will get going then.

157
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,900
- See ya.
- Bye-bye.

158
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,300
- Hello.
- Hello.

159
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,600
I'm wondering, are you still hiring new applicants?

160
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,200
Sorry, all the positions are full.

161
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,400
That's okay, I understand.

162
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,600
Excuse me, what was that person here for?

163
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,300
He was here looking for a job, but we are not hiring.

164
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,200
- Thank you, Sir.
- Yes

165
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,400
Fight.

166
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,200
Are you trying to get back at me?

167
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,700
No, I'm not.

168
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,400
If you want to tutor me again, you can.

169
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,500
If you don't want to, don't worry about it.

170
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,400
Then I won't.

171
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,400
It's up to you.

172
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,700
What are you doing here?

173
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,600
I'm here for an errand and passed by,

174
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,600
and I saw you walking like a lost dog.

175
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't know what's wrong with you.

176
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You're exaggerating.

177
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,800
Oh, my god... I already told you, right?

178
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:48,400
Don't steal from the store! It's against store policy.

179
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,600
I didn't mean to.

180
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,000
Stop!

181
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I no longer want to listen or speak to you anymore.

182
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,600
Bye, go home.

183
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,400
Go back.

184
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,000
It's you! You came to apply for a job today, right?

185
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,400
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Kae sent me your photo.

186
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
Have you found a job yet?

187
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,400
No, not yet.

188
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,400
So sad.

189
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,220
You... poor thing.

190
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Anyway, let's go talk inside.

191
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
My name is Kaimook.

192
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,470
I'm a manager in this store.

193
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:45,170
[Scala]

194
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,200
Fight.

195
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,000
Are you happy?

196
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,200
You're still here?

197
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,800
I thought you already left.

198
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,059
I just so happene to be free.

199
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:04,899
I just want to know...

200
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:07,679
if a person like you would pass a job interview.

201
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,599
Of course, I would pass it. I am that good.

202
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:13,019
Okay, you're great.

203
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:14,599
But...

204
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:16,699
But what...?

205
00:20:16,699 --> 00:20:18,349
But...

206
00:20:18,349 --> 00:20:20,879
But what? Just say it.

207
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:22,509
Have you eaten anything yet?

208
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:25,090
Not yet.

209
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,349
Why? Are you asking me out for a meal?

210
00:20:28,349 --> 00:20:29,869
Tutor.

211
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:32,039
So what do you want? Hurry up.

212
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,839
It's just a question, okay?

213
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:35,999
Just asking...

214
00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:38,099
I...

215
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:40,220
I just happened to buy food.

216
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,120
I can't finish it.

217
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,760
You want me to eat your leftover food?

218
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,690
- I bought it.
- You bought?

219
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,120
I bought it for you, just take it.

220
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,339
Thank you.

221
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,820
I'm leaving then.

222
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,560
Hey, Tutor.

223
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,820
What is it?

224
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,830
You should come back and tutor me in English.

225
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,620
That way you don't have to work so hard.

226
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,429
You can tell me how much money you need?

227
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,139
You're being nice to me because of my situation, right? Case you might want to continue playing.

228
00:21:20,139 --> 00:21:25,960
No... I made up my mind that I won't teach any student who can't pay attention to me.

229
00:21:26,689 --> 00:21:30,560
Sorry, but I already got a job offer.

230
00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:35,720
For this food, thank you, Fight.

231
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,440
If you are going to give me things out of pity,

232
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,240
I don't need it.

233
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,540
Okay.

234
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:56,630
You will see... who's going to win.

235
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,280
Hello.

236
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,920
Hello.

237

(T/N: Hello in Korean)

242
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,520
What are you doing?!

243
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,299
Aren't you busy?

244
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:21,069
I'm not busy.

245
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,450
If you are not busy, go find something to do.

246
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,550
That way you won't bother me.

247
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,470
Is this how you greet a customer?

248
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,500
Excuse me, Manager, this worker—

249
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,499
Will you sell anything to me?

250
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,220
Are you sure that you want my help?

251
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,950
Okay.

252
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,469
Is this product any good?

253
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:46,020
This is a good mask.

254
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,899
- How about this one?
- This is a lip sleeping mask.

255
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:51,100
Is it for your lips?

256
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,770
If I use it on my lips...?

257
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,470
Kissable...

258
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,320
Fight.

259
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:02,749
- How about this one?
- This is a moisturizer. [KISAA]

260
00:24:02,749 --> 00:24:08,400
I think this product is good for you because your face needs it a lot.

261
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,050
Hey, Tutor.

262
00:24:11,069 --> 00:24:14,360
You should use this toothpaste, [Me-Dent]

263
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,760
it helps clean filthy mouths.

264
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:20,700
After you use it, maybe then you'll start speaking nicely.

265
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,919
You actually know what you are selling.

266
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,399
I thought I was watching a commercial.

267
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,399
Let me ask, how much commission do you make?

268
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:34,669
Fight.

269
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:39,269
If you are going to be an ass, you can go.

270
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,060
Okay, I'll go.

271
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,900
- Fight.
- What?

272
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,319
Are you really not buying anything?

273
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,099
What is it?

274
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,770
We don't talk at home, but you ask me to meet you here?

275
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,970
Zol...

276
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:24,620
I need your opinion. I need to talk to you.

277
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:29,049
I guess you need to have a problem

278
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:32,070
for you to talk to me.

279
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,799
I...

280
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,099
I want to know. After the mini-concert,

281
00:25:40,099 --> 00:25:44,100
what happens between me and Saifah?

282
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,149
You hooked up!
[HOOKED UP]

283
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:48,749
Zol... No!

284
00:25:48,749 --> 00:25:51,399
I don't want to.

285
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:56,590
I mean... Hooked-up and play music.

286
00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:03,460
I really wanted you to be in my novel.

287
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,970
But...

288
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:11,319
Since I saw... how you feel,

289
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,320
I changed it.

290
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:17,999
You're no longer playing music with Saifah.

291
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,069
- Really?
- That day,

292
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:24,099
we made a vow for the novel to come to life...

293
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,619
It's not real.

294
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:28,220
Really?

295
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,520
Are you happy now?

296
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,419
- Okay?
- Okay.

297
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,019
Go practice.

298
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,170
Okay. I'll go practice.

299
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:43,099
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

300
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,749
- Go.
- I'm off.

301
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,019
Talk to me at home.

302
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:50,650
Okay.

303
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,099
I didn't change the novel.

304
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,690
As long as you feel better...

305
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,419
Strike down motion four times.

306
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:12,819
- C, A minor, F and G7.
- How do you hold F chord?

307
00:27:12,819 --> 00:27:16,540
This is how you hold it. For just a moment.

308
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,170
Like this. Yeah.

309
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,970
Like that. Just try it.

310
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:26,370
Here, I'll teach you to hold the chord.

311
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,500
Put your finger here.

312
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,949
Here.

313
00:27:31,949 --> 00:27:36,650
Not all your fingers. Don't hold the 6th string.

314
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:40,149
Use this side of your finger.

315
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:42,470
Hold it.

316
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:45,010
Hold this.

317
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,850
Now go.

318
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,950
Go.

319
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:55,230
Here... Here...

320
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,230
Here.

321
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,700
One, two, three,

322
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:08,110
four. One, two, three, four.

Hey, hey, hey!

331
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,150
I can't take it.

332
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:56,370
Why are kids nowadays so fast?

333
00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:00,019
Oh-ho... You are this close, why don't you just kiss?

334
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,030
Spanking stick in.

335
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,079
My hand is shaking.

336
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,130
Naughty boy, you good at luring boy.

337
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:13,119
Let me have a good look at it.

338
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:16,800
Let's go... Let's go inside.

339
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,200
Hey, Zon.

340
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,939
I think you are... Furious.

341
00:29:25,939 --> 00:29:27,810
Mischievous.

342
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:32,019
- Suspicious.
- Already a couple.

343
00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:34,979
-Already a couple.
- Over my dead body.

344
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:42,200
Why are you blushing if there's nothing going on?

345
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,619
Blushing? Where am I blushing?

346
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:51,459
Maybe it's your mom?

347
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:58,019
Wait! You don't have to snide at your friend. Why's he being that way?

348
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,719
Hey, you.

349
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:03,800
I think your story in the novel is coming true.

350
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,230
Fuck the novel.

351
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,330
Oh, don't cry just because your friend is yelling at you.

352
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,319
What are you doing here anyway?

353
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:11,710
Oh, I found

354
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,530
a place for you and Saifah to

355
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:17,920
play in.

356
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,330
Clap.

357
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,919
You want to take a look?

358
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,479
Why are you asking me? Ask Saifah.

359
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,890
Saifah is okay with it.

360
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:31,569
He just usually helps out anyway. Isn't that right, Saifah?

361
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,349
Yes, I have no problem.

362
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,820
It's up to you if you want to play there.

363
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,760
I'm still new,

364
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,560
I don't think I'm good enough yet.

365
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,670
It's okay if you know only a few chords.

366
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,850
You can focus on singing.

367
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,950
I'll play the guitar... Don't worry.

368
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,600
You have me.

369
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,950
Do you think I can do it?

370
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:58,700
Yes, I think you are good enough.

371
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,319
Huh. Eottokhae.
(T/N: What to do? How? in Korean)

372
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:10,460
Okay.

373
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,380
I will trust you.

374
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,480
I will take your word for it.

375
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:22,100
Yaoi!

376
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,150
That's enough.

377
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,860
Okay, I'll stop.

378
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:36,610
And you... Why are you smiling?

379
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,960
What should I be doing?

380
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,610
Help me take care of these two bastards.

381
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,960
So you can't do it yourself, but you ask your man for help.

382
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,660
[You tired?]

383
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,650
[Are you tired of having me as your boyfriend?]

384
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,450
Where did this come from?

385
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,890
Hey.

386
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,860
Do you want to drink it?

387
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,170
No.

388
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,560
Stop bothering me.

389
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,910
Go.

390
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,090
Does Hwahwa know you stopped tutoring me?

391
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,700
Why didn't you tell her?

392
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,530
Because you are going to have to continue tutoring me.

393
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,130
Are you begging me

394
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,590
to tutor you?

395
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,420
If you want me back...

396
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,120
all you have to say is,

397
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,030
"Tutor,

398
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:50,070
would you please tutor me?

399
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:58,200
Tutor, I promise to pay attention, to not sleep and play video games."

400
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,299
Repeat it.

401
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,969
Are you trying to be funny?

402
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:04,630
You will be working for me.

403
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:06,030
- You're the boss?
- Yes.

404
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,990
Dear customer, I think

405
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:12,350
you will be interested in the product on the other side of the store.

406
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,960
Why don't you go that way?

407
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,860
Go that way.

408
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,350
I thought you were better than that.

409
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,770
[Open]

410
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:35,570
- Can you get it?
- What is this code for?

411
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,480
I'll do it. I'll show you.

412
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,410
See?

413
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:43,100
Kai...

414
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,020
Kaimook... Kaimook.

415
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,620
It's all right.

416
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,030
Tutor, I forgot to tell you

417
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:52,700
yesterday that sales weren't good.

418
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:57,080
Can you help me? We need to do 20,000 baht in sales.

419
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,170
20,000 baht?

420
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:01,580
Add sales for me, please!

421
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,950
But...

422
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,730
I...

423
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:08,020
I am not good at approaching people.

424
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,789
Oh, my god.

425
00:34:09,789 --> 00:34:12,470
It's for the company.

426
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:16,120
I'll be rooting for you.

427
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,640
KISAA brand is number one in sales,

428
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,610
you shouldn't have a problem.

429
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:23,960
So you can do 20,000 baht.

430
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,960
I'll cheer for you.

431
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,390
Fighting! Fighting!

432
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:28,500
Fighting! Fighting!

433
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,960
Okay, 20,000 baht.

434
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,400
Yeah, let's work.

435
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:35,900
Get back to work.

436
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:39,690
- I don't see it.
- Right here. Why is that not adding up?

437
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,420
Excuse me, Ma'am.

438
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,980
The total sales you need is 20,000 baht?

439
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:50,259
Yes, 20,000 baht.

440
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,810
Oh... Are you two...

441
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:55,370
together?

442
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,850
I knew it.

443
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,750
It's two guys.

444
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,480
I'll take care of it.

445
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,900
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

446
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,469
I'm interested in KISAA.

447
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,320
- Can you assist me?
- Yes, Ma'am.

448
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,210
This is KISAA, it helps in moisturizing your skin.

449
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,899
It is great for dry skin.

450
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,259
- Then I'm going to get it.
- Yes, Ma'am.

451
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,930
May I ask you to go to the cashier?

452
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:36,430
Total is 22,000 baht.

453
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,180
All right.

454
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,980
I don't have enough cash,

455
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,530
wait just a second.

456
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:51,200
Okay.

457
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,680
Fight, can you come over?

458
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,010
Are you waiting on your friend?

459
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,700
- Is he coming right now?
- Yes, he is coming right now.

460
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,450
Okay.

461
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,000
What's up?

462
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,690
Fight.

463
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,200
♫ I used to miss the old love and I dreamed of him often ♫

464
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,250
♫ Waiting for the day to meet ♫

465
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:09,470
♫ I don't know who that person is,
the imaginary one in my mind ♫

466
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:13,670
♫ Well, it doesn't look like you ♫

467
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:17,820
♫ If it's not true, then it's a trick. Is it trick or true? ♫

468
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:22,090
♫ The more you are quiet, the more I get attacked ♫

469
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:26,480
♫ Even I don't understand you, you want to warn against me ♫

470

472
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,160
Bro.

473
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:03,030
Thank you for helping me hand out flyers.

474
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:06,220
Don't hit my head.

475
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:10,020
Without you helping me, I don't know how long it would have taken me.

476
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,300
I remember.

477
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:15,070
Bro, you have to go and check the stocks.

478
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,030
Are you finished?

479
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,420
Anyway, thank you.

480
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,550
I'll help you take off the mask.

481
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,670
You must be hot. Hold on.

482
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:30,020
Don't worry, I'm helping you take off the mask.

483
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,730
Are you tired?

484
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:00,550
How about you?

485
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,650
Yeah.

486
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,030
Well...

487
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,560
Fighting!

488
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,750
Thank you.

489
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,190
Fight.

490
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:53,070
About today... thank you.

491
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,149
I'll go home with you.

492
00:40:09,149 --> 00:40:11,549
I parked my car at your condo.

493
00:40:11,549 --> 00:40:15,949
- At my condo?
- Yes, can't I park there?

494
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:17,980
Are you the owner?

495
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,819
Let's go.

496
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:31,520
Let's get a taxi.

497
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,030
Let go.

498
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,199
Let's go.

499
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:46,390
Okay, let's go home.

500
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:13,970
Fight, let me lean on your shoulder.

501
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:21,299
You have to pay me for it.

502
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,299
Stingy.

503
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,570
I only asked to lean on your shoulder.

504
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:34,430
I'm too tired to fight.

505
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,149
Tutor.

506
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:54,700
Can you tutor me again?

507
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:59,330
I already said what you have to do.

508
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,810
I promise...

509
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:06,929
I will pay attention.

510
00:42:06,929 --> 00:42:10,060
I won't play video games while you are tutoring.

511
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,920
Please. Let me come back...

512
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,180
Do you hear me?

513
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:43,600
I can see what happened.

514
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,890
Every time you guys talk, it's so loud.

515
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:49,590
If you want Tutor back,

516
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:53,360
the best method is...

517
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:58,510
to prove it with an action from your heart.

518
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:00,920
It works.

519
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,650
Are you going to tutor me again?

520
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:45,820
Why do you keep asking, Fight?

521
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,529
Can I ask you one thing?

522
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:53,230
What do you need?

523
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:59,259
I know that I have no right to tell you what to do,

524
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,250
but as your boss...

525
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:07,960
I mean, as your student,

526
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,600
I think you should quit your job.

527
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,660
I know you still want to work at the bakery,

528
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:18,090
and working at the beauty store is hard.

529
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:21,350
You should just focus on teaching me only.

530
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:24,480
Okay.

531
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,410
Because I'm worried about you, Tutor.

532
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:31,980
What did you just say?

533
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,899
Because I'm worried, is that clear enough?

534
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:40,220
You can say it if you are worried about me. No need to act like you don't care.

535
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:44,209
I'll quit that job.

536
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:46,119
But not the bakery.

537
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,180
I can still tutor you and work there.

538
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:52,149
If it was up to me,

539
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:54,680
you wouldn't be working.

540
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,780
But it's up to you.

541
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,630
Thank you, Fight.

542
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:03,920
Thank you for earlier today.

543
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,250
Thank you for being there...

544
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,020
I'm leaving, bye.

545
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:17,949
What are you doing?

546
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:19,989
- Just stretching.
- Stretching?

547
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:22,059
- I'm tired.
- You are tired like this?

548
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,200
I'm just trying to relax.

549
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:27,919
Why are you turning around?

550
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:35,000
Let me know when you are ready to start studying, come over and I'll teach you.

551
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,669
I'll LINE you.

552
00:45:36,669 --> 00:45:38,430
I'm going now.

553
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:44,570
Yes!!!!!

554
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,180
Welcome back to Tutor's class.

555
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,470
What's wrong with you?

556
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:07,819
Put your shoes away.

557
00:46:07,819 --> 00:46:10,420
Neatly, in there.

558
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,599
In the cabinet.

559
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,580
Put it nicely in the cabinet.

560
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:19,260
Hurry up, up, up.

561
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,970
Close the door nicely. You'll break the door.

562
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:29,430
Fight, set it down here,

563
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:32,180
No... put it here instead.

564
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:35,619
Wait, put it in the cabinet.

565
00:46:35,619 --> 00:46:40,149
No, no... is probably better in the drawer.

566
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:43,009
- In the drawer?
- Yeah, yeah, put it in the drawer.

567
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:46,850
Move it to the left a little.

568
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,860
I'm running out of patience, Tutor.

569
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,900
You can leave if you want to.

570
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,500
Okay, I'll leave it here.

571
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:06,380
Do you want some?

572
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:10,170
I'll share.

573
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,870
You are easy to scare?

574
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:35,620
- What are you playing?
- You're scared?

575
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:38,820
That's not the right answer.

576
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:41,350
You have to do it this way.

577
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,719
- Is this correct?
- No, I'll help.

578
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:49,019
Do you understand? It's supposed to be like this.

579
00:47:49,019 --> 00:47:51,010
I don't understand.

580
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,719
You need to pay attention, Fight.

581
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,770
Let's go over it one more time, maybe then I'll understand.

582
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:00,950
Okay, let's go over it again.

583
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:03,419
Fight.

584
00:48:03,419 --> 00:48:05,150
Hey, Tutor.

585
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,930
Hey!!

586
00:48:56,890 --> 00:49:01,090
Hey! I'm here to collect the rental fee that you owe my brother.

587
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,189
But it's not a due date yet, is it?

588
00:49:04,189 --> 00:49:07,580
If you don't have money then you have to meet my brother.

589
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:11,009
I think you might need to calm down.

590
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:12,890
I won't calm down!

591
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:14,670
Go! Go meet my brother.

592
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:15,909
Hey, stop! Calm down, bro.

593
00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:18,440
- Go meet my brother now.
- Stop! I'm begging you. Please calm down.

594
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,910
You've been postponing so many times.

595
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:21,670
- Is not like that.
- Hey!

596
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:24,069
- Who are you!?
- What are you doing?

597
00:49:24,069 --> 00:49:26,090
He owes me money.

598
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,049
What do you want?

599
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:32,030
He owes me money, 1.5 million baht including interests.

600
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:37,329
Give me your bank account and I'll manage it.

601
00:49:37,329 --> 00:49:39,209
- This is not funny.
- I'm not joking.

602
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:41,879
Well, then I'll send it to you.

603
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,420
Now, get out!

604
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:48,720
And if you don't transfer the money, you both will get hurt for sure.

605
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:53,750
How are you? Are you hurt?

606
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:08,670
You again. Let's go, or else you will get sick.

607
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,400
Fight.

608
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,230
Thank you.

609
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:41,260
Fight.

610
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:46,009
If you want extra classes, you can have them. I'll teach you for free.

611
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:50,410
And about saving me,

612
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:54,270
I don't have money right now.

613
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,319
You don't have to be worried.

614
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,370
I just wanted to help you.

615
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,789
Thank you, Fight.

616
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:05,600
But no one offers help for free.

617
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,930
Let's put it this way. When I have money, I'll give it back to you.

618
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,420
Listen!

619
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:18,120
You just have to be a good teacher for me. That's enough.

620
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,670
Okay.

621
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:52,030
What's wrong?

622
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,470
Ummm... nothing.

623
00:51:57,509 --> 00:51:59,420
Are you shy because of me?

624
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:02,790
No, I'm not. Who's shy? Are you crazy?

625
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:07,409
If you're not, then take off your shirt!

626
00:52:07,409 --> 00:52:09,280
I'll do it in the bathroom.

627
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,919
Why in the bathroom? Do it right here.

628
00:52:11,919 --> 00:52:14,930
Okay. I'll do it.

629
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,479
Not brave enough to do it?

630
00:52:18,479 --> 00:52:21,120
I'm brave, why wouldn't I be?

631
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,080
And why don't you take it off?

632
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:30,699
If you don't do it…

633
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:33,780
Okay, okay, okay. I'll do it.

634
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,350
Do it!

635
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:16,210
Fight.

636
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:20,229
Are you okay?

637
00:53:20,229 --> 00:53:22,000
I'm fine.

638
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,900
Fight.

639
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:27,200
Don't turn your back to me.

640
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:32,900
Okay. Why?

641
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:40,590
Are you scared of me?

642
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,450
Are you?

643
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:56,500
What are you doing?

644
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:02,830
Tutor!

645
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:17,699
You like this, don't you?

646
00:54:17,699 --> 00:54:19,890
How are you feeling?

647
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:27,410
If you know how you feel...

648
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:29,330
then don't tease others like this.

649
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:31,150
Got it?

650
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:08,950
Tutor,

651
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:12,380
why do I feel excited around you?

652
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:23,130
What happened with me?

653
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:12,900
Oh, Fight.

654
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:19,699
Where have you been?

655
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,060
I went to buy food and snacks.

656
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:23,970
What about your mobile phone?

657
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:25,620
My mobile phone?

658
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:31,189
It might be in the room.

659
00:56:31,189 --> 00:56:35,659
Next time, carry it with you in case someone has urgent issues.

660
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:38,830
Usually, no one calls me.

661
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,189
Hey, what's the matter?

662
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:46,449
Hey, you! What's wrong?

663
00:56:46,449 --> 00:56:48,180
Fight!

664
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:51,720
You follow me.

665
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:54,599
What's wrong with you?

666
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:57,170
Do you have to go this far?

667
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:41,470
Fight! I want to read a book!

668
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,660
I said I wanted to read a book.

669
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,060
Don't you get it?

670
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:18,849
I told you to stop it. Stop pressing it!

671
00:58:18,849 --> 00:58:20,910
I told you to stop it right away, Fight!

672
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:24,020
I told you to stop, Fight!

673
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:43,780
Fight!

674
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,220
Fight.

675
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,750
Can I ask you something.

676
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:18,900
Why did you kiss me that day?

677
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:29,060
Do you like men?

678
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,050
Answer me!

679
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:40,750
Fight.

680
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,820
Answer me.

681
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,590
[Next Episode]
So I came here. To pick you up to tutor me at home.

682
01:00:56,590 --> 01:01:00,020
I told you that I wanted to read a book in my room.

683
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:01,760
You're with me now.

684
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,410
This is my father, Tutor.

685
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,450
Good evening, Uncle.

686
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:10,730
Here's the key to the rooftop. It's boring practicing guitar in the room. I want a change to refresh.

687
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:12,350
Give me back my book.

688
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:14,470
I won't give it back.
