Enough of this.

166
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,200
I won't do what Natee told me to do anymore.

167
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,140
I don't want to see you cry.

168
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,520
I'm sorry.

169
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,820
You mean...

170
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,000
You didn't actually forget about me, right?

171
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,340
You didn't know me before... That's not true, right?

172
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,560
Right.

173
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,919
That's not true.

what actually happened?

188
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,760
I looked at the FB page. There were no photos of us there.

189
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,680
Don't tell me that...

190
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,459
Damn you!

191
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:04,419
Don't blame it on me.

192
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:06,159
It was Natee's plan.

193
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,180
He's the mastermind.

194
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,139
Hello, Zol. Are you going to delete the novel?

195
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:17,480
That's great. After you delete it, tell Zon something like...

196
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,399
I wish this will never happen. What happened is not real.

197
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:23,700
Bye-bye, Zol.

198
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,599
Zol is okay about this but do you think Soda will be okay?

199
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:30,599
Don't worry.

200
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,639
I'll ask Junior to deal with this.

201
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,840
Everything is under control.

202
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,479
Is this a good plan?

203
00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:41,920
I feel sorry for Zon.

204
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,180
Don't be. He's stupid! He's dumb!

205
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:49,399
He will never learn his lesson if we don't do this.

206
00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:52,380
No need to worry. I got this.

207
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,080
Trust us.

208
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,200
Zol too?

209
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,100
Zol is in it, too?

210
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:19,000
What if... everything follows what happened in the novel?

211
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,180
About that...

212
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,120
Zol already deleted everything.

213
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,240
Please write a Yaoi novel with me.

214
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,840
Okay.

215
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,460
What if Zol rewrites it again. I'm scared that we will...

216
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,000
Zon.

217
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,380
Whatever happens in the end,

218
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,740
or even if we're actually in the novel,

219

If we're actually in the novel,

222

the only character that I'll choose to be with

223
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:34,200
is you.

224

I've been here for ages!

Since when were you here?

237
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,419
You came out of nowhere.

238
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:51,100
I've been here since you were smiling by yourself.

239

Oh right, Zol. I have something to ask you.

241
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,999
Well... I...

242
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,360
I...

243
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,860
I don't know what to do

244
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,360
about my own feeling after all this.

245
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,560
I think...

246
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,419
Whatever you feel

247
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:38,139
and whatever you want to do,

248
00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:39,940
just do it.

249
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,380
The characters that you write as well.

250
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,080
Every character has their own heart.

251
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,539
Whatever you want your characters to feel,

252
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:05,900
use your own heart to write them down.

253
