Are you saying it like that because you want to insult me, right?

Okay, try writing your own science fiction

00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,690
Kae...

166
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,490
- What!?
- Yes, Ma'am!

167
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:24,710
I'm sorry about the money.

168
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,269
It's all right, Tutor. You're like my brother.

169
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:34,029
If there's anything I can help you with, youcan let me know.

170
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:41,350
About the money, we can talk later. Look, Tutor, this too shall pass.

171
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:47,730
I'm really grateful for your help. May I go get changed now?

172
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:48,510
Sure.

173
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:52,130
- Thank you once again.
- Not a problem, Tutor.

174
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,550
Would you like anything else?

175
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,370
Thank you.

176
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,240
Thank you.

177
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
Thank you.

178
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,409
- Hey! Tutor, don't forget to clean that table.
- Definitely.

179
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,770
What's wrong with my computer again?

180
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,630
Zon!

181
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,270
Why are you so shocked?

182
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,390
Ouch! Why don't you knock first before you enter my room?

183
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,410
What if I'm naked?

184
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,170
Haven't I seen everything since I was a kid?

185
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:16,950
You're a monster!

186
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:26,530
Hey! If you're this shocked, were you just watching porn?

187
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,749
Nosy.

188
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:32,700
I didn't mean to be nosy. What about your novel?

189
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,790
Have you finished it?

190
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,750
Not yet.

191
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:43,930
Hang in there! If it's that hard, you can just give up.

192
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:49,320
And the challenge we have talked about…

193
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,489
I won't give up!

194
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,670
Why are you so serious? I was giving you some advice.

195
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:58,309
So why are you here? to ridicule me?

196
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,780
Dang! I forgot.

197
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:06,230
Dad and Mom want to see you. Dad looked...

198
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,450
to be not okay.

199
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,490
Is it that bad?

200
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:20,070
Very! You're dead meat.

201
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:27,469
Hurry down. Dress up and put your pants on.

202
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:32,640
- Don't forget, long pants. Be nice, bye.
- Please.

203
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,610
- Okay. I'm done.
- Pay attention.

204
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,970
Does it hurt, Unicorn?

205
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,070
It does. Badly.

206
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Dad and Mom, you look stressed?

207
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,730
Zon, when do you plan to tell me about your GPA?

208
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:12,590
Oh! GPA.

209
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:20,350
It's not that bad, is it? Right?

210
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:29,790
Look! Do you think 2.1 is not bad?

211
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,750
You almost get an academic warning.

212
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,070
I'm sorry, Mom.

213
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:50,220
I will make sure to get a higher GPA this semester. I promise.

214
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:58,190
Like 2.5, are you okay with that?

215
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:04,070
Then how much do you want?

216
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:13,190
Whoa, 3.0? Can I negotiate, 2.75?

217
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:23,940
Okay, okay. 3.0 then. It's just a piece of cake.

218
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,470
I can make it if I wanted to.

219
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:35,389
Well... if you're finished, I'll go upstairs.

220
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:39,249
Wait, I'm not finished yet. GPA is one of the issues.

221
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,890
The most important thing I want to say is about your novel writing.

222
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:49,910
I want you to take a break from it and focus more on your studies.

223
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:54,130
Your GPA is lower because you've spent time on other things.

224
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:01,240
But other things you're talking about are what I love.

225
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:07,890
You said you will support your kids in what they like.

226
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:13,549
And this is what I like but it seems you don't support me.

227
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:17,650
But with Zol, you have no problem supporting her.

228
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,450
This is obviously a double standard.

229
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:21,250
No, it's not like that son.

230
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:25,120
It's not that I don't support you

231
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,350
but your GPA is going down.

232
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:32,380
With your sister, her GPA is fine. Right?

233
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,810
- But...
- No "but".

234
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:39,120
I'm giving you an ultimatum, hold off the novel writing.

235
00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:02,800
Zon, take time and think about what we've said.

236
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:08,870
If we're right or not.

237
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,080
You're done, right?

238
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,410
I'll go back to my room then.

239
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,320
[Saifah]

240
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:22,590
It's him. Saifah.

241
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,720
The guy whom I want to meet the least in university.

242
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,820
Look at that pose.

243
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,400
Such a show-off.

244
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,540
Aww... cutie.

245
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:38,089
Well, excuse me?

246
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,569
Yes?

247
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,630
Why are you taking a picture of me?

248
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,330
Oh no!

249
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,090
I don't know what to say.

250
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,850
Zon, please don't mind us.

251
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:50,850
Actually, we imagine you and Saifah being together.

252
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:55,969
Like, the moment when your boyfriend playing guitar is so cute...

253
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:59,270
Imagine? Me and Saifah?

254
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,670
We don't like each other.

255
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:07,589
Nah, don't be shy.

256
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:10,530
Shy? No, I totally am not.

257
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,830
He said he's not shy.

258
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,670
What the heck?

259
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,690
Why would someone imagine me with Saifah all of a sudden?

260
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:21,730
Not only mess with my dream, but also with my real life.

261
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,950
Such a life.

262
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,470
Not only troubles at home,

263
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,529
but also this nonsense in the university.

264
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:31,270
Zon? Are you all right?

265
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,289
Why so quiet?

266
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:35,869
You didn't curse us in your head, right?

267
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:39,030
Um... no.

268
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:42,040
Well, I've got to go now.

269
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,330
He's so cute...

270
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:55,389
Seriously?

271
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,369
Yeah.

272
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:01,670
Weird. Your parents always support you in everything, don't they?

273
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,490
Why are they disallowing this?

274
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:05,790
No wonder, he got such a low grade.

275
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:08,470
If I were them, even this is still not enough.

276
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,430
What are you going to do?

277
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,250
I'll crush him like a bug.

278
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:14,250
A son like you, a retard, a naughty boy,

279
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,350
no way you can be successful.

280
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,690
Prepare for caning...

281
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:25,270
Wait... wait. It really hurts on the right side.

282
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,629
I'm older than you, give me some respect.

283
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:32,370
Let me ask. How were the grades you got last semester?

284
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,789
Hey!

285
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,510
A little more than him.

286
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:38,449
But I ask because I care for him.

287
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,270
- Care or just being nosy?
- A guy like Junior...

288
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:45,110
- Care for his friend?
- Must be nosy!

289
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,750
Oops!

290
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,670
Can you take it seriously?

291
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:59,450
You guys always make fun of me.

292
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,370
Wait. Zon.

293
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:05,169
Calm down, and let's find a way out of this.

294
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,290
Yep, sit down.

295
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,610
Yeah, don't be too serious.

296
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:14,290
What will you do next, Zon?

297
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,810
I got over it.

298
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:19,890
From now on, I'll just focus on studying.

299
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,629
Aww, look at that face.

300
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,410
Forget it.

301
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:34,850
I already got over it

302
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,830
Or maybe...

303
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:40,290
write it in the same genre as your sister, Zol.

304
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,610
Something called, Yaoi? I see that many people like it.

305
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:46,170
Yeah, it's trending right now.

306
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,370
Begin with your couple,

307
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:51,829
Zon and Zen, aww...

308
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:53,730
Zen...

309
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:57,270
Don't worry, just a little...

310
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:00,050
Come to think of it, a Yaoi novel...

311
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,550
I don't know how to write one.

312
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,869
Wait, your novel...

313
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:08,710
Oops! What's that smell? I think... Dog corpse?

314
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:11,670
Ugh! You make me smell it, what is that?

315
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,490
It's coming!

316
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,190
Novel?

317
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:14,950
Poop!

318
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,930
Natee!

319
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:22,410
Let's go eat something, we can't stay here with that smell.

320
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,670
Always interrupting.

321
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,929
I can't stand up.

322
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:29,370
- Come on guys, let's go.
- Zon, I'm sorry

323
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,649
- I'll come back later.
- Zon, I'm sorry

324
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:34,149
You guys go first.

325
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,710
Let me handle this first.

326
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,770
Don't take too long.

327
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,969
So hungry.

328
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,530
Not even a slice of pork for me.

329
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,670
- Hi, hi, hi!
- Whoa!

330
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:55,350
Natee! Did you shit in the toilet or your pants?

331
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,870
So smelly.

332
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,649
Excuse me? Your voice?

333
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,009
Anything stuck in your throat?

334
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,070
Er... it's "marcus".

335
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,830
Mucus.

336
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,170
Uh...yep, mucus.

337
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,750
Darn it! We're dead!

338
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,950
Dead? We don't have any class today.

339
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,550
No! I mean Saifah and his friends are coming.

340
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,090
Whoa!

341
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:42,490
Wow!

342
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:46,309
Your spoon.

343
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,830
Geez!

344
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:49,970
Walking here handsomely,

345
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:53,490
I thought you guys were Mum, Teng, Nong.

346
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:57,130
Hey! wait. Saifah, come practice soccer, will you?

347
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:00,930
Jay keeps asking me all the time and says that no sophomore comes to practice.

348
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,869
What did you say?

349
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,229
Say again.

350
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,170
More slowly and clearly.

351
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,889
Slow and clear? I see.

352
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:11,050
Saifah, come to soccer practice, will you?

353
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:13,829
Jay keeps asking me...

354
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:14,830
More slowly.

355
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,330
More slowly? Okay!

356
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:20,290
Saifah, come to soccer practi—

357
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:23,550
I didn't finish my line yet. Just listen to me!

358
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,669
It hurts all over.

359
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,870
Er... What did I want to say?

360
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,470
He said that...

361
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:32,250
- Saifah! Jay said...
- I know, I heard him.

362
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,590
Then do it, don't just talk the talk.

363
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:37,610
All right. Why did you guys come here?

364
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,850
Yep, why?

365
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:41,470
Not just you guys, many Communication Arts girls are also here.

366
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:45,170
Communication Arts canteen is closed, so we came here.

367
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:48,830
That's great, so the food would be more tasty.

368
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:52,630
You're such a playboy.

369
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,630
Whatever floats your boat, Day.

370
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,190
- Hey, and you, Tutor!
- What?

371
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,510
How it's going?

372
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:01,530
I heard that you had a fight with a senior at the soccer field.

373
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:05,469
It's nothing, no fighting.

374
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,469
Who is he?

375
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:11,229
None other than his forever rival.

376
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,730
You're so nosy, you know?

377
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:17,970
I don't want to be nosy, my mom is a big fan of Tutor.

378
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:22,689
Zon. Zon!

379
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:25,770
What's up? Why do you look so sad?

380
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:30,129
Because his dad...

381
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,790
What? It's the truth, we can tell them.

382
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:37,870
His parents curse him like a dog because his GPA fell down from 3 to 2,

383
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:40,030
and nearly got a warning.

384
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,490
Damn it!

385
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:47,130
But in secondary school, Zon was very good.

386
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,589
Really?

387
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,189
Yep!

388
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:55,250
As I remember, he was good at every subject except English.

389
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,189
Right?

390
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:59,650
I think you remember the wrong guy.

391
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:03,229
Hey, Tutor.

392
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:08,890
I think someone we may think is good might be not that good.

393
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:14,890
He might just be pretending to be good at everything,

394
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:18,470
but actually, he may be useless at everything.

395
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:19,790
Oww! Useless.

396
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:23,490
Savage, so damn savage.

397
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,830
Who are you talking about?

398
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,400
Who do you think?

399
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,130
Must be me.

400
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,430
Hey, stop it!

401
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,600
Can you guys stop fighting?

402
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,630
You always have to fight.

403
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,790
Just calm down, will you?

404
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,990
Tutor, I have nothing to do with him.

405
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:08,360
But your friend, what's the heck is wrong with him?

406
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,790
There's nothing wrong with me.

407
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,710
Just an ordinary guy, looking good,

408
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,040
do you have any problem with that, Zon?

409
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,890
Oh my god!

410
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,450
Sit down. Let's go.

411
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:26,570
Go there.

412
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:29,770
Zon, sit down. Sit down.

413
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,850
Come on, Zon.

414
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,390
Come on, sit here.

415
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:39,610
Don't mess with him.

416
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,830
Zon, may I ask something?

417
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:51,869
Why are you guys always fighting?

418
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:56,529
Yes, he just took your ex-girlfriend.

419
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:59,430
Why are you so angry with him?

420
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:09,150
Or... is there something more that we don't know?

421
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,050
Is that so?

422
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:18,430
Hmm... suspicious.

423
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,890
Nothing.

424
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,040
I just hate him.

425
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,910
Same as he hates me.

426
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,750
What are you looking at?

427
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:45,850
Saifah, don't look at him and stop fighting.

428
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:50,329
Tutor, your friend is annoying.

429
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,480
What has he done to you?

430
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,090
You know it, don't you?

431
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,990
About why I annoy him.

432
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:00,750
Are you sure... that is the only reason?

433
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,730
Why do you hate him so much?

434
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:09,650
Oh! I almost forget that Zon was...

435
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:13,289
interrupting you while you were...

436
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,450
All right, I get it.

437
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:16,990
Know what I meant?

438
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,990
Of course.

439
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:23,410
But if I were Zon, I would do that too.

440
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,850
I didn't do anything bad.

441
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,790
- But the girl just approached me, and...
- So...

442
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:33,790
I justflirted a little and went with the flow.

443
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:36,630
I didn't mean to do such thing.

444
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,850
What a gentleman. So, the point is...

445
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:43,170
Zon saw you, then interrupted you, right?

446
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,810
But no one ended up with the girl, right?

447
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,250
Be straight with me, Saifah.

448
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,250
Is there anything more than that?

449
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,669
I bet there is.

450
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:56,150
Nothing, you guys are just thinking too much.

451
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,350
You're hiding something from us now, hmm?

452
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,750
- I've told the truth.
- You sure?

453
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,650
- Aha.
- Tutor!

454
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:20,190
Can I sit here with you guys?

455
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,430
Yep.

456
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,930
Oh! Hwahwa...

457
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:27,310
I remember that I told you to come around 1:00 p.m., didn't I?

458
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:29,170
Why did you come so early?

459
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:31,469
I didn't arrive here early,

460
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,110
I just...

461
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:37,150
want to tell you that...

462
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,530
Hi, Hwahwa.

463
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:49,310
You just come to tell me that

464
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,570
you can't go out to eat with me.

465
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,970
I knew it.

466
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:07,670
Hwahwa? Why the long face?

467
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:13,090
I'm afraid that you might get mad at me.

468
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:18,430
Have I ever gotten angry because of you?

469
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:21,410
Never.

470
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,310
So, don't be sad.

471
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,110
I'm not mad at you.

472
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,710
- Thank you so much!
- Can we go now?

473
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,570
Well then, I have to go now.

474
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,969
Okay.

475
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:36,070
Bye-bye.

476

You see? Tutor.

477
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:51,210
What?

478
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,350
You only blame me.

479
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:56,549
- It's all the same to you.
- Yeah.

480
00:39:56,549 --> 00:40:00,409
Yep, when will you and Fight get back together?

481
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:02,309
Never.

482
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,170

00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,570
- Hi.
- Hi, what's your name?

496
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,110
I'm Sai.

497
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,310
Thank you.

498
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:07,430
- Hello.
- Hi.

499
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:09,390
- What's your name?
- I'm Day.

500
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,170
Thank you.

501
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,830
What's your name?

502
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,830
I'm Tutor.

[Tor]

504
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,510
Thanks.

505
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:46,830
Sir? This isn't "Tutor," it's wrong.

506
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:55,650
I just want to write it like this.

507
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:00,030
Any problem?

508
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:07,490
- Nothing. Thanks.
- Now go.

509
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,190
I'm Tar.

510
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,910
- Tar, right?
- Yes.

511
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,640
- Here.
- Thanks.

512
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,900
[Saifah]

513
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:37,650
Among those seniors, you just need the last one from Fight?

514
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:38,610
Yeah.

515
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:40,170
That's him.

516
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:47,270
Go ask him, and just do what he wants.

517
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,690
I don't want to. Please?

518
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:52,710
No! You are even more dependent on the seniors,

519
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:55,910
if you don't do it, we don't get to play. Now go!

520
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,470
I don't want to!

521
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:00,290
- There's no choice for you. Come on, go!
- Come on.

522
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:03,190
- He's the last one.
- Okay, just a second, and I will go.

523
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:05,490
No, go ask him now!

524
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,870
What do you want, Tutor?

525
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:16,289
I come to ask for an autograph.

526
00:43:16,289 --> 00:43:18,789
I already gave it to you.

527
00:43:18,789 --> 00:43:22,230
It's not you, I mean...

528
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:27,009
Hey, you didn't give it to him yet?

529
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:28,890
It's about time for him to get the gear.

530
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:30,549
Just give it to him.

531
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,950
Can I have your autograph?

532
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:59,170
- Here.
- Thank you.

533
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,370
Why did you just give me only one letter?

534
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:13,950
If you want the others,

535
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:16,030
come ask me again.

536
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:32,590
- Phew.
- Finally.

537
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:35,189
Yep, what a day.

538
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:38,490
Hey, man, everything fine? Did you get it?

539
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,070
Fine?

540
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:43,150
Want me to run for so many laps, give me just one letter.

541
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:45,770
Just don't mind. Get on with it.

542
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:50,269
You'll need him to tie the string soon, this is just an autograph.

543
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,950
I want to change my fraternity.

544
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:54,950
Aww, man, calm down. Changing fraternity?

545
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:57,710
Why so serious about it?

546
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,150
Don't worry.

547
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:02,150
Think about it, I ran about 50 laps!

548
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:05,170
- Just running, it's better than other things.
- It's just an autograph.

549
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:07,490
Let's drink, I'm thirsty.

550
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:11,770
- One more lap?
- No, not anymore!

551
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:21,240
Why do I have to do this?

552
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:29,790
Oh. Tutor.

553
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:31,350
Hello, Senior.

554
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:46,330
Senior?

555
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:52,350
Would you tie the string for me?

556
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:55,930
Because if you won't,

557
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:59,310
then I will leave.

558
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:12,930
Do you have the right to say that to your senior?

559
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:24,470
Come on.

560
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:52,390
Stay here for at least 4 years, all right?

Here.

572
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:49,910
You are giving this... to me?

573

Yeah.

Want it or not?

579
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,620
Yep, but you have to say something first.

580

You just say...

581
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:21,420
"Tutor, I bought this bottle for you"

582
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,130
Come on, try it.

Nah, get it.

Hi, Hwahwa.

587
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:35,380
What are you doing?

588
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,140
Well.

Fight, right?

591
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:47,149
Er... my fraternity senior,

592
00:48:47,149 --> 00:48:49,330
he came to give me something.

593
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:52,019
But he is too shy to say that

594
00:48:52,019 --> 00:48:55,310
"I bought this one just for you."

595
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,850
Your name is Hwahwa, right?

596
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,650
I bought this for you.

00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:10,290
Thank you so much!

598
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:18,939
I'm sorry, maybe my friend is thirsty.

599
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:19,879
Stop it.

Seems like your dad and my mom wants us to meet

601

and have dinner together.

602
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:30,200
I never thought I would see you here before that.

603
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,060
What a coincidence!

604
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,160
Hwahwa, did you know him before?

605
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:42,579
Not really.

606
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,579
Right?

607
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:46,480
Then, see you later.

608
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,660
- I have to go now.
- Okay.

611

His name is Fight who I told you about before.

612
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I'm warning you, be careful of him.

617

We're dating.

620
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,800
Have you eaten yet?

621
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,100
Not yet.

622
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,600
Shall we go eat something?

623
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,800
You okay? What shall we eat?

624

625
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,400
Oh! Jar, when have you been here?

626
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,200
A short while ago, I saw you zone out, so I didn't tell you.

627
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,000
Oh! All right.

628
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Shall we start now?

629
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,900
Yep.

630
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,500
What's wrong with this? It was working well yesterday.

631
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,700
Zol!

632
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:15,900
Zol!

633
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,900
Has she gone this far?

634
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,800
What is this?

635
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:34,600
Zon, what are you doing? Zon, what are you doing?

636
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,600
Nothing! My computer doesn't work.

637
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,300
So, I'm going to borrow your laptop.

638
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:50,300
Then, did you just see…

639
00:53:53,200 --> 00:54:00,400
It was your fiction that used my name and Saifah as the main characters, wasn't it?

640
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,200
Brother, Zon.

641
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,600
Why are you doing this, Zol?

642
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,400
It's all right. You don't need to answer, but you must delete it.

643
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,600
And remove it from every website you have published.

644
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:22,400
Zon, the characters are not exactly you and Saifah.

645
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,800
Many have the same name as yours.

646
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,000
Many people? What a coincidence?

647
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,400
My name. My faculty. My university.

648
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,200
And many things related to me and Saifah.

649
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,800
It's not just that.

650
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:45,800
There's Tutor and Fighter as main characters who happen to be my close friends.

651
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,100
What's a coincidence!

652
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:52,389
Delete!

653
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,600
No, I will not! Zon, it took me a long time to write this fiction.

654
00:54:54,600 --> 00:55:00,000
Zon, it took me a long time to write this fiction.

655
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:06,200
Don't tell me that the reason you are telling me to remove the fiction is

656
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:13,000
you are scared that people would know the thing between you and Saifah.

657
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,600
The thing between me and Saifah? What's that?

658
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,800
It's the fact that you and Saifah are dating?

659
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,800
Me and Saifah? We hate each other so much.

660
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,600
You think we are dating. Are you crazy?

661
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,300
Are you two quarreling?

662
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,400
Don't be like that.

663
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,500
Being a couple, you must try to understand each other.

664
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,700
Clarify, talk to, and understand each other.

665
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,800
Oh, my sister! Are you all right?

666
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,600
Do you have a fever?

667
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,600
Firstly, you must pull yourself together.

668
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:47,200
Me and Saifah as a couple, are you crazy?

669
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:54,400
You! You are the one who needs to pull yourself together.

670
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:01,000
You may think that no one saw. But I did.

671
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,300
Saw... what?

672
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:11,400
Well, the story is…..

673
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,600
Are you a friend of Tanthai? Do you have any business with me?

674
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,400
Yes, I do.

675
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,400
Who?

676
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,600
Zon.

677
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:59,200
Hi, Fai. I thought we were seeing each other.

678
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,200
Yes, we are. But I am not seeing only you.

679
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,800
I'm seeing Saifah, too.

680
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,150
What?

681
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:24,400
Hang on! I have a call.

682
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,800
Hello, Praew, I'm coming.

683
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,500
Fai... wait!

684
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,500
What do you want to do?

685
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,400
What I want to do?

686
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:41,900
You jerk! Saifah!

687
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:47,200
Did you really not know that I was seeing Fai.

688
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,500
No!

689
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:57,200
Actually, Tanthai, your friend, should have told you that I was seeing Fai.

690
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,400
He didn't tell me.

691
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,200
And even if you are really seeing Fai,

692
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,400
it doesn't mean she cannot talk to other guys.

693
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:08,000
You are just seeing her, you are not dating her.

694
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:17,100
So, you mean you are dating Fai?

695
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,600
No, I have been talking with her for three weeks.

696
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,800
Three weeks!

697
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,000
And she is the one who asked me to come here.

698
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,580
Let me tell you this, Zon.

699
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,100
No one...

700
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:46,000
wants to date a guy like you.

701
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,500
Say it again.

702
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,040
I said...

703
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,460
no one...

704
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:07,100
wants to date a guy like you.

705
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,100
You bastard!

706
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:53,600
Zon! Oh, you're shocked that I caught you.

707
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,200
Is that right? That day?

708
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:02,900
Building 3. It was, on that day, we...

709
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,200
we were about to fight.

710
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,200
Yes, I saw.

711
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:12,000
But you may have seen it from an angle

712
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,400
that looks like we were kissing, like in movies.

713
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:20,300
However, our lips were not touching each other.

714
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,200
We were punching.

715
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:27,300
And because of the angle, it made you see it like that. That's it.

716
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:31,200
You are lying, obviously.

717
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,200
Delete!

718
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,000
I said no!

719
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,400
I told you to delete it!

720
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,800
No! Way!

721
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:46,400
Well, do you dare to swear that you and Saifah didn't kiss each other?

722
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:52,600
And you have never felt confused and kept that moment in your mind?

723
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,400
I dare, I never felt confused because of that incidence

724
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,300
and I never kissed Saifah. I swear!

725
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:13,000
Well, I'm asking to all the sacred things in this house,

726
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,840
if you are telling a lie,

727
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:21,160
my fiction will turn into your reality.

728
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,700
Oh! What weird timing.

729
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:35,600
My fiction will come true. Oh my god!

730
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,200
Nonsense!

731
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,000
Nonsense what?

732
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,700
What if it really turns real?

733
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:44,400
It's just raining. Don't imagine that far.

734
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,800
That moment, the timing was so perfect.

735
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,500
The thunder came at the right time. Bang!!

736
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:50,600
It was raining, thunder could come as usual.

737
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:55,100
- Are you scared?
- I swear it's not true.

738
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:56,600
Delete!

739
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,600
I will not delete it!

740
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,400
Delete!

741
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,400
No! Boo! What?

742
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,400
Delete!

743
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,300
No, I will not delete.

744
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,600
I'm so hungry. I better find something to eat.

745
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,600
Why did I have to swear?

746
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,800
I did swear but she didn't delete it.

747
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,100
I could not sleep.

748
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,800
I shouldn't have sweared as Zol requested.

749
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,000
How did you come into my room?

750
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:49,000
What's happening with you, Zon?

751
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:54,000
What? What?

752
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:56,000
Calm down.

753
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,400
Why are you coming closer?

754
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,600
- Clam down, Zon.
- What!

755
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:05,100
Calm down, we are a couple.

756
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:08,800
What? I have never dated someone like this!

757
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,000
Don't you believe we are a couple?

758
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,800
What's wrong with you?

759
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:22,000
Then, I'm going to prove that we are a couple like we did last night.

760
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,200
Was that real or I was dreaming?

761
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,130
Ouch!

762
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,200
I'm begging you, don't let me get involved in anything with Saifah, please.

763
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,000
Ouch, that's hurt.

764
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:37,610
Shit! What the hell!

765
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,200
What? Has she gone this far?
[Welcome]

766
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:22,800
They are the people in the poster in Zol's room, aren't they?

767
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,400
Are you all right?

768
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,000
Why are you making a weird face?

769
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:34,000
Damn! I went into the fiction!

770
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,400
Is it real?

771
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:03,000
[Next episode]
Hello, everyone, you're now watching the "Chemistry Cute Boy" show.

772
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,800
Or you can say the "Cute Boy Who has the Best Chemistry" show.

773
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:10,000
- Hello, I'm Natee.
- I'm Junior.

774
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,800
Not now guys, sorry!

775
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:16,000
I forgot… that you never had a real friend...

776
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:19,300
Fight!

777
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,000
Or actually...

778
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:25,800
you like guys.

779
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,300
Is it like this?
