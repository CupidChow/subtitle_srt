00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:15,000
Welcome to WHY R U The Series!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,359
Hello, everyone. You're watching the Special Episode of WHY R U The Series.

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,960
Episode: WHY R U Ready?

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,439
Before opening our book, we want you to get to know us first.

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,820
Let me briefly introduce ourselves.

6
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:37,259
WHY R U The Series was created by ManDeeWork Company,

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,940
with the Executive Producer, Aoftion Kittipat Jampa

8
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:45,480
or the owner of the fanpage, DoMunDi Traveling Show.

9
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,139
Now that you already know us, let's gradually open our book together.

10
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,599
This series was inspired by a Boy's Love series and the beauty of love.

11
00:00:54,599 --> 00:01:00,019
We've got the popular online writer, CandyOn, as a part of our team.

12
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,279
After the announcement, feedback from the audience has been beyond our expectations.

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,380
The series was able to reach the Top Trend often.

14
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:09,779
We want to thank everyone, and now you're getting close to reading it.

15
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,870
But before doing so, we'd like to share with you each step that took place

16
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,610
before WHY R U The Series was released.

17
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,640
Let's get to know our director first.

18
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:34,200
Hello, I'm Cheewin Thanamin Wongsakulpatch, the director of WHY R U The Series.

19
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,059
Most of you might have seen me before. Actually, I had not been around for a while.

20
00:01:47,059 --> 00:01:50,480
So, when the producer, Aoftion, reached out to me,

21
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,999
I thought maybe it's time to get back to a Boy's Love series again.

22
00:01:55,999 --> 00:02:01,430
I was so excited, and I have to thank the producer

23
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,370
who gave me the chance to direct this series.

24
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:09,919
When I heard about the storyline for the first time, I felt like I got goosebumps.

25
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,219
I wanted to create this series because it has an obvious signature.

26
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:20,380
As it has the signature and some differences, I wanted to try creating it.

27
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,179
The acting is extremely important.

28
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,439
WHY R U The Series made sure to have acting workshops.

29
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,520
Talking about workshops,

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,899
I tested all groups of actors in order to divide them into four groups.

31
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,379
First, those who can act, those who can act moderately,

32
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,779
the ones who can't act and those who have never acted before.

33
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,239
Almost all of them are new actors,

34
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,059
and they had little acting background only.

35
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:55,159
so I provided them all with basic acting skills.

36
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:01,979
That's why it took us a long time to train our actors.

37
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:09,480
If I'm not mistaken, we've had almost 40 workshop sessions

38
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,559
The second character.
[Workshop]

39
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,699
The first character.

40
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,959
I'll call you in the evening.

41
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,519
Fighter! This is my best friend. Please behave.

42
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,759
You go with this bastard. Take care of yourself. Stop it!

43
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,779
Who are you calling a bastard? Do you have a problem? Do you?

44
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,139
I'm an acting coach who has never ventured into a BL series before,

45
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:33,519
so I had to learn a lot from watching a lot of BL series,

46
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:39,639
BL movies, both Thai and International,

47
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:48,539
in order to see how the actors should act to achieve the goal.

48
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:55,580
And I've gained a lot of knowledge and experience from studying

49
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,820
all of which I've brought to WHY R U The Series.

50
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,459
The producer is another one who puts a lot of effort.

51
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,879
Seems like a lot of money has been spent on this series.

52
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,339
Before making WHY R U The series, I was more focused on a traveling fan page.

53
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,539
One day, I thought I'd like to create a series.

54
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,299
It took me a long time to think of what kind of series I'd like to make.

55
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,879
I realized that BL series are popular these days,

56
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,939
so I thought about creating one.

57
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,599
Why did I choose BL series?

58
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,119
I think we have to change our mindset a bit

59
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,839
because in actuality, a BL series is a kind of love series.

60
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,279
It's not different from other series.

61
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,899
So I think it can get into the people's hearts.

62
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,119
We don't want to focus on sexy scenes for this series

63
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,739
but we want to focus on it being realistic,

64
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,960
which I think, if it appears to be realistic, it will be sexy itself.

65
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:05,079
♫ Because I believe in the love that I've found  ♫

66
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,899
♫ No matter how difficult it is ♫

67
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,579
♫ I'm ready to get hurt ♫

68
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,879
♫ And I will make it meaningful ♫

69
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,539
I was thinking about what kind of BL series I would like to make,

70
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:25,700
and I thought about some social issues like

71
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,220
BL novels and BL writers.

72
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,159
I don't understand why people are into BL novels that much.

73
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,260
Go ask your sister. She's a BL writer, isn't she?

74
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,099
The storyline begins with a BL writer

75
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,760
who writes a novel using the characters in the series as the characters in her novel.

76
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:05,579
So I wanted to make a series that touches on this kind of social issue,

77
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:11,820
And then there's shipping (pairing a couple) that everyone likes,

78
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,220
and we try to balance it.

79
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,279
You staying in my room like this,

80
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,940
aren't you afraid you'd fall in love with me just like in the novel?

81
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,280
Practice!

82
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,699
Take it easy. Okay, I'm sorry.

83
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:46,100
- Let's do this!
- Man up! I'm sorry.

84
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,059
There are many difficult parts in this series.

85
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:04,379
The first part is about the actors because the script contains two main couples.

86
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:09,599
And the hardest part is having to balance those two main couples

87
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,599
without focusing more on either one.

88
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,259
And there are a lot of actors, so I always considered about making the audience

89
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:25,700
remember the differences among the characters in each scene.

90
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,979
It's challenging.

91
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,819
Another difficult part is the script,

92
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:34,680
and we also have to consider the differences in the market of BL series.

93
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,080
We want WHY R U The Series to be memorable for the audience,

94
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,879
and we want to open a new dimension for BL series.

95
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,359
Working with this group of actors is not hard, but it's not that easy

96
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,799
because most of them are new actors.

97
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,319
For example, Saint has the most experience, but he still needed some adjustments.

98
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,339
For the other actors, after learning the basics of acting with me,

99
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:06,479
they appeared to have improved during filming.

100
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,919
The main problem was remembering the script which they have never experienced before.

101
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,419
The scenes where they had to put a lot of emotions into

102
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:21,359
like sadness, love, or anger affected them.

103
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,819
When they shot one for the first time, for sure, there were some problems

104
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,979
so we tried to adjust in each situation.

105
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,699
But now I'm absolutely sure that each actor has improved,

106
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,299
and they can convey feelings through their eyes more.

107
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,939
I have an appointment with...

108
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,540
With me.

109
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,720
- I have to go.
- Um.

110
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,599
Make up your mind. Will you be in a relationship with my friend?

111
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,999
Because if you don't, maybe you're seeing many girls

112
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,779
or... you are gay!

113
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,680
Gay?

114
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,699
Will a gay do this?

115
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,290
Zon!

116
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,480
Tutor!

117
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,980
I think I am in a Boy's Love novel.

118
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,779
[If they are in a boy's love novel]

119
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,699
I see your novel has my name in it.

120
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,739
How could you do this? How could you pair someone with his foe?

121
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,779
It's just a novel! If you don't believe it could be true, why do you seem serious about it then?

122
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:33,000
I'll make a vow. If the BL stuff that you wrote happens to be what I really feel,

123
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,100
I wish all of your BL stuff would come true.

124
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,059
Who are you? We already got to know the crew.

125
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,739
Now it's time for the main characters.

126
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,119
Let's get to know who Tutor and Fighter are.

127
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,259
Zon and SaiFah.

128
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,919
How would you describe the four main characters when it comes to working?

129
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,219
Saint first. He eats a lot. He has a lot of energy.

130
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,179
Actually, I'd like to describe him as clingy (in a good way).

131
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,599
Everything about him, his eyes, his nose, his lips, every time we shoot.

132
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,419
If I were Zee or Fighter,

133
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,519
I could fall in love with Tutor easily.

134
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,179
Saint is clingy.

135
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,100
I have to admit that Tutor's character was hard to find

136
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,380
because this character has complicated feelings.

137
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,979
It's not like we could choose whoever,

138
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,859
but it needs to be someone who fits this character.

139
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:45,059
And I feel that Tutor and Saint have something in common.

140
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,739
What's wrong with you, Tutor? Are you okay?

141
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,900
Tutor, I think you should accept tutoring Fighter.

142
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,219
But your family is in trouble!

143
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,019
Hello, I'm Saint Suppapong portraying Tutor.

144
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:04,860
Tutor used to be treated like a little prince, but his life changed.

145
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,779
From a little prince to a little prince who has to fight.

146
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:15,980
His family went broke, which made his father, mother, and sister move to another province.

147
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:24,420
It isn't the due date for the payment yet, is it?

148
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,019
You owe my father money,

149
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:33,319
and I'm his son.

150
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,779
So I'll take the money back.

151
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:41,040
I understand, but there are five days left. Right?

152
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,799
Actually, Saint and Tutor are so similar

153
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,119
because both, Saint and Tutor, use their brains to live their lives.

154
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:56,679
But Tutor would keep all his feelings to himself more.

155
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,579
Saint expresses his feelings.

156
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,679
If he likes or loves something, he shows it.

157
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,660
But Tutor is like... he straddles.

158
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:10,740
Sometimes he shows it, sometimes he doesn't.

159
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:32,979
For Zee, he looks like a bad boy and he's goofy sometimes

160
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,119
when he has to get into Fighter's character.

161
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,579
At first, everyone was a little skeptical whether he fit this character or not.

162
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,540
But when Zee came to audition for this character,

163
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,110
I felt that many aspects of Zee were those of Fighter.

164
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,799
When I met Zee for the very first time, he looked worried.

165
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:55,199
After he shot the first scene,

166
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,179
we could say that he could adjust himself very well.

167
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,660
Lately, he has started suggesting his ideas about some scenes.

168
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:10,500
When he works with Saint, we can feel their chemistry. I think this couple is interesting.

169
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:17,180
Do it like this. Yes. Hang in there.

170
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,539
Hello, I'm Zee Pruk Panich portraying Fighter.

171
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:28,590
Fighter's character is someone who doesn't speak his mind,

172
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,610
and he has a wall around him.

173
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,819
Fighter is rich, so he likes solving problems using money.

174
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,070
Fighter often speaks harshly.

175
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:46,010
To make it short, Fighter is not a good person.

176
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,859
When will you stop making fun of me?

177
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,899
It's weird, but Zee also uses his feelings to live his life,

178
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:58,899
but Zee has his own standards as compared to Fighter.

179
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,399
so Zee isn't different from Fighter,

180
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,759
but he needed some adjustments to portray Fighter in the aspect of emotions.

181
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,559
And are you sure that you are seeing Wha because you're comfortable?

182
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,119
And not because you're hiding something?

183
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,710
Hiding something?

184
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,999
What do you think I'm hiding?

185
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:20,659
The truth that... you like men.

186
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,940
What are you talking about?

187
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,140
- You like men.
- Tutor!

188
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,300
You like men.

189
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,919
Why am I feeling weird like this?

190
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,420
For Jimmy,

191
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:37,450
we call him "bean sprout" because he's tall with a small head.

192
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,039
At first, Jimmy was the person we were worried about the most,

193
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,160
but when he started working in front of the camera, he appeared to be so charming.

194
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,039
He could make us smile.

195
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,319
When he works with Tommy, they look so cute.

196
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,899
For Jimmy, like everyone said, the acting coach and the director were both worried about him

197
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:58,890
because Jimmy is new here.

198
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:03,070
He had zero experience.

199
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,139
But when the camera started rolling, he could be so charming and natural.

200
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:12,599
It's like he doesn't think too much, so he can do it flawlessly.

201
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:20,699
I feel like I made the right decision that I wanted him to be SaiFah in the first place even the chance was almost zero.

202
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,720
I'm bored of his handsomeness.

203
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,780
You mean me?

204
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,819
Guys, I have to go.

205
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,979
Are you afraid of me?

206
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,779
I'm not! I'm just annoyed!

207
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:38,739
Hello, I'm Jimmy Karn. Why is my nickname longer than my first name?

208
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,799
I'm Jimmy Karn. Karn Kritsanapan playing as SaiFah.

209
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,719
To describe SaiFah's character,

210
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,219
he's kind of bugging and tricky.

211
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:52,679
When he wants to tease someone, and that person doesn't like it,

212
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,419
the more SaiFah feels fun.

213
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,540
This is SaiFah's character.

214
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,319
What's the matter with you!?

215
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,560
What? You're like a girl in a Korean novel.

216
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,019
What novel? This is real life! Are you crazy?

217
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,580
Why are you panicking?

218
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:13,019
Hello, I'm Tommy Sittichok Pueakpoonpol playing Zon.

219
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,379
How can I describe Zon's character?

220
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,950
The director held an audition for the actors,

221
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:25,210
and my character might be similar to Zon. I'm not sure.

222
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,179
But I got this role.

223
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,879
Tommy really concentrates. He is quite anxious.

224
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,679
But when he started shooting,

225
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,300
he has his own catchphrase which is "I can be Zon every time I'm with Jimmy."

226
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,000
It's like every couple in a BL series,

227
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,239
when they're together, they start loving each other,

228
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,680
and their chemistry would come out when they're together.

229
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,399
Wrong.

230
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,640
Come here. I'll show you how to do it first. Give me your fingers.

231
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,299
Zon's character is a writer of sci-fi novels,

232
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:09,619
so he thinks and imagines beyond the real situation.

233
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:15,719
And the story makes Zon think beyond the situation.

234
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,059
But the difference is that Tommy stays in the present,

235
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,600
and it makes Tommy and Zon stand on both sides with balance

236
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,750
in order to make the characters look more comfortable

237
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,000
and he will be able to reach into his feelings.

238
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,530
Zon!

239
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,640
Tutor!

240
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,860
I think I'm living in the fictional world of a BL novel!

241
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:46,279
I'd say that Zon's character is completely different from my own.

242
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,459
But it's like... after I've played him a lot,

243
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,519
I'm not sure if I have become just like Zon either because we're alike or not.

244
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,299
Maybe Zon and I have something in common. Or maybe I have played Zon so much that I turned out to be just like him.

245
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:06,460
Zon is sort of goofy. He likes to make a peep and cry.

246
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:11,179
He's a writer of sci-fi novels without much luck.

247
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,299
Nobody cares what he does. He's kind of crappy.

248
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,439
And Zon has a younger sister named Zol.

249
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,759
Zol is also a novel writer, but she writes BL.

250
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:28,480
The two of them can't get along very well. They always fight.

251
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,819
But since I made a vow with Zol, my life has changed to be just like what I have said.

252
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:35,500
Zon, you think too much. Let's go back home.

253
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:40,819
But wait! More importantly, your name also appears in my sister's novel.

254
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,179
Hey, Tutor. Do you know what Wha Wha likes?

255
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,779
Tell me honestly,

256
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,139
how could you not know simple things like this?

257
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,200
Have you ever really cared about my friend?

258
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,780
Are you having an argument again?

259
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:01,840
Fighter seems to be interested in Wha Wha... and Tutor loves his friends,

260
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,879
so he thinks that Fighter might not be sincere with her.

261
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:10,980
So Tutor tries to do everything to prove that Fighter is just playing Wha Wha.

262
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,499
To prove whether Fighter is a good person or not.

263
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,480
And he keeps trying to prove it to himself,

264
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,500
that's when he starts to have feelings toward Fighter.

265
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,300
Why are you feeling this way, Tutor?

266
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,959
So Tutor has to consider whether he should use his head or his heart to move forward.

267
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,719
What should he do with this love?

268
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,099
Because one day Tutor started having feeling towards Fighter,

269
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,199
so he has to decide what he should do.

270
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,040
This character is fun. Please stay tuned for Tutor.

271
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:56,099
The story of Fighter is that he doesn't get along well with Tutor.

272
00:19:56,099 --> 00:20:00,459
It's like he doesn't know why he feels irritated or bothered by Tutor.

273
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:05,939
So he tries to find out why.

274
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,710
And one day, Tutor decides to help Fighter with his studies

275
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,180
because Fighter is not doing well in English.

276
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:19,820
That's when Fighter realizes he is sure how he feels toward Tutor.

277
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,940
Hey!

278
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,840
Give me my book!

279
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,580
Give it to me!

280
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,319
Fighter, give me the book.

281
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,679
Hand it over.

282
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:44,199
♫ Maybe it's because love has no answer, I can't really tell ♫

283
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,960
I see your novel has my name in it.

284
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,119
How could you do this? How could you pair someone with his foe?

285
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:55,159
It's just a novel! If you don't believe it could be true, why do you seem serious about it then?

286
00:20:55,159 --> 00:21:00,480
I'll make a vow. If the BL stuff that you wrote happens to be what I really feel,

287
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:07,500
then I wish all of your BL stuff to come true.

288
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:13,119
The one who started the story is Zol,

289
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,499
a popular online writer of BL novels, played by Perth Kavisara.

290
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:22,920
A young lady who is also a new actress.

291
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,379
In the series, Zol is the younger sister of Zon.

292
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,979
She's a first-year student at the university.

293
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,959
She's a BL novel writer

294
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,259
and her older brother also writes novels, but he writes sci-fi stuff.

295
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:40,179
My character writes novels and she's more successful than her brother.

296
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,420
There are more people who read her novels than those of her brother's.

297
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:48,889
And the story begins because Zol saw her own brother when she was about to write a BL novel,

298
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:55,119
and she thinks it can be lovely. She saw their chemistry.

299
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,880
Zol pairs Zon with SaiFah in her novel.

300
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:11,199
So she writes about Zon and SaiFah as well as Tutor and Fighter, all of them in her novel.

301
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,220
So... I saw you and SaiFah.

302
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,719
Hey! About that day. I can explain... It's just the camera angle for sure.

303
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,920
Actually, I was about to punch him. I was about to...

304
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,080
So you might have seen it differently.

305
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:36,000
Talking about other characters, there are more.

306
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,120
Ouch. Are you confused yet? I can't catch up.

307
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,010
So, let's meet more of the actors.

308
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,599
Hello, I'm ToyToy Thanapat Chanakulpisan playing as Zen.

309
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:54,320
Zen's character is someone who always comforts Zon.

310
00:22:54,320 --> 00:23:00,559
Zon is always teased by friends, and it's only me who stands beside him.

311
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:07,679
But actually, I don't know about Zen's feelings towards Zon either.

312
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,739
ACTION!

313
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,400
I want to thank you.

314
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:15,100
Wait, Zon...

315
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,980
Hey! It's okay, I understand.

316
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,680
Our school can't have only BL couples!

317
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:33,500
Hello, I'm Tonnam Piamchon Damrongsuntornchai playing as Natee.

318
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,860
Why are you so cute? What's wrong with you?

319
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,819
Soft cheeks...

320
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:48,200
Natee, in this series, likes to bug people.

321
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,479
He loves his friends.

322
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:53,200
Actually, he likes to tease his friends because he wants his friends to be happy.

323
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,399
He wants to create a fun atmosphere among his friends.

324
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,120
But sometimes, the timing of his jokes is just inappropriate.

325
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,819
For example, when they have a problem, and I put myself in the middle of it at the wrong time.

326
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,739
He's quite different from me because I am quite gentle.

327
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:09,519
When I play as Natee, it's quite hard for me.

328
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,160
When it comes to Natee's love story, he also has his own.

329
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:20,179
Natee is in love with Zol who is the younger sister of his best friend, Zon.

330
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,379
Natee has been trying to hit on Zol for a long time.

331
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:28,439
No matter where she goes, Natee always follows her.

332
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,080
Although I'm not free, my heart wants to see you.

333
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,759
What's the matter?

334
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,080
Something... about my heart.

335
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:44,620
My life has changed since I made a vow with my sister.

336
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,029
Hello, guys.

337
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:53,619
We'd like to invite all of you to be in a faculty's prince competition.

338
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,020
Yes!

339
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:58,999
See? This is exactly the plot in the BL novel!

340
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,340
Hey... your foe is coming.

341
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:06,619
My name is Poppy, Ratchapong Anomakiti playing as Junior Kia Roo.

342
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:13,899
This character is funny, brash. He's also crappy and sort of like a troll.

343
00:25:13,899 --> 00:25:16,899
He's moved from another university. Actually, he should be a 4th-year student.

344
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:20,099
He's not a successful person.

345
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,679
He's not serious with anything.

346
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,119
He only goes to school to see his friends.

347
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,519
It's normal because his grades are this low.

348
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,380
If I were his parent, I would give him severe punishment.

349
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,580
What would you do then?

350
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,839
I would trample him over and over again.

351
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:35,379
You bad son! You ungrateful child!

352
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,719
A person like you wouldn't prosper, Zon!

353
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:44,519
Another dream of Junior is winning Soda's heart.

354
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,959
To be honest, I'm a very popular person.

355
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,479
Every woman in this school likes me, but I refuse.

356
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,819
I want only Soda,

357
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:58,139
so I have to refuse every woman at school who cries because they couldn't win my heart.

358
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,800
Eventually, I have to fight only for Soda.

359
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,259
Are you serious, Soda?

360
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,200
Is this a dream?

361
00:26:06,201 --> 00:26:09,560
Ouch. It's real.

362
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,560
I will have a chance to go out with Soda!

363
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:20,819
Soda usually deceives me into persuading Zon to be in the Music Club

364
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:25,100
and to perform on stage for the university.

365
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,859
So I try to do everything to persuade Zon.

366
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,479
Let's see how Junior deals with it.

367
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,379
This isn't easy anymore.

368
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:39,600
Zon and SaiFah have to sing together on Open House Day no matter what!

369
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,880
I really don't want to do it. I'm sorry.

370
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,599
Zon, my best friend. I'm begging you.

371
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,220
Don't embarrass me any more than this. Please accept it.

372
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:55,279
Hello, I'm Park Panupat Anomakiti playing Japan.

373
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,279
I'm a 4th-year student and a member of the soccer club.

374
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,399
And I'm also the vice president of the club.

375
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,339
This character is quite strict and fierce

376
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,460
because the boys in the club are lame.

377
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,879
About being in the team, we have to wait for more people, and we'll talk about it later.

378
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,039
Thanks, guys.

379
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:16,019
But I dislike someone. Tanthai.

380
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:20,259
Whenever I see him, I feel offended as if he were a tick.

381
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,159
It annoys me. I don't like him.

382
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,839
But we have to stay tuned to see how the story of the two of us goes.

383
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,500
But I'd say, I'll be hard on you, Tanthai.

384
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,979
Hello, I'm Seng Wichai Saefan. I'm a member of the soccer club.

385
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,239
I'm a substitute in the team,

386
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:40,279
and I have the ambition to be an on-ground player.

387
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,999
My friends are Zon, Zen, Natee, Junior.

388
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,619
When I'm in the football club, there's someone called Japan or something.

389
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:54,010
He likes to tease and bug me all the time.

390
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,420
I don't know how to get back at him.

391
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:02,299
Please stay tuned to see whether it will be Tanthai-Japan or Japan-Tanthai.

392
00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:04,899
I couldn't find my bag. I don't know where I put it.

393
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,239
I'd like to tell you something too. What?

394
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,359
I've heard you the first time.

395
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:20,159
Hello, I'm Mark Sorntast Bua-ngam playing as Champ, a senior.

396
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,919
Champ is the president of the soccer club. He's a 4th-year student.

397
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:32,939
In the series, Champ is quite strict as he's the president.

398
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,579
Champ is a senior and the club president.

399
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:46,259
He gets pressure from everyone, like his friends or the boys in the club.

400
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,499
The boy who he gives advice to the most is Blue.

401
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:58,019
Blue is always teased by Champ's friend, Dew.

402
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,819
And Champ has to comfort Blue.

403
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:04,379
I don't know how the story goes. Please stay tuned.

404
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:09,499
And someone might be wondering if Champ has his own partner or not.

405
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,079
Please stay tuned for WHY R U The Series.

406
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,379
He's just a boy.

407
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,520
- But he meant to...
- He didn't mean to! Calm down!

408
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:25,619
Hello, I'm Max, Saran Rujeerattanaworapan. R needs a... tsk. Oh no.

409
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:29,439
I play as Dew in WHY R U The Series.

410
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,239
Dew's character is harsh.

411
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,299
We can say he's the meanest person.

412
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,619
He likes to tease and bug people.

413
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,140
There's a boy that I feel irritated with.

414
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,399
Hmm, not irritated, but I like making fun of him.

415
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:47,219
That's Blue.

416
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,159
And in the series, I will tease Blue a lot.

417
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:55,219
And after teasing him for quite some time, one may realize Blue is lovely in his eyes.

418
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:00,919
If you want to know more, please say tuned for WHY R U The Series.

419
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:03,219
Can you be strong?

420
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:09,919
Honestly, you came to my club because you wanted to seduce everyone, right?

421
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,509
Hello, I'm Nat Natasitt Uarekkasit

422
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:17,799
and I play Blue. Blue is a 1st-year student.

423
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,679
I think I'm the youngest one in WHY R U The Series.

424
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:27,119
Blue is a determined person.

425
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:33,180
Blue decided to join the soccer club in order to find out more about it.

426
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,180
He just wants to know how it is.

427
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,680
I don't know if he kicked the ball or he just touched it.

428
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,459
Really? Don't insult me.

429
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,659
Wait for the series. Let's see how I will be.

430
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:53,279
After he joined the soccer team, it's like Blue is the weakest person in the group.

431
00:30:53,280 --> 00:31:01,320
Please stay tuned for WHY R U The Series.

432

♫ It feels like I'm falling into a hole like in a dream ♫

434
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,820
Hello, I'm Janis Janistar

435
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,379
and I play Wha Wha in WHY R U The Series.

436
00:31:22,379 --> 00:31:28,410
Her character is nothing...

437
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,580
but beautiful.

438
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:40,000
There are only a few women in the series, so I have to be... beautiful.

439
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,579
Okay! Get back to work. Wha Wha loves her friends.

440
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,440
And she lacks warmth and affection

441
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,559
because her family is rich,

442
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,879
but her parents don't give her much love and attention.

443
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,259
Her story is a little bit confusing

444
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:05,840
because she has Tutor as her best friend.

445
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,920
And she likes a senior named Fighter.

446
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:15,880
Fighter has a crush on Tutor, that's why it's confusing.

447
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:22,180
As I'm Tutor's best friend, it's quite painful.

448
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,520
Hello!

449
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,860
Tutor, I can't go with you today.

450
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,539
I have a date with...

451
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:31,180
With me.

452
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,799
- I have to go.
- Uhm.

453
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,539
I want you guys to stay tuned.

454
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:44,700
How hurt I will be, how dramatic it will be, and how comedic it can be.

455
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,560

459
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,799
Day likes to color his friends' life.

460
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:12,840
Day likes to show his charisma.

461
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:17,119
Day is Tutor and SaiFah's best friend.

Day has a crush on Tutor's best friend Wha Wha.

465
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:32,100
Please stay tuned for WHY R U The Series.

466
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,519
We've filmed so many scenes,

467
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:44,860
let's see which scenes are the actors' favorites.

468
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,399
My favorite scene... I like...

469
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:53,179
I like the scene that we shot at the music club.

470
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:59,160
The reason why I like that scene is that I like how the room was decorated.

471
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:04,519
There are a lot of posters, drums, and musical instruments.

472
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:06,320
It's like the room in my dream.

473
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,009
And I played the guitar in that scene with Tommy.

474
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:14,720
It's so perfect, so it's my favorite scene.

475
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:22,920
♫ Please, someone in heaven, please tell me.
This kind of scenario ♫

476
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,540
♫ That is what people call love, right? Is this love?
And if this is love ♫

477
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,960
My favorite scene is the scene where I played the guitar with Jimmy.

478
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,419
Actually, I like singing and playing musical instruments.

479
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:42,620
So I feel happy when I do so, even though I had to act as if I couldn't play.

480
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:51,779
Let's see how someone who can play the guitar acts like someone who can't.

481
00:34:51,780 --> 00:35:00,099
This is how you should play it,

482
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:05,050
Working with the seniors... actually, there are many people.

483
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:10,039
But the ones who I got close with, and we had to act together were mom and dad

484
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:15,600
Mom is Lukkade Metinee, and Dad is Jab Penpetch

485
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:22,059
At first, I was so nervous being in the same scene with them.

486
00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:25,399
Lukkade has slender eyes and a fierce face.

487
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:31,619
But after working with her, I realized she's so nice and friendly.

488
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:36,260
She's friendly and that makes me comfortable.

489
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:45,239
But let me tell you... your dad was the hottest musician

490
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,219
and that's the reason why I hit on him.

491
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:52,040
I'm so glad that everyone, whom we reached out to, accepted this work.

492
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:59,559
Lukkade has to play as Tommy and Perth's mom or Zon and Zol.

493
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:05,720
Lukkade accepted the role at once, and she's glad to be a part of this series.

494
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,419
She wants to support BL series and LGBT.

495
00:36:08,419 --> 00:36:10,600
And Jab as well.

496
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,270
Jab and Lukkade have never worked with each other before,

497
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,540
so I think we'll create new chemistry.

498
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,179
Oh! Willy is fantastic!

499
00:36:26,179 --> 00:36:29,860
I was also nervous working with Willy.

500
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:34,420
He expressed intense emotions, and the script requires that I don't cry.

501
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:38,459
I could express my feelings, but without crying.

502
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:44,740
When Willy conveyed emotions, I couldn't help but tear up.

503
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:47,780
That scene was so beautiful, and I have to thank Willy a lot.

504
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:58,360
My favorite scene is the scene we filmed at the beach.

505
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,900
I felt that it was realistic, and it's like we actually traveled together.

506
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,080
I want everyone to see this scene.

507
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:25,060
We went to Krabi because we wanted to have a beautiful set.

508
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:30,160
Saint and Zee had a chance to share our ideas about the scenes.

509
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,399
We helped plan the scenes and told the director and the producer. We want it to be the best.

510
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,900
I want everyone to enjoy our beach scenes and other scenes.

511
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,560
We arrived there, and everything was just so beautiful.

512
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,159
About the love scene, right?

513
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:52,339
Actually, I'm a shy person.

514
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:56,720
So it took a lot of time to shoot.

515
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,580
I was so shy that I had to discuss it with Saint.

516
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:04,519
After shooting many times, I felt more relaxed.

517
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:08,240
We've discussed how we should go about some scenes.

518
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,170
We've kissed so many times that I'm used to it right now.

519
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:19,520
♫ Please, someone in heaven, please tell me.

WHY R U The Series can be considered one of the series having the most OST.
