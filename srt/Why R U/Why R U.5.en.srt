Comfortable what, Bro?

00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,910
Sleeping on my lap, was it nice?

4
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,770
It's not. You leaned on me first.

5
00:02:24,647 --> 00:02:26,107
Are you sure?

6
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,430
Why do I have your shirt? Take it back.

7
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:56,990

We went to leave something in the room and then the door...

It's a long story... May we leave, please?

- Ah, get home safe.
- Thank you.

Yes, get home safe.

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,880
Well, well, nobody did.

166
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,520
Let's make a truce. Okay? Then, what should it be?

167
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,580
What should friends be like?

168
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,750
Good job! But where is the smile?

169
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,640
Smiling, eyes' expression, love.

170
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,420
Smile, cute!

171
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,899
This is the key to the acoustic club's room. Do you know how to go there?

172
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:13,480
I think there's nobody around there. I have talked to the club president.

173
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,180
So, you two have to keep it.

174
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,919
Yep!

175
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,470
Then, feel free to do whatever!

176
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:23,150
I will send you the pictures later.

177
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,160
Bye-bye. That's cute.

178
00:18:41,634 --> 00:18:43,594
Are you ready to learn to play the guitar?

179
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,840
It's not right!

180
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,780
Not right!

181
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,640
Not right! Not right! Not right! Not right!

182
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,140
I give up.

183
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,480
Hey, hang on!

184
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,430
Hold on.

185
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:21,540
Play the C chord. I will assist you.

186
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,880
Uh, press it.

187
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,000
Too hard.

188
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,799
Yeah, it feels like that the first time.

189
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,460
You will get used to it soon.

190
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,400
Yeah, two! Three!

191
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,360
Four! Get it?

192
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,900
- Got it?
- Yep.

193
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,200
Have a try by yourself.

194
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,720
Not right!

195
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,840
Can you show me one song? I want to know.

196
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,840
Sure!

197
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,079
One, two, three!

198
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:13,520
♪ It's true even though it's strange.
This should not be happening to me ♪

199
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:23,700
♪ It's a too sudden love. But no matter how
I rethink about it, it must be you ♪

200
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,080
♪ You are the only one I'm waiting for ♪

201
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,780
It's your turn.

202
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,460
Why do you have to show off that much? Do you really need to tap the guitar like that?

203
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,140
- I got carried away.
- You should play it simple. I can't even play a basic thing.

204
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,620
Perhaps, it's because I don't have that small piece.

205
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,340
Guitar pick? Yeah... It makes playing the guitar easier.

206
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:50,860
If you want to buy one, you may have to go to Siam or the music shops.

207
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,399
Okay, I will buy it later.

208
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,720
Okay, here we go. I will help you first.

209
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,540
Put your fingers here, here, and here. Like this, do the same.

210
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,380
I'm going to teach you how to strum.

211
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:20,000
One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four.

212
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,310
I have to go now.

213
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:02,100
The last van leaves at 8:00 p.m.

214
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:17,350
♫ I never thought that I could ever love you ♫

215
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:26,240
♫ Just thinking about it, my heart throbs ♫

216
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:44,640

217
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,750
♫ How many reasons are there that make
people love each other? ♫

219
00:22:54,410 --> 00:23:00,850
♫ Or did I already love you from the beginning? ♫

220
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:24,710
♫ I wonder what makes me love you ♫

221
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:28,300
♫ Or was it when our eyes met, you then bewitched me? ♫

♫ Or did I already love you from the beginning? ♫

227
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,800
Hwahwa.

228
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,710
Oh, Tutor.

229
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,659
Do you have any problems? Why did you call me?

230
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,499
Yes, I have something to consult with you about.

231
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,290
But it is an old topic.

232
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:23,280
I am not sure if you are tired of hearing about it or not.

233
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,070
Is it about Fighter?

234
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,720
Yes.

235
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,779
I just feel that he is weird with me.

236
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,650
He doesn't care about anything.

237
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,640
I mean, he doesn't care about me.

238
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,910
And he called me.

239
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:47,880
He told me that he has an important thing to talk about with me.

240
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:51,520
I'm afraid that he might break up with me.

241
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,160
I don't know what I should do.

242
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,370
You should calm down.

243
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:02,020
It probably won't be as you think.

244
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,510
Who knows?

245
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:09,320
It might be exactly what I'm thinking.

246
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,720
What should I do?

247
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,100
I've confessed to him already.

248
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,960
Hwahwa...

249
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:39,580
If I tell you something, can you promise me that you won't get mad?

250
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,440
What is it?

251
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,500
You can tell me everything. I promise.

252
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,210
Do you remember when you asked me

253
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,840
to look for Fight on your birthday?

254
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,960
You looked for me, so what's wrong?

255
00:26:14,022 --> 00:26:16,290
Fight, why did you call me?

256
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,960
Are we going somewhere?

257
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,740
I just wanted to invite you for dinner.

258
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,380
Actually, you can tell me that via LINE.

259
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,340
It is not necessary to look for me.

260
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:33,980
Tutor, when will you teach me English?

261
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,120
Did you agree to teach him?

262
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,840
Yeah.

263
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,040
Tutor, thank you...

264
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,370
for heeding my request.

265
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:51,600
It's fine, you asked me many times.

266
00:26:52,470 --> 00:27:01,420
Also, he asked me himself as well.

267
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:07,264
Do you want to start a war with me?

268
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,720
Please, respect your tutor.

269
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,360
Wait. Wait. Wait, you guys.

270
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,900
Tutoring hasn't even started yet, do please don't fight.

271
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,030
I think I should go now. I'll see you later.

272
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,220
Later. Bye.

273
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:44,090
Are we having dinner now?

274
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,690
Yeah.

275
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,230
Hey!

276
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:26,251
Fighter, why are you here at my condo?

277
00:28:26,253 --> 00:28:31,053
I really want to know, Tutor. What did you tell Hwa?

278
00:28:31,053 --> 00:28:34,420
I think I'm trying to be good to you.

279
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,430
What else do you need me to do?

280
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:41,709
You are trying to be nice because you are trying to hide the truth, right?

281
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,000
No, I'm not.

282
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,170
I'm trying to fix my own problem. That's why I asked you not to tell anyone.

283
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,290
How will you fix it?

284
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,010
Are you going to tell Hwa that you kissed me?

285
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,050
I forgot that you really don't care about anything.

286
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,010
I care!

287
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:15,270
I just don't want others to misunderstand.

288
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:24,800
I will not tell Hwa that you kissed me,

289
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,630
but it doesn't mean I understand you.

290
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:31,070
About Hwahwa,

291
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,390
don't play with her feelings.

292
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:41,410
If you don't have feelings for her, tell her.

293
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:48,270
It's my problem. I will fix it.

294
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:52,370
You call that fixing your own problem? You just invited her to dinner!

295
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:55,770
Do you think I really just invited her to dinner?

296
00:29:55,770 --> 00:30:02,670
Are you really asking? Do you not understand what I'm trying to do?

297
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,250
Can I back-out of teaching you?

298
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:17,570
Please, respect your students.

299
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:54,190
Hey! Saifah, why did you come here?

300
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,869
I'm going to buy a guitar string. What about you?

301
00:30:56,869 --> 00:30:59,130
To buy a pick.

302
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,990
Can I go with you?

303
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:04,970
May I? Please!

304
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:08,180
Why can't I go with you?

305
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,290
Why are you mumbling?

306
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:12,850
I think I didn't say that.

307
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:15,080
Are we going now?

308
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,890
Together?

309
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:29,080
W-H-Y A-R-E Y-O-U.

310
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,610
Why must it be you?

311
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,650
Because of love, right?

312
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:39,789
Fighter, how will you pass English I and English II?

313
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:43,690
What do I have to do? I am not good at this.

314
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:47,830
If you are not good at it, you should improve yourself.

315
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:51,230
You have to focus. One day, you will be good at it.

316
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:57,430
Then you tell Hwahwa that you don't want to teach me.

317
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,130
I don't want to teach you.

318
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,910
Why do you think I want to study with you? I don't either.

319
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:07,410
Hwahwa asked me to study with you, so that's why I came.

320
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,930
Do you have any other choice?

321
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,590
Let's just focus.

322
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,070
Fighter.

323
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,680
Fighter.

324
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,550
Fighter.

325
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,930
Please focus more.

326
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,760
Why do you have to be so insistent?

327
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:45,610
Even if I just sit here, you will be paid.

328
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:49,350
Fight, do you know what I hate the most when teaching?

329
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:54,190
Someone who doesn't focus like you.

330
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:03,880
Listen to me. This is the last time I will teach you.

331
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,870
I will stop being your tutor.

332
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:09,790
Okay. Do you think I wanted to study with you? I don't.

333
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,590
This is your salary for today.

334
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,230
Fighter.

335
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,690
Keep it!

336
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:34,170
- Tutor.
- Why are you bothering me?

337
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:36,949
I don't have a key card. How can I go down?

338
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,310
The door doesn't use a key card.

339
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:05,830
It's just a pick. Why is it so expensive?

340
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,309
Keep it.

341
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,829
I know...

342
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:13,470
You will keep it in your wallet, won't you? It might get lost.

343
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,290
When you pick a card, it might fall.

344
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,390
Then, where should I keep it?

345
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:21,270
Make it as a bracelet.

346
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:32,590
Um, then do it for me. Won't you?

347
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:37,710
I don't... have any equipment.

348
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:44,030
I will take you to the shop.

349
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:51,300
♫ We used to walk past each other ♫

350
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,000
♫ We knew each other, but treated each other like strangers ♫

351
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,790
♫ I didn't like you at all ♫

352
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:04,750
♫ I couldn't even imagine being close to you ♫

353
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:11,290
♫ Thinking about it again ♫

354
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:15,560
♫ It was like there was a magic spell cast upon us ♫

355
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,990
♫ and we got closer ♫

356
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:28,290
♫ I never thought that I could ever love you ♫

357
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,990
♫ Just thinking about it, my heart throbs ♫

358
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:43,090
♫ I wonder what makes me love you ♫

359
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:47,500
♫ Or was it when our eyes met, you then bewitched me? ♫

360
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:52,200
♫ How is it possible that you are the one? ♫

361
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,390
♫ I can't figure it out, I was standing still
then you suddenly came into my life ♫

362
00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:01,150
♫ How many reasons are there that make
people love each other? ♫

363
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:05,730
♫ The more I think, the more my head aches
The more I think, the scarier it is ♫

364
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:12,690
♫ Or did I already love you from the beginning? ♫

365
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,130
♫ I liked you, but it wasn't true ♫

366
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:23,120
♫ Why did I eventually fall for you? ♫

367
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:26,890
♫ I liked you, but it wasn't true ♫

368
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:31,840
♫ Why did I eventually fall for you? ♫

369
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,660
♫ I liked you, but it wasn't true ♫

370
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:40,630
♫ If it's not... ♫

371
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:44,250
♫ I liked you, but it wasn't true ♫

372
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,930
♫ Why did I eventually fall for you? ♫

373
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,810
Mission complete!!

374
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,950
Okay. I will do it in my room.

375
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,550
Thank you.

376
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:05,720
Actually, you are a good person, I guess.

377
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,710
I hated you for a long time.

378
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:12,670
Actually, I have been a good person for a long time;

379
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:17,930
moreover, I am handsome too.

380
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,250
Disgusting!!

381
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,580
How long do you think you've worked?

382
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:57,990
Hello, Kae, Bung. I'm sorry. I am late.

383
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:02,700
Don't worry, Tutor. Put on the uniform first.

384
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,170
Yes.

385
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,240
I pity him.

386
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,770
Kae, he has to work and study at the same time.

387
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:15,070
He looks so tired, doesn't he?

388
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:19,590
Yes, he might be tired but, this is life.

389
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:22,230
It can turn around.

390
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:27,060
Yes. He looks like a rich person.

391
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,570
His skin, his face, it all looks good.

392
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:33,900
Don't you know that he has a financial problem?

393
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:37,170
His family went bankrupt. His father disappeared.

394
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:40,290
His mother has to be a housemaid in the up-country,

395
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:45,710
and he has to work to support himself and find the money to pay off debt.

396
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:48,470
I don't know why he is so pitiful. His life is so troubled.

397
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:50,960
It's like a fiction novel.

398
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:58,270
Do you remember the new shop on the main street which has been opened for 2 months?

399
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:01,549
Why are there so many people there?

400
00:39:01,549 --> 00:39:04,389
On the other hand, there are fewer people here.

401
00:39:04,389 --> 00:39:06,469
Wow.

402
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,989
I don't know what I should do.

403
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:16,269
You have to tell him that your partner wants to lay off the part-time staff.

404
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:21,090
I would like to tell him, but I pity him.

405
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:23,350
I don't know what I should do.

406
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,610
This time, he won't survive.

407
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:34,109
- Bung, you should go now.
- Where do I have to go?

408
00:39:34,109 --> 00:39:36,070
Go to work!

409
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:39,170
Forget it. I am going now.

410
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,669
I will save the part-time staff then fire you instead. Go!

411
00:39:42,669 --> 00:39:45,830
I am going now!!

412
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:54,910
May I help you with anything else?

413
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,969
It is all good!

414
00:39:57,969 --> 00:40:02,310
Then I am going now. Goodbye. Goodbye.

415
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,530
- Kae.
- Tutor

416
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,920
You first.

417
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,870
- Tutor, you first.
- Kae, you first!

418
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,760
- Tutor, you first.
- Kae, you first!

419
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,850
- Tutor, you first.
- Kae, you first!

420
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,490
- Tutor, you first.
- Kae, you first!

421
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:26,270
- Tutor, you first.
- Kae, you first!

422
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,450
Stop!!

423
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,270
Tell him then.

424
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,950
Get home safe.

425
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:40,650
I understand if you have to fire me.

426
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:45,910
I heard you guys talking.

427
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:48,670
Hey! You talked too loudly.

428
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:51,129
No, I didn't...

429
00:40:51,129 --> 00:40:53,050
You are so annoying!

430
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,040
You don't have to go,

431
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:00,230
but we need to only decrease the workday.

432
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:03,930
Do you understand me? It is also my hard decision.

433
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,150
I understand. Whatever suits you best.

434
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:13,749
Then if I have a part-time job, I will tell you.

435
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:16,670
Okay. Then I will go. Goodbye.

436
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,790
Keep on fighting.

437
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,430
Thank you.

438
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:48,030
Hi, Japan!

439
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,110
What's wrong?

440
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:53,960
Now, Zon and Saifah are playing guitar together.

441
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,080
I came to call on your promise.

442
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:01,930
As I heard, it isn't because of you.

443
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:04,130
Why isn't it because of me?

444
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:06,990
I asked him for that...

445
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:11,569
I said no. It means no.

446
00:43:11,569 --> 00:43:15,430
Japan, don't prank me.

447
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:17,630
You have already promised me.

448
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:22,240
When did I promise you?

449
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,020
You are dreaming!

450
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:27,450
Japan, please accept me.

451
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:29,100
Please.

452
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:33,500
Please.

453
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,290
I said no!

454
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:36,970
Please.

455
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:48,350
Pity me, please.

456
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:54,660
I said no. It means no.

457
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,470
Stop touching me. I don't like it.

458
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:04,570
Are you shy?

459
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:06,810
Who is shy?

460
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:11,150
Japan, wait for me.

461
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:39,510
Damn! What did you do?

462
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,830
You are so dead!

463
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:48,390
You are so dead!

464
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:52,990
- Hapless! Come back.
- Let's go back home. Go.

465
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:03,880
What did you do?

466
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:08,930
Did you wet my clothes? Did you wet my clothes?

467
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:15,170
Dew!!!

468
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,060
Calm down. He is so young.

469
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,610
- But he understands.
- He is so young.

470
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:24,990
Do you understand, right?

471
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:27,470
Back off!

472
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:42,690
Boom, come here. Let me see your wound.

473
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:58,450
Are you hurt?

474
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,589
No, I am not. It's just a scrape.

475
00:46:01,589 --> 00:46:06,120
But I think you might be hurt.

476
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,750
Don't forget to use some medicine.

477
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:09,529
Yes, sure.

478
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,310
Then you come here.

479
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:19,169
Before I leave, I have a mission for the both of you.

480
00:46:19,169 --> 00:46:21,530
What mission?

481
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:25,110
Actually, I didn't want to use this rule.

482
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:32,690
From now on, both of you are buddies.

483
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:38,380
When you are in the club or joining the club's activities,

484
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:40,890
you guys have to take care of each other.

485
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:44,950
I hope you will understand.

486
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:49,370
I understand.

487
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,410
It is good that you understand.

488
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:20,010
I just accepted others. If I want more, I'll contact you.

489
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:23,190
I'm so sorry, our position isn't available. There isn't a policy to recruit.

490
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:28,090
You are not suitable for a job like this. It might be for the next time.

491
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:31,550
I'm not accepting more staff. I am sorry.

492
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:33,940
Tutor.

493
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:39,860
Don't worry.

494
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:50,190
You will soon get over it.

495
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:58,430
Won't you?

496
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:02,790
Don't worry about it.

497
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,790
Meowwww.

498
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,530
Meowww.

499
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:48,350
Meowww.

500
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:52,050
Don't be silly. When did you get here?

501
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:55,150
Just a few minutes ago. I'm sorry for waking you up.

502
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:56,749
What time is it?

503
00:50:56,749 --> 00:50:59,370
It's around 7:00 p.m.

504
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:02,910
What about your bus? When does it stop operating?

505
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:04,770
At 9:00 p.m.

506
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,570
At 9:00 p.m.

507
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,870
Why were you in a hurry the other day?

508
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,990
It was just 8:00 p.m.

509
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:18,370
I… I had an appointment with my mom.

510
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:19,870
Uh, an appointment with your mom.

511
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:23,750
What about you? Why are you late?

512
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:26,909
The professor asked me to help. Sorry.

513
00:51:26,909 --> 00:51:31,889
Actually, you can go back home at 6:00 p.m., can't you?

514
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:35,230
Why did you wait for me?

515
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:37,210
Well...

516
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:42,720
I wanted to wait for you.

517
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:48,090
Or can't I?

518
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:51,730
You can.

519
00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:54,490
I'm just kidding.

520
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:09,970
What about my pick? Have you done it yet?

521
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:11,590
What pick?

522
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:15,430
The pick that I asked you to turn into a bracelet.

523
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:19,830
I forgot it.

524
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:23,630
Never mind, tomorrow I will give it to you.

525
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,140
No.

526
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:29,190
Then I will go to your room.

527
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:31,070
I'm afraid you might forget it again.

528
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:33,750
Go now?

529
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,790
Let's go. Go. Let's go together.

530
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:39,669
Let's go. Hurry!! Don't forget your bag.

531
00:52:39,669 --> 00:52:41,170
Hurry!

532
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:45,010
Zon, hurry. Let's go.

533
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:48,530
- Saifah, wait. Wait!
- Let's go.

534
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:50,930
What did you say?

535
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:52,830
Let's go together.

536
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:54,429
Do you not understand?

537
00:52:54,429 --> 00:52:57,369
Damn, are you equivocated?

538
00:52:57,369 --> 00:53:02,169
This is the real you. You're not the character from the fiction, are you?

539
00:53:02,169 --> 00:53:03,730
Why do you like to make me confused?

540
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:06,350
How do I confuse you?

541
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:09,290
Why do you hear what I say?

542
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:11,410
I just talked to myself.

543
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:16,450
Damn, I think I won't go to your room.

544
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:18,490
Wait, wait, wait.

545
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:21,249
I saw you confused by what I said.

546
00:53:21,249 --> 00:53:23,129
You were thinking it over, weren't you?

547
00:53:23,129 --> 00:53:25,770
You look like the lost.

548
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,710
protagonist of Korean fiction.

549
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:35,270
Fiction! What is fiction?

550
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:41,589
If I didn't se your face right now, I would think you were acting.

551
00:53:41,589 --> 00:53:44,190
Why? Am I showing off?

552
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:49,069
If you attended acting class, you would be great.

553
00:53:49,069 --> 00:53:50,230
Saifah!!!

554
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:54,009
Then, will you go or not? Or are you scared?

555
00:53:54,009 --> 00:53:56,490
Who is scared? I'm not.

556
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:58,790
If you aren't, then go.

557
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:08,810
Calm down, Zon. Fiction isn't real.

558
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:11,630
Wait for me, Saifah!!

559
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:20,950
Rain is coming down.

560
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:26,350
It is a popular scene in Yaoi fiction.

561
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:32,050
Then, I have to jump into this fiction. Right?

562
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:40,610
Saifah, you are so suitable to be a male protagonist in Yaoi fiction.

563
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,420
If you are the male protagonist,

564
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,930
I am a female protagonist, am I not?

565
00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:56,050
I stumbled again.

566
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:58,880
Why do I easily fall when I am with you?

567
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,130
♫ Because I believe in the love that I've found  ♫

♫ No matter how difficult it is ♫

569
00:55:10,606 --> 00:55:13,426
I will be kissed by you, right?

570
00:55:13,426 --> 00:55:17,250
Zon, my shirt is already wet.

571
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:23,890
Weren't you going to kiss me?

572
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:27,970
Kiss... No! Never! Let's go.

[Next Episode]
What did you do?

585
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:37,810
What??

586
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:39,410
Kiss...

587
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:44,609
I do not want to fight with you today. I am tired...

588
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:47,370
Can you teach me English again?

589
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:51,169
Are you shy?

590
00:56:51,169 --> 00:56:53,909
Who is shy? No, I'm not.

591
00:56:53,909 --> 00:56:56,310
If you aren't then take off your shirt.

592
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:01,950
What are you doing, Tutor?
