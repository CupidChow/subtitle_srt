00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,620
[The beach.]

165
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:13,540
[Na… Na… Let's go to the beach… ]

166
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,280
[Just the two of us?]

167
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,839
[We can invite Fighter with us. He's really sad right now. ]

168
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:26,009
[Okay. Okay.]

169
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:30,020
[But you… you're sleeping with me.]

170
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:41,980
[What the heck is wrong with you? We can talk about it later. ]

171
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:04,000
Such nice weather, Sai, take a look at that.

172
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:14,470
Looking at you in this weather is such a nice thing.

173
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:21,590
Why am I getting shy just by holding hands?

174
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,990
Playing at the beach, just the two of us...

175
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,000
We get to take a picture together.

176
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,880
We get to look at the stars together..

177
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,030
And we will get to sleep together.

178
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,380
Sai, what are you doing?

179
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,869
Zon, are you ready?

180
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:31,010
Don't tell me...!!!

181
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,030
Are you nervous?

182
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,939
A little.

183
00:25:10,939 --> 00:25:13,810
I've never won a competition that I've been in.

184
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,990
Keep fighting!

185
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:25,899
No matter what, I and the others will be down there to cheer for you and the team!

186
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:30,110
Japan, fighting. Japan, fighting!

187
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,990
Thank you.

188
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,649
And you, too.

189
00:25:36,649 --> 00:25:39,069
Next year, you need to get on the active roster as a real player, okay?

190
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,020
I'll be waiting to see it happen.

191
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,330
Yes, Sir.

192
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:49,810
Even if this year I don't get a chance to be a real player on the field,

193
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:55,290
all I ask for...

194
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:58,190
...is that I will be someone's real significant other?

195
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,290
What the hell are you talking about?

196
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,309
Come on.

197
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,740
Anyway, come back with that trophy.

198
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,119
Because, if you can do it…

199
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,550
I have a reward for you.

200
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,240
A reward? What reward?

201
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,440
If you want to know...

202
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,940
you have to win first.

203
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:16,349
Japan, Fighting. Japan, Fighting. Japan, Fighting.

204
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,779
Okay?

205
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:21,360
- Fighting.
- Fighting.

206
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,419
Oh, Dew.

207
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,360
Here, for you.

208
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,880
Why didn't you go home yet?

209
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,340
Well. I came here to practice more.

210
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,940
So I can be as good as the others.

211
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,520
You're so dedicated.

212
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,320
What's wrong?

213
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:06,920
These days, I feel exhausted.

214
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,729
If there's something about soccer

215
00:28:11,729 --> 00:28:15,269
and if you'd like me to help, please tell me right away!

216
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,109
It's because you're such a nice kid like this

217
00:28:19,109 --> 00:28:21,079
that people like to tease you.

218
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:22,830
I can tell you right away

219
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:26,880
that, in the entire team, you're the only person who teases me.

220
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,519
Talking like that will get you in trouble.

221
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:31,020
You didn't learn your lesson, huh?

222
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,360
Don't make yourself so scary.

223
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,489
Why do you like soccer?

224
00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:40,820
When I was a little kid,

225
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,730
my father took me to watch a soccer game.

226
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:47,640
It was the first time I saw the soccer players on the field.

227
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,220
And it was such an inspiration to me.

228
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,719
I thought, "One day, I'll be just like them!"

229
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:55,129
But it's like they say, I'm really small.

230
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:58,980
So, it's really hard for me to compete with others.

231
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,650
But... you know? Who cares. It doesn't matter.

232
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,510
The sky's beautiful today, isn't it?

233
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,800
It really is beautiful.

234
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,740
Let me rest here for a little bit, okay? I'm really tired.

235
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,599
What's wrong?

236
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,849
Nothing.

237
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,940
We're here.

238
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,650
Thank you for walking me home.

239
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,540
It's all good.

240
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,660
This way, I'll be familiar with your house.

241
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,730
Yes.

242
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:37,010
Then... I'm going to go ahead and go inside.

243
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,110
So... I'm… I'm really going to go inside now.

244
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:01,240
You're not going to come in?

245
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:47,570
♫ I keep telling myself, over and over again,
that there is no you in my heart ♫

246
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:51,030
But this picture can never get out, Fight!

247
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,320
Who would I let see this?

248
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,780
I'm possessive to death of what is mine!

249
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:00,649
- Fight, what's the matter with you?
- I'm possessive of what's mine!

250
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:03,800
No, Fight.

251
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:07,740
♫ That's all I can do ♫

252
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:13,419
♫ Telling myself, all day and night ♫

253
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:22,960
♫ But why is my heart in pain like this? ♫

254
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:30,440
♫ Every time I see you, I can't stand it ♫

255
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:35,899
♫ Finally, I have to admit ♫

256
00:32:35,899 --> 00:32:40,790
♫ That I have only you in my heart ♫

257
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:48,909
♫ Because I can't stop thinking about you at all ♫

258
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:58,329
♫ Even my head... tells me not to love you ♫

259
00:32:58,329 --> 00:33:02,819
♫ But my heart doesn't follow it ♫

260
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:11,560
♫ Inside me, it's telling me that I love you ♫

261
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,430
Fight. Fight?

262
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:34,159
Fight! What's wrong with you? Why didn't you attend the meeting?

263
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,610
You're like Tutor.

264
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,419
How?

265
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:47,170
He's like you.

266
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:49,349
But he is even worse than you.

267
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:52,110
His face looks pale.

268
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,850
I don't know what happened.

269
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,960
Where have you seen him?

270
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,190
I just saw him in front of the faculty building.

271
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,410
What's wrong with you?

272
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:42,420
Are you okay?

273
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:45,080
Why are you here?

274
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,600
I followed you.

275
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,210
You look pale.

276
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:57,150
Have you had enough rest?

277
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,900
I have to go now.

278
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,750
Wait, Tutor.

279
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,569
Can you stop doing something else?

280
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:13,630
Now you have to take care of yourself.

281
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,819
You're burning up, Tutor.

282
00:35:18,819 --> 00:35:22,110
I'm not. I just got some sun.

283
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:24,800
You'd better go to the hospital with me.

284
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,590
Fight.

285
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:32,860
Look.

286
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,460
Can you stop being stubborn?

287
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,600
I'm going to go back to my place.

288
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,960
I'll drive you there then.

289
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,129
I'm begging you.

290
00:35:51,129 --> 00:35:54,599
Let me take care of you until you get better.

291
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:56,750
Maybe only today.

292
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,010
Please.

293
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,090
Let's go.

294
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,710
Fight, what are you doing?

295
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,400
I'm taking advantage of you.

296
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:04,730
I'll give you a sponge bath.

297
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:01,229
You stay still

298
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,900
and I'll take care of it.

299
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:52,170
Your heart is beating so fast.

300
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,570
My heart is beating so fast, too.

301
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,500
Comfortable?

302
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:23,390
You'd better get some rest.

303
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,310
Fight.

304
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:34,670
Fight, can you not go yet?

305
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,099
You miss me, right?

306
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,650
Are you asking for tender loving care?

307
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:47,330
Fight, please stay with Tutor for a while.

308
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:25,790
[Tutor]

309
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,520
[Zon: How are you, Tutor?]

310
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,499
[Zon: You are sick because you think too much about Fight, right?]

311
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:16,429
[Zon: Can I make a suggestion?]

312
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:20,660
[Zon: I think you should talk to Fight about his father.]

313
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:26,810
[You can find a better solution than this.]

314
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:05,080
Fight.

315
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:13,950
Fight.

316
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:19,840
Fight.

317
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:32,319
[Fighter: Get well soon, Tutor]

318
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:39,409
[Fighter: If you need anything, let me know]

319
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:43,020
[Fighter: But I'm going back for today...]

320
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:46,550
[I'm sorry if I make you feel uncomfortable]

321
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:02,169
What's the matter with you!?

322
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:03,670
Why are you in a foul mood?

323
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:07,320
Don't you really know... what you've done?

324
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:13,670
That boy can't stand it so much that he had to tell you, right?

325
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:17,670
You admited it sooner than I expected.

326
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,299
Let me ask you honestly.

327
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:23,610
How happy are you with what you've done, Pa?

328
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:26,660
Since that Tutor boy came into your life, you've changed so much.

329
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,789
Who has changed!?

330
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:33,029
I'm still the same person, who likes to argue

331
00:47:33,029 --> 00:47:35,749
but always listened to you.

332
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:38,160
But what you've done this time...

333
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,540
was too much that I can't take it.

334
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,919
All that I do is only for your future.

335
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:52,790
Future?

336
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:59,410
It's only for the future of your business.

337
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:03,110
You are so damn selfish!

338
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,290
Do not insult me about everything I do for you!

339
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:11,379
Understand?

340
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,840
You've done for me?

341
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:18,049
Have you ever asked me once

342
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:21,649
if I liked it or not?

343
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:27,890
Everything I've done was for your future.

344
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:29,719
So your future won't be compromised.

345
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,720
And so what?

346
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,820
Look at me right now.

347
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:37,199
Do I look happy or not?

348
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,540
Or did you...

349
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:42,879
want me to be like this?

350
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,830
Whatever you feel right now, you will get over it soon.

351
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:47,620
Your future is more important.

352
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,709
It's your future.

353
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:54,380
Do it! Hit me!

354
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,960
Do it! Hit me!

355
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:00,960
I'm not good enough for you.

356
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,459
I could never please you unless I obeyed you.

357
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,970
I have to do what you want me to do.

358
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,120
Let me ask you honestly.

359
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,670
Why?

360
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:23,350
Why do you have to control my life?

361
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:26,070
Especially this kind of thing!

362
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,159
Because... in the future...

363
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,269
you have to have a family. You have to have status.

364
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:38,659
You have to inherit my business.

365
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:39,849
Business!

366
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:41,449
You only talk about business!

367
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:45,679
And how can you be sure that the love between you and that Tutor boy will last!? Huh!?

368
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:50,280
As I've seen, homosexual love is not steady.

369
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,210
And how can you be sure

370
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:54,249
that your heterosexual love is steady!?

371
00:49:54,249 --> 00:49:55,999
My mom left you!

372
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,290
She left you for another man!

373
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,109
Let me ask you honestly.

374
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:03,750
How can you judge other people's love?

375
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:25,520
I'm begging you.

376
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:34,110
I've followed your way enough already.

377
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,970
Please, let me be happy in my own way.

378
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:48,330
I'm begging you.

379
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:16,040
About this... can I make my own decision?

380
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:19,840
If it turns out bad,

381
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:23,220
I'll take care of it by myself.

382
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:28,760
I am asking for my life back, Pa.

383
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:17,360
Tutor!

384
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:21,810
Tutor!

385
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,799
We can talk here.

386
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,519
I have to go see Sai right after.

387
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,210
I want to see if you want to go to the beach.

388
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:54,090
I want to tell you... everything about the novel.

389
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,090
We write it on our own.

390
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:01,990
It happened by force right, Zon.

391
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:07,390
But inside Zol's novel...

392
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,599
my partner and I have a happy ending.

393
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,739
But your couple, Tutor...

394
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:19,500
Aren't we writing it ourselves?

395
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:21,910
That's okay, Zon.

396
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:27,540
Are you sure about your decision?

397
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:32,330
I know that you love Fight very much.

398
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,849
I think that sometimes if we spoil ourselves too much,

399
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:41,810
it may hurt other people, Zon.

400
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:46,760
In my opinion, you can stand up and fight better than this.

401
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,770
You love him so much that you ignore your own feelings.

402
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:57,039
Fighting, Tutor.

403
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,810
I'm rooting for you.

404
00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:02,709
Thank you, Zon.

405
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:06,539
So are you going to the beach with us?

406
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,500
Well, I…

407
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,240
You're not allowed to say no.

408
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,110
Come with us so you can relax.

409
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:19,550
Well... Is Saifah going, too?

410
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:21,520
I'm not going to be your third wheel, right?

411
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,760
What third wheel? We're all friends here.

412
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,890
Plus, Sai told me to invite you.

413
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:28,320
You think too much. Come with us.

414
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,250
Well.

415
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:32,800
All right.

416
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,789
Okay, I'm off then. I have an appointment with Sai.

417
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:37,670
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye

418
00:54:41,339 --> 00:54:43,340
I forgot. I thought the door was left open.

419
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,649
Good luck.

420
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,650
Walk carefully.

421
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,179
Zon, you will sleep downstairs.

422
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:49,600
And, Tutor,

423
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,600
your room is upstairs.

424
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,299
Tutor, are you okay?

425
00:55:55,299 --> 00:55:59,999
I'm okay. I'm not all right because you keep asking.

426
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,949
Well, sorry.

427
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:10,960
Zon, I'm sleeping with you. Okay?

428
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:13,500
I know!

429
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,900
- You repeat it many times.
- Okay.

430
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:17,730
Fight!

431

♫ Please, someone in heaven, please tell me ♫

432
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:35,450
♫ This kind of scenario ♫

433
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:40,900
♫ That's what people call love, right? Is this love?
And if this is love ♫

[Next Episode]
I still feel uneasy about your father.

435
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:46,770
Tutor, you're my happiness.

436
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:49,950
Let's go back and be each other happiness.

437
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:54,540
You have music in your heart and don't you want me inside your heart, too?

438
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:57,279
Are you going to play guitar till morning?

439
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,070
All right, we can go to bed.

440
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:02,929
Are you sure?

441
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:04,410
Yes, I am.

442
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:11,110
I'm going to take back what was mine.
