1
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,150
What's wrong?

2
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,050
I don't want to be far away from you.

3
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,770
Can I sleep over at your condo?

4
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,949
Please. Please!

5
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,530
Fight.

6
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,509
You've been with me for like 4-5 days. Don't I ever bore you?

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,309
Nope.

8
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,910
And I'll never get bored.

9
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,869
Common, don't be a cry baby.

10
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,269
Absence makes the heart grow fonder, Fight.

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,630
You know?

12
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,189
Hey, look at your face!

13
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,510
Why?

14
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,090
Okay, fine.

15
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,719
I'm leaving then. Thank you.

16
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,370
I'm going now.

17
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,369
Drive safely.

18
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,110
- I'll call you tonight.
- Okay.

19
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,590
Bye-bye.

20
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,730
Can I kiss you one more time?

21
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,849
Boo!

22
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,789
- Tutor!
- Open the trunk for me.

23
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,930
See you.

24
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,109
You're going to get it!

25
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:12,909
♫ Having you makes me feel ♫

26
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:17,209
♫ My feelings have been changed ♫

27
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,390
Fighter.

28
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,589
- Thank you.
- Bye.

29
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:36,950
♫ You make the days that pass by meaningful every day ♫

30
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:45,129
♫ They have no meaning without you here by my side ♫

31
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:50,950
♫ Having you here is more than enough ♫

32
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,950
Thank you, Fight.

33
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:09,050
♫ I don't even know why ♫

34
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:13,949
♫ You're not like anyone I've met before ♫

35
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:18,809
♫ I'm always worried about you ♫

36
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,789
♫ Because my heart has only you ♫

37
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:28,709
♫ I've never thought you'd make me fall in love ♫

38
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:33,589
♫ I've never thought it would be you ♫

39
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:38,469
♫ Who put me be under your spell, falling in love with you ♫

40
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:46,450
♫ Making my heart fly like this is enough ♫

41
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,890
How do I pronounce this one, darling?

42
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,010
Fight.

43
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,150
Don't call me like this. I'm not used to it.

44
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,770
How about this? Are you used to it now?

45
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,469
Not yet.

46
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:27,790
But if you do it often, and I happen to get used to it, you'll be sorry.

47
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,830
Fight.

48
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,149
Then I'll kiss you in many spots.

49
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,549
So you won't get used to it.

50
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,269
Hey!

51
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:48,570
Didn't you say that love isn't about that thing?

52
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,589
It's because you're cute, Tutor.

53
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,629
After we came back from the beach,

54
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,890
I don't want to be far away from you!

55
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,950
Me either.

56
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,989
Come on. Let's focus on studying first.

57
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,729
- Fight.
- What?

58
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,820
Focus on studying first.

59
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,730
Let's foc.us on it first

60
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,329
Tutor stay still!

61
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,690
Focus on studying first, Fight.

62
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,149
You stay still first!

63
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,600
Fight! Fight!

64
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,429
- What? What? What?
- Others will see.

65
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,389
Who will see?

66
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,250
Hey, Fight!

67
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,049
Hello, Uncle.

68
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,269
Hi.

69
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,210
Are you guys studying a book?

70
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:15,090
Hey, Fighter! Please dress properly!

71
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,770
You need to button it up right, even when you're at home.

72
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,830
Okay, Dad.

73
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:38,570
Okay, okay. I just heard a weird sound and I thought there was no one home.

74
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,050
Okay, Dad.

75
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,809
I'll leave you guys alone.

76
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,210
Okay.

77
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,789
Fight, what are you playing!

78
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,890
Let's focus on studying right now.

79
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,629
I said, focus on it.

80
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,849
No more playing.

81
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,110
And button it up nicely.

82
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,950
Tutor.

83
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:46,809
Sorry, Uncle. What can I do for you?

84
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:54,190
I'm just curious because I've never seen my son bring someone in the house like this before.

85
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,490
I think it's because I'm here to tutor him, right?

86
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,669
I don't think so. He seems strange.

87
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,669
He doesn't look the same. Don't you think so?

88
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,490
Strange how?

89
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,330
I can't explain it as well.

90
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,389
Can you just watch over him for me?

91
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:23,130
I want him to be back as my same old son.

92
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:29,650
From what I've seen, Fight seems happy.

93
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,869
He's not.

94
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,429
My son, I know him well.

95
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,789
I'm afraid that he might have done the wrong things.

96
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,270
Okay.

97
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,570
Thank you, Tutor.

98
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,809
Okay, Uncle. I'm going to bed now.

99
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,850
Good night, Uncle.

100
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,230
Tutor.

101
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,400
Are you overthinking?

102
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,150
How can I not be overthinking?

103
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:35,289
Fight, let's be serious.

104
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,570
Do we have to be like this?

105
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,249
We've come this far, Tutor.

106
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,090
I'll find a way for us to be together and stay happy.

107
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,650
Are we already in a relationship?

108
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,570
What do you think?

109
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:04,730
Are you in serious mode with me again, huh?

110
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,370
Fight, I know...

111
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:13,310
how we both feel.

112
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,150
But I'm still worried about it anyway.

113
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:20,570
I'm even more worried about your dad issue.

114
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,030
I understand you, Tutor.

115
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,310
I'm worried, too.

116
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,390
And what should we do then?

117
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,410
I don't know as well.

118
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:47,069
But what I know is that I love you.

119
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,059
- Fight.
- Are we clear?

120
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,160
I'm being serious.

121
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,170
Let's do our best for today, Tutor.

122
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,470
This is our moment.

123
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,810
I'm being your koala bear for you.

124
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,170
Doesn't this warm you enough?

125
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,369
All right, Mr. Bear.

126
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,750
You're really good at being cringy.

127
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,629
Because normally you're the one who's cringy to me.

128
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,580
Can it not be my turn to be cringy back?

129
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,569
- Haven't hit it yet.
- No.

130
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:41,130
Don't move.

131
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:02,490
But today, you can only hug me.

132
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,169
Because today I'll hug the bear for the whole night.

133
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,510
Okay?

134
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,480
- Let's lay back nicely.
- Okay.

135
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:23,300
♫ You are the beautiful love that lights up my day
when I have no one left ♫

136
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:28,390
♫ You are my greatest love ♫

137
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:38,770
♫ You are the reality that keeps my heart warm all the time ♫

138
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,189
- What's wrong?
- Your heart is beating fast.

139
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:52,189
Let's lay yourself down nicely.

140
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,790
Hurry up!

141
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:57,090
Okay, I'll lay down nicely.

142
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,770
[Your son is intimate with a friend of my child. Can you explain this, please?]

143
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:03,790
[Did you ever think to tell me about this, Tutor?]

144
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,859
[I was about to tell you, actually.]

145
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,980
[You were? It's funny though, Tutor.]

146
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,029
[Calm down, Hwahwa, I'll tell you my reasons.]

147
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:31,620
[I think we need a serious talk, Tutor.]

148
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,449
[Hwahwa, where are you? Let's talk face to face.]

149
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,410
[This evening, I will send you the location.]

150
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,540
Fight.

151
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,420
Can you come to me?

152
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,430
All right. See you then.

153
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:57,079
[2 Days Ago]

154
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,329
Noon, let's practice this question first.

155
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:02,630
- And I'll check the answer.
- Okay.

156
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,630
Hello, Fight.

157
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,900
Have I ever bailed on you?

158
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,569
But that photo is not good, Fight. I think the face is not bright.

159
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:14,879
I miss you.

160
00:17:14,879 --> 00:17:18,050
Tutor, why are you not focusing on teaching me?

161
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,619
I'm sorry, Noon. I was talking about some errands.

162
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,149
Are you already seeing someone?

163
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,019
What are you asking me?

164
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,370
I want to know. Can't I ask about it?

165
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,889
Sure, you can. But you have to focus on your studying first.

166
00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:35,619
If you're good at studying, you will get someone nice.

167
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,899
Like you?

168
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,490
I think I need to go to the toilet.

169
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,339
How many did you do?

170
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,349
Well, I'm finished.

171
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,120
Whoah! Good job.

172
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,800
Are you okay, Tutor?

173
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:55,139
I have never shown this to anyone.

174
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,089
I trust you.

175
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:01,339
But this photo, Hwahwa is the one who sent it.

176
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:12,110
And are you okay?

177
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,320
I want you to come with me to see her.

178
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,940
Please.

179
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,330
Fine.

180
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,320
But she is already dating someone else.

181
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,090
But this is not right.

182
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,000
We both haven't told her about this.

183
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:47,530
I know that we trust each other.

184
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,949
But when I date someone,

185
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,090
I want to date with happiness.

186
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,990
Come with me, please.

187
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,220
I understand you now.

188
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,150
Are you doing well, Fight?

189
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,860
Quite well.

190
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,850
I should not have asked you.

191
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,150
I can see it on your face...

192
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,150
that you're doing well.

193
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,670
You went to the beach,

194
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,190
you must be really happy. Right?

195
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,910
Tutor.

196
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,080
Let me ask you seriously.

197
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,940
When were you going to tell me about this?

198
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,850
Or... did you ever think to tell me about it at all?

199
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,910
It's not like that, Hwahwa.

200
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,230
I planned to tell you after coming back from the beach.

201
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,069
Really?

202
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,220
Yes.

203
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,119
He really cares about you.

204
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:39,729
Shut up, Fight!

205
00:21:39,729 --> 00:21:41,850
I didn't ask you.

206
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,310
Well...

207
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,030
I'm sorry, Hwahwa.

208
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,300
Actually, I'm no longer mad at you.

209
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,850
Somehow we're best friends, right?

210
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,290
We are.

211
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,540
I respect your decisions, no matter what.

212
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,970
But back to you, Fight.

213
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,369
I still have doubts about one thing.

214
00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:32,129
Do you still remember the question I'd asked you before?

215
00:22:32,129 --> 00:22:34,429
At that time...

216
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:37,240
Why did you play with my feelings?

217
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,770
I do, I do remember.

218
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,210
If you do remember...

219
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,320
then you must already have an answer, right?

220
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,169
I think I do.

221
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,280
Then I just hope

222
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,620
that your answer

223
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,189
will be obvious enough

224
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,350
not make my friend sad.

225
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,400
Tutor.

226
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,909
I'm so hungry

227
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,909
and I haven't talked to you for many days.

228
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,910
We...

229
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,940
Can we go have dinner, just the two of us?

230
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,770
Well, I haven't seen you in many days.

231
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:54,110
There're a lot of things to ask.

232
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:55,680
Please.

233
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,920
Sure.

234
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,520
Fight, I'll go have dinner with Hwahwa.

235
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,900
You should go back now.

236
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,420
Then I'll call you tonight.

237
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,239
Yes.

238
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,320
Shall we go now?

239
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,770
Let's go.

240
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,320
Tutor.

241
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,370
What?

242
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,389
Since when?

243
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:31,210
Tell me. Tell me!

244
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,440
Let's go have some dinner.

245
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,370
Hello, Uncle.

246
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,130
Please come inside.

247
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,680
Uncle, here is your coffee.

248
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,570
Thank you so much. Have a seat.

249
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,520
Thank you, Sir.

250
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,829
I already know everything. Between you and Fight.

251
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,030
Yes, Sir.

252
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:16,239
I hope you can understand me.

253
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:20,090
Fight is my only child.

254
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,260
It's not wrong for me

255
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:27,650
to want to see him with a stable family and cute children.

256
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,000
Right, Tutor?

257
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,749
No, Uncle, it's not wrong.

258
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,260
But...

259
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,540
What if...

260
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,340
What's going on (between us) right now,

261
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,070
is Fight's happiness. Right?

262
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,900
But I'm not happy with it.

263
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:55,530
My family's happiness is to see him with a regular family in the future.

264
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,019
I have been Fighter's father my entire life.

265
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:03,190
Why wouldn't I know what he wants the most?

266
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,850
Tutor.

267
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,670
I only hope you can understand me.

268
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,350
I would like you to stay away from him.

269
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,539
I hope you understand my family

270
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:23,740
and do not tell Fight about this.

271
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,590
Uncle.

272
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:39,639
I think maybe you should talk to fight first.

273
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,610
You know my son's behavior well.

274
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,460
If you love him,

275
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,399
please stay away from him.

276
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,810
I beg you.

277
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,200
Or...

278
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,320
You can tell me how much money you need?

279
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,230
Excuse me, Uncle.

280
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:25,090
If what you told me...

281
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,580
is for the sake of your family's happiness,

282
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:34,010
I will try to do it.

283
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,100
Regarding money,

284
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,590
no, thank you, Sir.

285
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,650
If you don't have anything else,

286
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,660
excuse me. I'm leaving.

287
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,190
Goodbye.

288
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,750
You know my son's behavior well.

289
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,120
If you love him,

290
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,760
please stay away from him. I beg you.

291
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,930
Fighter, it's your name.

292
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,350
This doesn't mean my name.

293
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:21,769
It means you, because you are a fighter.

294
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,670
Morning kiss.

295
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,230
I promise

296
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:56,430
that I will never let go of your hand.

297
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,050
You're exaggerating, Fight.

298
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:00,050
I really mean it.

299
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,350
Unless you are

300
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:06,429
the one who asks me to let go of your hands.

301
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,210
Is there something you wanted to say?

302
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,650
As I am part of the LGBTQ+,

303
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:47,340
I would like to tell you one thing.

304
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,890
For you to judge a couple's

305
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:54,270
happiness and unhappiness by gender,

306
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,720
I would like you to rethink it.

307
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:03,210
If you're going to talk about this,

308
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:06,220
it's my family matter.

309
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,640
Yes, Sir.

310
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,459
Yes.

311
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,250
You can judge however you like.

312
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:18,760
As long as it's not your son's love.

313
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,910
You have no right to judge others.

314
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,840
What generation are we in now?

315
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,990
Nowadays, our world is more open.

316
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:36,820
There are many happy couples out there.

317
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,450
Do you know?

318
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,890
What makes you an unhappy person...

319
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:50,230
is your way of thinking.

320
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:55,520
Because you are close-minded and not willing to listen.

321
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,100
Are you done talking?

322
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:06,000
Do you... ever want to see your son's happiness?

323
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,720
Have you ever asked him?

324
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:20,440
Excuse me, I'm leaving.

325
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,760
Poor Tutor.

326
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,600
That's all I can do to help you.

327
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,830
Tutor.

328
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,930
I don't know what you have been going through,

329
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:28,079
but I want to tell you one thing.

330
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,970
Don't let others tell you what to do.

331
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,070
Yes, Sir.

332
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:39,410
Just like when we bake a cake.

333
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,270
For cake decorations,

334
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:44,659
you can decorate it however you like.

335
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,940
It's your choice.

336
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,160
But once you start to decorate it,

337
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,310
you pay attention.

338
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:54,909
Slowly, you put your heart into it.

339
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:57,900
And, Tutor, you work hard to design it.

340
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,580
Using your happiness as a base for it.

341
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,439
Your cake will turn out perfect

342
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,840
and as beautiful as you want.

343
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:11,889
But if you already have a design for a cake,

344
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:14,749
start doing and stopping,

345
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,419
even though you finish it,

346
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,020
you take a look at the cake and you think it just looks okay.

347
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:23,720
As time passes by, the design will start to fade.

348
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,760
Tutor, you understand what I'm saying. Right?

349
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,790
I understand, Sir.

350
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,999
- But I—
- Tutor.

351
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:41,360
I want you to think about what I just said.

352
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:45,860
I'm very confident.

353
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,090
that you will get through it.

354
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,250
Yes, Sir.

355
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,780
Tutor.

356
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,929
Why didn't you answer my call last night?

357
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:26,819
I called you ten times this morning

358
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,940
but you didn't answer.

359
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,200
Is everything okay?

360
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,940
It's nothing.

361
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,440
I'm just stressed out.

362
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,360
What's wrong with you, Tutor?

363
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,820
I'm okay.

364
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:52,040
I think... I should go to class.

365
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,020
It's getting late. I'll call you later.

366
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,740
Are you sure you're all right?

367
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,280
Are you all right, Tutor?

368
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,389
You look stressed out.

369
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,949
Well, if you feel uneasy, you can tell me anything.

370
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,610
I know.

371
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,940
Zon.

372
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,610
I already did "it" with Fight.

373
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,130
What?

374
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,010
You...

375
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:09,110
You did "it" with Fight?!

376
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,330
You mean....

377
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,930
Yes, it is what you are thinking.

378
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,810
Shit!

379
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:23,710
Am I in a boy's love novel? Really?

380
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,050
What did you just say?

381
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,769
Tutor.

382
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:37,699
I think... you and I are actually in a boy's love novel.

383
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:42,120
What makes you say that?

384
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,579
Saifah... and I...

385
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:50,400
Saifah???

386
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:55,439
It's not like you and Fight... But we're...

387
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,449
I was...

388
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,289
I know.

389
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:02,090
You're confused.

390
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,299
But in my opinion,

391
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,919
I think both of us

392
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:09,789
might really be in a boy's love novel.

393
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:14,539
Because... there are a lot of things happening right now, Zon.

394
00:39:14,539 --> 00:39:17,050
What should we do?

395
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,920
I think...

396
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,529
Zon, you should follow your heart.

397
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:28,990
If you think about something, or you want to do something,

398
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:31,290
or you feel about something,

399
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,660
you should just do it.

400
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:38,860
Have you ever heard about "the law of gravity"?

401
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:44,050
It means you will be like what you think.

402
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:49,429
Well. You're good at giving me advice.

403
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,780
But what about yourself, Tutor?

404
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,420
My situation...

405
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:02,380
needs to follow my head rather than my heart.

406
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,399
Tutor.

407
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,209
If you feel uneasy,

408
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:20,030
you can tell me anything.

409
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:23,869
But if you don't want to tell me now, it's okay.

410
00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:27,540
My story just started when I met Fight,

411
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,020
the one that Hwahwa asked me to teach.

412
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:34,110
Do you remember Hwahwa?

413
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:08,400
You're burning up.

414
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,330
Sai.

415
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:32,000
I'm going home now.

416
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,069
Can you... not go back home?

417
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,960
I'm begging you.

418
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,580
Stay here tonight, please.

419
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,570
Please.

420
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,050
But I have one condition.

421
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:23,260
Don't let me catch a cold from you.

422
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,260
Okay.

423
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,650
Open your mouth.

424
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:14,780
One more.

425
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:18,470
One more, come on.

426
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:21,419
Why not? Just one more.

427
00:45:21,419 --> 00:45:23,809
Why not? Wasn't it yummy?

428
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,919
I don't want to eat anymore.

429
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,430
There is still a lot of rice left.

430
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:37,720
Drink water then.

431
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:44,750
Are you still burning up?

432
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:48,960
Yes, you are.

433
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,720
Thank you.

434
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,300
Open your mouth.

435
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,250
Just go to bed.

436
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,150
Saifah.

437
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:45,400
Get some rest. I'll take care of them myself.

438
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:50,670
♫ I wonder what makes me love you ♫

439
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:54,060
♫ Or was it when our eyes met, you then bewitched me? ♫

440
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:59,100
♫ How is it possible that you are the one? ♫

441
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,740
♫ I can't figure it out, I was standing still
then you suddenly came into my life ♫

442
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:07,910
♫ How many reasons are there that make
people love each other? ♫

443
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:12,640
♫ The more I think, the more my head aches
The more I think, the scarier it is ♫

444
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:19,040
♫ Or did I already love you from the beginning? ♫

445
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,270
You're running a fever. Are you okay?

446
00:47:32,379 --> 00:47:34,039
Yes, I am.

447
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,100
You're burning up.

448
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,640
Please, give me encouragement.

449
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:54,850
♫ Why do I have to love this person? I don't know either ♫

450
00:47:54,850 --> 00:48:01,000
♫ I've never met someone who ♫

451
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,750
♫ Makes me crazy like you ♫

452
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:11,110
♫ Why do I have to love this person? I want to know as well ♫

453
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:14,020
You'll be better soon.

454
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:23,000
♫ The more I think, the more I don't understand ♫

455
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,270
Why don't you talk to me first?

456
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:52,820
Hi. What's up?

457
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:59,449
What's wrong? Why don't you tell me?

458
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:02,220
It's nothing.

459
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:05,679
I'm just exhausted and busy with work.

460
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,300
I already told you to quit your job.

461
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:11,729
Tongta also told you that.

462
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:14,469
If your work makes you be like this,

463
00:49:14,469 --> 00:49:16,919
I'll spank you.

464
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,180
Thank you for your care.

465
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:28,529
If I didn't care about you, who should I care about then?

466
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:02,360
Fight.

467
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:09,200
Do you remember the promise you made to me?

468
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:12,430
Which one?

469
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:15,090
The one you promised me that...

470
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:21,580
if I don't let you go, you won't let me go either.

471
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:30,950
I remember.

472
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,139
What's the matter with you?

473
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:45,070
What are you talking about?

474
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:59,180
Fight, can you just let me go?

475
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:12,260
Do you know what you're talking about?

476
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:17,679
Don't tease me like this.

477
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,660
It's not funny.

478
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:32,630
You already promised me.

479
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,190
Why?

480
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,289
I'm sorry.

481
00:51:40,289 --> 00:51:44,630
Tutor, I'm confused now.

482
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,960
Can you stop acting like you are in a soap opera?

483
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:02,190
A soap opera?

484
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:11,860
You know what?

485
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:15,540
There are many pitiful characters in a soap opera.

486
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:19,600
There is a good person...

487
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:26,600
that nobody understands.

488
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,570
And you know what?

489
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:34,690
I...

490
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:39,250
I freaking hate being like that.

491
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:49,180
Do you know how I feel?

492
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:53,470
Do you know what I have to face?

493
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,700
Do you know how weak I am?

494
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,160
Have you ever known...

495
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:08,870
what I have to confront?

496
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,080
Nobody understands me.

497
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:20,750
Everyone just hurts me.

498
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:25,070
Nobody cares about my feelings.

499
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,169
I... I'm sorry.

500
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:35,960
I...

501
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:42,160
I don't want it to be like this.

502
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,890
Tutor.

503
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:49,380
I don't know what you're talking about,

504
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:59,070
but let me ask you one question.

505
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:04,640
After all this time

506
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:08,560
at the beach,

507
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,970
what were you feeling?

508
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:24,290
Our relationship from the beginning until now,

509
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:32,120
have you ever regretted it?

510
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,640
Enough... Please.

511
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,599
Fight, please have mercy on me.

512
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,370
I can't handle it anymore.

513
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:47,060
Please.

514
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:49,380
I can't handle it anymore, Fight.

515
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:19,530
I understand you now.

516
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:35,000
And I'm sorry...

517
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:38,940
that I made you feel uncomfortable.

518
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:43,660
And you can...

519
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,380
stop crying now.

520
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:57,730
Come on, smile!

521
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:59,820
Stop crying.

522
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,469
♫ I can no longer stop my heart ♫

523
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:07,809
♫ Because inside my heart, it's full of love ♫

524
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:12,319
♫ I loved you from that day, but I have to hide it ♫

525
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:17,809
♫ I loved you from that day, but I have to hide it ♫

526
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:23,259
♫ I can no longer keep these feelings ♫

527
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:29,689
♫ I will tell you how much I love you ♫

528
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:37,870
♫ Even though I'm afraid that it will hurt,
I can't keep it hidden anymore ♫

529
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,870
[Next Episode]
Fight.

530
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,540
Let go!!

531
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:39,669
Everything I've done,

532
00:58:39,669 --> 00:58:42,159
is for the sake of your future.

533
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,970
You're doing it for your future, not mine.
