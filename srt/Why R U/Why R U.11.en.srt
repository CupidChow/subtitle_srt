Hmm? Say it again.

- Yep.

74

Then, should we be in a relationship?

75
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,770

I'm Tutor's boyfriend.

Tutor's boyfriend?

98
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,569

99
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,069
What? Was I just imagining things?

100
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,590
I don't know.

101
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,449
You have to wear this often.

102
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,069
I went out of my way to buy this for you.

I'll wear it every day.

What is it?

109
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,070
Close your eyes first.

110
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,630
- Don't open your eyes.
- Of course.

111
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,389
- Well, get up.
- Get up.

112
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,990
- Beware of the chair.
- Okay.

113
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,269
- Stay still.
- I will.

114
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,070
- Do not open your eyes. Understood?
- Sure.

115
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,430
I'll be gone for a while.

116
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,349
Do not miss me.

117
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,849
Who misses you? No one is missing you.

118

Even if you're gone for an hour, I'm not going to miss you.

119
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,390
Wait here.

120
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,450

Fighter.

122
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,590
It's your name.

123
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,450
This doesn't mean my name.

124
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,289
It means you.

125
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:09,010
Because you're a fighter.

126

Thank you.

129
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,700

- What else?

130
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,729
Carry me, please.

131
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,609
- What's going on with you?
- Up, up, please.

- Well, you're not heavy at all.

139
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:57,909
I'm not that heavy, of course. I'm not a big eater. I'm not good at eating.

140
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,590
Are you sure you know how to ride it?

141
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,169
It's just riding a motorcycle. Come.

Here.

Hey, I'll help you.

149
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:43,710
Is there something that a guy like you can't do?

150
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,449
There's only this thing.

151
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,610
Well...

152
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,970
I don't think there's only this thing.

153
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,530
Because you still need me to teach you English.

154
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,129
Come on, hop on.

155
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:57,630
You're talking too much.

156
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,250
Come.

157
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,000

Fight! What the heck?

165
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,170
Can't I hug you? Hmm?

166
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,769
You can, but, Fight...

167
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,630
What the heck?

168
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,970
Fight!

169
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,870
Others will see.

170
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,670
Apart from traveling here,

171
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,750
are there any other places you want to go?

172
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,369
I don't know as well.

173
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,700
But I like going to the beach.

174
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,800
If that place has a beautiful sea, I want to go there.

175
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:08,489
Well, it would be good. I want to bring Zon, too.

176
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,970
Why do we have to bring him with us?

177
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,850
Because Zon is a funny guy.

178
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,050
Anywhere he goes, there's always laughter.

179
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,889
Am I not funny?

180
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,610
You're not.

181
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,950
Tutor!

182
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:42,350
You know what? When I'm with you,

183
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,630
I'm so freaking happy.

184
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,370
And I promise...

185
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,650
I won't go anywhere.

186
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,789
And I do promise...

187
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:59,550
that I... won't let go of your hand.

188
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,700
You are exaggerating, Fight.

189
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,800
Exaggerating what? I really mean it.

190
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,250
Unless you are...

191
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,010
the one who says to me...

192
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,450
to let go of your hands.

193
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,610
Therefore,

194
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,830
you must never let go of my hands.

195
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,569
Understood, good boy?

196
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,310
Not good.

197
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,750
You're good at everything.

198
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,910
Good at everything.

199
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,740
You're good at "that thing," too.

200
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,270
Shut up, Fight!

201
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,030
You're playing hard to get.

202
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,429
You don't have to scare me.

203
00:15:44,429 --> 00:15:47,270
I'm fine with just one night.

204
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,130
But...

205
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,229
Whenever you're ready, one more time would be fine to.

206
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,410
♫ Please, someone in heaven, please tell me ♫

207
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:07,570
Are you sure?

208
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,649
When you're ready. You can do it?

209
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,609
Fight, stop! Don't play like this, Fight

210
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:18,800
♫ I've never experienced this before. Is this love? ♫

211
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,670
♫ That I'm trembling and out of control ♫

212
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,020
♫ My heart is shaken, is this real? ♫

213
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,530
♫  Who has said that this is love? Is this love? ♫

214
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,950
♫  Is this love? And if this is love ♫

215
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
♫ Please tell me what you feel.
At least, I can make our love happen ♫

216
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,000
Mister.

217
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,970
"Mister" what?

218
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,820
Mister Boyfriend.

219
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:08,250
Who is your boyfriend?

220
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,100
♫ Having you makes me feel like ♫

221
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,460
♫ My feelings have been changed ♫

222
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,690
Fight.

223
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,850
What are you doing, Mister?

224
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,150
I'm recording you.

225
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,730
♫ I won't let us be apart ♫

226
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:29,710
♫ You make the days that pass by ♫

227
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:34,819
Fight, the island is big.

228
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,610
♫ It has no meaning... ♫

229
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,740
My boyfriend is big, too.

230
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,960
Fight. What big, Fight!?

231
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,469
You go into the sea! Go!

232
00:17:46,469 --> 00:17:48,300
If I do, who will you go back home with, Sir?

233
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,780
I can go back alone. You go into the sea!

234
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,060
This island is really big.

235
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,620
You're crazy!

236
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:01,910
♫ Having you makes me feel like ♫

237
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:06,599
♫ My feelings have been changed ♫

238
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:09,439
♫ And I love you more than every day ♫

239
00:18:09,439 --> 00:18:12,130

♫ I won't let us be apart ♫

00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:21,499
♫ You make the days that pass by ♫

242
00:18:21,499 --> 00:18:26,290
♫ Meaningful every day ♫

243
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:31,920
♫ They have no meaning without you hear by my side ♫

244
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:41,170
♫ Having you here is more than enough ♫

245
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,600
Nice weather, Fight.

246
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,390
You should get some rest sometimes.

247
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,120
Peck instead then.

248
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,890
Fight.

249
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,050
We're going snorkeling, right?

250
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,389
We're about to get to the place for snorkeling.

251
00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:21,960
However, we're going to stay on the island tonight.

252
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,320
But I haven't prepared anything.

253
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,839
I've already prepared everything here.

254
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:32,600
You tricky, Fight. Such a planner.

255
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,380
- Hello, Mom.
- Tutor.

256
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,789
Tutor, are you at the beach?

257
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,479
Let me see who you're there with.

258
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,108
Tongta already told me.

259
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:27,239
I'm here with Fight.

260
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:31,139
It's good, son. Follow your heart.

261
00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:31,960
Yes, Mom.

262
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,519
I love you, Tutor.

263
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:35,969
I love you too, Mom.

264
00:21:35,969 --> 00:21:39,340
- I miss you, Mom. Bye.
- Yes.

265
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:00,810
I think I'm going to buy a condominium for you, Tutor.

266
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,870
You don't have to, Mom.

267
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:05,469
I think I can go back and forth from home to school.

268
00:22:05,469 --> 00:22:07,069
A condominium is a waste of money.

269
00:22:07,069 --> 00:22:08,859
Don't overthink it, my boy.

270
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:11,470
You'd better save your energy for studying.

271
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,749
And more importantly, our house is very far from your school.

272
00:22:15,749 --> 00:22:18,760
I don't want you to be tired.

273
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,140
Okay, Mom.

274
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,920
But I'm afraid that when I go to school, I'll miss you, Mom.

275
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,399
My boy loves getting hugged.

276
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:31,599
You're not like your sister at all.

277
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:36,850
She always travels abroad.

278
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:40,099
It's Tongta's lifestyle, Mom.

279
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:44,469
Mom, when Tongta comes back, let's go to the beach.

280
00:22:44,469 --> 00:22:50,459
Sure! You want to go to a Thai beach like Krabi or the Maldives?

281
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:55,940
I think let's go to Krabi. A Thai beach is really beautiful.

282
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,590
- Okay.
- But you have to promise me.

283
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:01,150
- I promise.
- Yeah.

284
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,460
Let me kiss your cheeks.

285
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,010
You're lovely.

286
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,850
Are you okay?

287
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:27,659
I'm okay. I just talked to my mom.

288
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:30,591
I heard it already.

289
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,970
Thank you, Fight, for bringing me here.

290
00:23:43,685 --> 00:23:48,310
I see you're happy, and I'm glad.

291
00:23:49,089 --> 00:23:50,260
Did you have fun today?

292
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,110
I did.

293
00:23:55,326 --> 00:23:56,330
Let's look at the sea.

294
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,850
Okay.

295
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,329
♫ You're the flower in my heart ♫

296
00:24:11,329 --> 00:24:18,039
♫ You're the present. You've made me find the new world ♫

♫ I know how much you mean to me ♫

305
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:34,169
♫ Your smile is not like someone else's ♫

306
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:41,190

317
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,010
The room is beautiful.

318
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:52,160
You are well prepared.

319
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,490
Of course. I'm coming here with a little prince.

320
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,560
I have to make sure it's planned well.

321
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,860
Thank you.

322
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,390
You don't need to thank me all the time.

323
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,260
It's enough to just love me a lot.

324
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,890
What are you doing, Tutor?

325
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,140
Giving you lots of love.

326
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,869
Go. Go take a shower.

327
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,320
Can we take a bath together, hmmn?

328
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,120
What are you saying?

329
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,200
I'm not joking.

330
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,470
I want to take a bath with you.

331
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,740
Are you sure?

332
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,120
I'm sure.

333
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,950
Fight.

334
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,710
Are you sure you want to do this, Tutor?

335
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,240
Instead of the bath,

336
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,460
I think we should change it

337
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,790
to the sauna instead.

338
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,260
Why are you making that face?

339
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,850
I just...

340
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,770
Nothing.

341
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,520
Are you embarrassed by me?

342
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,880
Hey!

343
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:36,020
Will you have to get my answer no matter what?

344
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,310
Are you sure...

345
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,290
you can take it?

346
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,890
So, are you embarrassed by me?

347
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:58,620
Yes.

348
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:02,690
I am... Are you happy now?

349
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:12,300
Yes, I am truly happy.

350
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,000
I am happy.

351
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:20,330
Tutor, what are you doing?

352
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,680
What do you want to do?

353
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,850
Tutor.

354
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,280
I don't want to break my promise to you.

355
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,370
You are not breaking any promise.

356
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,880
I'm the one breaking it.

357
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:28,900
Or if you don't do it...

358
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,820
Tutor will.

359
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,600
I will not stop myself, Tutor.

360
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:58,050
Okay.

361
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,170
I won't be able to take it.

362
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,340
You will do this, right?

363
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,540
I'm so fucking happy.

364
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:46,559
I'm very happy.

365
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,079
You're not allowed to get bored with me, okay?

366
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,739
You're the one who might get tired of me.

367
00:40:53,739 --> 00:40:56,379
No way, not me.

368
00:40:56,379 --> 00:40:58,669
Especially after what happened earlier.

369
00:40:58,669 --> 00:41:01,650
I'm certain I won't get tired of you.

370
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,779
Fight.

371
00:41:05,779 --> 00:41:07,409
Are you shy?

372
00:41:07,409 --> 00:41:09,460
Nope, I'm not.

373
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,689
Yes, you are.

374
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:16,740
No, I'm not shy.

375
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:25,369
When I am with you...

376
00:41:25,369 --> 00:41:28,990
my heart always beats fast.

377
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,550
Do you think you are the only one?

378
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,820
I promise.

379
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,680
I am certain

380
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:45,579
you're the only man that I have feelings for.

381
00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:47,419
No.

382
00:41:47,419 --> 00:41:50,370
Actually, you're the only person who makes me feel this way.

383
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,439
You are like...

384
00:41:55,439 --> 00:41:57,800
a long-awaited dream.

385
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:04,520
Same with me.

386
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:10,000
I might be your dream...

387
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,239
but...

388
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,690
you are my reality.

389
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,779
♫ You're the dream ♫

390
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:24,949
♫ I've been waiting for so long ♫

391
00:42:24,949 --> 00:42:34,149
♫ You're the beautiful love that lights up my lonely day ♫

392
00:42:34,149 --> 00:42:39,409
♫ You're my greatest love ♫

395
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:58,250
Morning kiss.

396
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:10,882
Morning kiss.

397
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:15,450
You sleep like a child.

398
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:19,040
It's because I'm tired.

399
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:24,300
Can I sleep on your shoulder for a while?

400
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,240
Sometimes it feels good to be babied.

401
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:41,450
Tutor.

402
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:44,469
You're good at acting like a baby.

403
00:44:44,469 --> 00:44:48,229
Can't I be polite to you?

404
00:44:48,229 --> 00:44:51,770
No, Fight, I'm not used to it.

405
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,629
I want to stay like this for the next three days.

406
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:09,010
No, we are still students.

407
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:21,660
I'll go get a shower then we will leave for Bangkok, okay?

408
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,850
You're really going?

409
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,270
Can I hold you like this for a while?

410
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:01,179
Stay with me like this.

411
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,680
Then we can go shower together later.

412
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:54,149
♫ I used to keep sleeping alone ♫

413

♫ Secretly thinking about you all day ♫

416
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:12,759
♫ It might be because love doesn't have an answer ♫

417
00:47:12,759 --> 00:47:16,120
- Almost done?
- Yes.

418
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,800
Rinse your mouth.

419
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,100
You're all messy, P'Fight.

- Go.
- Let's go shower, together.

425

Fight!Fight, what are you playing?

426
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,550
What?

427
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:07,210
Fight.

428
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,690
I'm going to tell Hwahwa about us, okay?

429
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:14,100
Hey,

430
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,110
why are you starting a drama?

431
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:23,569
I'm not being dramatic, Fight.

432
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:25,949
Even though Hwahwa and Day are already together,

433
00:48:25,949 --> 00:48:29,070
I still want to tell her about us.

434
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:33,940
Does that mean you are confident

435
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:36,929
about the things between us?

436
00:48:36,929 --> 00:48:38,510
Yeah.

437
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:49,230
Thank you.

438
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:56,329
I am happy... that it is you.

439
00:48:56,329 --> 00:48:59,440
I feel like I have unlocked my feelings, Fight.

440
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:08,340
Thank you.

441
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,000
Yes.

442
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,749
Hey, I have something to show you.

443
00:49:16,749 --> 00:49:18,700
What is it, Fight?

444
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:25,489
Hey, look at this picture. Isn't it cute?

445
00:49:25,489 --> 00:49:27,229
Not really, Fight.

446
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:29,469
This picture looks funny.

447
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:33,309
Take a look at my face; big cheek and double chin.

448
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:35,289
I look fat, Fight.

449
00:49:35,289 --> 00:49:36,990
No.

450
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:42,020
It doesn't matter if no one likes it, but I do.

451
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,020
Super cute.

452
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,590
Okay.

453
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:51,480
As long as Fight like it.

454
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,899
But you can't leak this picture, Fight.

455
00:49:54,899 --> 00:49:57,269
Who am I going to show it to?

456
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:59,680
I'm very protective of what's mine.

457
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:02,259
- Fight!
- Can I?

458
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,749
Fight! Fight, what are you playing at?

459
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:08,520
No more... Fight.

460
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,169
You dare?

461
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:12,539
No, no, Fight.

462
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:15,210
- I want to hug you from behind.
- I won't allow you to hug me.

463
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,750
You're good?

Are you happy?

465
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:40,940
Do you still need to ask?

466
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:45,100
Somehow...

467
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,789
when we are happy,

468
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:49,800
time flies so fast.

469

Don't say it like that, Tutor.

Fight.

Do we still need to prove our feelings?

473
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:12,619
We've come this far, Tutor.

474
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:14,790
What else do we need to prove?

475
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:21,719
All right. Let's go back to Bangkok.

It's not like that, Hwahwa.

491
