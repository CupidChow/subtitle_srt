1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,400
You're acting innocent, only holding hands, huh?

2
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,500
What are you laughing at?

3
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,400
I'm laughing at you.

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,200
Laughing at what you said.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,200
What do you want me to do then?

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,400
Can I touch somewhere else?

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,600
Hey! You have been wanting too much lately!

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,700
Or are these your true colors?

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,600
You don't know me well enough, Tutor.

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,900
You don't know me well enough either.

11
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,900
Stay still!

12
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,400
Stay still! Sit on your hands!

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,900
Well, Tutor, would you like to go to the beach?

14
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,400
What did you say?

15
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,300
Let's go to the beach on Saturday.

16
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,200
Let's try to prove something seriously once.

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,300
Let's try being alone, just the two of us, together.

18
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,600
Ask our hearts first.

19
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,200
And get back to clear our feelings.

20
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,500
This is interesting.

21
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,400
But I want to tell Hwahwa about our story first.

22
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,200
I have cleared everything up with her.

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,200
I knew that I didn't have any feelings for her.

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,800
I told her everything, Tutor.

25
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,600
Tutor,

26
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,000
can you stop talking about someone else for now?

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,800
There are just the two of us together.

28
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,500
Shouldn't we help each other find the answer to be more sure about this?

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,400
Does this mean that you don't believe in me?

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,800
Let's go to the beach, and let's try pretending to be lovers?

31
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,100
If it works, we will go on.

32
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,500
Thank you.

33
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:25,599
I want to prove how I feel too.

34
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,200
Please!

35
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,600
I'm bruised!

36
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,400
Please, hmm?

37
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,400
What did you do?

38
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,700
I just wanted to kiss right here.

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,700
Enough for today.

40
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,800
About something else, we'll do it later at the beach.

41
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,600
Come.

42
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,179
You should leave now.

43
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,400
You'd better leave.

44
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,500
You should leave now.

45
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,000
Thank you so much for today.

46
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,459
About going to the beach, I'll manage everything.

47
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,039
Okay, sure.

48
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,640
- See you.
- Okay.

49
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,300
- Good night.
- Good night.

50
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,600
Get home safely.

51
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,800
- Good night, Tutor.
- Okay.

52
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,200
Bye-bye.

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,300
That's it.

54
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,400
Now I'm going to have a good dream.

55
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,900
Go! Go home.

56
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,400
You'd better leave. Hurry up.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,200
Now!

58
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,700
Okay.

59

[Why R U - The Series]

70
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,500
And then the little one turned into the big one.

71
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,100
So freaking sci-fi.

72
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,300
What are you doing?

73
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,400
Nothing?

74
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,800
Dodgy!

75
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,000
Nothing

76
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,200
I didn't say anything.

77
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,300
Then there's nothing.

78
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,000
Did you do something with my laptop?

79
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,100
Well, shall we go?

80
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,199
Go where?

81
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,000
To your house.

82
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,400
My house?

83
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,500
I think...

84
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,100
My parents will have doubts about this for sure.

85
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,800
Living my life is difficult as usual.

86
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,400
If you go, it would be more difficult.

87
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,700
You're mean.

88
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,100
And about a place to practice the guitar,

89
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,100
I don't have a place to do it.

90
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,800
Do you have to be this cringey?

91
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,600
Is it working though?

92
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,400
A bit.

93
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,000
Please!

94
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,600
Can I sleep with you please?

95
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,800
- What?
- Let me sleep with you.

96
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,400
Should I allow you though?

97
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,000
Just a bit.

98
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,100
Otherwise, I will kiss you.

99
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,200
Hey! You will?

100
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,300
Well, then.

101
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,100
I have a plan in my mind.

102
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
Shall we go now?

103
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,800
Mom, I...

104
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,900
I know everything, Dear.

105
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,800
Zol told me everything.

106
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,600
- You have to perform the musical for the university.
- Hey, Zol!

107
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,400
Please do not blame your sister.

108
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,000
Because she told me so,

109
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and I wanted to know when you were going to tell me about this.

110
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,900
Well, your mom wanted to see Saifah's face,

111
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,300
and what he looked like from what Zol told her.

112
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,400
What did she tell you?

113
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:36,700
It was just that you have to perform with Saifah,

114
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,100
who is your imagined (BL) partner.

115
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,600
What's about that!

116
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,000
She just made it up.

117
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,300
Aren't you guys mad at me

118
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,200
for spending time practicing the song with Saifah?

119
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,300
We thought that we might get mad at first,

120
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,200
but I have heard you singing a song in the shower.

121
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,400
Your voice was quite good actually.

122
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:02,200
So I thought that you should allow yourself to try something new.

123
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,790
Maybe you'll find your way.

124
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,459
Well, Saifah,

125
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,219
was my son "naughty" like his name?
(T/N: Zon=Naughty)

126
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,899
He was.

127
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,559
What can we do to make him be less naughty, Auntie?

128
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,079
Please call me "Mom." We're on the same team.

129
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,439
Okay, Mom.

130
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,900
You can call me "Dad," too.

131
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,160
Can I? Sure, Dad.

132
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,579
Well, we fully support you on this.

133
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,860
If you want some advice about guitars...

134
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,319
Well, you're laughing. Let me tell you that your dad...

135
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:58,599
Oh! He was the most handsome musician when he was young.

136
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,240
I flirted with him because of this.

137
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,659
Dad. Mom. That's enough.

138
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:13,700
Saifah. Zon. Let's do your best! Go for it!

139
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,419
And about the imagined couple thing...

140
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,259
From what I've seen today...

141
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,300
I'm okay.

142
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,280
Mom!!

143
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,500
We should leave. You made our son feel awkward.

144
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,599
- Okay.
- Let's go!

145
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,799
If you're going to practice, please do it loudly.

146
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,760
We want to hear it.

147
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,599
Zon, your parents are not mean at all.

148
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,019
I think they're nice.

149
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,579
I have a headache.

150
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,680
Then I will visit Dad and Mom more often in the future.

151
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,120
Knock it off!

152
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,099
I want you to stop writing fiction for now,

153
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,279
and focus on your study.

154
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,659
The reason that your grades have fallen is that you've been wasting time doing something else.

155
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,739
I'm making an ultimatum. Stop writing fiction for now.

156
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,689
Think about what we have said, Dear.

157
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,339
Think about it wisely

158
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,460
if we were right or not.

159
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,640
I don't understand them.

160
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,840
They support the music stuff,

161
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,240
but not the fiction.

162
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,760
What did it do wrong?

163
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,300
I feel bad for it.

164
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,480
Hey! Chill out.

165
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,599
I think they have their own reasons.

166
00:13:21,599 --> 00:13:23,959
What reasons?

167
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,520
The reason for being afraid of me getting bad grades but allowing me to play the music, huh?

168
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,120
Or do you want to stop playing?

169
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,879
Nope. I didn't mean it like that.

170
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,160
Have you really ever asked them

171
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,000
why they don't want you to write fiction that much?

172
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,540
Never mind.

173
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,200
I'm sorry for today. I'm not in the mood to practice.

174
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,579
Let's think. Today, you are exploring my room instead.

175
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,499
You're artsy.

176
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,620
You can be an artist.

177
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,700
What is "artsy"?

178
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,979
What kind of person are you?

179
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,260
You stare at me and get shy. Hmm?

180
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,100
What! Who's shy?

181
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,699
I... I snuck a peak at your fiction for like 4,5 chapters actually.

182
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,199
Really?

183
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,359
Yep.

184
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,880
When?

185
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,120
Well, when you left your laptop open.

186
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,139
It was bad, wasn't it?

187
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,119
Hey! No, it wasn't.

188
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,859
It was quite okay.

189
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,689
Well, even if it was a bit too fancy,

190
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,920
but it was fun when reading it.

191
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,459
Yeah. It was freaking nonsense.

192
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,500
What!?

193
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,160
Are you complimenting me or chewing me out?

194
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,280
I'm complimenting you.

195
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,479
Hey! Let me tell you this.

196
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,219
If you want to write it again,

197
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,279
you can hire me to read it. I'll do it for you.

198
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,440
If the whole world

199
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,800
could think the same way as you do, it would be good.

200
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,450
The fictions have to be this way, huh?

201
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,700
Just like some stories, if they happen to be good,

202
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,659
we just have to be open-minded.

203
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:26,900
Sai, I never thought that someone like you

204
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,500
would make me feel this precious.

205
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,539
So, at the musical festival,

206
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,320
I will do my best for you.

♫ Just thinking about it, my heart throbs ♫

209
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:56,680
♫ I wonder what makes me love you ♫

210
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,420
♫ Or was it when our eyes met, you then bewitched me? ♫

213
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:14,020
♫ How many reasons are there that make

214

216
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,839
- Blue.
- Yes.

217
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,159
- Can you help me bring stuff from the car trunk?
- I'll go with you.

218
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:47,699
- I'll help you.
- You don't have to. I'll take care of it.

219
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,999
Hey! Dew! Champ! Have you seen Junior and Tanthai?

220
00:17:56,999 --> 00:17:59,019
They've left to buy water a long time ago.

221
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,619
I think they might be sitting behind the building.

222
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,000
Okay, see you.

224
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,919
Soda...

225
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,860
Drink it, please.

226
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,080
Drink a little more.

227
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,180
- Hello.
- Hello.

228
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
- You got them all?
- Yes.

229
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,080
Let's go.

230
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,339
- Soda.
- Yeah.

231
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,540
Drink it, please.

232
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,850
Yes, here you go.

233
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,999
- Hello.
- Hi.

234
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,939
Everything is completed, Soda.

235
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,280
Completed?

236
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,939
850 light sticks ordered from the factory have already been here.

237
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,979
Everything is fine.

238
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,500
- Already counted?
- Yes.

239
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,680
- Okay.
- One, two, three, four... 800. Yes.
- Good, and what have you guys done?

240
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,059
- Good, and what have you guys done?
- They haven't done anything.

241
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:45,579
I'm the one bringing this folder that has the list of the 800 members of the audience's names. It's fine.

242
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,319
- So, it's okay.
- Yes.

243
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,779
- What have you done?
- Balloons!

244
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,199
He hasn't done anything. I'm the one bringing these balloons.

245
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,820
- You've done it all by yourself?
- Yes.

246
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,119
Okay, so Check! Check! Check! it again.

247
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,419
Okay.

248
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,759
I'm so tired that I can't breathe.

249
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,280
It's fake. Luketarn, let's go to the dressing room.

250
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,079
Soda, do you have a sore throat?

251
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,620
Enough! Or I'm going to have pulmonary edema.

252
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,240
Zon.

253
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,220
Wake up. Let's have lunch.

254
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,200
You won't wake up, will you?

255
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,410
If you don't wake up...

256
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,340
I'll kiss you now.

257
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,000
You've teased me again.

258
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,840
I haven't.

259
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,880
I just tried to wake you up.

260
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,460
Japan is waiting for us to rehearse.

261
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,740
- Rehearse?
- Yeah.

262
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,579
Do you think a person like me needs to rehearse?

263
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,980
The great one like me?

264
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,520
If your legs wobble on stage, I'll laugh at you.

265
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,840
Let's have lunch.

266
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,880
What is that?

267
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,329
This one is stir-fried seafood with basil,

268
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,959
and this one is stir-fried chicken with basil and fried egg.

269
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,239
Which one do you want?

270
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,780
Stir-fried seafood with basil doesn't have a fried egg?

271
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,340
No.

272
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,820
I want stir-fried seafood with basil that has a fried egg.

273
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,460
Please.

274
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,600
I want stir-fried seafood with basil and fried egg.

275
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,339
But when we eat, you don't eat eggs, do you?

276
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,639
I mean fried egg.

277
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,740
Fried egg, right?

278
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,300
As you wish.

279
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,720
Egg. Egg. Egg. Egg.

280
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,460
Take it.

281
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,300
Have you taken my chicken, too?

282
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,200
I just want to try it.

283
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,140
Hey! Slowly.

284
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,659
Zon.

285
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,160
Hot.

286
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,800
Are you that hungry?

287
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,120
I'm full.

288
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,140
Too full.

289
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,840
You should be full.

290
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,060
You also had almost half of my food.

291
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,620
But you're the one giving it to me.

292
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,720
I'm full.

293
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,960
Are you comfortable now? You're leaning on me.

294
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,599
Why? Can't I do it just a little?

295
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:04,099
A little? It's not a little.

296
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:06,560
Do you have a backbone?

297
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,280
You might lay on my lap later.

298
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,960
Can I?

299
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,940
So comfortable.

300
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,360
Do you remember this photo?

301
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,320
Yes, the one I took for you on the rooftop.

302
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:37,300
You know what? It gave me the most likes I've ever gotten.

303
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,080
It's normal.

304
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,340
The photographer is great, so the photo is great.

305
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,980
Not true.

306
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,379
The one in the photo is the best.

307
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:50,560
- So people like it.
- Because of the photographer.

308
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,620
Because of the one in the photo.

309
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,140
Chemistry Cute Boy.

310
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,320
Wait!

311
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,159
What are you guys doing?

312
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,779
It's not like what you are thinking.

313
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,500
Are we interrupting you guys?

314
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,859
It's not like what you are seeing.

315
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,510
Bewildered again.

316
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,940
Bewildered again.

317
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,419
Easy! Calm down!

318
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:32,880
We're just bringing these outfits for you.

319
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:41,420
I'd better to not interrupt you guys because you seem to be busy.

320
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,640
You haven't interrupted us. It's absolutely nothing.

321
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,099
No! No! I've already known that you guys are boyfriends.

322
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,359
Friends, I mean.

323
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,299
Maybe friends with benefits who can lean on one another.

324
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:59,280
He didn't lean on, he laid in his lap.

325
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,920
Okay, I'd better go. Bye

326
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:09,200
You can keep on laying down. Don't you feel sleepy now?

327
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,479
- Bye.
- Bye.

328
00:26:13,479 --> 00:26:16,000
Let's go.

329
