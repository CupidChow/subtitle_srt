Zol, why is it so hard to write a Yaoi novel?

20

I told you so! It's not easy at all to write a Yaoi novel.

21

I'm glad that you are open-minded enough to write this kind of novel.

26

You were so dramatic towards me and Saifah after the music show.

Why are you so kind to me?

Because you already have my heart.

You went to the salon with me. Why bother asking?

170
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:37,319
By the way, how long did Tan let you take a rest after the music contest?

171
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,919
I think around one week. We'll have an annual soccer match later.

172
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,159
Are you in the starting lineup?

173
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,620
Of course I am.

174
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,119
I'll beat everyone if I'm not.

175
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,039
You know, people donated a lot of money because of me.

176
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,279
Stop right there.

177
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,999
The reason that the donation skyrocketed

178
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,999
is because of Zon and Saifah, the hottest imaginary couple.

179
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,040
It has nothing to do with you. Stop imagining things.

180
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,639
Zon, what's wrong with you?

181
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,120
Why do you look so depressed?

182
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,740
- I didn't get enough sleep.
- Didn't get enough sleep?

183
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,759
What did you do?

184
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,439
I was just overthinking about something.

185
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,540
You can tell me. I'm all ears.

186
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,399
Sai, you come here alone?

187
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,999
My friends are not here yet. So, I'm here to eat breakfast first.

188
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,679
Can I sit with you guys?

189
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,079
Of course.

190
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,840
Sit down.

191
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,580
Smelly.

192
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,920
Zon.

193
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,699
- About yesterday...
- I'm going to class first.

194
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,999
Smelly.

195

What's smelly?

196
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,760
Zon.

197
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,399
Zon. Hey, hello.

198
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,000
My friend.

199
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,199
You're not smelly.

200
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,439
Why did Zon say that?

201
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,460
I think he's sick of me.

202
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,540
What did you do to my friend?

203
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,080
What did you do?

204
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,240
Tell me...

205
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,720
What did you do?

206
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,540
Well... I...

207
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,780
- I kissed him.
- He just kissed him.

208
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,519
Shit!

209
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,959
You kissed him?

210
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,159
Saifah, you kissed Zon?

211
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,060
- You kissed Zon!
- Why are you shouting?

212
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,920
Why am I shouting? Because you kissed Zon!

213
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,920
He kissed Zon. He already kissed Zon!

214
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,560
Sorry...

215
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:15,759
Dude, maybe we're actually in Zon's Yaoi novel.

216
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,119
Don't you dare like me.

217
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,999
I won't like you.

218
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,559
I already have Zen.

219
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,839
Damn you.

220
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,279
Where's Zen?

221
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,460
I miss him already.

222
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,240
This drink is not as red as Zen's heart.

223
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,160
This drink is not as green as Zen's body.

224
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,660
Hello, Zen. Baby, have you eaten yet?

225
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,820
Babe, my friend asked where did you go?

226

- Hello, Zon.

230
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,400
Sai wants to return the guitar to you.

- I'm not free yet.
- Just make some time for him. That's it.
