1
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,350
 I had no reason to come over. 

2
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,740
   

3
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,260
 However, there was no reason to refuse the invitation. 

4
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,030
 Even so... 

5
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,210
Do you want a cup of coffee?

6
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,180
   

7
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,590
 It's a feast of delicacies! 

8
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,800
 But this fluffy and runny omelette rice has to be the top pick. 

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,380
-  It's paired with chicken rice...  
 - Here you go.

10
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,660
 Slice it, and runny eggs will overflow. 
   

11
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,500
Omotesando? What in the world goes on there?

12
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,200
You guys ever watch "Adomachikku Tengoku"? 
  (T/N: Japanese travel reality show) 

13
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,190
Somewhat.

14
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:18,230
City life incomprehensible to us country folk,

15
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,600
but I can't keep my eyes off the damn show.

16
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,020
Maybe it's because the narration's great.

17
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,250
Utsunomiya.

18
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,850
Yes?

19
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,080
You'll be transferring to the Tokyo office.

20
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,590
- What? 
 - Huh?

21
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,230
I know you've always been requesting to go.

22
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,390
Congratulations.

23
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:54,180
T-Thank you very much.

24
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,850
Tokyo isn't all that great.

25
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,800
I bet the water stinks.

26
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,410
Besides, isn't this place your hometown?

27
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:06,930
If I were you, I'd definitely choose to stay in Yamagata.

28
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,240
Why do you want to go to Tokyo?

29
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,520
Well, about that...

30
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,590
I mean, why not?

31
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:34,450


32
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,390
   

33
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,440
All right.

34
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,300
♫  Hey, ladies, where you at? So let's start it (let's start it)  ♫

35
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:58,050
  ­ 

36
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,500
♫  You can't deny, so gimme something (gimme something)  ♫

37
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,080
♫  Can you feel your heart's exploding?  ♫

38
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,610
   

39
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,390
Wow, it's more spacious than I expected.

40
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,130
And it comes with furniture.

41
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,400
You can move into this place at the start of the next month.

42
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,370
Even the scenery's great.

43
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,150
By the way, how much is it?

44
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,300
¥210,000  ($1500)  with the management fee.

45
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,370
It's the average price for an 1LDK in Ebisu.

46
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,450
That's quite expensive.

47
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:36,030
¥210,000 would get me an 8LDK in Yamagata.

48
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,560
You're here in Tokyo.

49
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,210
Indeed, but...

50
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:45,630
But if you're looking for less serious relationships, Ebisu's too blatant. Folks might avoid you.

51
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,580
"Less serious relationships"?

52
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,850
If you live in Ebisu, people think you're likely a playboy or something.

53
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,270
Living here has its downsides,

54
00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:01,700
but residing in Ebisu is quite appealing for many women.

55
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,620
I don't understand what you're trying to say from the beginning.

56
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,320
You don't have to be shy.

57
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,330
Please take a seat.

58
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,750
Excuse me.

59
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:21,270
Well, I do hope you take living in Tokyo more seriously.

60
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,340
- That's what I think. 
 - What do you mean?

61
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,800
Let's say you start living alone in Kokubunji.

62
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,590
It's a wonderful neighborhood. Very peaceful, quiet, and the rent's cheap.

63
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,320
But here's the thing.

64
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,150
Imagine drinking until late in Ebisu.

65
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:41,550
On top of that, you've managed to charm a pretty Ebisu lady, an Ebisu Babe.

66
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,670
What if you two want to get it going? What will you do?

67
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,620
Before that, what's "Kokubunji"─

68
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,020
You probably think heading to a hotel beats going home.

69
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,470
It's not like that.

70
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,950
On the weekends, Ebisu's hotels are booked out.

71
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,870
After facing numerous fully booked spots, she'll lose interest.

72
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,430
"Forget it," she'll say.

73
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,280
In desperation, you'll offer, "How about coming over to my place?"

74
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,960
"Where's that?"

75
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,310
"Kokubunji."

76
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,480
"Kokubunji?"

77
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,830
"What? Kokubunji?"

78
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,880
"It's not a bad place, but it's far... I can't really decide."

79
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,960
"I guess he doesn't have the money to live in Ebisu or something."

80
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,420
"If I follow him back to Kokubunji, going home in the morning will be a hassle."

81
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,980
"Sorry!"

82
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,750
"I'll head home for today."

83
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,260
That's what will happen.

84
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,530
Are you sure you're fine with that?

85
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:56,150
Is there a slightly cheaper place that's still worth boasting about?

86
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,930
I see you're quite eager.

87
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,110
Well, how about Shimouma?

88
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,410
Shimouma?

89
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,650
The rent's on the cheaper side,

90
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:13,700
and when girls ask you where you stay,

91
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:19,700
you can grit your teeth and say, "Me? I live in Nakame, Nakameguro."

92
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,510
You can still barely flex with that.

93
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,270
After that, we ate at an Italian restaurant in Aoyama that's rated 3.92 online!

94
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,420
That sounds amazing! What else?

95
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,150
Then, we went to a members-only bar in Azabu, the kind of place where celebrities frequent.

96
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,340
I know the ones, those almost pitch-black bars. And then?

97
00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:00,390
I went to his low-rise mansion in Hiro! Isn't he perfect?

98
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,070
So that's what happened.

99
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,860
All on the first date.

100
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,090
What are you chatting about?

101
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,070
Matsuda-chan went on a first date yesterday. 
  (T/N: Suffix for cute people) 

102
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:13,250
He brought me to an Italian place in Aoyama and then a members-only bar in Azabu.

103
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,050
Did you sleep with him?

104
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,570
Not the greatest idea, right? But I drank too much.

105
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:26,250
I get your sentiments, but you have to show him that you don't just sleep with anyone.

106
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,210
Isn't it all right if they aren't dating?

107
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,270
But I want to date such a great catch!

108
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,050
I guess it'll be tough then.

109
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,720
If you aren't after him for sex, you should've called it quits after the bar.

110
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,680
A guy who picks his hangout spots and home based on the location's name is a loser.

111
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,180
But I like guys who live in Nakame.

112
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,520
I totally get you.

113
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,590
But the guys who boast about residing in Nakame

114
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:56,310
mostly live in Nishikoyama or Shimouma.

115
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,650
I'm Utsunomiya Hiroto who'll be transferring here from the Yamagata Office.

116
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,020
I live in Nakameguro.

117
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,580
I'll do my best. It's a pleasure to work with you all.

118
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,800
All right, clap for him.

119
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,480
Yes.

120
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,870
- Got it. 
 - Excuse me.

121
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,220
Nice to meet you, I'm Baba.

122
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,010
I'm also from Aomori.

123
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:27,130
"Also"? You're from Yamagata, aren't you?

124
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,860
Yes, I'm from Yamagata.

125
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,220
People from Tohoku are bonded by a unique camaraderie. 
   (T/N: North-east region of Japan) 

126
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,390
I totally get it, sir.

127
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,430
You don't have to be so polite. He's just a rookie who joined in April.

128
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,320
- Is that so? 
 - I joined the company very recently.

129
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,430
Hang on.

130
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,130
- Where's Noda? 
 - Noda-san's over there.

131
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,560
- Noda-kun. 
 - Yes, sir?

132
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,890
Utsunomiya-kun will be under your care from now on. 
  (T/N: Suffix for equals and juniors) 

133
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:56,280
- I'll leave him to you. 
 - Yes, sir.

134
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,610
- I'm Utsunomiya. 
 - I'm Noda.

135
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,270
Utsunomiya-san lives in Nakame. Cool, right? 
  (T/N: Polite suffix) 

136
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,950
By the Meguro River?

137
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:12,280
No, but there's a dessert store nearby.

138
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,050
Are you talking about "I'm Donut?"?

139
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,440
Probably.

140
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,380
Tons of pretty women hang out there.

141
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,670
Noda-san, do you go drinking in that area?

142
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,390
From time to time.

143
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,770
I always go to Nakame for lemon sours.

144
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,580
Nice, you're really soaking up the Tokyo atmosphere.

145
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,150
So? Do you want to grab drinks together?

146
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,850
It'll work as a welcome party for you.

147
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,410
Just a quick one.

148
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,100
- Can I? 
 - Utsunomiya-san!

149
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,050
Please don't force yourself to agree.

150
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,660
Force myself?

151
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,640
Also, isn't it annoying when people ramble about their favorite bar?

152
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,080
But I do that, too.

153
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,620
You're someone with class, so it's fine.

154
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,620
I'm talking about those hags who keep blabbering about falling in love with bartenders.

155
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,290
Are you going to keep chatting the day away?

156
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:04,870
Lunch break is long over.

157
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,600
Senior Mitsuki, we're just getting to the exciting part.

158
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,430
Sorry.

159
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,540
I wish I could devote myself to my work like Senior Mitsuki.

160
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,630
Well, how are things with you and your bartender boyfriend?

161
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,590
Don't put it like that.

162
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:31,030
Having a bartender boyfriend means never feeling lonely.

163
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:35,150
Even if he doesn't contact me for a week, I can meet him by visiting the bar.

164
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,970
- Are you sure you're dating? 
 - Do you want to have some drinks tonight?

165
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,260
I want to introduce him to you.

166
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,050
   

167
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,310
Korido Street?

168
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,090
Here's the thing about Korido Street.

169
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:53,320
It's a respectable place for gentlemen and ladies to hang out and meet someone they like.

170
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,810
After that, they can decide whether to have a fun time that night.

171
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,300
I see.

172
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,880
Beer, please.

173
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,000
Thank you.

174
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,100
Maybe we can approach those two ladies.

175
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,510
They're working hard to impress by wearing sleeveless clothes in this cold weather.

176
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,590
That delights me.

177
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,840
What are you talking about?

178
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,300
- Hang on! 
 - Ladies, how about a drink?

179
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,490
Sure.

180
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,610
Just consider me your wallet.

181
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,890
Wow, you're more gentlemanly than you look.

182
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,750
In that case, we'll have a glass or two.

183
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,800
Cheers.

184
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,710
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

185
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,920
You barely drank anything!

186
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,510
Drink up!

187
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,000
You've lost again!

188
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,690
- How about just your contact numbers? 
 -  Nope. 

189
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,970
- Drink up! 
 - We'll be going elsewhere to drink now.

190
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,860
- Bye bye! 
 - Wait a second!

191
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,890
- Wait! 
 - H-Hang on!

192
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,930
This sucks.

193
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,550
Noda-san, let's go home already.

194
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,260
We've already spent a lot.

195
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,750
No, let's go elsewhere. I know a good spot nearby.

196
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,860
Spare me, please.

197
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,860
This is Friday night in Tokyo for you.

198
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,680
Come on.

199
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,460
   

200
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,690
Enjoy.

201
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,720
Thanks.

202
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,850
Ryo-kun, how's the novel going?

203
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,580
Novel?

204
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:06,740
I've been writing, but my work seems too ahead of its time.

205
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,020
I'm simply waiting for the right time to arrive.

206
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,510
I stand with those who think art must enter the world when it's meant to.

207
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:19,000
Is that so?

208
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,580
Do you want another drink?

209
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,340
I'll have a Salty Dog.

210
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,630
Salty Dog?

211
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,780
Sone-chan.

212
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,580
- You're sexy. 
 - No way.

213
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,280
Don't say that.

214
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,290
What do you think? Isn't Ryo-kun wonderful?

215
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:41,080
What school of thought are these people who share his views based on?

216
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,810
- He's so smart. 
 - Isn't he rather immature?

217
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,990
Good evening.

218
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,870
- Are seats at the bar fine? 
 - Sure.

219
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,520
I'll take the long-haired one, you can have the bob cut.

220
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,010
What?

221
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,890
Good evening.

222
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,200
- Ladies, are you two drinking alone? 
 - Yes.

223
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,990
We happen to be in the area for work.

224
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,820
- Are you two in sales? 
 - Yes.

225
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,200
In fact, we're from Mitsui Commerce.

226
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,740
Wow! You must be a seasoned salesperson.

227
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,260
Not at all.

228
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,680
I'm still a child at heart.

229
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,790
- Are you two bar-hopping? 
 - No, this is our first.

230
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,900
We were at Korido just now.

231
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,710
- What did you have there? 
 - That's a secret.

232
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,660
- Here's your drink. 
 - Wow, you're so speedy!

233
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,470
What would you two like to have?

234
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,680
A Lemon Sour then.

235
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,260
I'm really sorry, but we didn't order any lemons today.

236
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,430
The lemons in this season can't bring out the full flavor of the fruit.

237
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,470
Ryo-kun's so refined.

238
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,500
- How about an Oolong Highball? 
 - Same for me.

239
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,560
Understood.

240
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,700
After you finish your drink, how about hitting another bar?

241
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,770
- But... 
 - Come on, it's Friday night.

242
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,810
If you miss the last train, I'll pay for your taxi.

243
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:14,070
Sorry, but I live in the area and want to have a few more drinks here.

244
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,360
How about exchanging contact numbers?

245
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,740
It's already 11:30 pm! Can I have the bill?

246
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,900
- Sone-chan, you're heading home? So soon? 
 - I can't stand listening to this chat.

247
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,430
Miss, where do you live?

248
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,420
Noda-san, let's head home.

249
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,690
Hey, Minami. Atsushi and the others invited us over for darts.

250
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,710
Let's close the shop and head over.

251
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,640
- Okay, let's go! 
 - Let's go.

252
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,300
You aren't the best at darts, yeah? You'll need some practice.

253
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,740
That's so true.

254
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,610
- Like this? 
 - No, differently.

255
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,630
- How about this? 
 - Do it like this and then...

256
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,820
That was a hell of a bad pick.

257
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,910
I bet those two are a couple.

258
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,330
Yeah, that's probably true.

259
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:10,530
Why do I work myself to the bone on weekdays when I can't have a woman in bed on Friday night?

260
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:12,370
Damn it!

261
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,100
What's up with that attitude?

262
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,540
My condolences.

263
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,950
Huh?

264
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,400
I dropped by the convenience store.

265
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,540
It was painfully obvious why you were buying us drinks.

266
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,830
I'm really sorry!

267
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:33,240
We spoke crudely of your friend.

268
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,830
I need to catch the last train. Bye.

269
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,890
Hang on, Senpai! Wait! 
  (T/N: Addressing a senior) 

270
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,320
What the heck?

271
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,800
Hey!

272
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,600
What is it?

273
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,980
Um...

274
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,650
Won't you miss the last train?

275
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:05,440
Well, I'll miss it.

276
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,630
But these fallen leaves are pretty.

277
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:13,920
And it's just two stops, so I thought it'll be fine to take a walk home.

278
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,490
Sorry?

279
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,160
All right, goodnight.

280
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,650
Excuse me!

281
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:07,950
Can I join you for the walk?

282
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,640
So you're 27 years old, Sone-san?

283
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,370
Yeah.

284
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,480
Huh?

285
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,630
I see.

286
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,160
What's with the "Huh"?

287
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,730
Oh, it's nothing. I'm 25, two years younger than you.

288
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,430
Girls really do think younger guys are just boys, huh.

289
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,570
You know...

290
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,550
What? Oh...

291
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,360
Was that a question just now?

292
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,490
Not exactly, but...

293
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,000
Not that I need an answer.

294
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,400
Here's what I think.

295
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,780
Trying to fish for a woman's opinions by pretending to think out loud is childish.

296
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,180
- Huh? 
 - And here's a tip.

297
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:11,960
Don't drag out a conversation if you only want to hear someone say, "No, that's not true."

298
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,210
That answer was five times harsher than what I expected.

299
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,070
Hey, where do you live?

300
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,090
Oh, in Nakame.

301
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,420
I live in Shimouma.

302
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,860
Shimouma, huh?

303
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,270
It's a nice place, so why did you lie?

304
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:40,690
- I'm sorry. 
 - Why are you apologizing?

305
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,490
Sorry.

306
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,920
You're so peculiar.

307
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,970
Sone-san, I'm sure you despise guys like me.

308
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:53,350
There you go again. Trying to get me to say, "No, that's not true."

309
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,020
My home's just round the corner.

310
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,740
Got it.

311
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,270
I guess a walk wasn't enough.

312
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,660
Well, do you want to come over?

313
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:34,970


314
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,910
Good morning.

315
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,990
Do you want a cup of coffee?

316
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,220
Yes, please.

317
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,550
Sone-san,

318
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:56,850
why were you open to letting me come over yesterday?

319
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,600
I mean, look at me.

320
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,950
How should I put this...

321
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:14,850
I get so horny right before menstruating.

322
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:23,860
But it doesn't make sense that I feel in the mood after ovulation.

323
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,130
Anyway, I'll be heading out now─

324
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,420
What?

325
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,120
What's up?

326
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,680
Sorry.

327
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,140
This might be annoying for you,

328
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,290
but I want to do it again.

329
00:21:55,550 --> 00:22:00,420
Why do you think I let you stay over?

330
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,730
♫  Tokyo crazy night  ♫

331
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,520
♫  Got me falling deep  ♫

332
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,110
♫  Love like illusion  ♫

333
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,480
Where are you going?

334
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,000
To the horse tracks with some old guys from a client company.

335
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,060
Old guys? How old are they?

336
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,970
Men in their 70s! I guess they aren't just old, they're actually grandpas.

337
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,290
What's the matter?

338
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:26,500
No, it's nothing.

339
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,790
Then have a restful Saturday. Bye!

340
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,430
You, too.

341
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,250
♫  Until we drown  ♫

342
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:43,050
♫  Pushing, pulling, and this frustrating camouflage  ♫

343
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:46,590
♫  Even if it is a lie, nicely done (done, done)  ♫

344
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:51,060
♫  Would like to feel and touch it, this insufficient sabotage  ♫

345
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:56,060
♫  You and me tonight, all night long  ♫ 
 ♫  Like this we fly  ♫

346
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,360
I forget to ask for her number!

347
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,220
   
 If possible, can I have your number? 

348
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,850
 "If possible" is such an annoying statement. 
   

349
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,700
 What if things stay this way forever? 

350
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,070
 What's going on? 

351
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:11,990
 - Sone-san! 
 - You have horrible timing. 

352
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,900
 Does she despise me?
