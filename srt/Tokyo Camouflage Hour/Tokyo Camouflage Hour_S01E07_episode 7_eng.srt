1
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,620
 "Yae" is fine.

 Timing and Subtitles by the 
 ☕️ Golden Hour 👠 Team @Viki.com 

3
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,930
 I dislike the rustling sound when a man 

4
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:06,080
 reaches out to caress me in the backseat, 

5
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,640
 as well as the cold silence of the driver. 

6
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,650
Shall we drop by a convenience store?

7
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,490
 I dislike men who don't try to match my walking pace. 

8
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,230
You smell wonderful.

9
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:40,010
 I dislike sex that begins with anything that isn't "I like you." 

10
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,700
I'll call you.

11
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,690
 I dislike the predictable conversation with men I'm not dating. 

12
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,900
 I dislike the mornings after when men don't walk me to the station. 

13
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,890
May I sit with you?

14
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,540
Sure, but I'm leaving soon.

15
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,360
Don't say that. Let me buy you a drink.

16
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:41,200
Well then.

17
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:48,680
 I feel worthless unless a man approaches me. 

18
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,020
 I dislike this side of myself. 

19
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,120
Welcome.

20
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,990
Do you want to have your usual drink?

21
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,890
- Or... 
 - What am I?

22
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,400
- Minami? 
 - What...

23
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,190
am I to you?

24
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:30,220
  ­ 

25
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,020
I made breakfast. You can drop the key in the letterbox. 
    

26
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:44,280
   

27
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,830
Take care.

28
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,130
I will.

29
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:56,880
- See you later. 
 - Do your best.

30
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,960
Bye-bye.

31
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,800
I'm coming.

32
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,700
Yes?

33
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,200
- Morning. 
 - Good morning.

34
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,280
Meguro-chan, have you looked over the documents we sent yesterday?

35
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,350
Documents?

36
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,390
   

37
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,700
It's nothing urgent, but give it a look.

38
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,170
Meguro-chan?

39
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,760
What's the matter?

40
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,590
- Hey. 
 - Welcome back!

41
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,520
Why are you inviting a sex friend over to your girlfriend's home?

42
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,650
You're hard to catch.

43
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:30,840
It's just a watch, you selfish prick.

44
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:37,810
You don't get it, this watch is a family heirloom.

45
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,020
I missed you, my precious.

46
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,280
If it's so precious, don't forget it at my house again.

47
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:51,240
Got it.

48
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,270
Ryo-kun?

49
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,030
 What's up? 

50
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:08,930
Did someone come over?

51
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,710
No, nobody came here.

52
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,200
-  Is that so?  
 - Yeah.

53
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,920
Why are you asking?

54
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,790
Are you alone?

55
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,970
 No. 

56
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,940
What?

57
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,980
You're always in my heart, after all.

58
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,820
Ryo-kun...

59
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,690
Have a good day at work.

60
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,810
You too, Minami.

61
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,920
So you'll be joining me at the exhibition on Sunday...

62
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,900
Doesn't that make her your girlfriend?

63
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,950
You think?

64
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,110
Did you hear me?

65
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:39,440
I mean, a girl at your daily lunch spot approached you.

66
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,720
Then you two hit it off and went on dates? She's definitely your girlfriend.

67
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,150
Is she really?

68
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,910
- Aren't you coming? 
 - Did you two kiss?

69
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,500
No one wants to listen, huh.

70
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,460
We did.

71
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,180
- She's indeed your girlfriend then. 
 - Seriously? Is she?

72
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,860
Wow, this is great news. Right?

73
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,100
Yes, congratulations. Get in the taxi.

74
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,990
All right.

75
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,740
You're looking really glum, Senpai.

76
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,050
- Wouldn't you be if no one listened to─ 
 - To Hamamatsucho, please.

77
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,400
- Understood. 
 - Thank you.

78
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,620
Still, this is really something.

79
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:26,730
My dear country boy went from being intimidated by a lady outside a bar to scoring a girl?

80
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,070
Welcome to Tokyo.

81
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,870
It does feel nostalgic somehow.

82
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,650
What do you like about her?

83
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,320
Utsunomiya-san?

84
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,000
Well? What do you like about her?

85
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,060
She's...

86
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,880
Yeah?

87
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,310
She's just, you know.

88
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,570
I know what?

89
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,250
She's pretty and kind.

90
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,090
Right, yes.

91
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,940
Even ChatGPT would provide a more constructive answer.

92
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,310
She also smiles a lot.

93
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,700
Infomercials make me smile, too.

94
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,020
Senpai.

95
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,050
Anyway, she's a good girl.

96
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,770
Whatever it is, I'm glad you're happy.

97
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,330
Thank you.

98
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,950
   

99
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,890
Coming!

100
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,390
Welcome.

101
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,250
Thank you for inviting me.

102
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,400
I'll carry that for you.

103
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,890
Be careful, it's heavy.

104
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,080
This is a lot!

105
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:23,740
Since I'm cooking, I thought it'd be nice to prepare for several days.

106
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,980
What's the matter?

107
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:36,590
It's nothing, I just feel really fortunate.

108
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,900
Where do the carrots go?

109
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,730
- I don't think they need to be in the fridge. 
 - Okay, got it.

110
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,080
- Let's eat. 
 - Enjoy your meal.

111
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,050
- It looks delicious. 
 - Really?

112
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,810
I'm digging in.

113
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,500
All right.

114
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,000
The taste is fantastic!

115
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,950
I'm glad.

116
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,160
It's good enough to be sold.

117
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,560
- You're exaggerating. 
 - I mean it.

118
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,070
Delicious.

119
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,150
Say, how about we go on a trip sometime?

120
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,340
- A trip? 
 - Yeah.

121
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:24,650
We can drive somewhere and stay over.

122
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:31,400
One of my part-time colleagues lately visited Nikko.

123
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,320
They said it was fabulous and there were art museums to visit.

124
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,650
It can be done as a day trip, too.

125
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,950
- Let's go. 
 - Really?

126
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,530
In that case...

127
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,300
How about this Sunday?

128
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,200
Sure.

129
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,350
Awesome!

130
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,420
- Sunday... 
 - I'm so excited.

131
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,380
- Let's drive over. 
 - Sure, let's do that.

132
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,390
- Sounds like fun. 
 - Nice, I'm so glad.

133
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,150
Hang on.

134
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:09,640
He has a wife, a kid, and a girlfriend.

135
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,050
Yes.

136
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,970
And there's still another woman?

137
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,720
Sounds like a scumbag to me.

138
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,410
Probably, but I'm not sure yet.

139
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:20,770
Pass me the yuzu pepper paste.

140
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:25,970
Anyway, having a wife was a sign to end things. Wait, what show was this?

141
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:30,970
I forgot the name, but it's a dating reality show.

142
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,520
The shiitake mushrooms are delicious.

143
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,060
Hang on, why don't we watch it now?

144
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,480
- What? 
 - We're all here anyway.

145
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,450
I don't think that's a great idea...

146
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:43,130
- What was it called again? 
 - Oh, well...

147
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,950
- Sorry, I forgot. 
 - But a married man joined a dating show?

148
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,530
He's crazy. So gross.

149
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,590
It's overflowing!

150
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:55,310
That's because you two haven't been eating.

151
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:57,520
We are, you're just going too fast.

152
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,910
Well, I want to finish eating quickly.

153
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,640
Sone-san, hot pot is a team effort.

154
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,960
In that case, match my pace.

155
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,590
It's exactly this situation, Meguro-san.

156
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,660
That guy is so full of his own desires that he doesn't care

157
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,370
about the women's feelings or pace while acting all high and mighty.

158
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,150
That's not a nice way to put it.

159
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,290
Look at this tofu.

160
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,780
Poor thing.

161
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,840
It didn't come into the world to end up like this.

162
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,830
This is what will happen to all the women who date that man.

163
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,600
- Right, Sone-san? 
 - Can we finish the meal with ramen?

164
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,460
Were you listening?

165
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,080
- Let's do this as a team, okay? 
 - Got it.

166
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,880
Oh, so pitiful.

167
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,230
Delicious, but it's burning hot.

168
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:48,030
Wow, your cleaning robot is even more capable than tabloid reporters.

169
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:51,590
I wasn't trying to compete with tabloid reporters.

170
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:55,850
If you want, I can offer superficial consolation by saying that

171
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:03,310
Ryo-kun isn't in the wrong, or that wasn't actually a woman you saw.

172
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,340
I just can't forget those tofu scraps.

173
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,950
And I'm too hooked on this dating reality show.

174
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,520
Sone-chan...

175
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,980
But you knew all along, didn't you?

176
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,590
 Huh? 

177
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,430
I did.

178
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,710
I know what happens next, too.

179
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,750
If I confront Ryo-kun with this photo,

180
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:50,060
he will say whatever I want to hear and things will return to how they were.

181
00:14:52,820 --> 00:15:00,630
It really is impossible for anyone to change his nature now.

182
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:09,340
But whether you make a change or not

183
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,770
is entirely up to you.

184
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,570
What? This Sunday?

185
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,060
I told you, remember?

186
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,910
You have to join me for Sunday's exhibition as part of the handover.

187
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,330
 Your reaction is telling. 

188
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,560
You have a date, don't you?

189
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,780
Tell me I'm right.

190
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,030
No, that's not it.

191
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,030
I'll be fine for Sunday.

192
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,190
Yes, sir.

193
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,350
Sure.

194
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:52,010
Understood. Thank you.

195
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,970
Was that good news?

196
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,570
You look pleased.

197
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,930
- I do? 
 - Yeah.

198
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,110
- No way. 
 - Are you sure?

199
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,640
- I'll start eating first. 
 - Sure.

200
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,160
   

201
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,510
   

202
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,920
♫  Once upon a time, fairytales only existed in my mind  ♫

203
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,880
   

204
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:07,180
♫  Now that I've awoken, ♫ 
 ♫ I see it clearly, and I realized you're broken  ♫

205
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,720
♫  I feel that really there's no point in hoping  ♫

206
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,810
♫  That you'd be choking on your words  ♫

207
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:22,010
♫  I'll burst out your cellar, ♫ 
 ♫ Hold me down, take my crown, I'm no Cinderella  ♫

208
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,480
♫  I've been there, but I swear  ♫

209
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,500
Welcome.

210
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,260
Do you want to have your usual drink?

211
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,140
- Or... 
 - What am I?

212
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,070
- Minami? 
 - What...

213
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,890
am I to you?

214
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,550
I'll be closing shop soon. Can you wait for me?

215
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,080
What's the matter?

216
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:32,830
You said that I'm the only one you love.

217
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,310
Yes.

218
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:41,560
That really made me happy.

219
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,510
Yeah.

220
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:59,910
Someone came over to my house, right?

221
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,670
Can you explain?

222
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,240
Who is she?

223
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,070
- We finished sooner than expected. 
 - Yeah.

224
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,880
What about your date?

225
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,010
Huh?

226
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:54,820
I can tell by that reaction, even if it was over the phone, sir.

227
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,270
Why are you talking like that?

228
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,730
Ding!

229
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,160
This isn't a quiz.

230
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,820
Did you two fight?

231
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,020
Not at all.

232
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,420
You don't like her that much?

233
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,980
No.

234
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,310
You're interested in someone else.

235
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,630
Did I hit the nail on its head?

236
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:36,430
No, I'm not exactly interested.

237
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,370
I'm right, aren't I?

238
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,920
You've hit on all kinds of women, right?

239
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,470
I guess so.

240
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,760
Working for a trading company is the hook,

241
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,300
followed by expensive food and a nighttime view.

242
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:55,530
You do that to find the one, don't you?

243
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:58,680
I guess so.

244
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,840
Let's say you're uncertain about a person.

245
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,040
However, they're very certain about you. What then?

246
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,890
I'd be happy.

247
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,940
No, it's not like that.

248
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,140
What?

249
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,230
How should I put it...

250
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,850
I don't really get it,

251
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:25,960
but as a great philosopher once said...

252
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,240
I'm not familiar with philosophy.

253
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,300
"It's better to love than to be loved. Seriously."

254
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,570
Senpai?

255
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:43,390
In other words, you need a certain resolve to love and to be loved.

256
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,400
The question is whether you have that resolve or not.

257
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,340
Is this person worth the resolve or not?

258
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,000
Damn, I want to be loved!

259
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,040
Sorry for taking up your time.

260
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:17,560
The homepage designer for this project is coming over.

261
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,920
- Can you join me for the meeting? 
 - Yes, certainly.

262
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,840
This way, please.

263
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,550
They're here.

264
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:36,820

 Nice to meet you, I'm Sone from Design Bella. 

271
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,220
 You're confused about your feelings. 

272
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,550
 I really want to go. 

273
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,780
 Yae-chan. 

274
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,590
 Do I ever cross your mind even for a second? 

275
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,900
 No.
