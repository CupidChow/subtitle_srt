1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,740
   

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,070
What do you do when someone asks if you would like to do something together?

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,390
What?

4
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:16,210
I don't mind the intimacy, but he isn't quite the boyfriend candidate.

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,300
Then again, he's totally great as a male friend.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,990
That being said, he's inviting me for drinks like it's a date.

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,680
Oh, that happens.

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:32,410
But even before that, when he asks for your LINE, 
  (T/N: Japanese messenger app) 

9
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,790
it's a headache when you can't tell his true intentions.

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,000
Exactly.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,930
"If possible" is such an annoying statement.

12
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,890
If they frankly said, "Please give it to me," it'd make it easier for us to decide, too.

13
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,900
Yeah, totally.

14
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,280
- I'm going to use the restroom. 
 - Sure.

15
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,050
"Do you want a cup of coffee?"

16
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,980
Excuse me.

17
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,690
Yes?

18
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,380
Um...

19
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:25,000
Does the lady who was drinking with me frequent this place often?

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,350
Are you talking about Minami?

21
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,590
No, the other lady.

22
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,330
Sone-chan?

23
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,810
Yes.

24
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,320
It was her first time here.

25
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,550
I see.

26
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,100
It's boats over horses for me lately.

27
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,440
They get me so pumped up.

28
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,960
Boats are much more exciting where I'm from.

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,490
You're from Saga, right?

30
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,650
I'm jealous! Now, I'm craving squid.

31
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,450
- How about coming with me next time? 
 - Of course!

32
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,650
Race 8 of Karatsu today is...

33
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,330
a close fight of 2-4-3.

34
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,360
What should I do? Spend money on it?

35
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,150
Want to have some hirezake after this? 
  (T/N: fish fins in hot sake) 

36
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,810
Really? That'd be awesome! Let's go!

37
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,420
   

38
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,100
♫  Hey, ladies, where you at? So let's start it (let's start it)  ♫

39
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,060
♫  Just a night of lies can make you fall  ♫

40
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:34,700
  ­ 

41
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,050
♫  Can you feel your heart's exploding?  ♫

42
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:42,070
   

43
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,970
   

44
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,300
- Good morning! 
 - Morning!

45
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,080
Don't watch porn with the company's Wi-Fi. You'll get caught.

46
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,710
No, I wasn't doing that!

47
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,030
Oh, thanks for the drinks on Friday night.

48
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,800
It was nothing.

49
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,460
However, it was a terrifying experience.

50
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,450
Terrifying? What happened?

51
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,090
At the second bar, there were these lovely two women.

52
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,500
-  Good evening.  
 - But one of them was clearly dating the bartender.

53
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,890
So, I was complaining after leaving the bar...

54
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,990
 My condolences. 

55
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,410
When the other lady who left first appeared.

56
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:28,360
 It was painfully obvious why you were buying us drinks. 

57
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,470
That's because you were being a loser.

58
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,150
Leaving first only to come back and chat with us isn't normal.

59
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,900
Right?

60
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,230
But I bet someone like her doesn't have a boyfriend.

61
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,770
- She doesn't? 
 - No, I'm sure of it.

62
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:59,910

63
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,820
Morning.

64
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,970
So ironic.

65
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:15,310
Why don't women fall for nice guys?

66
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,690
I sense a story to be told.

67
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:24,320
Women are happier when they're loved, more so than when they're pouring out love.

68
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,690
I think I'm doomed.

69
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:37,070
What's going on? Is your relationship going south?

70
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:43,890
Last Friday, I went to a darts bar with Ryo-kun after you left.

71
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,020
What happened there?

72
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,200
Ryo-kun's friend was there, too.

73
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,630
A female friend.

74
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:59,370
 Ryo-kun! I'll head home since I have to work tomorrow. 

75
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,360
 Huh? 

76
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,660
 What's going on? 

77
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,810
 Didn't I tell you about my rehearsals? 

78
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,440
 I'm a rookie actor. 

79
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,530
 Is that so... 

80
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,620
A writer and an actor? He's quite busy.

81
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,340
Just like Tsutsui Yasutaka. 
  (T/N: Japanese author and actor) 

82
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,700
Ryo-kun's overflowing with too much talent for a single lifetime.

83
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,630
You're so devoted, Meguro-chan.

84
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:33,320
When I saw Ryo-kun hugging that woman,

85
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:40,000
I tried to convince myself that he was only practicing with a fellow actress.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,810
But jealousy still bubbled in me.

87
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,560
- So... 
 - So, what did you do?

88
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,730
I turned to Instagram.

89
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,960
Ryo-kun follows my account

90
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,500
and I posted that photo yesterday.

91
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,410
Is this about the ugly cocktail?

92
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,620
No, look carefully!

93
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,120
Ryo-kun checks my posts, and I wanted him to get jealous.

94
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,350
So I made sure the guy beside me was in the shot, too.

95
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:14,360
Do guys remove their arm hair these days?

96
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,120
What do I do, Sone-chan?

97
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,140
This is horrible, right?

98
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,680
Ryo-kun will be furious if he sees it, right?

99
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,460
I've made a blunder in my romance.

100
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,730
What do I do?

101
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,850
   

102
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,380
   

103
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,160
   

104
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,840
   

105
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,170
Hey.

106
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,530
Your phone's been buzzing. Aren't you taking a look?

107
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,630
It's probably just work. Don't mind it.

108
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,920
Is it another girl?

109
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:12,730
How can there be "another" girl if there isn't anyone else?

110
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,460
- Hey. 
 - Yeah?

111
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,760
- Are you jealous? 
 - No, I'm not.

112
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,560
- You are. 
 - Are you hiding something?

113
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,100
No, nothing!

114
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,700
   

115
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,910
   

116
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,850
   

117
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,630
   

118
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,990
   
   

119
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,540
What am I? A stalker?

120
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,140
It's been three days!

121
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,000
He hasn't replied for three days.

122
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,960
I've been texting him,

123
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,020
but I bet he's furious.

124
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,270
Peyang's Korean BBQ pork flavor's not bad.

125
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,300
Sone-chan, are you listening? It's been three days.

126
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,510
I'm sure this is a case where he doesn't even care.

127
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,600
That's definitely not true. Ryo-kun's a sensitive guy.

128
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,850
Being a bartender is tough. He has to face customer's all day!

129
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:44,700
I'm his source of comfort.

130
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,150
But my brief jealousy has hurt him.

131
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,600
I really have to reflect on my actions.

132
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,970
He's been leaving me on read, so I want to apologize in person.

133
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,270
Hey, Sone-chan, can't you visit Ryo-kun's bar with me tonight?

134
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:07,250
Sure, but I have to go home early to catch "Tokyo Swindlers."

135
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,150
What? You've been watching that?

136
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,090
Hey there! What were you two chatting about?

137
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,140
It's been three days without a reply from him!

138
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,320
- Hang on, what's this about? 
 - She's desperate.

139
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,700
Anyway, how are things with you and Nakazawa-san?

140
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,150
Ah, that Italian restaurant in Aoyama and low-rise mansion guy.

141
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,860
Oh, I lost interest in him.

142
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,090
What? But you were head over heels for him!

143
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:35,600
I contacted him frequently after that, but he ignored me.

144
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,740
Three days is nothing.

145
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,660
And two days ago, he texted me at 1am asking if we could meet up at his place.

146
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,090
That was when I lost interest for good.

147
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,920
Now, I have my eyes on a different guy.

148
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,210
Matsuda-chan, you're really the type to move on right away if a guy treats you poorly.

149
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:57,640
That's very true. I always put myself first.

150
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,080
If someone doesn't treat me right, I can't even spare a second for him.

151
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,890
I think he's someone unworthy of my time.

152
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:09,240
Matsuda-chan, do you listen to the Kano Sisters' "Fabulous World" podcast?

153
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,010
What's that?

154
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,470
Here is where you are.

155
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,980
Are you all attending Fujita-chan's wedding?

156
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,160
- If so, can you work reception? 
 - Got it.

157
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,130
Senior Mitsuki, are you organizing it?

158
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,660
Yes, but I won't be able to attend.

159
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,970
You aren't going?

160
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:30,690
Why must I spend time bearing witness to the happiness of others?

161
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,680
I'm busy pursuing my own happiness.

162
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:41,230
The ideal organizer plans everything perfectly, then misses the actual event.

163
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,920
Matsuda-chan, help me out for a second.

164
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,440
Okay!

165
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,210
The food was great.

166
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:57,970
Sone-chan, I want to marry someone I love and have a family with them after all.

167
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,910
I also want to raise kids and grow old with them.

168
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,390
That's happiness for me.

169
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,910
I get how you feel.

170
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:13,070
Honestly, when I heard about Fujita-chan's wedding, I felt really envious.

171
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:17,540
At 24, she found her lifelong partner.

172
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:23,190
Meanwhile, I'm already 28. What if things stay this way forever?

173
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,620
But you know what?

174
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:31,680
That's just a passing worry that we women in our thirties catch.

175
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,260
   
   

176
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,810
- Utsunomiya! 
 - Yes, sir!

177
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,860
Are you busy tomorrow night?

178
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,570
No.

179
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,460
In that case, we haven't had a welcome party for you yet.

180
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,120
I appreciate the thought, sir!

181
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,800
Is there anything you'd like to eat?

182
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,180
If it's expensive, anything works.

183
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,990
You're frank.

184
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,600
Yes, sir.

185
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,690
   

186
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,010
Come on, let's go.

187
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:15,080
How long must we wait here?

188
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:20,080
But a furious Ryo-kun is in there.

189
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,260
I've never seen Ryo-kun like that.

190
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,750
- I'm scared. 
 - Why the heck are we here in that case?

191
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,170
- I'm going in. 
 - What? Wait!

192
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:31,480
It's freezing. 
    

193
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,180
Wait─

194
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,070
Welcome.

195
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,980
I guess I'll go home.

196
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,330
- What? 
 - See you.

197
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,150
Hey! Sone-chan!

198
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,450
- Ryo-kun. 
 - It's been a while, Minami.

199
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,490
What's wrong?

200
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,440
My texts...

201
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:07,320
Why haven't you been replying to them?

202
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,540
I know I wasn't being the nicest,

203
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:15,190
but I was really anxious because you wouldn't reply.

204
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,040
I was scared.

205
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,360
I thought you hated me.

206
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,750
I see...

207
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,630
I'm sorry that I frightened you.

208
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,410
Actually...

209
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,780
I've been trying out Mind Travel.

210
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,700
Mind... What?

211
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:51,320
With Mind Travel you project your thoughts into a completely different world.

212
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,000
By doing that, you can refresh your mind.

213
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,920
You'll be able to look at things from a different perspective.

214
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,190
If I don't do that, I won't be able to write a good novel.

215
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:11,010
Therefore, I projected my mind to Vietnam.

216
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,230
So that's what happened...

217
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:21,590
And you were mind traveling when I texted you?

218
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,520
That's right.

219
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:28,760
Texts and the like don't exist in that plane.

220
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,610
Sorry.

221
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,290
But I'm back now.

222
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:41,010
Feel free to text as much as you like.

223
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,140
I want to read all your messages.

224
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,580
Ryo-kun, you're indeed strange.

225
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,940
You don't like that?

226
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,300
I love it.

227
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,300
I knew it.

228
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,980
Ryo-kun, do you really like me?

229
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,950
Of course.

230
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:12,770
I'm always thinking about how hard you must be working.

231
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,210
Even when I was in Ho Chi Minh City, you were on my mind.

232
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,920
Let's have Banh Mi together next time.

233
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,600
Ryo-kun!

234
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,780
Hey, Ryo-kun.

235
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,380
Can I come here next Sunday?

236
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,070
Of course.

237
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:49,710
A younger colleague of mine is having a wedding that day.

238
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,460
A wedding? That's wonderful.

239
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,830
Really?

240
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,310
Do you also consider weddings wonderful?

241
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:01,810
Definitely, as long as your colleague is happy.

242
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:07,250
She's getting married at 24,

243
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:12,720
but I'm turning 28 this year.

244
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:20,890
That's why... Well, I wondered what you think about marriage.

245
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,010
It's something worth celebrating.

246
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,420
I also want to get married.

247
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,240
Why?

248
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,700
Huh?

249
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,670
Marriage is just a bond written on a piece of paper.

250
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:53,550
If I can be with you and we love each other, we don't need a piece of paper.

251
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,300
Wow, a typical scumbag's reply.

252
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,480
You think so, too? He's avoiding the issue, right?

253
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,420
He's blatantly doing it.

254
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,850
I guess we'll never be a couple.

255
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:17,860
Oh my, that's the first time you have adopted this attitude.

256
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:22,110
I mean, if he's utterly disinterested in marriage,

257
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:26,830
I'd have to wait forever for his proposal.

258
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:32,530
In that case, I'd rather prioritize myself like Matsuda-chan.

259
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,500
That's a great perspective.

260
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,610
Place yourself first! Right?

261
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,880
Wow, you should run for office! Vote for Meguro Yuriko!

262
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,410
You don't have to be in a rush to make decisions.

263
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:51,710
Take your time to decide whether to break up.

264
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,600
You like him, don't you?

265
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,490
Do you want to drop by the bar with me tonight?

266
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,490
- Again? 
 - Just for one drink! Please!

267
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:11,090
Ugh, but I want to know what happens to Harrison Yamanaka!

268
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:16,980
I just need you to probe about my future with Ryo-kun.

269
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,980
 Thank you for the meal! 

270
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,720
Motsuyaki is always delicious. 
  (T/N: Grilled offal skewers) 

271
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,830
- Then I'll head home first. 
 - Sure.

272
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,260
- Thanks! 
 - Take care!

273
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,740
- Shall we go? 
 - Sure.

274
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,170
All right, boys.

275
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,720
- Do you want to go to Korido? 
 - You're pumping with energy.

276
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,910
Honestly, rookies should only answer with "yes" or "no."

277
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,440
In that case, it's a "no" for me.

278
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,930
Utsunomiya, you're coming, right?

279
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,020
- No. 
 - What?

280
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:54,030
I have plans tonight.

281
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,800
I don't want my girlfriend to worry either, so I'm going home.

282
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,500
- Wow, what a cool statement. 
 - Seriously?

283
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,910
- Thank you. 
 - Come on.

284
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:04,140
You'd miss the chance to meet a sleeveless babe.

285
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,200
I think it's much better to meet a girl who looks cute no matter what she wears.

286
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,650
Bye, I'm heading off.

287
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,530
- Take care. 
 - You, too.

288
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,970
Hey, was he trying to preach to me just now?

289
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,500
That's a win for Baba-kun this time.

290
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,760
Whatever, I'm going home.

291
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,620
- Take care! 
 - You, too.

294
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,510
Meguro-chan.

295
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,560
You're prepared for this, right?

296
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,070
What?

297
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,700
Talking about marriage is a heavy topic for any guy.

298
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,810
That's why Ryo-kun was avoiding the issue.

299
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:03,930
If he doesn't give you the answer you want, don't let it shake you.

300
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,600
Don't let your emotions take over.

301
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,080
That's what you need to be ready for. Can you do it?

302
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,870
Thank you, Sone-chan.

303
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,890
I've steeled myself.

304
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,330
Got it. I'll stay for just one drink.

305
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:21,220
Thank you.

306
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,580
All right.

307
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,370
You're doing great.

308
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:35,310
Okay, one, two.

309
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,550
Daddy, do your best at work!

310
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:42,580
Thank you, Anju. I'll do my best.

311
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,860
Okay! Daddy, I love you!

312
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,720
Anju!

313
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,330
I also love you the most in this world!

314
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,080
Hang on! Wait!

315
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,890
Wait! Stop!

316
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,250
I liked him!

317
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,310
I loved him!

318
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:15,880
I... really wanted to marry him!

319
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,630
It was worse than we thought.

320
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,840
I really considered marrying him,

321
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,010
but he betrayed me!

322
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:32,830
He's married and has a child!

323
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,290
I really loved him!

324
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:38,680
But...

325
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,970
Meguro-chan, I thought you'd move on quickly...

326
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,130
But you're bawling.

327
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,300
Sone-san!

328
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,880
What a coincidence.

329
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,880
I was also drinking nearby.

330
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,050
If possible, how about sharing a drink?

331
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,520
Oh, I'm Hiroto, Utsunomiya Hiroto.

332
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,420
- Last week, we were at the bar together─ 
 - Dude!

333
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,620
You have horrible timing.

334
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,310
This isn't the time for drinks.

335
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:25,320
- Pardon? 
 - I have to get going.

336
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,050
- Apologies. 
 - I can't leave her alone.

337
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:37,250
- Yes, of course. 
 - I mean...

338
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,410
This is too entertaining!

339
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:42,200
E-Entertaining?

340
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,750
Hey!

341
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,540
Um...

342
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:50,090
If possible, can I have your number?

343
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,250
"If possible"?

344
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:55,480
Then no, it's not possible. See you!

345
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,510
♫  Hey, ladies, where you at? So let's start it (let's start it)  ♫

346
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:02,720
♫  Can you feel your heart's exploding?  ♫ 
 ♫  Let's get through the night  ♫

347
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,210
Does she despise me?

348
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,100
   
 Are you waiting for Sone-chan? 

349
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,290
 No, not at all. 

350
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:13,410
 It's fine if I'm happy now. 

351
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,380
 I'll only say it once. 

352
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,640
 - Okay! 
 - 0-8-0. 

353
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,840
 - 0-8-0... 
 - 7-2... 

354
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,510
 See you! 

355
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,000
 So I have a chance.
