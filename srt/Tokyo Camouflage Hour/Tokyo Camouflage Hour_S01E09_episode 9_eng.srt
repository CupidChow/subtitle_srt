1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,360
Oh, such is youth!

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,110
That just means you didn't like her.

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,140
That's not it.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:18,830
Here in Tokyo, there's a large gap between "liking," and "not disliking" someone.

5
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,260
I can almost imagine what you looked like when you gave her the final blow.

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,780
 Why are you crying? 

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,830
I guess that girl's like your melon soda.

8
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,600
- Pardon? 
 - Look.

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,930
You stopped drinking it halfway.

10
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,730
You ordered it knowing that you wouldn't finish it.

11
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,930
When you first met her, you thought she was cute.

12
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:59,950
But once she was yours, you found it a hassle to get along with her.

13
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:06,100
Spending time with her got annoying, so you shoved her away and felt guilty about it.

14
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,610
After that, you avoided her because ending it felt like a pain.

15
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,660
Just like your melon soda, you wanted her without really needing her.

16
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,220
I get it, so stop preaching to me.

17
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,480
That's the experience of youth.

18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,910
That's true.

19
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:27,750
But youth isn't an excuse to toy with people's feelings and hurt them.

20
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,990
You're cornering me with these statements.

21
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,320
Let me say one last thing.

22
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,640
Yes?

23
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,020
If someone older is paying, you should finish whatever you ordered.

24
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,390
Sorry.

25
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,400
You're pretty eager even after all this talk.

26
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,550
Sorry, it's the chief.

27
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,160
Hello?

28
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,920
A transfer?

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,070
We're discussing it.

30
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,640
But it hasn't been long since I came to Tokyo.

31
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,260
I'm sorry, but is it something I did?

32
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:16,630
That's not it, but two employees in Yamagata suddenly quit.

33
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,560
Therefore, we need someone who's familiar with that region.

34
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,310
That's why you were recommended.

35
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,160
I see.

36
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,850
It's a pity for me, especially since you've been working hard.

37
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,900
But the choice is up to you, so give it some thought.

38
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,810
I'll leave you to it.

39
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:50,670
  ­ 

40
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,250
What? You're returning to Yamagata?

41
00:02:53,250 --> 00:03:00,300
Yeah, but it hasn't been decided yet. It seems like I'm popular back there.

42
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,400
You get to choose, don't you?

43
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,200
   

44
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,040
In that case, you should stay in Tokyo.

45
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,350
I mean, you've just found a salon to frequent, and a dentist who isn't too peculiar.

46
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,560
Things are just kicking off for you.

47
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,520
But I just don't have one.

48
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,280
What don't you have?

49
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,360
A reason to remain in Tokyo.

50
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,660
You can make tons of that up for yourself.

51
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,780
Have you fallen in love with anyone?

52
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,620
I guess so.

53
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,180
Wanting to meet someone here is a good enough reason to stay.

54
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,900
Anyway, I'm against this.

55
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,020
This company is truly horrible.

56
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,450
I'm off.

57
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:06,080
 Timing and Subtitles by the 
 ☕️ Golden Hour 👠 Team @Viki.com 

58
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,660
 How about Shimouma? 

59
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,950
 Shimouma? 

60
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,620
 You can still barely flex with that. 

61
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,610
 Sone-san, I'm sure you despise guys like me. 

62
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,070
 There you go again. Trying to get me to say, "No, that's not true." 

63
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:52,770
 Sorry. This might be annoying for you, but I want to do it again. 

64
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,890
 Why do you think I let you stay over? 

65
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:02,370
 Why do men look so sexy when they're drenched? 

66
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,480
   

67
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,570
That took pretty long.

68
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,180
Yeah.

69
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,430
How was the date with Section Chief Yoshida?

70
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,080
You recommended Section Chief Yoshida to her?

71
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,460
Yes, he always thought Meguro-san was charming.

72
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,220
So, I thought I had to match-make them somehow.

73
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,880
- Good work today. 
 -  You too. 

74
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,390
When it comes to boyfriends, guys like Section Chief Yoshida are unexpectedly great.

75
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,920
If you were his girlfriend, your life would be a breeze.

76
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,590
Sorry, I can't work overtime.

77
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,520
I'll get back to the client.

78
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,770
Thank you!

79
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,500
Well, that is true.

80
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,320
He doesn't have striking features and a rather forgettable face.

81
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,650
But he's manly, and isn't a bad guy.

82
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,700
Exactly. Don't you agree, Meguro-san?

83
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,620
But he doesn't make my heart race.

84
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,940
Pardon?

85
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,930
What's the point of dating someone who doesn't make your heart race?

86
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:38,040
Here's the thing about earnest and unpopular guys.

87
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,380
If they ever cheat on you,

88
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,110
it'd be a thousand times more infuriating than a handsome man cheating on you.

89
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,960
I fully agree.

90
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,360
It'd be impossible to recover from that.

91
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:55,830
That's why I don't date earnest and unpopular men.

92
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,970
But he's a great marriage candidate.

93
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,800
Think about your happiness.

94
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,260
Happiness, huh?

95
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,920
Anyway, I'm looking for a guy who makes my heart race.

96
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,630
One who's so charming, he would practically have other girls waiting on him.

97
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,180
He also has to be a looker, have a sense of humor

98
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,040
and be able to say "I love you" straight to my face.

99
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,490
If only there was a guy like that out there waiting for me.

100
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:28,000
Well, he certainly doesn't exist in the entire city of Tokyo.

101
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,510
I thought you moved on.

102
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,780
But I guess he's still tucked away in your heart.

103
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,440
What?

104
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,620
Can I say something annoying?

105
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,480
Don't do it.

106
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,160
What is happiness to you?

107
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,950
Getting married and having a wholesome family.

108
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,810
Then wouldn't Section Chief Yoshida be a great pick?

109
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,380
You're so mean.

110
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:08,500
Aren't you tired of being swept along by stereotypes of happiness?

111
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,480
You don't have to wear yourself out like this.

112
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,220
Hello?

113
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,620
It's Utsunomiya.

114
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,070
 What is it? 

115
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:44,810
You know... What are you doing next Sunday?

116
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,960
Nothing much.

117
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,520
Hey...

118
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,060
I have somewhere I want to go with you.

119
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,850
Sure, I'll make time.

120
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,000
Really?

121
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:09,510
I'll text you later then.

122
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,430
Got it.

123
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,810
Bye then. Good night.

124
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,510
 Yes. 

125
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,950
Sone-san!

126
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,370
Hey there.

127
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,450
Thank you for making time for me today.

128
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,240
Don't be so polite. We aren't at work.

129
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,040
Sorry. I wanted to take you somewhere today.

130
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,590
Sounds nice. Where are we going?

131
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,980
I'd like to visit this place.

132
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,810
   

133
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,040
Yamagata?

134
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,370
Yes, I wanted to help you learn about Yamagata.

135
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,870
And why do you want to do that?

136
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,220
Sone-san, you're rather hasty, huh.

137
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,870
You've become pretty blunt.

138
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,630
Let's go.

139
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,870
I think Tokyo's a great place.

140
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:30,470
There are so many people here and opportunities for new encounters here.

141
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,610
I also met you because I came to Tokyo.

142
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,770
But...

143
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,480
I also think Yamagata's a great place.

144
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,370
That won't change, no matter where I end up.

145
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,680
Not everything is about Tokyo.

146
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,310
Either way, it's nice to share this appreciation you have with someone.

147
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,510
And not with just anyone, but with you.

148
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,710
What are you hinting at?

149
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,850
So hasty.

150
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,110
Sorry! Let's go.

151
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,300
This local liquor tastes amazing!

152
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,370
Here, you can try it.

153
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,910
Thank you for the drink.

154
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,990
Thank you.

155
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,310
This is delicious! So smooth!

156
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,950
Exactly, I thought you'd like it.

157
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,540
This is really good.

158
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,340
Delicious.

159
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,610
Konjac balls are like Yamagata's soul food.

160
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,410
It also tastes great with mustard.

161
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,010
There's squid in this soy sauce seasoning.

162
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,680
As a child, I had this often as a snack.

163
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,470
Oh, let's take a photo.

164
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,120
- No thank you. 
 - Why not?

165
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,030
- Right now? 
 - Okay, say cheese!

166
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,890
Look, it's a great photo.

167
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,200
- Cute. 
 - Yeah.

168
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,580
This ramen won the Japanese Provincial Ramen Contest of 2023.

169
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,980
It's known for its chewy, curly, medium-thick noodles and savory fish stock.

170
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,430
You're like some kind of Yamagata ambassador.

171
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,170
You're exaggerating.

172
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,780
Oh, the hot springs are really famous as well.

173
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,100
I really recommend Ginzen Hot Springs.

174
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,870
I saw some great drinking snacks over there. Follow me.

175
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,800
Preserved veggies... Oh, there they are.

176
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,360
Open up, Minami.

177
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,400
Minami!

178
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,640
I'm done with you.

179
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,530
So please, leave.

180
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:53,240
Minami, I came here to apologize.

181
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,090
 It's freezing out here. 

182
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,250
Delicious.

183
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,840
Minami, why are you upset?

184
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,490
Didn't you come here to apologize?

185
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,010
I came here because I missed you.

186
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,810
Do you even hear yourself?

187
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:19,960
You have a wife, a child, and other women.

188
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,300
I'm at my limit.

189
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:29,140
Even if I'm gone, you can return home to your wife and child.

190
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,740
But I have no one else waiting for me.

191
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,260
I care about you the most, but I can't get the same treatment from you.

192
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,170
That's way too unfair.

193
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,510
I'm sorry, Minami.

194
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:59,320
I... was being really mean.

195
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,010
But I don't want to lose you.

196
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,890
Stop it already, I don't want to hear it.

197
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,150
I like you the most.

198
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,360
But things don't always go well.

199
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,230
I'm also at a loss.

200
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,440
I'm sorry for hurting you.

201
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,980
You're horrible.

202
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,730
The worst!

203
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:30,810
When you say that, I can't get angry at you.

204
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,200
I've had enough.

205
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,760
Wait, Minami!

206
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,710
Minami! Wait!

207
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,430
Minami!

208
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,760
Look at me.

209
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,360
I don't want to.

210
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,340
I'm sick of getting hurt!

211
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,920
Let me say it again.

212
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,220
I love you, Minami.

213
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,840
Liar.

214
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,700
You're such a liar!

215
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,330
Minami, you're the only one on my mind.

216
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,820
Ryo-kun.

217
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,700
Can you just do one thing for me?

218
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,300
What is it?

219
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,620
You can lie or do whatever you need to.

220
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,550
Always make me feel like I am everything for you.

221
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,570
Don't ever let me catch on to the truth.

222
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:56,690
Hey, Minami. Can I tell you the truth?

223
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,410
Yes?

224
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,250
You're the only one I truly care about.

225
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:09,070
I'm not hiding anything.

226
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,460
Even now,

227
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,600
I'm really turned on.

228
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,540
Ryo-kun, you're indeed crazy.

229
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,650
I get that often.

230
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,550
Here, you must be freezing.

231
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,700
Thank you.

232
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,600
All right, how about we visit Singapore?

233
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,780
What?

234
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,960
Mind traveling. Close your eyes.

235
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:05,680
Let's spin.

236
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,520
Oh, do you see the Merlion? Over there! 
  (T/N: Singapore's official mascot) 

237
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,420
It's spouting so much water today!

238
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,790
Yeah.

239
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,330
I had a lot of fun today.

240
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:25,600
Yamagata is surprisingly diverse.

241
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,580
I'm glad.

242
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,620
But why me?

243
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:36,470
What about the girl at the restaurant? Are you sure you don't want to be with her?

244
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,740
Yes.

245
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,160
Is that so?

246
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,600
I've gotten a clear idea of Yamagata.

247
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,610
Actually, I...

248
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,910
might be returning to Yamagata.

249
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,990
I see.

250
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:22,840
I never worked hard for any particular purpose.

251
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:28,740
Instead, I've lived a relatively fun and happy life.

252
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:35,960
I thought coming to Tokyo would change something.

253
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,860
But...

254
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:47,650
Tokyo is unexpectedly rough.

255
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,690
It's a lonely place.

256
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,910
Do you dislike Tokyo?

257
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,330
I have no clue.

258
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:06,580
I think I prefer Yamagata.

259
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:15,710
But right now, I want to remain in Tokyo.

260
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,900
And the reason for that...

261
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:25,240
is you, Sone-san.

262
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,250
If you weren't in Tokyo,

263
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,840
this place would've been difficult and lonely to live in.

264
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,080
It's full of fake smiles.

265
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,610
But spending time in Tokyo with you...

266
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,790
was fun.

267
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,390
So enjoyable.

268
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:07,080
Immensely so.

269
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,240
What the heck?

270
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,720
So you're staying here for a woman, too.

271
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,620
Is that so wrong?

272
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:26,730
Losing yourself over a woman is rather adorable.

273
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,550
I'm such a loser, aren't I?

274
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,220
♫  To quench my loneliness, I poured myself some sparkling wine  ♫

275
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,010
Huh?

276
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,870
You're waiting to hear, "That's not true." Right?

277
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:01,640
♫  Our eyes meet through the glass,  ♫ 
 ♫  Every plan for tomorrow  ♫

278
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,430
Can we stay like this a little longer?

279
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,670
Just a little longer.

280
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,640
♫  Pushing, pulling, and this frustrating camouflage  ♫

281
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,300
♫  Even if it is a lie, nicely done (done, done)  ♫

282
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,670
♫  Would like to feel and touch it, this insufficient sabotage  ♫

283
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:26,650
♫  At this moment, let it unfold,  ♫ 
 ♫  Tokyo crazy night  ♫

284
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,600
♫  Tokyo crazy night  ♫

285
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,850
♫  Got me falling deep  ♫

286
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,360
So, you two are back together?

287
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,020
Yeah.

288
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,810
But I'm just a hopelessly dumb woman.

289
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:02,700
As long as Ryo-kun keeps lying, I'll be happy.

290
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,090
Lies, huh.

291
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:24,490
I have something I need to tell you.

292
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,150
What is it?

293
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:30,920
I'm moving overseas next month.

294
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,710
What?

295
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:36,270
Hang on, next month?

296
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,080
Are you moving for work?

297
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,270
No, I'm getting married.

298
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,280
Married?

299
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:56,980
 Timing and Subtitles by the 
 ☕️ Golden Hour 👠 Team @Viki.com 

300
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:03,560
   
 From my perspective, I'm the one choosing. It only hurts when I'm not chosen. 

301
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,260
 Nasu-Nakanishi's... 

302
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,170
 Even I have times when I feel like crying. 

303
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,950
 There's no way to predict the future. 

304
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,420
 All beginnings and ends hit you unexpectedly. 

305
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:14,000
 Goodbye then.
