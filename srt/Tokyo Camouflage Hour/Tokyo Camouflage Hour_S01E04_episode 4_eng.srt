1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,060
Well...

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,310
If we're talking about this year, it has to be "Desert of Namibia."

3
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,480
- Right. 
 - You've watched it?

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,420
No.

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:27,990


6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,790
Do you watch movies often? I only catch two or three a year.

7
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,590
I guess I do, since it's important for my job.

8
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,730
I see.

9
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,400
Advertising must be tough work. Even yesterday you took the last train home, right?

10
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,200
It's known for being brutal.

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,060
Sometimes, I don't even go home for days.

12
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,220
- That happens? 
 - Yeah, definitely.

13
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,620
Must be hard on you.

14
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,740
You look like you love anmitsu. 
  (T/N: Japanese dessert) 

15
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,120
- Not really. 
 - Oh, is that so?

16
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,200
- I see. 
 - It must be because I haven't eaten it for a while.

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,950
So that's why you're so eager to have it.

18
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,550
- Thank you for tonight. 
 - Same here.

19
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,540
Good night.

20
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,590
She's lovely.

21
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,050
She smiles a lot and we got along well.

22
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:44,180
He only talked about himself and never asked about me.

23
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,760
I could barely keep the conversation going.

24
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,970
Yes, she even offered to pay for the meal.

25
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,350
She's totally the type to become a great wife.

26
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,090
He's older and works at an advertising firm, but he wants to split the bill at a cafe?

27
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,820
I think she's worth a second date.

28
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,660
Yeah, indeed.

29
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:08,050
Exactly, that's why he's single despite appearing like a good catch.

30
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,800
I felt like killing someone.

31
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,660
I'm moving on.

32
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,120
Yeah, exactly!

33
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,030
And he was stuffing his face with anmitsu. It wasn't even the main course.

34
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,220
   

35
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,540
Sone-san!

36
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,230
Oh.

37
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,250
Hey...

38
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:35,050
The text.

39
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:38,510
I received a text message from you yesterday.

40
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,230
   
   

41
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,600
I'm pretty sure this isn't you.

42
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,030
Oops, you found out?

43
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,340
I'm glad.

44
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,680
At first, I thought you were pranking me by texting in Korean.

45
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,780
So I replied with a translator.

46
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,630
But I got suspicious after four messages and called, only for a man to pick up.

47
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,810
- He said he was... 
 - Kim Ha Neul.

48
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,560
Yes.

49
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,620
Are you free on Saturday?

50
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,080
- What? 
 - Let's hang out on Saturday.

51
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,490
Okay.

52
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,060
♫  Just a night of lies can make you fall  ♫

53
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,190
♫  See the lights behind these concrete walls  ♫

54
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,600
♫  You can't deny, so gimme something (gimme something)  ♫

55
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,360
   

56
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,330
   

57
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:53,580
   

58
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,120
   
   

59
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,810
Good morning!

60
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,190
It's only Wednesday.

61
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,970
And tomorrow's Thursday.

62
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,640
- You're acting like you scored a vacation. 
 - I did?

63
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,910
Your energy is scaring me. Have you grown wings?

64
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,900
Wings? What do you think I am? Red Bull?

65
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,620
Oh, Red Bull.

66
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,000
Utsunomiya-kun, do you have a minute?

67
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,780
Yes, sir.

68
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,830
It's regarding our ideas for the Mongolian fair in Marunouchi.

69
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,480
Can you come up with five proposals, each with a presentation?

70
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,250
Five of them?

71
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,250
It's really too many, isn't it?

72
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,910
I really get it, but I was assigned with a sudden work trip.

73
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,840
I'm not such a sadistic man that I'd push such a tough task onto my subordinate.

74
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,820
- If anything, I'm the opposite. 
 - I'll do it.

75
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,080
Please let me do it.

76
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,730
Really?

77
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,200
It's not because you find me annoying, right?

78
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,900
By when do you need it?

79
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,640
By Friday.

80
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:47,120
- If Friday's too much of a rush, then Saturday... 
 - I'll get it done by Friday.

81
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,940
Thank you.

82
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,500
Five proposals, huh...

83
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,900
   
   

84
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,970
All right, let's do this.

85
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,800
Minami, have you always worn these earrings?

86
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,270
This pair? I bought them recently because they caught my eye.

87
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,050
From that antique shop in Aoyama?

88
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,380
Wow, how did you know?

89
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,890
The items loved by my lover speak to me.

90
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,420
Ryo-kun...

91
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,300
You got back together?

92
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,520
Yeah.

93
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,540
But she blocked your number.

94
00:06:55,450 --> 00:07:00,170
I persuaded her to let me into her house with a cake in my hand.

95
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,320
That worked?

96
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,620
Well, I guess it did.

97
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:14,390
Tons of guys don't bother remembering the simplest things.

98
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:18,700
Like what their girlfriends eat or the things they like.

99
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:25,120
Then there's the extra effort of getting items such as a cake, which is sold out by noon.

100
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,360
When a guy bothers to care, you're happy, right?

101
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,660
And I'm capable of putting in that effort.

102
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,750
Doesn't that make me the best?

103
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,840
You know, Ryo.

104
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,770
What do you even like about her?

105
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,000
She's a dumb beauty with a chest.

106
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,090
- That's the reason? 
 - Isn't she perfect?

107
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,140
Excuse me!

108
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,660
Yes?

109
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,440
I want to see a different magic trick.

110
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,060
A magic trick?

111
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,890
Sure.

112
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,640
Which one should I perform...

113
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,790
 Your happiness now is also tinged with such concerns. 

114
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,350
 I hope you're aware of that. 

115
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,650
Wow, it's different! Amazing!

116
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:36,000
- Right? 
 - Yeah! Why is it different?

117
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,640
It's magic.

118
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,600
What kind of magic?

119
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,040
Ryo-kun's magic.

120
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,060
- Ryo-kun's magic? 
 - That's right.

121
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,920
   
   

122
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,710
   

123
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,550
   
   

124
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:34,670
When I first came here, I headed straight for...

125
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,800
Shimokita, right?

126
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,410
- Wow, that's surprising. 
 - Not really.

127
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,640
My girlfriend's from Tokyo anyway.

128
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,490
I can't possibly invite her to check out Asakusa.

129
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,010
So, you picked Shimokita?

130
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:51,510
I mean, can you get to Parco in Shibuya without a map? 
  (T/N: Shopping center) 

131
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,410
- Nope. 
 - Can you find Shinjuku's west exit right away?

132
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,810
- Nope. 
 - So, it had to be Shimokita.

133
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,710
Well, have you decided?

134
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,640
- Decided on what? 
 - Isn't it the first date?

135
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,210
   

136
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,750
   
   

137
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,770
He hit me with the "So..."

138
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,120
"So"?

139
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,280
It was our first date, and we went to chat over tea.

140
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,600
He said it when it was time to part ways.

141
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,810
Japanese is an amazing language, right?

142
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,140
Indeed. A single word conveys everything.

143
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,870
That's not the point.

144
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,180
Sorry.

145
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:00,880
Isn't the first date a time to find out more about the other party?

146
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,940
Like if you met in a group, it's a chance to get along as a pair?

147
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,420
Yes! Now, the first date's over.

148
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:14,420
The only choice left to make is whether he's worth it or not.

149
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,260
But he's not an option for you, right?

150
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,760
Not after that "So..."

151
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,570
Then you have your answer, and all it took was one date.

152
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,640
Even after several dates,

153
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:31,180
it only takes a split second to decide if you like or dislike a person.

154
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,220
Isn't that right...

155
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,340
   

156
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,470
Huh?

157
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:56,500
   

158
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,900
Where's Kita-Ayase?

159
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,260
   

160
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,060
Damn it.

161
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,740
   

162
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,620
It's terrible.

163
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,170
You're here.

164
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:55,340
I thought Kim Ha Neul-san might appear.

165
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,470
I want to a visit a shop in Kameari.

166
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,880
But this is Kita-Ayase.

167
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,360
Yes, that's right.

168
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,570
It's just a short walk away.

169
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,570
Got it.

170
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,380
- Hello! 
 - Hello!

171
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,350
Hello.

172
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:21,690
Why did we meet at Kita-Ayase if we're going to Kameari?

173
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,040
It's a train station I've only heard about.

174
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:30,180
But getting off at a station you've never been to before brings surprises.

175
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:35,790
Like finding a wonderful park or a charming curio shop.

176
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:41,250
I like to slowly fall in love with new places like that.

177
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,340
That's quite wonderful.

178
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:48,190
Takada Junji isn't the only one allowed to enjoy new places. 
  (T/N: Hosts a travel show) 

179
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,210
It's over there.

180
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,900
I get sudden cravings for this restaurant's dishes.

181
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,300
- Delicious. 
 - Right?

182
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,130
The rich red bean here is irresistible.

183
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,400
You're really cool, Sone-san.

184
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:25,890
You get off at earlier stops and frequent such chic places...

185
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,630
Isn't that pretty normal?

186
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,620
No, it's not.

187
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:35,570
Leaving my hometown has left me with anxiety and feeling like an outsider.

188
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,450
So, I've been frantically trying to fit in.

189
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,290
You've already done that.

190
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,810
What?

191
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:46,260
Shibuya and Shimokita...

192
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:51,140
Oh, even Sancha. You look like the youngsters who hang out at such spots.

193
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,210
That isn't a compliment, right?

194
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,190
But you want to fit in, right?

195
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:00,300
Yeah, I do.

196
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,200
Um...

197
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,190
I'm Utsunomiya.

198
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,730
I mean, you've never called me by my name.

199
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,930
I was wondering if you forgot.

200
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,670
Do you remember the day we first met?

201
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,850
I thought city life was so great back then.

202
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:37,490
I was finally in Tokyo, and life was fast-paced.

203
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:42,770
I was meeting women and all that. It was overwhelming in a way.

204
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:53,250
But our walk that night reminded me how amazing Tokyo is.

205
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,550
Therefore, I wanted to fit in.

206
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,970
That's why...

207
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,170
No, that won't cut it.

208
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,520
- What? 
 - Here it comes.

209
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,020
How can I enjoy fried rice like this?

210
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:14,090
The staff are staring at us because we interrupted their lunch break.

211
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:17,220
There's no way I can swallow my food.

212
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:22,330
- But they said it's fine. 
 - That's because you asked if they were on break

213
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,610
and then made a face.

214
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,860
That was embarrassing.

215
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,330
Come on...

216
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,830
I've had enough. We're breaking up.

217
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,400
- What? 
 - Can you not do that?

218
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,580
That's the only response to breaking up over fried rice.

219
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,860
You were the one who insisted on eating it.

220
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,810
What did I even do wrong?

221
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,430
Should we leave?

222
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:51,340
But we're getting to the best part.

223
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,060
Were you listening to me?

224
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,020
What's your problem? I even made time to come here with you.

225
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:02,420
- What? 
 - You're saying the same thing.

226
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,200
How long have they been here?

227
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:10,100
That is exactly...

228
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,160
what pisses me off about you!

229
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,760
Huh?

230
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,520
Hang on.

231
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,320
Wait.

232
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,320
Stop! Wait!

233
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,420
What was that?

234
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:14,300
It was the best! What a show!

235
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,980
You must be cold.

236
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,330
You know what?

237
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:41,730
Why do men look so sexy when they're drenched?

238
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,720
Well...

239
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,760
I'll get going.

240
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,580
I have a date with Ezra after this.

241
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,010
Ez... What?

242
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,200
Thank you for today.

243
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,990
Ez... Ez...

244
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,940
Ezra.

245
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,550
- Is he Japanese? 
 - He's British.

246
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,640
British?

247
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,420
Bye then.

248
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,660
If it's a date...

249
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,530
Does that mean you're dating someone?

250
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,450
How should I put it...

251
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,160
That's my life, isn't it?

252
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,450
You're right.

253
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,180
I have to get going.

254
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,310
Hey.

255
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:56,790
Enjoy your date.

256
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,070
Bye.

257
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,840
Bye-bye.

258
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,250
- Hello? 
 -  It's Noda. 

259
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,000
 Thank you for the proposals. 

260
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,080
You're welcome.

261
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,670
 However, I am sorry to say that it needs to be redone. 

262
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,590
- What? 
 -  I'm really sorry about this. 

263
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:36,540
 I shouldn't have pushed you so hard when you're still settling in. My bad. 

264
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,610
- I'll head back to the office right away. 
 -  I'll handle it. 

265
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,170
 Can you send me the original data? 

266
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,960
- But... 
 -  Thank you. 

267
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,720
Sorry.

268
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,670
Life in Tokyo is tough.

269
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:41,370
♫  To quench my loneliness, I poured myself some sparkling wine  ♫

270
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:46,870
♫  Fleeing from reality, as if I were leaving everything behind  ♫

271
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:53,050
   

272
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,990
♫  Every plan for tomorrow is gulped down  ♫

273
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:03,200
♫  Mind and body are emptied  ♫

274
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,000
♫  Until we drown  ♫

275
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,730
♫  Pushing, pulling, and this frustrating camouflage  ♫

276
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:12,380
♫  Even if it is a lie, nicely done (done, done)  ♫

277
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,790
♫  Would like to feel and touch it, this insufficient sabotage  ♫

278
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,590
♫  You and me tonight, all night long  ♫

279
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,510
♫  Like this we fly  ♫

280
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,800
♫  Together we glide  ♫

281
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,920
   

282
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,800
♫  At this moment, let it unfold  ♫

283
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:40,310
♫  Tokyo crazy night,  ♫ 
 ♫  Tokyo crazy night, got me falling deep  ♫

284
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,100
   
   

285
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:56,810


286
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,080
   
 I thought life would change once I got to Tokyo. 

287
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,080
 Didn't you think life would be more dramatic? 

288
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,720
 Does it really matter? 

289
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,790
 It's our life. 

290
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,890
 That's why Tokyo's great. 

291
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,000
 Tokyo's the best!
