1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,460
 I also want to get married. 

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,770
 Marriage is just a bond written on a piece of paper. 

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:13,020
 Daddy, do your best at work! 

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,560
 Hang on! Wait! 

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,410
 Wait! Stop! 

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,780
 I liked him! 

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,840
 I loved him! 

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,260
 I... really wanted to marry him! 

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,330
Sone-san!

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,120
You have horrible timing.

11
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,680
- Apologies. 
 - I can't leave her alone.

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,800
- Yes, of course. 
 - I mean...

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,990
This is too entertaining!

14
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,670
E-Entertaining?

15
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,340
Hey!

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,100
Um...

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,620
If possible, can I have your number?

18
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,500
"If possible"? Then no, it's not possible.

19
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,460
Your earnestness is way too blinding to handle.

20
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,310
Well...

21
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,310
I didn't mean to come off like that.

22
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,060
Have I caused some sort of misunderstanding?

23
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,450
I don't have a single friend in Tokyo,

24
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:36,200
so I thought it'd be nice to have at least a drinking buddy...

25
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,980
0-8-0.

26
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,900
I'm in a hurry, so I'll only say it once.

27
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,560
- Okay! 
 - 0-8-0.

28
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,630
- 0-8-0... 
 - 7-2-0-2...

29
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,490
Okay.

30
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,880
I'll hang out with you if I'm in the mood.

31
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,790
See you!

32
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,370
Bye.

33
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,050
So I have a chance.

34
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:19,070
  ­ 

35
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,980
Hello. 
    

36
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,470
I've made up my mind.

37
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,130
I'll break up with Ryo-kun!

38
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,840
Guess you're really determined if you're shouting it out loud.

39
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,690
You really bawled a lifetime's worth of tears last night.

40
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,770
I'll support you in this decision.

41
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,200
Come here for a bit.

42
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,340
Look at this.

43
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,540
All I have to do is send this. 
    

44
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,090
That's a good message. Send it.

45
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,880
You still have feelings for him after all, don't you?

46
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,110
I don't! There's not a single shred left for him.

47
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,290
Great, then send the message.

48
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,620
What do you want to do?

49
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,060
Hang on. 
    

50
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,470
- What's going on? 
 - Look at this!

51
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,880
No way! I was quite a fan of his. 
    

52
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,870
Between affection and sexual desire,

53
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,040
men ultimately choose sex.

54
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,120
When his wife needed him most? I'll never be with such a guy!

55
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,460
Don't act so surprised now.

56
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,390
This is pretty common, in fact.

57
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,120
Senior Mitsuki?

58
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,810
If some married man I've ended ties with contacted me out of the blue,

59
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,820
I'd intuitively know that he has a baby on the way.

60
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,590
Is that because of some kind of telepathic link?

61
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:57,720
When a guy's wife returns to her hometown, it's a heaven-sent chance for him.

62
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:04,310
And if his wife's in the last month of pregnancy, he'll be at the peak of desperation.

63
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,270
Got it?

64
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:10,480
He's not having an affair because his wife is pregnant.

65
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,350
He's having it because he's desperate to prove himself while his wife is pregnant.

66
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,590
That's just a man's biological instinct.

67
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,560
Meguro-chan, those were words worth paying for.

68
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:39,930


69
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,870
How is it?

70
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,330
Have you decided to send it to him?

71
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,990
There you are! Meguro-san!

72
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:04,110
- Yes? 
 - Are you dating anyone right now?

73
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,370
- I guess not. 
 - Great!

74
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,190
What do you think of this guy?

75
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,550
Well... he looks earnest.

76
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,890
Right? I got to know him while drinking at Sancha yesterday. Can I introduce you to him?

77
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,530
- Introduce us? 
 - He's a civil servant.

78
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,460
He isn't a looker, but he's serious.

79
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,710
Please consider it!

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,050
Stability is best in a marriage, isn't it?

81
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,640
I guess so.

82
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,970
Maybe I should meet him once.

83
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,460
What do you think?

84
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:52,890
The conversation will be so boring, you'll call up a guy friend to drown your sorrows.

85
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:57,120
Either that, or you'll be reminded of how much you like scumbags,

86
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,980
and find yourself right back at Ryo-kun's bar.

87
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,100
Both outcomes are entirely possible.

88
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,450
But we might get along if I just meet him.

89
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,610
Calling a guy earnest just means he has nothing else to offer.

90
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,080
You're right.

91
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,400
But it's your choice.

92
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:20,340
As the saying goes, "When one door closes, another opens."

93
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,850
   

94
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,860
I sent it.

95
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,770
Good job.

96
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,340
- Is this your child? 
 - Yes.

97
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,690
- So adorable! 
 - Right?

98
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,810
- She looks like me, doesn't she? 
 -  So cute! 

99
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,530
   

100
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,020
Their noses are almost identical.

101
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,720
- I can see the resemblance. 
 - They look so much alike!

102
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,610
- Excuse me! 
 - Yes?

103
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,380
Can I have another Oolong Highball?

104
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,420
Certainly.

105
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,370
Hey, are you waiting for someone?

106
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,940
- Pardon? 
 - You've been dropping by often.

107
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,260
No, not at all.

108
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,120
Are you waiting for Sone-chan?

109
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,360
No.

110
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,330
I just moved to Tokyo.

111
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,970
- I don't know many other bars. 
 - If you'd like, I can call her over.

112
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,680
She's a friend of a friend.

113
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,420
No, it's fine.

114
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,950
Got it.

115
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,330
   

116
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,620
If she's in the mood...

117
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,300
 The number you called is not available. 

118
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,650
 Please leave a message after the beep. 

119
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:38,260
We'll hear an answer before 1pm tomorrow.

120
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,190
Okay. We're entering crunch time.

121
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:46,470
Let's stick to the plan and get our clients on the same page as soon as possible.

122
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,660
 Yes, sir. 

123
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:52,010
Please hand me the meeting minutes before we go, Utsunomiya-kun.

124
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,730
- Yes, sir. 
 - Great.

125
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,210
- That's all for today. 
 -  Thank you. 

126
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,810
- Great work. 
 - You too.

127
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,740
   

128
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:35,470
   

129
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:50,040
Utsunomiya! Where's the presentation for Every Insurance?

130
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,220
- I'm working on it. 
 - That's too slow.

131
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,320
Get your priorities straight.

132
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,380
Yes, sir. Sorry about that.

133
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:16,760
Your hobby is watching movies?

134
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,360
What genre do you prefer?

135
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,090
English movies like "Iron Man."

136
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:26,900
Is "Iron Man" part of the "Terminator" series?

137
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,780
It belongs to Marvel, adapted from American comics.

138
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,920
American comics...

139
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,110
Right.

140
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,840
What do you do on your days off?

141
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,660
Well, I stay at home.

142
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:11,200
I clean the house, do the laundry, enjoy a drink, and the day is over.

143
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,390
Home is always the best. I love preparing snacks for myself.

144
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:20,620
I don't eat much, so snacks are out of the question for me.

145
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,800
I see.

146
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:43,190
You know...

147
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,040
Yes?

148
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,410
Meguro-san, you're really refined and ladylike.

149
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,230
Is that so?

150
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,040
This isn't about your appearance.

151
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,140
You simply seem like a really virtuous and kind woman.

152
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,740
Thank you.

153
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,140
I had a great time. Thank you so much.

154
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,780
Me too. Thank you for the meal.

155
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,080
Let's keep in touch.

156
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,630
"This isn't about your appearance"?

157
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,070
That wasn't a compliment, not in the slightest.

158
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,650
They don't pay for overtime work.

159
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,890
- Good evening. 
 - Are you working on the presentation?

160
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:05,490
Yes, but there is still a lot to do.

161
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,550
Thank you.

162
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,130
Another gorgeous Tokyo night.

163
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:22,070
But the Tokyo Tower looks scary from our office.

164
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,610
It's scary?

165
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:34,660
When I just came to Tokyo, I was grateful and bursting with excitement.

166
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:41,030
But now I'm reminded that I'm in Tokyo.

167
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,540
The fear of loneliness creeps up.

168
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,230
Even now...

169
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,550
I question what I'm feeling.

170
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:58,290
It must be because I'm a country bumpkin.

171
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:04,380
Sorry, that sentiment is beyond me since I grew up in Meguro.

172
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,410
I see...

173
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:11,560
But the loneliness of isolation has nothing to do with the birthplace.

174
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,790
Everyone's plagued by some kind of loneliness.

175
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,740
Even you?

176
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,770
On particularly lonely nights, I make sure not to sleep alone.

177
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,230
How about going to Korido?

178
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,410
No, thanks.

179
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,090
I'll pass.

180
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,970
Then don't overwork yourself.

181
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,530
Yes, sir.

182
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,150
Ryo-kun?

183
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:43,140
I brought your favorite Basque cheesecake. Let's have it together.

184
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,380
Open up.

185
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,700
I told you it's over for us.

186
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,790
Didn't you read my LINE message?

187
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,240
 Don't be so cold. 

188
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,720
I bet you don't know what I went through by sending that!

189
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,010
After all, you already have a wife!

190
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,580
 Minami! Open the door! 

191
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:17,380
Hey, the entire hall will hear us if we talk like this.

192
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,060
 Minami! 

193
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,360
Please?

194
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,980
You opened the door.

195
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,350
You're the worst.

196
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,120
Looks delicious.

197
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,000
Do you want a spoon or a fork?

198
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:43,810
You lied about our relationship, and that's the first thing you say?

199
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,920
Huh?

200
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:52,010
Aren't you the least bit guilty now that you're here after your lie has been exposed?

201
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,770
Did I ever lie?

202
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,920
What?

203
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,940
You said you weren't dating anyone when we were a couple.

204
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,060
Exactly.

205
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,400
I didn't have a girlfriend back then.

206
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,230
- What about your wife? 
 - Yeah, I was already married.

207
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,570
I married her before we started seeing each other.

208
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,310
What?

209
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:20,290
But having a wife isn't the same as having a girlfriend.

210
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,210
What do you mean by that?

211
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,080
You might not understand, since you've never been married,

212
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,240
but marriage is the grave of love.

213
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,880
After marriage, romance with the other party ends.

214
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,690
But I'm still young and want to fall in love.

215
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,640
So?

216
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:48,390
So, a wife and girlfriend are completely different entities to me.

217
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,180
You're giving me a headache.

218
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:59,100
When I met you, I had just broken up with my ex-girlfriend.

219
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:04,230
So, I have never lied to you.

220
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:10,010
You should've told me all this before confessing your love to me.

221
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:15,570
If I did that, you wouldn't have dated me, right?

222
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,130
Of course not.

223
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,740
It was love at first sight when I met you.

224
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,660
 Welcome. 

225
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,260
 Is it okay if I drink here alone? 

226
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,750
 Certainly. 

227
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:38,810
I fell for you.

228
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:42,390
I wasn't going to let you slip through my fingers.

229
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,150
So, I played a bit dirty. Sorry.

230
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:57,630
It's mainly because you're too beautiful.

231
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,230
You're being so unfair.

232
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,370
Truly not fair.

233
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:09,310
If you say that, I can't snap at you.

234
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,130
Minami.

235
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:23,640
It was love at first sight for me, too.

236
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,710
I really love you.

237
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,660
You're the only one I love.

238
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,410
Ryo-kun.

239
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:53,510
It's safe for us to do it today, right?

240
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,640
You're such an idiot.

241
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:06,860


242
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,860
Here's what I think after your story.

243
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:18,160
"You're the only one I love" is a line only said when people are having affairs.

244
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,490
That's your takeaway?

245
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:24,190
It's insane to go back to how things were.

246
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:28,840
But I do love Ryo-kun after all.

247
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,290
What about that guy introduced by Matsuda-chan? He won't do?

248
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:37,780
He's a very down-to-earth guy.

249
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:43,320
But Ryo-kun straight up said that I'm gorgeous.

250
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,760
Only candid phrases like that make my heart race.

251
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,460
But does it really bring you happiness?

252
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,180
- Do you want to come over? 
 - I want to.

253
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,180
You do? Then it's a promise.

254
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,580
- Enjoy your drinks. 
 - Thanks.

255
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:11,340
It's fine if I'm happy now.

256
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,680
Future me can deal with my future happiness.

257
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,430
But here's the thing.

258
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,950
We're 27 years old right now.

259
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:34,430
But in 10 years, we'll be 37.

260
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:41,600
How many people will spend their time and effort on us then?

261
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,430
Well...

262
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:52,120
Your happiness now is also tinged with such concerns.

263
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,780
I hope you're aware of that.

264
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,880
- Wow, it's floating! 
 - How is that possible?

265
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,990
I can totally see the strings.

266
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,640
That's amazing!

267
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,630
It's floating!

268
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,490
- Are you leaving? 
 - Just for a smoke!

269
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,510
Sone-san!

270
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,170
Oh?

271
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,170
Hey...

272
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,930
The text.

273
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:33,670
I received a text message from you yesterday.

274
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,720
♫  Fleeing from reality, as if I were leaving everything behind  ♫

275
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,150
I'm pretty sure this isn't your number.

276
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,530
   
   

277
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,250
You found out?

278
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,910
♫  Would like to feel and touch it, this insufficient sabotage  ♫

279
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:59,440
♫  You and me tonight, all night long  ♫ 
 ♫  Like this we fly  ♫

280
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,240
   
 Do you remember the day we first met? 

281
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,690
 - Have you decided? 
 - Decided on what? 

282
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,720
 It's the first date. 

283
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,570
 I felt like killing someone. I'm moving on. 

284
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,280
 W-Wait. 

285
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,640
 - Um... 
 - I'll get going. 

286
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,000
 Life in Tokyo is tough.
