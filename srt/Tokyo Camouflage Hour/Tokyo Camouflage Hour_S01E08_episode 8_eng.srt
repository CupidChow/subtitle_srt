1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,810
They're here.

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:16,090


3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,830
Thank you for joining us.

4
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,750
I'm Osaki from Mitsui Trading.

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,560
I'm Miwa from Design Bella. We've spoken several times online.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,400
I'm Sone.

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,470
- I'm Osaki. 
 - Nice to meet you.

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,510
Likewise.

9
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,630
- I'm Miwa. 
 - I'm Utsunomiya.

10
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,230
Nice to meet you.

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,210
Nice to meet you, I'm Sone from Design Bella.

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,290
I'm Utsunomiya from Mitsui Trading.

13
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,460
Nice to meet you.

14
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,980
Nice to meet you. 
    

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,410
Please take a seat.

16
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,100
Thank you.

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,750
Thank you for making time to meet us.

18
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,010
It's our pleasure.

19
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,900
  Â­ 

20
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,060
   

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,130
This is the first time I've heard your first name.

22
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,620
You said it's Marika, right?

23
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,470
Something like that.

24
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,900
Who would've thought I'd be receiving your business card?

25
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,270
The world is truly small.

26
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,360
What happened the other day was even more striking.

27
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,250
At the yakitori place?

28
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:38,840
 Oh? 

29
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,580
 Hey. 

30
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,300
Sorry for interrupting your date.

31
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,470
Hey.

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,380
Ah, it's nothing.

33
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:07,700
You've made me curious now that you're making a face that says the complete opposite.

34
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,430
Made you curious, huh.

35
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,090
Do I ever cross your mind, even for a second

36
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,320
or a fleeting moment?

37
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,320
This is sudden.

38
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,870
Sometimes, you cross my mine.

39
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,440
Or rather, my mind just brings you up.

40
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,750
But I get it.

41
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:48,480
I know I hardly matter to you,

42
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,850
but I want to know where I stand.

43
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,930
Sorry for the odd question.

44
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,160
No.

45
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,350
You've never crossed my mind.

46
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,240
I see.

47
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,610
I'm heading back to the office.

48
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,770
Take care.

49
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,160
When did it start?

50
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,510
Oh, we met in high school.

51
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,040
- Baba-kun is getting married. 
 - What?

52
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,240
Baba-kun, you're getting married?

53
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,320
Yeah, I am.

54
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,300
Wow, congratulations.

55
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,690
- Congratulations. 
 - Congratulations.

56
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,190
Thank you.

57
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,410
I'm a little embarrassed, but thank you.

58
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,400
- Do you have a photo of her? 
 - A photo?

59
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,630
I mean, yes. I do.

60
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,890
Here.

61
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,500
Wow, so pretty!

62
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,310
- Congratulations. 
 - For what exactly?

63
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,330
What's with your gaze?

64
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,920
Tired from all the well-wishes?

65
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,380
As awkward as that may be to admit, yeah.

66
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,680
What's the matter?

67
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,540
- Sorry? 
 - You're sighing.

68
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,220
It's nothing much, just the midweek blues.

69
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,110
Are you having a wedding?

70
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:46,410
Yeah, since it's her dream to have one.

71
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,000
You have to prepare well for it then.

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,450
I tried to join her for the dress fitting,

73
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:56,680
but she said I wouldn't have much to say and shooed me away.

74
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,040
Is that why you're feeling down?

75
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,810
I see.

76
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,160
Utsunomiya-san.

77
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,060
Do you want some animal biscuits?

78
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,470
- Seriously? 
 - Yeah, take them.

79
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,150
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

80
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,120
Enjoy.

81
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,960
Delicious. Great.

82
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,200
- They taste good? 
 - Yeah, thank you.

83
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,150
Eat as many as you want.

84
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,960
We aren't having children.

85
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,010
Huh?

86
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,990
Honestly, I'm fine with or without them.

87
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,420
So when we talked about the wedding exceeding our budget,

88
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:02,700
she told me we weren't saving for maternity

89
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,560
or child-rearing expenses.

90
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,160
This apparently means we have the leeway to splurge.

91
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,480
Maybe she just wanted an excuse?

92
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,800
Maybe.

93
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,490
But that's when I realized

94
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,260
she was absolutely certain we wouldn't have children.

95
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,330
I was at a loss for words.

96
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,370
If you want children,

97
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,890
- you can still... 
 - Oh, that's not it.

98
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,680
I'm not entirely sure that I want children.

99
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,340
But...

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,520
I don't have the courage to think

101
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,290
that I won't want them forever.

102
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,060
If we lead a life without children,

103
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:57,830
this will be the final major milestone in our lives.

104
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,780
In the future, days will just stretch out for us.

105
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,910
Does that scare you?

106
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,310
No.

107
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:12,320
But will her heart ever burst with joy again

108
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,870
once her dream wedding is over?

109
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,780
Your care for your girlfriend is impressive.

110
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,020
You give me too much credit.

111
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,510
It's just...

112
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,780
I love her, you know?

113
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,570
I want to stay with her.

114
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,290
That thought itself is adequate, don't you think?

115
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,810
I guess you're right.

116
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,900
- Baba-kun. 
 - Yes?

117
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,770
Congratulations on the wedding.

118
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,130
Thank you.

119
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,140
Can you explain?

120
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,400
Who is she?

121
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,840
What am I to you?

122
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,540
My girlfriend.

123
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,340
In that case, who is she?

124
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,870
If we had to put a label on her, she's a sex friend.

125
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,140
I see.

126
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,040
Fine.

127
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,840
Minami.

128
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,850
I get it now.

129
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,620
Thank you for being honest with me.

130
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,060
So pretty!

131
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,550
Green... No, yellow is also hard to give up on.

132
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,020
Pink? Help me, what's a good color?

133
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,200
Shouldn't you get a partner first?

134
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,680
This blissful atmosphere is encouraging my fantasies,

135
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,800
and I'm easing myself back to reality.

136
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,470
Don't drag me down like that.

137
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,220
   
   

138
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,680
   

139
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,920
But they looked so happy.

140
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,390
Yeah, Fujita-chan was also gorgeous.

141
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,850
How in the world does everyone find the perfect dress for themselves?

142
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,030
The boutique they visited must do their job well.

143
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,720
I should ask about this boutique.

144
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,240
Even without a significant other?

145
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,760
Sone-san, I'd definitely win if I sued you right now.

146
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,760
Still, this is so wonderful.

147
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,260
Attending a wedding really makes you fantasize your own, doesn't it?

148
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,980
- Rather than the ceremony itself... 
 - Yeah?

149
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,270
I like how certain priorities change.

150
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,880
When something happens, your partner becomes the first to know.

151
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,450
That's what I think is nice about marriage.

152
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,040
I see.

153
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,010
Marriage promises that you won't have anyone else in your life.

154
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,270
- Is everything okay? Your notifications have been endless. 
 - Sorry about that.

155
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,100
Is it something urgent?

156
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,510
No, just a dating app.

157
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,170
Are you eager to get married now?

158
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:41,650
I guess so.

159
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,880
But it's difficult to use.

160
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,250
Should I introduce someone to you in that case?

161
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,860
Can you?

162
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,700
It's not another person without any good qualities aside from being a "nice guy," right?

163
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,080
- I'm really confident about this guy. 
 - Seriously?

164
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,440
I'll even do the speech for your wedding.

165
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,040
You're really confident.

166
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,340
Wait, Sone-san should do the speech.

167
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,330
No, thank you. I don't like making a show of my private affairs.

168
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,070
Okay, I think my feet are back on the ground.

169
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,570
Shall we get drinks?

170
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,460
Nice idea, I want to have Japanese liquor.

171
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,300
Sounds amazing.

172
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,120
 Can you share the most interesting incident that happened to you lately? 

173
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,100
 It's not scary.Â­ 

174
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,900
 I was asked to get heating for the toilet bowl. 

175
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,930
 I got money for it... 

176
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:29,370
 - If it's for a marriage interview... 
 - In particular.Â­ 

177
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,340
 All I could see were filthy pigeons. 

178
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,720
 Did anything interesting happen to you lately? 

179
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,400
 Yes! 

180
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:44,100
 I was at a cafe and a couple was breaking up. 

181
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,060
 They fought over fried rice 

182
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:54,460
 and the lady tried to splash the wan with water. 

183
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,100
 But the man dodged, 

184
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:03,150
 so the person I was with got drenched. 

185
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,050
 That's tragic. 

186
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:18,670
 I thought an event like that was only for dramas on TV. 

187
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,860
 It was an unforgettable sight. 

188
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,090
 Wow. It certainly sounds like a drama. 

189
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:26,380
 Right? 

190
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:32,100
   

191
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,760
Do you know "zero" and "rei" have different meanings? 
  (T/N: different words for 0) 

192
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,930
Pardon?

193
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:59,070
"Rei" is supposed to refer to drips of rain,

194
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,410
indicating that it's only close to nothing.

195
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,530
But "zero" means nothing at all.

196
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,800
I see.

197
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,920
Then there's a little left, right?

198
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,760
Huh?

199
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:25,130
To me, both just mean that nothing can be seen.

200
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,340
He hasn't been coming lately.

201
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,210
That guy.

202
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,880
I'm sure...

203
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,880
I was asking for the impossible.

204
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:59,250
Even if it was zero for him, it was probably "rei" for me.

205
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,960
Trying hard might've made it "one,"

206
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,710
but there was nothing for him.

207
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,280
You can't be sure of that yet.

208
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,080
I think...

209
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,050
I can no longer pretend I'm unsure.

210
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,440
Tired from all the well-wishes?

211
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,580
- As awkward as that may be to admit. 
 - You get it now.

212
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,770
Thank you.

213
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,020
What's up?

214
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,100
- Pardon? 
 - You're sighing.

215
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:22,510
Baba-kun, what would you do?

216
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,310
You have someone you like.

217
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:35,010
You know that you have to cherish her and treat her better.

218
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,670
But...

219
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,900
But there is someone else who comes to mind.

220
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:46,720
An individual you think about, yet you can't assess.

221
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:54,430
So you're confused by your feelings, is that it?

222
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,530
Yes.

223
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,080
Senpai.

224
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,680
- Yes? 
 - I say this as your dear junior

225
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,850
and on behalf of everyone who has been asked this question before.

226
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,820
Okay?

227
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,860
Stop pretending to be confused!

228
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:40,140
Hey, can we meet on Saturday?

229
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,000
Welcome.

230
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,530
Work must be tiring for you.

231
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:32,540
- Sorry? 
 - I mean, that Sunday too.

232
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,510
I'm really sorry about that.

233
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:41,510
Don't apologize, it must've been tough to work on the weekend.

234
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,470
Not really.

235
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,570
- You know... 
 - Oh, I saw this on Instagram.

236
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:00,100
It's so pretty, right? I really want to go.

237
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,350
- You knowâ 
 - And there's this pancake shop, too.

238
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:08,260
Take a look. Aren't you curious about this hot strawberry milk?

239
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:12,780
- Yae-chan. 
 - My friend also wants to introduce her new boyfriend to me.

240
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,030
So, she...

241
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,750
Yae-chan.

242
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,740
I knew it wouldn't work out.

243
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,880
It's fine. You don't have to say it.

244
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,640
I get it.

245
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,130
- I'm sorry. 
 - It's really fine.

246
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:57,020
- I understand if you're angry. 
 - I'm not angry.

247
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,860
I wanted to like you.

248
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:13,520
I wanted to like you in all the ways you hoped I would.

249
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,100
But...

250
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,090
I couldn't do it.

251
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:25,730
I couldn't accept that I couldn't do it.

252
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,260
So, I pretended to be confused.

253
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,650
I took up your time.

254
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,520
I'm sorry.

255
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,380
I liked you.

256
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,810
But I wasn't the one you liked the most.

257
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,290
That's all this is.

258
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,090
Why are you crying?

259
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,830
Here, use this.

260
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,860
I'm sorry.

261
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,950
So that was it.

262
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,590
Yeah.

263
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,640
Goodbye.

264
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,250
â«  Tokyo crazy night  â«

265
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,210
â«  Got me falling deep  â«

266
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,500
â«  Love like illusion  â«

267
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:26,160
â«  To quench my loneliness, I poured myself some sparkling wine  â«

268
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,080
â«  Fleeing from reality, as if I were leaving everything behind  â«

269
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,470
â«  Tokyo crazy night  â«

270
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,330
â«  Pushing, pulling, and this frustrating camouflage  â«

271
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,950
â«  Even if it is a lie, nicely done (done, done)  â«

272
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,480
â«  Would like to feel and touch it, this insufficient sabotage  â«

273
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,420
â«  At this moment, let it unfold,  â« 
 â«  Tokyo crazy night  â«

274
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,440
â«  Tokyo crazy night  â«

275
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,440
â«  Got me falling deep  â«

276
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,740
   

277
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,400
Meguro-san!

278
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,120
Hello.

279
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,980
Are you Matsuda-chan's acquaintance?

280
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,420
   

281
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:54,960


282
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,960
   
 A transfer? 

283
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,140
 Wanting to meet someone here is a good enough reason to stay. 

284
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,540
 I have somewhere I want to go with you. 

285
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,640
 I'm sick of getting hurt! 

286
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,060
 You're waiting to hear, "That's not true." Right? 

287
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,900
 Can we stay like this a little longer?
