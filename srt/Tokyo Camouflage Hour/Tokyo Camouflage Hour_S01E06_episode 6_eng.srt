1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,490
- Good morning. 
 - Good morning.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,770
Good morning.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,870
   

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,050
Sorry.

5
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,000
I got you to cover shifts again.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,120
It's fine, a freeter's schedule is flexible. 
  (T/N: without a full-time job) 

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,170
That's not true, isn't it?

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,060
Really, it is. Besides, I need to put in good work somewhere.

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,990
Oh? Are you up to no good?

10
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:46,900
No, but I feel bad working part-time jobs

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,610
instead of getting properly employed.

12
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:51,590
Feel bad? Towards whom?

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,320
Just the world at large?

14
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,850
If you're doing what you want to do, nobody has the right to criticize you.

15
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:11,810
I want to become someone like you, Suzuki-san.

16
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,530
Don't worry, you will once you grow old.

17
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:29,940


18
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,060
Welcome.

19
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,090
Welcome.

20
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,010
I'll take care of him.

21
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,850
Go on.

22
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,430
- Takeout, please. 
 - Understood.

23
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,170
Here you go.

24
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,180
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

25
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,840
Thank you!

26
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,220
Waiting won't get you anywhere.

27
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,780
Huh?

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,060
In this world, whoever takes the first step wins.

29
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,360
Utsunomiya-san, want to go for lunch together?

30
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,850
- No, I have this. 
 - Oh, right.

31
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,510
The usual pizza bread. See you later then.

32
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,490
This is so delicious.

33
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,180
Pizza bread?

34
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,370
We'll have a fresh batch in five minutes if you'd like to wait.

35
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,030
I'm very sorry.

36
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,080
- If you're busy, you can select a different one─ 
 - No, it's fine.

37
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,340
I always get the same thing.

38
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,370
So do I.

39
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,520
My choice is always the same as well.

40
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,460
Is that so?

41
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,120
Yes.

42
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,270
I'll wait for it then.

43
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,400
Please give us a moment.

44
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,840
Sure.

45
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,580
Excuse me!

46
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,980
I hope you have a wonderful day at work today.

47
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,700
Thank you.

48
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,260
I'll be back again.

49
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,240
Thank you.

50
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,350
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

51
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,800
Did you just get off work?

52
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,740
Yes.

53
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,890
Work ends really late for you.

54
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,180
I have to handle closing and such.

55
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,760
I see.

56
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,490
Excuse me.

57
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,700
Have you had dinner yet?

58
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,540
Not yet.

59
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,650
Shall we grab dinner together?

60
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,420
I'd love to.

61
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,720
An Italian place? Are you a fan of Italian food?

62
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,390
Yes.

63
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,390
   

64
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:58,120
Is that why you're always buying pizza bread?

65
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,200
I guess so.

66
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,530
- So, you like Italian cuisine. 
 - This is embarrassing.

67
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:08,840
   

68
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:15,390
She stepped on my foot, but never pulled away.

69
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:19,710
And I was the only one at the table.

70
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,040
The facts make it clear.

71
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,410
- I have a chance. 
 - Hang on, Senpai.

72
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,420
Are you sure she hasn't mistaken you for the table leg?

73
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,350
The feeling of her feet was unusual. 
    

74
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,560
It wasn't too forceful or light. 
    

75
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,910
She was totally testing the waters with me.

76
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,840
This must be fate.

77
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,370
   
   

78
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,470
It's fate.

79
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,990
Exactly.

80
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,580
- Utsunomiya-kun, next time... 
 - Chief!

81
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,850
I've sent you the presentation for next week by email.

82
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,850
- You're really fast. 
 - Let's get to work.

83
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:02,660
However, a budget change was announced this morning.

84
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,560
I've included it.

85
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,920
That's impressive.

86
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,780
♫  Hey, ladies, where you at? So let's start it (let's start it)  ♫

87
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,310
♫  Just a night of lies can make you fall  ♫

88
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,010
♫  See the lights behind these concrete walls  ♫

89
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,920
♫  You can't deny, so gimme something  ♫

90
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,880
- What? 
 - It's nothing, but...

91
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,100
You've changed.

92
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,790
Huh?

93
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,360
Seriously?

94
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,500
Yes, Tokiwa-san from accounting had an online affair

95
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,140
and word has spread around the office.

96
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:38,000
Female employees are in the meeting room slagging him...

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,890
I mean, boiling with righteous anger.

98
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,010
He's been suspended for now, but I'm sure it's over for him.

99
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,020
Am I thinking of the right Tokiwa-san?

100
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,870
The old man with the long eyelashes that girls envy? Indeed.

101
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,920
That's quite dramatic.

102
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,050
- Are you okay? 
 - Have you heard about it, Meguro-san?

103
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,090
Yeah, about Tokiwa-san, right?

104
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,710
Everyone's downright furious with him!

105
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,740
Yeah.

106
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,880
This is no time for sitting still. I'll go spread the word.

107
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,740
I'll tag along!

108
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,250
Hang on, Sone-chan!

109
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,490
I...

110
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,980
I'm also having an unusual romance.

111
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,260
What if everyone finds out, and I'm criticized like Tokiwa-san?

112
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:32,260
I can't stop shaking after hearing what everyone said to him...

113
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,080
What did they say?

114
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,340
They said they would commit murder if they were Tokiwa-san's wife.

115
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:51,130
Everyone's quick to say such things so casually,

116
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,340
but none of them are his wife.

117
00:08:54,340 --> 00:09:01,030
They're being really presumptuous by speaking on his wife's behalf.

118
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:07,080
Would they even commit murder if they were his wife?

119
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:13,650
You're right! Maybe Tokiwa-san's relationship with his wife was already strained.

120
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,340
Or maybe his wife wanted a divorce

121
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:20,090
and she'd appreciate the alimony.

122
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:23,820
If we go a step further, maybe they weren't even having sex.

123
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,520
Tokiwa-san's wife may also have a lover, too.

124
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,680
Spotlighting just what's been known thoughtlessly

125
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,980
and ranting about it just indicates someone's lack of imagination.

126
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:43,260
Even so...

127
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:49,720
The fury of those girls was frightening.

128
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,220
I know.

129
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:03,000
Whatever reason there may be, it's definitely an act to be condemned.

130
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,460
But an outsider shouldn't be making a fuss out of it.

131
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:15,360
That's just because they're excited to criticize someone.

132
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,680
E-Exactly!

133
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,400
Everyone's so thoughtless.

134
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:28,320
I'm on your side, so I'll go along with your stance.

135
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,220
But I love watching

136
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,440
the ugly side of humans gathering to scoff at such scandals.

137
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,620
May I join in the fun?

138
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,300
What?

139
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,460
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

140
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,830
Sorry.

141
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,790
   

142
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,420
Welcome.

143
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,280
Give me a second.

144
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,590
Welcome!

145
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,240
Oh?

146
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,650
Huh?

147
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,740
Long time no see.

148
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,550
Hey there.

149
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,670
This is...

150
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,340
I'm Sone.

151
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,780
- Hello. 
 - Hey.

152
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,780
And this is...

153
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,190
- I'm Kobayashi. 
 - Hello.

154
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,780
Hello.

155
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,250
Sorry for the wait. Come on in.

156
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,950
- I'll be right with you. 
 -  Sure. 

157
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,610
I'm sorry, but you have to share.

158
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,930
- Not at all. 
 - It's okay.

159
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:38,980
I'll have a beer and... spring onion with chicken, chicken heart, and chicken skin.

160
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,260
Got it. What about your friends?

161
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,860
We didn't come together...

162
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,590
- Well... 
 - I'll also have a draft beer.

163
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,480
- Sure. 
 - I'll have a Highball.

164
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,200
Okay.

165
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,110
- Here are your beers. 
 - Thank you.

166
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,620
- Enjoy your Highball. 
 - Thank you.

167
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:06,200
- Um... 
 - I believe fate brought us here.

168
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,950
Cheers.

169
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:10,260
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

170
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,660
- Wow, refreshing. 
 - Here are your chicken skewers.

171
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,830
Thank you!

172
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,040
Get me the spices.

173
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,200
Okay.

174
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,010
Thank you.

175
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,000
It's delicious. You have to get the chicken heart here.

176
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:49,900
How do you know each other?

177
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:55,300
- We... 
 - We spent a night together.

178
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,930
- What? Do you mean... 
 - No, it's not what you think.

179
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,270
It isn't?

180
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:06,740
- Excuse me, can I have another chicken heart? 
 - Sure.

181
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,370
Um... How should I explain this...

182
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,480
It's fine if you don't want to talk about it.

183
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,630
- It's not that. 
 - Hey.

184
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,630
You're still hungry, right?

185
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,070
Yes.

186
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:24,200
The chicken kamameshi here is insanely delicious, but it comes in two servings.

187
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,630
I see.

188
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,890
Can you share it with me?

189
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,900
- Of course. 
 - Nice, thank you.

190
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,450
Excuse me, can I also have a chicken kamameshi?

191
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,030
Sure.

192
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,800
Minami-chan, have you been sleeping well?

193
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,730
Yeah, why do you ask?

194
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:54,110
You look pretty, just a little tired.

195
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,550
I'm fine.

196
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,560
What else do you want to drink?

197
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,010
What should I get...

198
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:09,280
Oh, Atsushi is heading to karaoke with friends and says we can come along.

199
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,840
Karaoke?

200
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,240
But, hm...

201
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,490
Today feels like a day to spend alone with you.

202
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,880
Ryo-kun...

203
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,230
Can I go over to your place tonight?

204
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:47,940
You didn't have to mention that.

205
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,890
It's good. Mention what?

206
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:56,380
The fact that we... spent a night together.

207
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,630
But we aren't friends, and we're hardly acquaintances.

208
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:08,000
- That's true, but... 
 - Should I have lied?

209
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,880
- No. 
 - Then what should I have said?

210
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,180
Well...

211
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,720
If it were you, what would you say?

212
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,500
To whom and about what?

213
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,510
You had a date, didn't you?

214
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:33,410
Did you tell him about meeting me before the date?

215
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,250
No, I didn't.

216
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,960
He didn't ask?

217
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,140
Even if he did, why am I obligated to reply?

218
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,740
But you're dating.

219
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,580
Who am I dating?

220
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,350
- What? 
 - Here's the thing about dates.

221
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,240
Are they restricted to people who are dating?

222
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,990
Usually yes.

223
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,430
So that means you two are dating?

224
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:10,190
Here's your meal.

225
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,690
It's hot. Be careful.

226
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,530
Thank you.

227
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,490
Here, you'll need these plates.

228
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,470
Thank you.

229
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:57,480
The two of us have each taken our first step towards the other.

230
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,750
In a way, we're halfway there to becoming a couple.

231
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,080
May I ask you something?

232
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,160
Sure.

233
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,480
Who have you been directing these excuses to?

234
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,870
The food is here.

235
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,900
Welcome back.

236
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,900
This is delicious. Out of this world.

237
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,620
Looks great.

238
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,170
Eat up while it's warm.

239
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,690
- Here you go. 
 - Thank you.

240
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:07,620
Sone-san's quite an interesting character.

241
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,060
I'm sorry.

242
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,210
I know you were looking forward to visiting that spot.

243
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,990
It really is a hard place to visit alone.

244
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:30,020
But Sone-san was there alone.

245
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,660
She's so cool.

246
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,360
It's not what you think.

247
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:52,800
I wasn't just riding the mood of the moment.

248
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:55,780
Not with you, Yae-chan.

249
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,530
So...

250
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,920
♫  Tokyo crazy night  ♫

251
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,810
♫  Got me falling deep  ♫

252
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:33,190
♫  Love like illusion  ♫

253
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,420
♫  To quench my loneliness, I poured myself some sparkling wine  ♫

254
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,780
"Yae" is fine.

255
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:44,820
♫  Fleeing from reality, as if I were leaving everything behind  ♫

256
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,210
♫  Tokyo crazy night  ♫

257
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,940
♫  Pushing, pulling, and this frustrating camouflage  ♫

258
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,730
♫  Even if it is a lie, nicely done (done, done)  ♫

259
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:00,120
♫  Would like to feel and touch it, this insufficient sabotage  ♫

260
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,960
♫  You and me tonight, all night long  ♫

261
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,390
I made breakfast. You can drop the key in the letterbox.

262
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:15,640
♫  Sneaking away from the street's flickering neon signs, where's the love?  ♫

263
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,170
Take care.

264
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,100
I will.

265
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,090
- Welcome. 
 - Welcome.

266
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,500
- Please pack these. 
 - All right.

267
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,210
- Morning. 
 - Good morning.

268
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:14,250
Meguro-chan, have you looked over the documents we sent yesterday?

269
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,330
Documents?

270
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,220
   

271
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,780
It's nothing urgent, but give it a look.

272
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:35,420
   

273
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,550
Meguro-chan?

274
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,180
What's the matter?

275
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:54,830


276
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,180
   
 I feel really fortunate. 

277
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,770
 - Let's eat. 
 - Enjoy your meal. 

278
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:06,140
 - Did someone come over? 
 - No. 

279
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,550
 What am I to you? 

280
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,640
 You don't like her that much? 

281
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,000
 - You're interested in someone else. 
 - I'm not exactly interested.
