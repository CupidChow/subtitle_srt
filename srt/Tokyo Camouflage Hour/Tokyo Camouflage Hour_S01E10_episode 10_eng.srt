3
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:25,230
Hey, I have something I need to tell you.

4
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,860
What is it?

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,490
I'm moving overseas next month.

6
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,270
What?

7
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,540
Hang on, next month?

8
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,240
Are you moving for work?

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,930
No, I'm getting married.

10
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,680
Married?

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,740
I thought I should let you know.

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,520
You're lying, right?

13
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,550
No woman would lie about this.

14
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,470
- Who are you marrying? 
 - Jonathan.

15
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,200
Jona... Who?

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,030
Jonathan.

17
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,200
Who is this?

18
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,610
A potter in Finland.

19
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,830
You might not expect it, but his Japanese is perfect.

20
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,050
He's been proposing to me for a while now.

21
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,220
I finally said yes, since I want to get married anyway.

22
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,920
I'll be heading over in April.

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,790
April?

24
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,470
To Finland?

25
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,580
That's all I have to say.

26
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,540
 A new day is here, and it's time for Nasu-Nakanishi's... Oops, there's the camera. 

27
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,160
 Sorry about that. 

28
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,040
It's Nasu-Nakanishi.

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,010
 Let's introduce the show. 

30
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,000
 It's Nasu-Nakanishi's Friendly Tokyo Walk! 

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,580
 - It wasn't edited?  
 - Is that perm intentional?

32
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,380
 There's no way to predict the future. 

33
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,480
 All beginnings and ends hit you unexpectedly. 

34
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,360
 No, that's not it. 

35
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,810
So cute.

36
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,630
Hello there.

37
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,260
Cutie pie.

38
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:50,110
 Maybe it's just that I haven't been noticing the signs. 

39
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,020
You're so adorable.

40
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:59,380
But I can't keep someone like you around.

41
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,680
Please! This group blind date will fall through without enough people!

42
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,060
I don't have the money for it. I attended two weddings this month.

43
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,180
- I don't think I can make it. 
 - What happened, Meguro-san?

44
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,990
Weren't you always eager to meet new guys?

45
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,500
What about you, Sone-san? Are you free on the second Friday of next month?

46
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,820
- Next month? 
 - Yes!

47
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,240
I won't be in Japan.

48
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,910
- What? 
 - Are you taking leave?

49
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,800
Something like that.

50
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,180
But this is such a great chance.

51
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,930
Girls, time to get back to work!

52
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,350
Senior Mitsuki! Perfect timing!

53
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,620
There's a three-on-three group blind date this time.

54
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,770
All of them are elite and handsome bankers.

55
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,970
- Are you sure they're handsome? 
 - Yes, for sure.

56
00:03:52,970 --> 00:04:00,840
If she put that enthusiasm towards work, she'd get pretty far in her career.

57
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,000
- Hey, Sone-chan. 
 - Yes?

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,990
Can I ask you for advice?

59
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:13,100
Rather than asking for advice, you're always talking about something lewd.

60
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,410
Don't say that. It's embarrassing.

61
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:20,060
Is this about that scumbag bartender who went on another imaginary trip?

62
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,770
 Do you see the Merlion? Over there! 

63
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,460
- So mean. 
 - Sorry, my true thoughts slipped out.

64
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,670
Goodness.

65
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:30,120
May I ask you something?

66
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,100
Sone-chan, have you ever loved anyone with all your heart?

67
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,320
Don't make me sound like some isolated witch.

68
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,890
But you're always so calm, composed, and chic.

69
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:48,980
On the flip side, love makes everyone lose their composure.

70
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,730
It makes them look pathetic.

71
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:56,930
But I can't imagine you looking like that.

72
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,950
Looking pathetic, huh?

73
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,560
How pathetic indeed.

74
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,890
Huh? What do you mean?

75
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,750
 I'm getting married. 

76
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,720
 I'll be heading over in April. 

77
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,950
 Can we stay like this a little longer? 

78
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,980
All right.

79
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,300
I see, you've made up your mind.

80
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,860
Yes.

81
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,870
You're still young. You can always come back here.

82
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,600
Yes, certainly.

83
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,400
Perhaps when I have such plans again.

84
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,020
Although, I suppose in your case,

85
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,480
Yamagata might be better for you.

86
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,560
I haven't worked here long, but thank you all very much.

87
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,730
I will be returning to the Yamagata office.

88
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:04,270
I hope we can work together in the future.

89
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,240
A round of applause for him.

90
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,410
Just when we finally became friends...

91
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,340
Thank you.

92
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,910
But I'm still your Senpai.

93
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,070
Sorry.

94
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,840
Are you really alright with this?

95
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,130
Yes. While I enjoyed Tokyo, I love my hometown just as much.

96
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,640
But this is such an exciting city.

97
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,630
There's so much in store.

98
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:50,020
I remember you brought me to Korido when I first arrived here.

99
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,090
 - Bye bye! 
 - Wait a second! 

100
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,900
 - Wait! 
 - H-Hang on! 

101
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,690
I wouldn't have invited you if I had known you'd leave so soon.

102
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,420
Sorry about that.

103
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,800
Don't apologize.

104
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,510
You chose to return to Yamagata, didn't you?

105
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,440
Be confident in your choices like a real man.

106
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,400
How do you handle not being chosen?

107
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,780
Not being chosen?

108
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,170
There are tons of options here.

109
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:33,290
And while we have the power to choose, we're also choices ourselves.

110
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,060
What are you talking about?

111
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,700
From my perspective, I'm the one choosing.

112
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:47,010
It only hurts when I'm not chosen. It feels pathetic, even.

113
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,120
Don't talk in riddles.

114
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,710
Anyway, I'm fine with leaving Tokyo.

115
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,070
Well, do you want to take a trip down memory lane?

116
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,850
For Utsunomiya's farewell party.

117
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,640
Just for a few drinks.

118
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,670
Sure.

119
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,330
- Baba, you're coming along as well. 
 - Got it.

120
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,530
You're quick to agree.

121
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:19,800
I mean, I'm fond of Utsunomiya-san.

122
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,260
- You probably wanted to hear that from a woman. 
 - Indeed.

123
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,820
What, am I no good?

124
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,080
Fine, I'll allow it for today.

125
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,530
Really?

126
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:29,610
- But only for today. 
 - What's up with that "only for today"?

127
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,540
Guess I'll tell my wife I've got plans tonight.

128
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,730
   

129
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,960
- Thanks. 
 - Thank you.

130
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,230
Thank you.

131
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,880
Spotted one.

132
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,900
Can we sit with you?

133
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,430
We happen to be in the area for work.

134
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,670
But we're lucky to have met such gorgeous ladies.

135
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,830
Are you in sales?

136
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,000
I guess you could say that.

137
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,740
We're from Mitsui Commerce.

138
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,360
 Wow, amazing! 

139
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,080
- What about you two? 
 - We work at a nail salon.

140
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,200
Wow, your fingers are beautiful.

141
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,930
Yes, they are gorgeous. Where is the shop?

142
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:29,560
- In Meguro! 
 - I also live in Meguro. Is it near Gonnosuke?

143
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,210
Let's raise our glasses.

144
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,490
- Sure. 
 - Great idea.

145
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,460
- Cheers! 
  - Cheers! 

146
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,930
♫  Hey, ladies, where you at? So let's start it  ♫

147
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:49,250
♫  Just a night of lies can make you fall  ♫ 
 ♫  See the lights behind these concrete walls  ♫

148
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,470
 Amazing! So cool! 

149
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,150
I'm even more impressive.

150
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,170
I'm better.

151
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,380
 Amazing! 

152
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,730
- You weren't lying! 
  - So cool! 

153
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,250
- You're insane. 
 - Wow!

154
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,450
Too close!

155
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,080
I'm cool, right?

156
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,960
That didn't work out at all!

157
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,960
We're such losers!

158
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,150
Why is this happening?

159
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,730
You scared them off with your enthusiasm!

160
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,740
Yeah, that was it.

161
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,000
So I'm the issue?

162
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,970
Yes, and I have proof.

163
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,820
Look. 
    

164
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,020
When you went to the toilet,

165
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,690
we exchanged contacts.

166
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:44,350
Damn you two.

167
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,900
- What? 
 - Don't scare us.

168
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,530
We really are in Tokyo, huh.

169
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,980
Yeah.

170
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,830
Are you already missing the city?

171
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:01,560
No, I don't. I had my fun.

172
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,080
All right, let's hit up another bar.

173
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,140
- What? 
 - Korido, Ebiyoko, Shibuyoko, and Toyoko.

174
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,360
Let's conquer them all.

175
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,190
I still haven't shown you the true fun of Tokyo.

176
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:18,250
- We can't cover all that in a night. 
- Yeah, I'm heading home. My wife's feeling sick.

177
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,660
Don't force yourself to accompany him.

178
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,400
Thank you.

179
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,870
Utsunomiya-san!

180
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,240
Heba! 
  (T/N: "Bye" in Akita Dialect) 

181
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,990
Heba!

182
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,350
Same to you, Senpai! See you!

183
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,800
What does that mean?

184
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,610
No clue.

185
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,180
Let's go.

186
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,750
Okay.

187
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,210
Viva Tokyo!

188
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,280
What are you saying?

189
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,310
   

190
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,110
Welcome.

191
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,880
It's lively tonight.

192
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,570
- Yeah. 
 - Sorry for the crowd.

193
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,270
It's our anniversary celebration, but there are seats inside.

194
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,930
Thank you.

195
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,240
We met before!

196
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,830
- Who are you again? 
 - You totally forgot.

197
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,380
These boys tried to hit us up, remember?

198
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,130
My condolences!

199
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,210
The counter seats are open if you like.

200
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,180
Nice.

201
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,950
I see.

202
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,160
You're returning to Yamagata.

203
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,610
Yes.

204
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,720
How did you find life in Tokyo?

205
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,450
It's been fun.

206
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,150
What are your plans now?

207
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,820
You'll feel lonely at night in Yamagata.

208
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,710
Loneliness doesn't even vanish when I'm in Tokyo.

209
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,010
Enough with the sentimentality.

210
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,880
That's why he isn't popular with girls.

211
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,640
Hey, Ryo-kun. I don't like feeling lonely, okay?

212
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,400
Tonight is the bar's 40th anniversary.

213
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,700
But that's not all.

214
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,100
It's also the day I'll erase loneliness from your life, Minami.

215
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,450
Ryo-kun!

216
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,320
Right, they're a couple.

217
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,430
I remember now.

218
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,820
This is too much to bear.

219
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,610
- Where are you going? 
 - Home to watch "Tokyo Swindlers."

220
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,290
Sone-chan, you still haven't watched that?

221
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,320
See you.

222
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,260
Take care.

223
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,790
Sone-san!

224
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,790
You came after me.

225
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,770
Can I join you for a walk?

226
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,640
When are you leaving?

227
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,430
At the end of March.

228
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,250
I see.

229
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:47,910
Ever since I came to Tokyo, I feel like I haven't been living as myself.

230
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,580
Thinking back on it,

231
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,310
I feel like I've only been telling lies.

232
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,970
Lies?

233
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:02,410
I've been so caught up in appearing a certain way.

234
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:08,190
Everything down to the smallest details have been fake.

235
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,130
When we first met, you said you lived in Nakame.

236
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,080
 Hey, where do you live? 

237
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,090
 Oh, in Nakame. 

238
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,330
 I live in Shimouma. 

239
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,160
Sorry about that.

240
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,220
Now, I can say this with full confidence.

241
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:36,280
Shimouma is a wonderful place.

242
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,170
All right then.

243
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,360
Hey.

244
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,020
Yes?

245
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,300
Congratulations.

246
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,530
Huh?

247
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:13,390
Congratulations on getting married.

248
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,460
I didn't congratulate you yet.

249
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,310
Thank you.

250
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,670
Goodbye then.

251
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:50,190
 Looking pathetic, huh. 

252
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,380
 How pathetic indeed. 

253
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,510
 Sone-chan? 

254
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:05,280
Even I have times when I feel like crying and want to be spoilt.

255
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,380
What? Really?

256
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,080
Of course.

257
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,780
But what do you think will happen if I say that to a guy?

258
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,040
They'll try to do something about it, right?

259
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,680
Isn't that a good thing?

260
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:30,120
But I don't like it when they force themselves to do something.

261
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:35,630
I'm sure the right person is out there for him.

262
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:41,160
Someone he can be comfortable with without trying to look cool.

263
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:45,630
But I admit that he's adorable.

264
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,480
 Sone-san! 

265
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,120
But I can't keep someone like that around.

266
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,050
Who are you talking about?

267
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:10,120
Someone in my life.

268
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,410
♫  Tokyo crazy night  ♫

269
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,300
♫  Got me falling deep  ♫

270
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,640
♫  Love like illusion  ♫

271
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:47,240
♫  To quench my loneliness, I poured myself some sparkling wine  ♫

272
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,210
♫  Fleeing from reality, as if I were leaving everything behind  ♫

273
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:55,830
♫  Tokyo crazy night  ♫

274
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,670
♫  Our eyes meet through the glass  ♫

275
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,840
♫  Every plan for tomorrow is gulped down  ♫

276
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,130
♫  Mind and body are emptied  ♫

277
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:12,740
♫  Until we drown  ♫

278
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,140
♫  Pushing, pulling, and this frustrating camouflage  ♫

279
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,590
It's been great living here.

280
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,660
♫  Would like to feel and touch it, this insufficient sabotage  ♫

281
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,960
♫  You and me tonight, all night long  ♫

282
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,390
   

283
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,590
This is a wonderful place.

284
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,610
I'm glad you brought me here.

285
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,090
- What would you like to have? 
 - The usual for me.

286
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,210
I'll have a Tequila Sunrise.

287
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,440
A Tequila Sunrise?

288
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,810
Matsuda-chan, you're sexy.

289
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,040
I think he's interested in me.

290
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,250
Perhaps.

291
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,070
Minami, where's Sone-chan?

292
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,920
Um... Sone-chan, she...

293
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,460
You were in Tokyo last year, right?

294
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,260
Yeah.

295
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,520
Does this bring back memories?

296
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,680
I guess so.

297
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,760
Well, I'll head back to the office first.

298
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,670
- Thank you. 
 - No worries.
