1
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,730
   
   

2
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,230
 I have a date with Ezra after this. 

3
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,030
 If it's a date... 

4
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,900
 Does that mean you're dating someone? 

5
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,910
 How should I put it... 

6
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,380
 That's my life, isn't it? 

7
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:56,840


8
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,330
 Hey, are you there? 

9
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,590
 I texted so many times, but you just won't reply. 

10
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,880
Right.

11
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:03,100
 We hardly get to meet up with everyone from middle school. 

12
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,730
Yeah.

13
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,030
 So, are you coming to the class reunion? 

14
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,590
 Hey! Hiroto! 

15
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,770
Maybe I should go back

16
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,600
to Yamagata.

17
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:42,310
  ­ 

18
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:53,060
   

19
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,130
Hey, guys!

20
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,710
 Wow! 

21
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,000
 Woah! 

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,820
Make way, he's coming through!

23
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,480
Sit over here!

24
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,830
- Here, give me your jacket. 
 - I can do it myself.

25
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,250
- I'll put it over there. 
 - You must be tired from traveling. Sit.

26
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,070
- Thank you. 
 - Come on.

27
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,230
Thank you.

28
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,920
Since Hiroto's here as well...

29
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,600
- Cheers! 
 -  Cheers! 

30
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,180
Bottoms up!

31
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,930
Sorry about that.

32
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,810
- Well? 
 - Yeah?

33
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,340
How's life in Tokyo?

34
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,440
- Um... 
 - When did you move there?

35
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,640
- Two or three months ago. 
 - For work?

36
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,520
Yeah, it was a sudden transfer.

37
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,720
That's rough. Are you working in a wholesale trading company?

38
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,050
- Somewhat. 
 - Wow, that's really elitist.

39
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,440
No, not at all.

40
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,800
So? How's Tokyo?

41
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,970
It's... nice?

42
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,270
 A nice place, huh. 

43
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,010
I guess you're all settled down then.

44
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,260
Yes, quite a bit.

45
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,300
Is it true that Tokyo guys get body hair removals?

46
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,930
Not everyone, but many of them.

47
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,860
So, they're all shaved down?

48
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,170
Hey, don't probe too much!

49
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,500
Is it crowded there?

50
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,730
Yeah, for sure.

51
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:34,150
- Are things expensive? 
 - It's on the pricier side.

52
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,690
That sounds rough.

53
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,070
But there are pros.

54
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,990
- Like? 
 - You want an example?

55
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,700
I caught Matayoshi from Peace at Nakame. 
  (T/N: Comedian) 

56
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,810
- Wow, that's amazing. 
 - That's a celebrity!

57
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,510
Anything else?

58
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,220
What else?

59
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,290
Um...

60
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,610
I also saw Sakurai-san from Mr. Children. 
  (T/N: Musician) 

61
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,000
-  Wow!  
 - It happened during a meal with my colleagues.

62
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,140
- I thought I heard a really familiar voice. 
 - Seriously?

63
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,690
Listen, we've got big news!

64
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:09,950
This guy had his first child!

65
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:13,500
-  Congratulations! 
 - You serious? 

66
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,640
Sorry, I have no money to give away!

67
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,950
That's worth celebrating.

68
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,760
And at this age, too.

69
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,340
Hey, didn't you say you were also getting married?

70
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,850
My parents certainly keep nagging me to get a wife quickly.

71
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:31,090
- Same here. 
 - It's the same for everyone, huh.

72
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,640
But I have my own plans.

73
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,280
What about you, Hiroto?

74
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,560
Don't you consider getting married soon?

75
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,210
No, not yet.

76
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,860
But isn't everyone getting married?

77
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,430
- I guess. 
 - By the way, are you dating someone?

78
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,290
He won't have issues meeting girls in the city.

79
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,670
She isn't exactly my girlfriend.

80
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,380
- Come on. 
 - What's she like?

81
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,420
You want to know about her?

82
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,150
Well...

83
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,130
So, I asked about the last train.

84
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,750
And she said she'd walk home.

85
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,780
We have to leave this place soon, so grab your things!

86
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,700
Got it!

87
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,220
- And? 
 - Oh, right.

88
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,840
She said the falling leaves were pretty, and there was a breeze.

89
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,930
- The Autumn breeze... 
 - Does anyone want to hit a second shop?

90
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,580
-  Me!  
 - Great idea!

91
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,940
Awesome!

92
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,100
Hiroto, you're coming, right?

93
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,820
Let's get going!

94
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:46,560
♪  I fiddle with my watch while waiting for the train with you  ♪

95

♪  It isn't the season for snow, but it's snowing  ♪

00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,380

Come on, everyone together!

102
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,980
Sorry, and thank you.

103
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,850
Are you disappointed?

104
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,250
Huh?

105
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,280
The way everyone's unexpectedly disinterested in Tokyo.

106
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,930
- That's not it. 
 - You might've seen Matayoshi, but Mr. Children was a lie, right?

107
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,810
To tell you the truth, I've been in Tokyo since college as well.

108
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,600
- Huh? 
 - Sakurai-san is indeed not that easy to bump into.

109
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,300
- Kizaki-kun, that... 
 - You used to be less uptight with me.

110
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,140
Was I?

111
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,150
You aren't drunk at all, are you?

112
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:50,250
You can't fit in there, so you thought you'd be fine celebrating with friends here.

113
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,960
But you no longer fit in here like before.

114
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,860
That's you now, isn't it?

115
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,240
- How could you tell? 
 - You know what?

116
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,950
Let's sneak off.

117
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,070
Huh?

118
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,160
Somehow I'm sorry.

119
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,150
That's...

120
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,390
something I want to hear from a gorgeous woman.

121
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,190
- Stop laughing at me. 
 - I just can't. I mean...

122
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,960
"Ezra"?

123
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,010
I said I'm sorry.

124
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:34,710
Stop picking at a fresh wound like that.

125
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,840
Ouch.

126
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:42,310
That just means you're still interested in her.

127
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,740
Yeah, you're right about that.

128
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,970
But it's such a Tokyo occurrence.

129
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,400
Hey, at least you're faring better than I am.

130
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,560
Sorry?

131
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:59,920
Actually, I went to Tokyo to look for a girl I liked.

132
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,610
- You're kidding. 
 - I am.

133
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,570
Huh?

134
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,390
You were?

135
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,030
Yeah, of course.

136
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:11,130
Hey, it's hard to believe you're lying with that serious face.

137
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,210
Here's the truth.

138
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,190
I went to look for my long-lost younger brother.

139
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,800
- Really? 
 - No, it's a lie.

140
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,170
What the heck? Do you have a thing for lying?

141
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,150
Doesn't everyone lie to some extent?

142
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,250
People like saying, "My hometown's the best" or "Tokyo's the best."

143
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,170
But no one ever means it with all their heart.

144
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,460
Doesn't matter where you are.

145
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,330
Doesn't matter if you're clinching a job, getting married, or raising children.

146
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:48,510
Everyone says their life is happiest at the moment.

147
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,500
But that happiness is tainted by all kinds of misfortunes.

148
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,890
Some people think that's lying, while others don't.

149
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,830
You know,

150
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:08,210
I thought... life would change once I got to Tokyo.

151
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,650
Not that I knew how it would.

152
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:20,740
But nothing has changed so far.

153
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,970
After all, I'll have a beer.

154
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,440
You're drinking?

155
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,850
Yeah.

156
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,160
Excuse me, can we pay?

157
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:49,200
Didn't you think life would be more dramatic?

158
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,130
Like something would eventually grip your soul.

159
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:59,860
We expected Tokyo to present us with unexpected adventures.

160
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:04,310
We thought our lives would barrel down unimaginable paths.

161
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,980
Just that our hometown is now a place you visit and no longer return to.

162
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,370
And riding the Tokyo subway has become a walk in the park.

163
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:17,060
We're even able to direct taxi drivers on which routes to take.

164
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,340
It's hitting too close to home now.

165
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,110
Hey...

166
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:28,560
But reality is drab. It offers nothing.

167
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,880
There's no reason to go to Tokyo,

168
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:39,650
nor is there a good reason to stay.

169
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,900
Can your job only be done in Tokyo?

170
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,040
- No. 
 - Do you have a lover there?

171
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,280
- No. 
 - Will anyone be in trouble if you leave Tokyo?

172
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,270
- No. 
 - That means it's fine for you to come back.

173
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,960
There's no reason to refuse.

174
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,610
But here's the thing.

175
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,860
Will anyone be in a fix if we're in Tokyo?

176
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,120
No.

177
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,900
- Are you going to inherit a family business here? 
 - No.

178
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,130
- Do you have some kind of arranged marriage here? 
 - No.

179
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:23,260
Does that really matter in this case?

180
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,270
Why don't you stay?

181
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,770
It's our life.

182
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:35,350
 How should I put it... That's my life, isn't it? 

183
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,680
I get it now.

184
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,630
That's why Tokyo's great.

185
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,040
Everyone's living as they please.

186
00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:00,320
Over here, we're only drinking beer if that's the choice for the night.

187
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,300
The same goes for Japanese liquor.

188
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,240
But I want to drink beer and Japanese liquor

189
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,830
whenever I like.

190
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,650
I also want to enjoy Lemon Sours, wines, and Highballs.

191
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,300
Mojitos and tequilas, too.

192
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,670
I want to drink whenever and whatever I want.

193
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,780
Is that why you're in Tokyo?

194
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,940
I guess...

195
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,320
- you could say so? 
 - Hey, don't ask me.

196
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:48,170
Why didn't we chat much in middle school?

197
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,740
- Who knows? 
 - You were buddies with Kubota.

198
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,430
- Yeah. 
 - But we hardly talked.

199
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:58,320
Then I was a friend of a friend you hardly spoke to.

200
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,950
That's exactly it.

201
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,810
Thank you.

202
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,820
What for?

203
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,810
Actually...

204
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,750
I quit my job.

205
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,180
- What? 
 - I was overworked.

206
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,900
And depressed, I guess. So, I couldn't work.

207
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:31,500
I was stuck at home sleeping or stuffing my mouth with food.

208
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:39,570
Dreams, aims, ambitions, hobbies... I had none of that.

209
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:44,530
I was staying in Tokyo for no real reason.

210
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,260
I also didn't want to move back here.

211
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:52,260
But none of that matters, right?

212
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,070
It's my life to decide.

213
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:05,760
You meant what you just said now, didn't you?

214
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,770
No, I lied.

215
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,100
It's true.

216
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,180
- Which is it? 
 - Who knows?

217
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,170
I wonder.

218
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,260
Say...

219
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:27,080
 ­  

220
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,860
-   Hello?  
 - Hello.

221
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,000
 Where are you? 

222
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,980
- Um... 
 - Kubota?

223
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,620
 Come back quickly. 

224
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,860
Well...

225
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,290
Got it.

226
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:14,030
Kizaki, are you coming along?

227
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,810
No, I'll pass.

228
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,490
Sure.

229
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,700
Tokyo's the best!
