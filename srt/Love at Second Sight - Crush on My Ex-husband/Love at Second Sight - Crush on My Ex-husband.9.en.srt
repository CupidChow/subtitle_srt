00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:24,760
So we will never be apart.

10
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,599
I haven't brushed my teeth yet.

11
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,839
I'll help you.

OK.

13
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,919
Let's brush your teeth, OK?

14
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,279
Be good, alright?

15
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,720
Wash your face.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,898
Wash your face.

17
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,199
You are so heavy.

18
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,279
Are you pretending to be asleep

19
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:04,680
and trying to take advantage of me?

20
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:32,880
(Last night,)

21
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:36,320
(what on earth did I do?)

- Morning, President Qi.
- Morning, President Qi.

24
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,279
Morning.

25
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:47,639
President Qi, let me tell you

26
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,800
your schedule today.

27
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,839
Ten o'clock in the morning,

28
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:52,039
you'll have an online meeting

29
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,320
with Mr. Zhang of Weisen Technology.

30
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,520
And in the afternoon...

31
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,360
(Are you pretending to be asleep)

32
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,800
(and trying to take advantage of me?)

33
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:26,440
If I continue,

34
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,199
I would be taking advantage of you.

35
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,919
I am a strong woman

36
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,320
dedicating on my career.

37
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
I must remember that.

38
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,559
Jiang Shishi.

39
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,600
Don't go, don't go.

40
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,679
(No, I need to focus on my career.)

41
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,279
President Qi.

42
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:01,960
Enough.

43
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:03,600
Enough, President Qi.

44
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:14,679
President Qi.

45
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,922
Hi.

46
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,799
Let's go.

47
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:36,760
Hello.

48
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,160
Hello, is this Ms. Jiang Shishi?

49
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,220
Yes.

50
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,679
I am the assistant
of President Lin of DK Group.

51
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,600
President Lin

52
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,320
appreciates your design very much.

53
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,480
I wonder if you

54
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,279
have any intention to work in DK?

55
00:04:47,362 --> 00:04:48,279
Sorry,

56
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,839
I'm not considering
changing my job for now.

57
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:51,760
OK.

58
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,839
I actually refused DK!

59
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:01,679
That is the leading company
in the jewelry industry!

60
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,739
Well,

61
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:09,399
now is not the time to leave Jun Yue.

62
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:17,040
Sir, Ms. Jiang has declined.

63
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,559
Jun Yue has just
entered the jewelry industry.

64
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,600
I don't think

65
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,480
it's a threat for us now.

66
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,519
Although Jun Yue has just
entered the jewelry industry,

67
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,359
Qi Junye cannot be underestimated.

68
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,359
We must defeat him
as soon as possible.

69
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:31,880
So why does it have to be Ms. Jiang?

70
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:36,839
Everybody has weaknesses.

71
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,160
Jiang Shishi,

72
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,920
looks like
we are destined to meet again.

73
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:57,399
I like you.

74
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,519
Will you be my girlfriend?

75
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,320
You are...

76
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:05,258
Cheers.

77
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,760
It's you!

78
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,480
I don't even know your name yet.

79
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,359
My name is Lin Mochen.

80
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,399
So, will you be my girlfriend,

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,880
Jiang Shishi?

82
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,959
Boss. You've got a rival in love.

83
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,440
He has a

84
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:20,720
wicked face.

85
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,640
But I heard he is a famous playboy,

86
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:25,279
and there is no girl he can't get.

87
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,839
Jiang Shishi is not that kind of woman.

88
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,000
Don't you think

89
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,239
it's too fast?

90
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,559
Currently

91
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,040
I have no plan to fall in love yet.

92
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:34,938
OK.

93
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:36,079
That's a no then.

94
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,239
It's OK.

95
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,640
I'll make some change next time.

96
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:42,760
OK, private matters are done.

97
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,519
Let's talk about business.

98
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:52,920
You are the president of DK Group?

99
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,079
You declined DK Group's job offer,

100
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,239
I want to know the reason.

101
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,760
I'm not planning to go to DK.

102
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,200
Well, it seems our previous offer

103
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,399
was not attractive enough for you.

104
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,959
Alright, I'll think about it

105
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,399
and come up with a better offer.

106
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,679
See you next time.

107
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,679
What a unique way to leave.

108
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Boss, where are you going?

109
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,841
To a show.

110
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
To a show?

111
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,320
What kind of flowers are these?

112
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,279
These are balloon flowers.

113
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,279
Its flower language is
sincerity and honesty.

114
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,279
How beautiful!

115
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:53,279
They symbolize my sincerity towards you.

116
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,359
He's still not giving up?

117
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:58,040
But...

118
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,193
President Qi,

119
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:00,670
- you can't just stand here.
- I can't accept it.

120
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:02,359
You have to fight back.

121
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,119
Boss, I've got it!

122
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,079
He's here again

123
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,160
with tulips.

124
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,920
What kind of flowers did you prepare?

125
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,239
What flower?

126
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,480
Are you planning to go empty-handed?

127
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,600
Just wait and see.

128
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,520
Have you finished your work?

129
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,280
Work can never be finished.

130
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,799
So why are you leaving the office?

131
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,239
I have finished today's tasks.

132
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,239
Look at the others,

133
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,760
and look at me, the president.

134
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,953
Nobody has left work yet.

135
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,679
You are not leaving

136
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:49,919
because your work efficiency is low.

137
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,799
I won't do

138
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,039
any kind of

139
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,119
meaningless work.

140
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:56,840
I'm leaving work on time.

141
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,840
Goodbye.

142
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,039
You are not fighting back!

143
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,159
You are helping your rival.

144
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:36,239
Why did you throw my flowers away?

145
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:38,035
Stop taking gifts from another man

146
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:38,919
back to my house.

147
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,239
What are you talking about?

148
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:42,080
I bought it myself.

149
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,679
I'm just reminding you.

150
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,320
Although we are divorced,

151
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,479
cheating during

152
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,880
the cooling-off period is still cheating.

153
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,760
Who cheated?

154
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,239
I'm just kindly reminding you.

155
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,320
That dandy who comes every day

156
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,719
is unreliable.

157
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,880
Lin Mochen, the President of DK.

158
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,080
You can search him online.

159
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,719
His scandals are everywhere.

160
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,760
Can he be worse than you,
President Qi?
