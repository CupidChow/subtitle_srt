9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,880
Sir, Madam Qi went out
for morning exercise

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,720
with Mrs. Zhang
with the jade jewelry.

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,119
Shishi has already left for work.

12
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,200
She has left?

13
00:01:08,559 --> 00:01:09,519
Please have breakfast.

14
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,360
(Jun Yue Group)

15
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,400
Please sign here.

16
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,199
Boss, why are your clothes
so disheveled today?

17
00:01:23,839 --> 00:01:25,720
Could it be that some female employee
did something...

18
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:30,720
Let me make a quick report.

19
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,239
Mrs. Qi came very early today,

20
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:34,040
and she learned how to use the printer.

21
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,160
Mind your own business.

22
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:37,519
Yes, President Qi.

23
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,599
Here comes the breakfast.

24
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:05,480
Let me get it.

25
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,698
I'll do it myself.

26
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:10,960
Come home early, OK?

27
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,880
Why do I keep thinking about her?

28
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:19,320
I knew she's doing this on purpose.

29
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,479
I must not fall for it!

30
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,559
I need to work harder.

31
00:02:36,124 --> 00:02:37,000
President Qi,

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,039
why are you watering the flower?

33
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,520
It's too dry.

34
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:45,279
Oh, right...

35
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,616
President Qi,

36
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:52,880
don't tell me
you are trying to avoid me.

37
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,802
Why should I?

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,888
President Qi,

39
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:10,240
please pay attention
to your appearance.

40
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,019
Jiang Shishi,

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,887
let's talk.

42
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,119
To avoid embarrassment,

43
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,839
we need to reduce contact.

44
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,939
In the future,

45
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,880
let's try to avoid

46
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,440
what happened just now.

47
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:44,879
Qi Junye,

48
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,160
why didn't I notice
how narcissistic you were before?

49
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,039
You think I'm playing hard to get

50
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,639
to win you back

51
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,440
because I can't do

52
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,679
without you?

53
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,681
After all,

54
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,919
that is possible.

55
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,700
And there's one more thing.

56
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,080
My mom doesn't know
about our divorce yet,

57
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:09,759
so when you are at home,

58
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:12,160
you should still behave as my wife.

59
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,959
I was really fooled by your face

60
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:26,160
when I first met you.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,559
I didn't even know

62
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,679
it's full of rubbish.

63
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:32,519
Sit down, Qi Junye,
listen to me carefully.

64
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:34,359
First,

65
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,679
I loved you,

66
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:39,320
but it's different now.

67
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,359
Second,

68
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,679
we have already divorced.

69
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,200
I refuse to fulfill

70
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:49,000
the demands

71
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,320
you just named.

72
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:55,079
I am a person with autonomy.

73
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,279
I only do things
according to my own ideas.

74
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,359
Moreover, President Qi,

75
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,760
this is the company.

76
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,600
Don't you think it's inappropriate

77
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,440
to talk about personal matters

78
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,540
with a female employee in your office?

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,600
Since we are in the cooling-off period,

80
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,079
maybe you should cool yourself off,
President Qi.

81
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,399
If that's all,

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,600
I have to get back to work, President Qi.

83
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,679
(But I still think President Qi
and Director Chu are a better match.)

84
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,320
(But haven't you watched
enough soap operas?)

85
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,559
(Women like Director Chu)

86
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:40,519
(are always supporting roles.)

87
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:42,160
(And Jiang Shishi)

88
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,320
(is not that simple.)

89
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,640
(The relationships
among the three of them)

90
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,119
(are quite complicated.)

91
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,480
There's a project meeting at 2 PM.

92
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,720
Everyone, get ready.

93
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
OK.

94
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,284
Jiang Shishi!

95
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:16,160
Who is that? What are you doing?

96
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:20,154
You, you, you...

97
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,440
Why are you here?

98
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,523
Then she, she, she...

99
00:06:23,888 --> 00:06:24,759
What are you doing?

100
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,880
Are you crazy?

101
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,359
It's really not me.

102
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,119
What a crazy woman!

103
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:31,679
Chu Yu, look what you did!

104
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:36,640
Junye!

105
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,839
Jiang Shishi... She...

106
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,519
I really can't take it anymore.

107
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,320
Junye, please save me.

108
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,760
Jiang Shishi, leave Jun Yue immediately!

109
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,559
You still remember the terms
in our agreement, don't you?

110
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:57,760
If I leave Jun Yue,

111
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,440
I can't guarantee what secret

112
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,399
my mouth will leak out.

113
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,724
President Qi,

114
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:06,359
you won't make
such a stupid decision, right?

115
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,559
What's going on between them?

116
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:14,519
- I don't know.
- What's happening?

117
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,119
You don't have work now?

118
00:07:16,857 --> 00:07:17,719
Mr. Qi.

119
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,160
Mr. Qi.

120
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,559
- Let's go.
- Get back to work.

121
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:22,818
Come on.

122
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,440
Stop looking.

123
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,320
Junye, find a place
for Chu Yu to have some rest.

124
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,920
Let me talk to Shishi.

125
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Junye.

126
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,561
Second Uncle.

127
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:42,160
This is your first job, right?

128
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,250
How do you feel?

129
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,320
I'm still adapting to it.

130
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,559
You are a smart girl.

131
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,320
Besides, I'm here for you,

132
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,119
nobody would dare bully you.

133
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,480
You are treating me the best
in the whole Qi family.

134
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,959
This is a private u-shield for
senior management of the company.

135
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,279
You can use it to log in
to the company's intranet,

136
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,040
and check some of
the previous projects of Jun Yue.

137
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,239
Maybe it will be helpful for your design.

138
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,640
That's great, thank you, Second Uncle.
