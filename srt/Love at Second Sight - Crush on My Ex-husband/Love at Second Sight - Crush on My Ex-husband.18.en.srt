He's here!

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,750
Of course.

11
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,279
Junye, you are finally here.

12
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:44,840
We have been waiting for you.

13
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:46,360
Sorry, Mr. Chu.

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,479
He was delayed by his work.

15
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:49,759
Young men always
prioritize their careers.

16
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:50,650
Sit down.

17
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,000
- Sit, sit, sit.
- Mom.

18
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:53,599
What are you doing?

19
00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:55,520
Junye, please cooperate.

20
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:57,680
- Sorry, I am already married.
- Sit down. Sit down.

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,114
What's happening?

22
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,319
This is the last chance for the Qi family.

23
00:01:07,839 --> 00:01:08,776
OK.

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,532
Thank you.

25
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,305
Not just for this,

26
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:16,480
but for the medical expenses
you paid for my mom.

27
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,720
I have saved some money,

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,120
I'll pay you back in a while.

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,519
Don't mention that.

30
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:25,480
That's what I should do as a friend.

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,680
Still, I have to thank you.

32
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,959
This is also what I have to do.

33
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,448
Let's eat.

34
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,800
(No matter what happens,)

35
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,360
(you are still the only niece-in-law
in my heart.)

36
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,599
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,519
I need to go to the bathroom.

38
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,519
Come on, be good, Junye.

39
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:02,360
Sit down, please sit down.

40
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,919
Junye, although
we didn't tell you in advance,

41
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,160
we just want to help you
get Jun Yue back.

42
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,320
Don't be angry.

43
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,039
Sorry, guys.

44
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:12,872
Junye.

45
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:16,942
Shishi.

46
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:21,329
Sorry,

47
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,839
but I won't marry Chu Yu.

48
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:25,639
- What are you talking about?
- Dad.

49
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,683
Qi Junye,

50
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:28,600
have you thought it through?

51
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:31,800
Our Chu family has never been
treated like this before.

52
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:37,530
President Chu,

53
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,385
I'm sorry

54
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,839
to have wasted your time.

55
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:45,119
But I have already thought it through.

56
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,320
Chu Yu is a very good girl.

57
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,600
She is excellent.

58
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:50,880
But we are not right for each other.

59
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:53,440
Junye, think before you speak.

60
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:56,600
Qi Junye, tonight
is our engagement banquet.

61
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,759
Are you really going to
leave me like this?

62
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,179
Yu.

63
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:01,258
Dad.

64
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:05,800
Maybe somebody didn't know
about my previous marriage.

65
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,919
I'll tell you here today

66
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,320
that I, Qi Junye, will only

67
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,960
have one wife in this life, and she is

68
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:16,720
Jiang Shishi.

69
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,800
If you really go out,

70
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,160
the Qi family will be doomed.

71
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,720
It won't as long as she is here.

72
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,679
She is the most shining person

73
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,639
I have ever seen.

74
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,320
She is sensitive.

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,559
She never stirs up trouble.

76
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
She's always real.

77
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,960
She never complains about difficulties.

78
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,199
She has enough self-respect.

79
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,459
So

80
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:45,800
she is the only woman
I want to marry in my life.

81
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:47,679
It can only be her

82
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,039
and it has to be her.

83
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,338
Let's go.

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,440
Junye! Junye!

85
00:03:57,559 --> 00:03:58,536
Dad.

86
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,199
I'm really sorry, Mr. Chu.

87
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,000
- This is a misunderstanding.
- Yu, let's go.

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,639
I will ask Junye
to apologize to you later.

89
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,600
This is really a misunderstanding.

90
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:07,759
Sorry, everyone.

91
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,440
I feel so good now!

92
00:04:28,239 --> 00:04:30,040
I don't like the absence
of your traces at home.

93
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,239
I don't like it when you
smile at other people

94
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:36,239
but show me a cold face.

95
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,040
I want to be with you.

96
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,040
As long as we are together,

97
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:45,559
I can give up everything.

98
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,040
I don't want to.

99
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,265
Why?

100
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:03,146
Qi Junye,

101
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:06,440
I have a question for you,

102
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:08,760
and I'll only ask you this once.

103
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,679
Is my father's death

104
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:15,519
related to you?

105
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,239
I don't know.

106
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,799
What's going on in your mind?

107
00:05:30,119 --> 00:05:31,399
A suspenseful drama?

108
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:34,160
So what is the truth?

109
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,920
About that,

110
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,079
actually, I have always regretted it.

111
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,559
That project was important
for both of our groups back then.

112
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
If

113
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,359
I hadn't competed with your father,

114
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,119
he wouldn't have worked overtime

115
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,440
at the factory so much.

116
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,040
Maybe the accident

117
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:53,760
wouldn't have happened.

118
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:57,040
How could I possibly
harm him on purpose?

119
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,839
I'm sorry.

120
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,040
I didn't want to believe it either,

121
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,601
but after I read those project documents...

122
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,680
How did you get those documents?

123
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,360
Second Uncle gave them to me.

124
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
Actually, leaving Jun Yue

125
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,441
is just the first step of my plan.

126
00:06:25,481 --> 00:06:26,481
My true purpose

127
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:27,800
is to find out the real reason

128
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,360
for Jun Yue's failed listing.

129
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,680
Lin Mochen and Second Uncle?

130
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,201
Second Uncle is the mole?

131
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:42,340
That's right.

132
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:45,321
I checked all the projects

133
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,481
that were handled by him,

134
00:06:46,721 --> 00:06:48,321
and I found some clues.

135
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,840
When your father and I
were competing,

136
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,240
he frequently contacted your father.

137
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:55,005
And

138
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,601
he cooperated with Jiang Group.

139
00:06:58,441 --> 00:07:00,400
He wanted to team up with my father

140
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:02,041
to deal with you?

141
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:06,001
We were already engaged at that time,

142
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,360
so of course your father wouldn't agree.

143
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,441
So now I suspect

144
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:13,120
your father's death

145
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,201
was really not an accident.

146
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,520
Don't worry, I'm here.

147
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:24,240
We will definitely find out the truth.

148
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:34,001
Thank you, Qi Junye.

149
00:07:37,562 --> 00:07:38,405
By the way,

150
00:07:38,836 --> 00:07:41,156
there's something else
I want to tell you.

151
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:44,960
This baby...

152
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,001
It's ours.

153
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,041
I never doubted that.

154
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
After all,

155
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,840
I don't believe you will fall in love

156
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,240
with any other man,

157
00:07:58,978 --> 00:07:59,840

I asked Ms. Jiang, the great designer,

165
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:21,800
to design this necklace for me.

166
00:08:26,161 --> 00:08:27,560
I hope she can feel

167
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:29,601

00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:43,921

What did Jiang Shishi

178
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,481
drug you with?

179
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,960
You are even giving up
Jun Yue and this home for her.

180
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:21,520
You call this a home?

181
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,801
What are you saying?

182
00:09:24,801 --> 00:09:27,840
This place is all about

183
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,520
interests and calculations.

184
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,130
Mom,

185
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:34,921
do you see me as your son

186
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,320
or your tool for fighting for interests?

187
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:40,921
You've been controlling me
for so many years.

188
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,801
I think that's enough.

189
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,440
From now on,

190
00:09:46,361 --> 00:09:48,161
I will only follow my heart.

191
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:50,041
I came back just to tell you that

192
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:52,721
Jun Yue will no longer

193
00:09:52,721 --> 00:09:54,320
be the first priority in my life.

194
00:09:56,066 --> 00:09:56,941
You...

195
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,561
Shishi, what's wrong with you?

196
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,241
I'm fine, Mom.

197
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,400
Lin Mochen and Second Uncle?

198
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,400
Second Uncle is the mole?

199
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,080
Actually, leaving Jun Yue

200
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,601
is just the first step of my plan.

201
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:22,440
My true purpose

202
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,000
is to find out the real reason

203
00:10:25,241 --> 00:10:26,161
for Jun Yue's failed listing.

204
00:10:26,361 --> 00:10:27,960
(So we need to work together
to put on a play)

205
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,241
(and let the fox reveal its tail.)

206
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:33,161
(It seems we have to
lure the snake out of its hole.)
