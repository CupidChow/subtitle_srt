9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,159
(If happiness can be quantified,)

10
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:43,479
(then now)

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,680
(is the happiest moment of my life.)

12
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,040
(Thanks to my mother-in-law,)

13
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:52,720
(Qi Junye)

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,080
(is all mine tonight.)

15
00:01:07,919 --> 00:01:09,000
(My name is Jiang Shishi.)

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,760
(I'm a full-time housewife.)

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,519
(Home is my workplace.)

18
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,239
(Being elegant and beautiful
is my responsibility.)

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,800
(Keeping my nose clean is my principle.)

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,319
(And giving birth to two babies
within three years)

21
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,959
(is the KPI I must achieve.)

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,559
(I have been married for two years,)

23
00:01:25,559 --> 00:01:27,319
(but I haven't even had a child.)

24
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,440
(So my immediate boss,)

25
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:31,720
(my mother-in-law,
is very unhappy about this.)

26
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,919
(She has expressed
the idea of firing me)

27
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:35,519
(more than once.)

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,720
(For the harmony and happiness
of the family,)

29
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:40,279
(I have to be more obedient.)

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,279
(I know it costs a lot)

31
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,959
(to be a perfect housewife.)

32
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:49,239
Madam Qi, I will try my best.

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,199
Good.

34
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,720
(But I am willing to
accept the challenge)

35
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,519
(because his family is rich.)

36
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,040
(No, no, no. We are a perfect
match in every aspect after all.)

37
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,400
(My maternal family is also rich.)

38
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,800
(I married him because I loved him.)

39
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,480
(As the only son of the Qi family,
and the President of Jun Yue Group,)

40
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,760
(my husband Qi Junye)

41
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:09,199
(is not only successful in career
but also cool and handsome.)

42
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:10,320
(He's like the hero)

43
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,679
(in an idol drama.)

44
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,919
Junye, why did you get up so early
on weekends?

45
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,880
The group is going public,

46
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:19,320
but some papers are not ready yet.

47
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,160
Take care of yourself.

48
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
Don't work too hard.

49
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,320
Shishi, remember to send
some snacks to Junye later.

50
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,160
OK, Madam Qi.

51
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,119
(I made some snacks.)

52
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,559
(Qi Junye)
(Do you want to have some?)

53
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:39,400
(I made some snacks.
Do you want to have some?)

54
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:53,200
(I miss you, Junye.)

55
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Sir, follow that car in front please.

56
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,039
No problem!

57
00:03:58,119 --> 00:03:59,800
Right here, Starlight Building.

58
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,320
Kissing! They are kissing!

59
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,920
(I am the biggest laughingstock
in the world.)

60
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,480
(Divorce Agreement)

61
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,201
What does it mean?

62
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,839
You want to divorce me?

63
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,000
Yes, that's right.

64
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:39,440
(Divorce Agreement)
Considering your current situation,

65
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,640
quitting being Mrs. Qi

66
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,160
is not a smart choice.

67
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:45,519
That is my business.

68
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,399
Can you be a little more sober?

69
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,279
I have never been
as sober as I am now.

70
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,640
I have a condition.

71
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,519
The cooling-off period for divorce
is one month.

72
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,959
I hope that in this month,

73
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,880
we can maintain a normal married life.

74
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:06,559
Now is a critical period
for the listing of Jun Yue.

75
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:08,160
I cannot be distracted by anything.

76
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:10,480
After the listing audit is completed
in one month,

77
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,559
the cooling-off period for divorce
will also be over.

78
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,880
Let's announce the divorce then.

79
00:05:15,425 --> 00:05:16,339
OK.

80
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:19,119
But I also have a condition.

81
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,519
Don't worry, you'll get
your share of the property.

82
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:25,119
I'm not interested in your money.

83
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,500
What do you want then?

84
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,799
(Jiang Group
is going downhill,)

85
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,200
(but after all,)

86
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:36,200
(nothing would have
happened to Mr. Jiang if you...)

87
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,313
Second Uncle,

88
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,200
why don't you finish
what you are talking?

89
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:43,440
You just want to say
what happened to my father-in-law

90
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,079
was because of me, right?

91
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,679
(So I wouldn't have lost my father)

92
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,880
(if it hadn't been for him?)

93
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,640
I want to work in Jun Yue.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,559
I need a job.

95
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,200
(Husband: Qi Junye)
