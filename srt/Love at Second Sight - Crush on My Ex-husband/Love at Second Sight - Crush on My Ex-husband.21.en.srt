=Episode 21=

9
00:00:46,673 --> 00:00:47,520
Boss.

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,159
She is the daughter of the gatekeeper.

11
00:01:18,199 --> 00:01:20,360
I saw the whole thing.

12
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,519
At that time, I went to
deliver food to my dad.

13
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,639
- (But at the gate...)
- We agreed to work together,

14
00:01:26,639 --> 00:01:28,400
why did you change your mind?

15
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:30,400
I have never agreed to this.

16
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:31,457
Let me tell you.

17
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:32,559
After I take control,

18
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,319
I can give you the shares of Jun Yue.

19
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:36,519
I am not interested in it.

20
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,239
Then why are you giving your daughter
to the Qi family?

21
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:43,080
Stop pretending.

22
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:45,879
(I saw a man)

23
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:46,919
(arguing with Mr. Jiang.)

24
00:01:47,559 --> 00:01:48,879
I was very scared.

25
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:51,559
Later, that man didn't leave.

26
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,400
(He lit a lighter.)

27
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:02,040
How dare you fool me!

28
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,239
Help! There's fire!

29
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,839
Help! Help! Save me!

30
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,440
- Help!
- Help! Is there anyone there?

31
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,080
(This is)

32
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,600
(what happened.)

33
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,960
I wanted to save Mr. Jiang,

34
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:25,639
but the fire was too fierce.

35
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,039
I wanted to call the police,

36
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,679
but my dad told me to keep it a secret

37
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,240
and forget about it.

38
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,919
He said I had to be silent

39
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:37,759
if I wanted to go to school

40
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:39,639
and my mom to be cured.

41
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,800
I guessed that

42
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:44,440
Dad took money

43
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:45,919
from that person.

44
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,119
But that was a human life!

45
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,960
How could you do that

46
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,160
just for some money?

47
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,039
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,759
Our family really
needed the money at that time.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,039
Dad passed away last week.

50
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:06,320
Before dying,

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,160
this is what he mentioned.

52
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,279
I don't want to continue living

53
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,960
with guilt.

54
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,199
Now we've got sufficient evidence,

55
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:40,313
it's time for us

56
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,279
to reveal the whole truth.

57
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,403
Junye.

58
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:48,119
Thank you, if it weren't for you,

59
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,080
the truth would never be revealed,

60
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:53,000
and I wouldn't know in my lifetime

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,039
how my father...

62
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,039
Silly girl, you don't need

63
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,639
to thank me.

64
00:04:00,266 --> 00:04:01,164
It was you who gave me

65
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,800
the motivation to regain Jun Yue.

66
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,720
I became a better self for you.

67
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,402
Junye?

68
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,279
What are you two doing here?

69
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:44,201
Second Uncle.

70
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,600
It's time to settle the accounts.

71
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:48,585
What accounts?

72
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,720
I don't know what you are talking about.

73
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,760
You are still pretending?

74
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,959
It's you who has been
secretly sabotaging Jun Yue.

75
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,839
It was you who murdered my father
for your own selfish desires.

76
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,679
Shishi, you can't say that.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,959
What does your father's death
have to do with me?

78
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,480
(He is the current president
of Jun Yue Group,)

79
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,839
(Qi Shuli.)

80
00:05:14,799 --> 00:05:16,079
(I saw it with my own eyes)

81
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,239
(that he threw the lighter
into the factory building,)

82
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,119
(and then locked the door.)

83
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
(Then Mr. Jiang)

84
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,040
(was burnt alive.)

85
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,119
This is slander!

86
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:29,119
We have already obtained
all the evidence against you.

87
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:30,519
Are you still going to quibble?

88
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,480
Shishi, I'm sorry.

89
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:40,559
I made a mistake.

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,359
This was just an accident.

91
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,399
I haven't slept well

92
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,040
for so many years.

93
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,359
I regret it so much, Shishi.

94
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,600
Give me another chance, OK?

95
00:05:53,696 --> 00:05:54,559
I have treated you well.

96
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,359
For the sake of that,

97
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:57,959
please let me compensate you.

98
00:05:59,119 --> 00:05:59,986
Shishi.

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,359
You... You...

100
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,320
Please forgive me

101
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,040
for the sake of your baby, OK?

102
00:06:10,391 --> 00:06:11,258
Turn yourself in.

103
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:13,880
We are here today

104
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,399
to persuade you to turn yourself in.

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,320
Don't make another mistake.

106
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll go with you.

107
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,040
I'll go with you.

108
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:48,399
Second Uncle, calm down.

109
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,880
- Don't move.
- Let go of Shishi.

110
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,799
- I can give up everything.
- Don't move or you'll regret it.

111
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,480
Believer me, I'll do anything.

112
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,239
- Second Uncle, calm down.
- Junye.

113
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:57,399
Don't come over.

114
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:58,977
Junye.

115
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,359
- Second uncle.
- Don't move.

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,938
Junye.
