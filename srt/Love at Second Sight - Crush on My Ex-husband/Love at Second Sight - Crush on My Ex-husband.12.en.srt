9
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,639
There is no Plan B at all.

10

Are you really so useless?

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,360
Doesn't Jiang Shishi
have an auction item?

12
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:48,799
You'll purchase it,

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,240
put it on her personally,

14
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:52,000
and then tell everyone
that she is Mrs. Qi.

15
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:53,639
I'll make the preparations.

(Jun Yue Group Charity Gala)

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,319
Welcome everyone
to Jun Yue Charity Gala.

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,040
I declare that
the auction is officially starting.

19
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:08,826
OK.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,120
The first auction item

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,199
belongs to Miss Chu Yu
from the Chu Group.

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,639
This string of jade beads

23
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,639
was originally in the imperial palace
of the Qing Dynasty.

24
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,199
It has extremely high collection value.

25
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,800
The starting price
is five hundred thousand.

26
00:01:24,104 --> 00:01:24,959
Six hundred thousand.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,890
Seven hundred thousand.

28
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:28,360
- Seven hundred thousand, first.
- Junye,

29
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,204
raise your plate

30
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,559
and buy it.

31
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,080
Seven hundred thousand, second.

32
00:01:33,199 --> 00:01:34,066
One million.

33
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,199
One million, first.

34
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:40,080
One million, second.

35
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:42,040
One million, third.

36
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,915
Sold!

37
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,279
Congratulations to
President Qi of Jun Yue Group.

38
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,319
He got the bead string
with one million.

39
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,160
The next auction item

40
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,120
is something I've never met before.

41
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,199
This item

42
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,519
belongs to a rising designer
from the Jun Yue Group,

43
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,639
Ms. Jiang Shishi.

44
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,279
It's a pair of crystal earrings

45
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,599
designed and made by her.

46
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,959
The starting price is one yuan.

47
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,479
She even brought
such a low-grade stuff.

48
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,839
I'm afraid it's only worth one yuan.

49
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,759
Please, this is a charity gala.

50
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,360
Can you think of anything

51
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,679
other than money?

52
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,039
One million.

53
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,559
One point two million.

54
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:27,800
One point two million, first.

55
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:29,240
One point five million.

56
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,199
One point five million, first.

57
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,520
One point eight million.

58
00:02:32,679 --> 00:02:33,520
Two million.

59
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,360
Junye.

60
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,600
Two million, first.

61
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,800
Two million, second.

62
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:41,960
Two point two million.

63
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,600
Two point two million, first.

64
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:47,800
I really can't understand

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,199
- Two point two million, second.
- these rich people.

66
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,732
OK.

67
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,759
Just now, a Mr. John

68
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,880
participated in our auction online.

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,440
He offered five million.

70
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,720
Five million?

71
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:04,600
Is there any raise?

72
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,080
What's wrong with this Mr. John?

73
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,759
Five million, first.

74
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,160
- Maybe he really likes it.
- Five million, second.

75
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,880
Five million, third.

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,867
Sold!

77
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,639
Congratulations, Mr. John,

78
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,800
for getting a pair of crystal earrings.

79
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,000
It seems that Plan B has also failed.

80
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:30,559
This Mr. John really has a good taste.

81
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:32,639
Now I'm a

82
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,000
five million designer.

83
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,679
I'll charge more
for repairing the necklace.

84
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,520
Well, I am really surprised.

85
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,307
Dad.

86
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,360
I really want to be with Junye.

87
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:53,399
It's not that I want to stop you,

88
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,960
but are you sure about this?

89
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,600
Do you want to be with him

90
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,039
because you like him

91
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,240
or because of

92
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,360
some obsession?

93
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,360
It's because I like him of course.

94
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,320
Haven't you noticed

95
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,919
that he loves somebody else?

96
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,440
But I just want to be with him.

97
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,279
I don't care. Just propose
a business alliance with him,

98
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:15,360
he will definitely agree to be with me.

99
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,839
But do you think
you'll be happy that way?

100
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,559
Love is not something you can force.

101
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,839
Think about it carefully.

102
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,087
Dad.

103
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:35,519
Jiang Shishi,

104
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,679
I didn't expect you
to be capable enough

105
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,480
to hook up with
Lin Mochen from DK Group.

106
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:43,920
You are just everywhere.

107
00:04:43,921 --> 00:04:44,809
Does Junye know

108
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,079
you are such a slut?

109
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,880
Slut?

110
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,200
That's what you are.

111
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,239
Give it to me!

112
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,320
- What are you doing?
- Give it to me.

113
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,239
- You... Jiang Shishi.
- Give it back.

114
00:04:56,288 --> 00:04:57,160
Give it to me.

115
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,399
- Give it to me.
- Let go.

116
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,040
Jiang Shishi!

117
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,491
Shishi!

118
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:12,399
Shishi!

119
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,259
Shishi!

120
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,706
Shishi!

121
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,200
Quick, send her
to the emergency room!

122
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,640
Shishi, don't be afraid, I'm here.

123
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:30,040
Don't be afraid.

124
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,279
I'm here, Shishi.

125
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,239
You are not allowed to enter.

126
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:38,119
Wait outside.

127
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:39,279
We will do our best to save her.

128
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,907
Shishi!

129
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,679
You can fix it?

130
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,799
I think I can give it a try.

131
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,359
But it'll take some time.

132
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,619
I'll do my best.

133
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,959
Now I'm a

134
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,279
five million designer.

135
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,880
I'll charge more
for repairing the necklace.

136
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,279
- Give it to me.
- Give me.

137
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,154
Let go.

138
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:35,523
Shishi!

139
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:38,123
Shishi!

140
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,200
(You actually almost fainted)

141
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,000
(because of low blood sugar.)

142
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,640
Boss, I brought you some clothes.

143
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:24,799
Maybe you should get changed
and take a rest.

144
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,959
And I can take care of her for you.

145
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,162
It's OK.

146
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,239
You can leave now.

147
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:32,020
I'll stay here.

148
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,519
Call me if you need anything.

149
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,119
I'll put your clothes here.

150
00:09:04,064 --> 00:09:04,932
The doctor said

151
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:06,617
it's hard for her to wake up.

152
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,280
Normally, when people are in a coma,

153
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:19,919
they won't feel itchy.

154
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,799
Looks like I've run out of choice.

155
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,320
I have to wake you up with a kiss.

156
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:47,479
How dare you pretend!

157
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,960
You almost scared me to death!

158
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,840
I thought I would never see you again.

159
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,819
From now on,

160
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,760
I will never leave you anymore.

161
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,960
(My baby!)

162
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,159
(Does he know about
my pregnancy now?)

163
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,359
Well,

164
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:28,640
did the doctor say anything?

165
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:31,239
The doctor said you should rest well.

166
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,039
(It seems that he didn't find out,)

167
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
(and the baby must be fine.)

168
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,559
Are you hungry?
I'll go get some porridge for you.

169
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,479
(What were you thinking, Jiang Shishi?)

170
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:56,200
(You are pregnant!)
