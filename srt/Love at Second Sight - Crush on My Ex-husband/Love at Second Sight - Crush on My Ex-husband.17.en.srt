we are going for the matching test.

You are not my biological child.

What did you say?

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,520
Your dad found you back then.

14
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,840
We really wanted a child at that time,

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,360
so we kept you.

00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:56,919
Your necklace

17
00:00:57,319 --> 00:01:00,040
was the only thing left to you

00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,840
by your biological father.

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,000
Then who am I exactly?

20
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,760
Boss.

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,919
Boss, I have been fired.

22
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:35,959
Boss, I have been fired.

24
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,959
Boss, I lost my job.

25
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,480
You will save me, right?

26
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,199
What about the thing

27
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,760
I asked you to investigate?

28
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:59,360
It's done of course.

29
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:14,119
Contact those who were fired

30
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:16,119
from the Business Department,

31
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,559
and investigate this project

32
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,039

35
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:27,679
I hope

36
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,759
it's not like what I'm thinking.

(I was fortunate enough)

41
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:52,679
(to buy a pair of earrings
designed by you through auction.)

42
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:54,759

(design a set of jewelry for me?)

45
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,119
(I want to give them)

46

(to my wife)

John?

50
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:10,039
Congratulations, Mr. John,

51
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,199
for getting a pair of crystal earrings.

52
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,720
This Mr. John really has a good taste.

53
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,559
It's him.

00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,160
I know you like Americano,

59
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,025
so I just ordered it for you.

60
00:03:51,026 --> 00:03:51,939
Thank you, Madam Qi.

61
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,862
You're welcome.

62
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,080
Auntie, is there something
you want to talk to me about?

63
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,720
There's nothing important.

64
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,520
You know Junye's current situation.

65
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,199
He is such a tough person,

66
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,839
he must be feeling bad inside now.

67
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,839
You and Junye are good friends,

68
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:11,320
do you think it's possible
for the Chu family

69
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,520
to give Junye a hand?

70
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:14,320
You should be clear

71
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,399
about what I want from Junye.

72
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,838
No one would help a friend

73
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,119
at the cost of risking a whole group.

74
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,760
Do you understand what I'm saying?

75
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:24,160
I do, of course I do.

76
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:29,040
If Junye can marry me,

77
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,200
then I will definitely try my best

78
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,480
to help my husband.

79
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,119
But after Junye returns to Jun Yue,

80
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:41,119
you must pay back to the Chu Group.

81
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:43,920
Otherwise, there is no way
to persuade my dad.

82
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,839
Of course.

83
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,279
If we are a family,

84
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,799
we should definitely help each other.

85
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:50,959
But there were
some misunderstandings

86
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,279
between Junye and I.

87
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,279
Will he be willing to marry me?

88
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,559
I know my son the best.

89
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,640
Jun Yue is everything to him.

90
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:01,359
To find a way to return to Jun Yue,

91
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:03,160
he can't eat or sleep well.

92
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,679
I'm worried about him.

93
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:06,640
Chu Yu, don't worry.

94
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,600
As long as the Chu family
is willing to help,

95
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,399
he won't refuse.

96
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,440
Thank you in advance then,
Mother-in-law.

97
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,320
Of course, of course.

98
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,640
Boss, I did what you asked me to do.

99
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,720
He does have a problem.

Shall we go to Jun Yue now?

104

I knew it.

106

Of course we'll turn the table.

107
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:43,450
Not enough.

108
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:46,399
The evidence we have now
is far from enough.

109
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,359
We need to check all the projects

110
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,839
that were handled by him.

111
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,611
OK.

112
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,160
(She usually wears simple jewelries,)

113
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,160
(like pearl necklace
and things like that.)

117
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,600
(a dream of becoming
a jewelry designer.)

118
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:25,880
(But for me,)

119
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:27,959
(she chose to give up her dreams.)

120
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,519
(For you?)

121
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,480
(Yes, to take care of me,)

122
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:34,359
(she became a full-time housewife.)

123
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,600
(She organized my life
in an orderly manner.)

124
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,200
(She ties my tie,)

125
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,720
(and sends me off to work every day.)

126
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,000
Don't come back too late.

127
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,200
(She would make)

128
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,359
(my favorite cake for me.)

129
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,679
(She would stay by my side
while I was drunk.)

(in the world.)

135
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,760
Junye, you can't
stay at home all the time.

136
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:19,119
Maybe we should do something

137
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:20,033
- Hello.
- and let the Chu family...

138
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,024
Junye,

139
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,346
you are both here.

140
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,239
Do you mind if I join you?

141
00:07:25,673 --> 00:07:26,580
Of course I do.

142
00:07:26,802 --> 00:07:27,709
Mom.

143
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,600
Second Uncle, come and sit.

144
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,609
Tablewear, please.

145
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,760
- Got it.
- Thank you, Junye.

146
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:38,690
Actually,

147
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:41,200
I am here
to learn something from you.

148
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,880
What do you want to ask about?

149
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,839
Since you left the company,

150
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:46,959
it's really hard for me

151
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:48,480
to carry such a heavy burden.

152
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,347
Sir.

153
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,572
Thank you.

154
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,600
So, I want to temporarily suspend
the development of the jewelry market

155
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,119
and focus on what we are good at.

156
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:00,239
What do you think?

157
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:01,880
Quit if you can't do it.

158
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,040
Let Junye go back.

159
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:05,040
So what if you get Jun Yue?

160
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,799
You don't even have an inheritor.

161
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,040
If you and my brother
hadn't been so cruel,

162
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,880
I would have children by now.

163
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,760
I told you many times
that it was an accident!

164
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,370
Forget it.

165
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,839
Let's not mention the past.

166
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,440
I can't do anything
about Junye's matter.

167
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,640
That was the resolution
of the BOD.

168
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,160
What resolution
of the board of directors?

169
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,720
You are just bullying me and my son.

170
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,760
You just want to seize power!

171
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,719
I am really full of anger!

172
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,400
- Mom.
- I'm done.

173
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:38,640
Uncle, please don't mind.

174
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,239
You know my mom.

175
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,172
Junye, what have you been
busy with recently?

176
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:45,048
I

177
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:47,440
have grown some flowers.

178
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:50,280
Don't worry, after all this is over,

179
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:52,640
I will talk to the board of directors

180
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,760
and help you come back.

181
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,364
Go back?

182
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,359
To continue being the president?

183
00:09:01,239 --> 00:09:02,799
It's good to have Jun Yue in your hands.

184
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,640
I

185
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,520
like growing flowers.

186
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:08,697
Second Uncle,

187
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,791
eat.

188
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,640
I should leave now.

189
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:20,239
Up a little.

190
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,437
OK.

191
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,799
- How do you feel?
- Good.

192
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:29,799
- Mochen is here.
- Mochen.

193
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,520
I've been bothering you a lot lately.

194
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,640
Thank you so much.

195
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,320
You are welcome, Mrs. Jiang.
I was just passing by.

196
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,336
How have you been recently?

197
00:09:36,507 --> 00:09:37,440
I'm good.

198
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,919
Mom, you don't have to say that
to my new brother-in-law.

199
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,320
Anyway, we will be family.

200
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,559
Thank you so much.

201
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,840
If it hadn't been for your help,

202
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:48,760
my mom wouldn't have
had surgery this early.

203
00:09:49,947 --> 00:09:50,853
Don't worry about it.

204
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,880
We are family.

205
00:09:52,035 --> 00:09:52,996
By the way, Shishi.

206
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,919
Don't just express your gratitude
by words.

207
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,119
You should treat him to a meal.

208
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:58,145
That's right.

209
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,119
- You should treat him to a meal.
- Yes.

210
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:02,679
That's right. Let's go then, I'm also hungry.

211
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,039
Don't bother, Mrs. Jiang.

212
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,960
It's OK, I just took on
a new design order.

213
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,520
I can afford some food.

214
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,476
How about steak?

215
00:10:12,656 --> 00:10:13,586
Let's go.

216
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:15,679
- OK.
- Then we are leaving.

217
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,039
Mom, take a good rest.

218
00:10:18,479 --> 00:10:19,320
Take care of yourself.

219
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:20,799
OK. Goodbye.

220
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:25,719
This new brother-in-law is really good.

221
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,799
Not bad.

222
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:27,840
- I like him.
- Peel your apple.

223
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,919
(Junye, I'm having dinner with friends
at Wanhao Restaurant.)

224
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,960
(I left a gift on the table.)

225
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,280
(Can you deliver it to me?)
