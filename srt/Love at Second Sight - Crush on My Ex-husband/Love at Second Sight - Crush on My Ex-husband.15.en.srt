00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,954
Hello.

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,599
Shishi, you're trending.

11
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,799
Aren't you always trending?

12
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:56,639
What's the big deal?

13
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:59,080
It's you! You are trending!

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,639
What exactly happened?

15
00:01:01,639 --> 00:01:02,759
Take a look now.

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,280
(The pregnant wife of the President of Jun Yue
has an affair with DK's President)

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,559
What is this?

18
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,618
Mochen.

19
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,279
What's going on, Jiang Shishi?

20
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,839
How did I suddenly become a father?

21
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,680
I'm sorry to involve you in this.

22
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,839
But the netizens are crazy.

23
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:36,763
Are you really pregnant?

24
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:38,737
It's Qi Junye's baby?

25
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:41,760
He wants to divorce you
even though you are pregnant?

26
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,160
He is even worse than me.

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,599
He doesn't know.

28
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:46,480
He doesn't know?

29
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:49,360
What's wrong with you?

30
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,239
I can't tell him for now.

31
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:54,639
Is there anything
you can't tell me directly?

32
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:56,802
Junye.

33
00:01:58,279 --> 00:01:59,599
Mr. Lin, what important thing

34
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,959
are you here for

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,959
at such a late hour?

36
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,857
You might catch a cold.

37
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:07,123
I was just passing by.

38
00:02:07,305 --> 00:02:09,705
It's OK, I have time
to listen to your explanation.

39
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,119
(How dare you
hide your pregnancy from me?)

40
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,240
(Jiang Shishi, you are unbelievable.)

41
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,559
(Do you think I would cheat on you?)

42
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,399
You don't believe me?

43
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,720
Jiang Shishi, how dare you
still stay in our house!

44
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,320
You brought shame on our Qi family!

45
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,346
Let go.

46
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,440
OK, I'll leave now.

47
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,639
I will never have any connection
with Qi Junye again.

48
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,736
I'll give you a ride.

49
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,240
- Shishi.
- Stop!

50
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:41,199
What did I do to deserve this?

51
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:42,759
What mistake

52
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,199
did our Qi family make?

53
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,559
- That is so unfortunate.
- Mom.

54
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,634
Drop the act.

55
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,320
Mrs. Qi, look at him.

56
00:02:57,839 --> 00:03:00,320
Director Jiang, are you really leaving?

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,320
Don't take
what they say online to heart.

58
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,679
We believe
you are not that kind of person.

59
00:03:08,017 --> 00:03:08,900
Yeah.

60
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,121
Thank you.

61
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,360
Even you are willing to believe me,

62
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:15,559
but he...

63
00:03:17,994 --> 00:03:18,893
Forget it.

64
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:25,025
- Mr. Qi.
- Mr. Qi.

65
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:26,199
Get back to work.

66
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:27,639
- Second Uncle.
- OK.

67
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,291
Shishi.

68
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,119
I know you are a good girl.

69
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,880
Come to me if you need anything
in the future.

70
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,039
Thank you, Second Uncle.

71
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,243
Boss.

72
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,039
Jiang Shishi has left.

73
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,799
She may have made some mistakes,

74
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,119
- but...
- She would never cheat on me.

75
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,839
You believe her?

76
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:22,839
Then why did you let her go?

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,399
I can't even protect myself now.

78
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,640
She won't be happy with me.

79
00:04:29,119 --> 00:04:30,480
I can't believe the board of directors.

80
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,239
How can they make you quit?

81
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,239
What should I do if you are gone?

82
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,920
Second Uncle will become the president.

83
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,320
You can work for him.

84
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,959
No, I will go wherever you go.

85
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:42,218
You should stay.

86
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,200
What's happening is not that simple.

87
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:46,559
Jiang Shishi and I are both their targets,

88
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,480
(Dismissal Notice)
someone must be behind this mischief.

89
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:51,440
We need to find out the truth.

90
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:53,839
Understood, Boss.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,200
I will become

92
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,600
a qualified spy.

93
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,280
(Jun Yue Group)

94
00:05:20,239 --> 00:05:22,880
I didn't expect this to happen,
Jiang Shishi.

95
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,239
It's all thanks to you.

96
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:30,480
You deserve this.

97
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,679
You lost this time.

98
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:37,959
Just keep it, I don't want it anyway.

99
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,239
Those guys on the board of directors

100
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:47,640
are just venting their anger.

101
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:50,720
After all, the listing failed.

102
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,799
Why don't you rest for a while?

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,720
I will take care of Jun Yue for you,

104
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,000
and wait for your return.

105
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,083
Second Uncle,

106
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,320
Mo will talk to you
on the subsequent matters.

107
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:03,239
I just can't rest assured
about the jewelry section.

108
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:05,959
- Maybe...
- You are too tired, Junye.

109
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,239
Just have a good rest.

110
00:06:09,187 --> 00:06:10,031
OK.

111
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,239
Thank you, Second Uncle.

112
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,799
Hello, I'm Jiang Shishi.

113
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:25,799
I would like to ask

114
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:27,079
if you are still hiring designers.

115
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,359
(Sorry, Shishi.)

116
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,839
(I can't protect you now.)

117
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,239
(We have to separate for a while.)

118
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,239
(I hope you won't hate me too much.)

119
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:54,959
- Hello?
- Shishi, Mom is in the hospital!

120
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,266
What happened?

121
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,720
The doctor said it's liver cancer.

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,898
What?

123
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:00,600
Come here now, Shishi.
