=Episode 10=

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,840
I'm just reminding you.

10
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:42,400
Although we are divorced,

11
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:43,599
cheating during

12
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:46,080
the cooling-off period is still cheating.

13
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,880
Who cheated?

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,200
I'm just kindly reminding you.

15
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:52,240
That dandy who comes every day

16
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:54,639
is unreliable.

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,919
Lin Mochen, the President of DK.

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,240
You can search him online.

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,119
His scandals are everywhere.

20
00:01:03,919 --> 00:01:05,760
Can he be worse than you,
President Qi?

21
00:01:13,279 --> 00:01:14,319
This photo!

22
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,120
I look so ugly in it!

23
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,279
Why are you so calm?

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,839
I thought you would

25
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:25,000
cry and beg me, saying,

26
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:26,239
"I'm not that kind of person.

27
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,080
It's all my fault.

28
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,319
I really didn't do it!"

29
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:31,000
What is there to explain?

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,800
In the photo,
we look intimate, that's true.

31
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,599
But it's just the result
of a special shooting angle.

32
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,919
I did not cheat.

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,000
Why do you look so disappointed?

34
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,319
You want me to cheat?

35
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,080
Don't you think

36
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,400
catching the cheater and mistress
on the spot

37
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,760
is dramatic and cool?

38
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:51,760
Too bad I can't experience it.

39
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,480
You must have got these photos

40
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,800
a long time ago.

41
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,480
Why didn't you ask me?

42
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:59,400
You trust me so much?

43
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,199
In this world,

44
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:03,199
nobody can be completely trusted.

45
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,559
I just have to verify it carefully

46
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,639
when there is some suspicion.

47
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,399
Suspicion?

48
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,720
Are you jealous?

49
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,039
Jealous of Chu Yu? Come on.

50
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,857
OK.

51
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,119
I'll solve this problem immediately.

52
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:26,440
How are you going to solve it?

53
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Just tell me.

54
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,763
Junye.

55
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,880
Junye.

56
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm returning the bottle opener.

57
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:40,320
Good, I want to talk to you too.

58
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,399
What's the matter?

59
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
Did you ask someone to take this?

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,080
How is that possible?

61
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,600
I didn't.

62
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:50,720
Could it be Jiang Shishi?

63
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,440
It must be her.

64
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,039
She wants to collect evidence,

65
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,759
and accuse you of cheating

66
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,600
before you are divorced

67
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,679
to get more benefits.

68
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:00,639
That makes a lot of sense.

69
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,839
But how did you know
about our divorce?

70
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,679
Madam Qi told me.

71
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:08,279
But I will keep it confidential.

72
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,279
Technically,

73
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:11,199
I haven't divorced Jiang Shishi yet,

74
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,679
and I'm not planning to do that.

75
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,600
But don't you
dislike Jiang Shishi very much?

76
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:18,199
And you have never taken her
to any public event.

77
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,331
You two...

78
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:30,199
I have never disliked Jiang Shishi.

79
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:32,600
Please show some respect
to my wife in the future.

80
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,399
Don't come to me again.

81
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,639
We are usually busy in the evening.

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You should go now.

83
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:43,039
Junye!

84
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,720
Put me down! What are you doing?

85
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,000
What are you doing?

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,906
Solved.

87
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,279
What can they do to me?

88
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,559
Is this your way of solving problems?

89
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:52,960
You...

90
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:54,209
It's very efficient.

91
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,320
(Jiang Shishi, calm down.)

92
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,479
(Don't fall for it again.)

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,119
(He doesn't love you.)

94
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,839
(He just needs a Mrs. Qi.)

95
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:16,399
(He doesn't love you.)

96
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,239
(I always get whatever I want.)

97
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,920
(You are not gonna divorce her?)

98
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,889
(It's not up to you!)

99
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,200
President Chu's daughter

100
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,040
has such

101
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,279
a good temperament.

102
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:32,920
You are flattering me.

103
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:34,279
My temperament

104
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,600
is nothing compared with yours.

105
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,480
Chu Yu, you are so modest.

106
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,720
It's a pity that Junye got married early.

107
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,399
He and Miss Chu
would have been a perfect match.

108
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,720
What's there to regret?

109
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,359
I have always taken Yu as my own daughter.

110
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,760
What's more,

111
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,600
marriage is a complicated thing.

112
00:04:53,603 --> 00:04:54,480
Then Miss Chu,

113
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,359
we might have more chances

114
00:04:55,359 --> 00:04:57,480
to have afternoon tea together
in the future.

115
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,040
I will definitely come often.

116
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,114
Good.

117
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,119
Come to Mom.

118
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:03,519
- Mom.
- Have some water.

119
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,839
What a cute little baby.

120
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,891
Come on.

121
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,200
So cute.

122
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,000
How old are you? Let me see.

123
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,163
I'm four.

124
00:05:11,585 --> 00:05:12,440
I'm sorry.

125
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,440
Look at you!

126
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,399
I'm really sorry.

127
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,920
- It's OK, it's OK.
- Apologize to Miss Chu.

128
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,160
It's OK, it's OK.

129
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,239
It doesn't matter. Come, Yu,

130
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:19,679
- I'll get you some clothes.
- Sorry.

131
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,558
OK.

132
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:21,920
Mom, I'm sorry.

133
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,760
It's OK, he's just a kid.

134
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,040
This is Junye's room.

135
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,160
This is the cloakroom.

136
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,959
My clothes don't fit you.

137
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:34,079
See if you can find something here.

138
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,839
Take your time. There's no hurry.

139
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,119
Is this appropriate, Madam Qi?

140
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,480
Of course it is.

141
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,279
Junye said

142
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:44,079
he would be back late.

143
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,119
However,

144
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,279
I will go out with the ladies.

145
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:49,200
So please help me

146
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,320
keep Junye company.

147
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,315
OK.

148
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,679
Then I'm going back down.

149
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:55,994
OK, Madam Qi.

150
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,679
Shishi, goodbye.

151
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:26,679
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

152
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,266
- Come on.
- Let's go.

153
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:29,600
I can't drive you home today.

154
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,720
I have to go to my mom's place.

155
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,760
Really?

156
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,959
Then I'll go with you.

157
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,000
You are willing to be Mrs. Qi again?

158
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,459
Forget it. Goodbye.

159
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:39,502
Come on.

160
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,440
Why are you going back?

161
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:42,519
You miss my mom?

162
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,720
How is that possible?

163
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:46,720
I might have left my necklace there.

164
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,799
I want to get it back.

165
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,274
Let's go then.

166
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,160
Are you hungry?

167
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,920
You go upstairs, I'll go
check if the meal is ready.

168
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:43,160
You are wearing so little
in my husband's room.

169
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,760
Jiang Shishi? Why are you here?

170
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:48,000
Miss Chu's thighs are really beautiful.

171
00:07:48,153 --> 00:07:49,039
You...

172
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,000
Delete it!

173
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,359
I finally got something against you,

174
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:53,720
how can I just delete it?

175
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,760
How can I give it to you?

176
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,613
Delete it.

177
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,040
- Delete it!
- What are you doing?

178
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,985
Delete it!

179
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:01,600
Jiang Shishi!

180
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,119
I have uploaded it to the cloud drive.

181
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,839
You'd better not offend me ever again,

182
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,760
or it might leak out

183
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,799
to the whole internet.

184
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,519
Jiang Shishi, you are shameless!

185
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,959
Nobody is as shameless as you.

186
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,959
Junye!

187
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:34,479
Junye!

188
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,400
You are such a lucky dog.

189
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,719
What are you doing here?

190
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:38,765
I...

191
00:08:38,766 --> 00:08:39,719
Madam Qi let me...

192
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,119
Get out of my room

193
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
immediately.

194
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:54,752
What do you want?

195
00:08:54,753 --> 00:08:55,632
I want to explain.

196
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:57,125
I...

197
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,200
I don't know why

198
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,520
she was in my room.

199
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,359
I think I know.

200
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,239
It must be your mother
who likes Miss Chu

201
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:08,760
and wants her to be your wife,

202
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,919
so she asked you to come back

203
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,919
and created a romantic night for you.

204
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,880
But I just want

205
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,080
you to be my wife.

206
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,520
But I have already
stopped being Mrs. Qi.

207
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,320
I never was!
