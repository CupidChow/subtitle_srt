(That's the third day
after my father's death.)

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,279
You just want to say
what happened to my father-in-law

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,884
was because of me, right?

16
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:00,080
(Impossible.)

17
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,520
(How could Junye deceive me?)

18
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,080
(He wouldn't lie to me.)

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,360
Are you going for
a prenatal check-up today?

20
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,440
I'm shooting in a cafe.

21
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:14,519
Come over when you're done.

22
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:16,559
Liu Shi.

23
00:01:19,385 --> 00:01:20,239
Shishi.

24
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,720
What's wrong with you?

25
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,239
- Shishi.
- What did you say?

26
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,879
Qi Junye murdered Mr. Jiang

27
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:34,199
for the sake of the bid?

28
00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:39,680
I don't know.

29
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,279
But I think the time

30
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,440
is too coincidental.

31
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,199
Did you ask Qi Junye about it?

32
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,239
He said it was just an accident.

33
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,040
Although I am a man,

34
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,519
I have to tell you something.

35
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,559
Men are all liars,

36
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,680
not to mention Qi Junye.

37
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,279
You can't believe his words at all.

38
00:01:57,919 --> 00:02:00,120
Don't rush to conclusions yet.

39
00:02:00,224 --> 00:02:01,080
Let's do some investigation.

40
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,300
Can you get in touch with some people who
knew the inside story of that accident?

41
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,919
Liu Shi, cut it out.

42
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:08,520
Shishi, don't be too sad.

43
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,679
You are pregnant.

44
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,432
Look!

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,800
My godson is very healthy.

46
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,759
Look at its graceful figure.

47
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,440
It's obviously my goddaughter.

48
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,600
- Godson!
- Goddaughter!

49
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,919
- Godson!
- Goddaughter!

50
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,600
OK, OK.

51
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:28,960
Keep these things for me for now.

52
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,279
I don't want Qi Junye to know about it.

53
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,027
Well,

54
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,559
do you need me to take you home?

55
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,839
I want to take a walk.

56
00:02:40,279 --> 00:02:41,154
All right.

57
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,119
Be careful and go home early.

58
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,976
Goodbye.

59
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:48,148
Goodbye.

60
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:00,919
(Jiang Shishi is really pregnant.)

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,440
(If the Qi family knows about it,)

62
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,279
(they won't let them get divorced.)

63
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,759
(I must)

64
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:10,360
(get rid of this baby.)

65
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:15,033
Are you OK?

66
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,839
I was so scared just now.

67
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:21,520
I'm fine, all right?

68
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,119
Why are you doing this?

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,300
Didn't you say
you were going to the hospital?

70
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,520
What are you doing here?

71
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,520
Liu Shi is filming nearby.

72
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,800
Let's go home then.

73
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,680
(A major fire broke out in the Jiang Group)
(President Jiang died in the fire)

74
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,681
Director Jiang,

75
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,119
it's time to get off work.

76
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,720
I have to work overtime.

77
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,320
Overtime?

78
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,520
I thought you wouldn't do
those meaningless stuff.

79
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,279
This is not meaningless.

80
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,720
I am going to share weal and woe with
colleagues in the Design Department.

81
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,919
If you want to leave early, just go.

82
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,639
You are right, Director Jiang.

83
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,359
Director Jiang is so brave.

84
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,040
She even made
President Qi speechless.

85
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,079
Shishi is great.

86
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,760
Are you done?

87
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,239
Are you hungry?

88
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,279
I prepared food for you.

89
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,519
Should we eat here

90
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,720
or at home?

91
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:41,519
You have been waiting for me?

92
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,119
Of course I have.

93
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:45,920
You could have left first.

94
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,920
Today you almost had a car accident,

95
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,160
how can I let you go alone?

96
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:53,559
Should we eat here or at home?

97
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,519
(Can you stop being so nice to me?)

98
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,239
(I'm afraid I wouldn't live without you)

99
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,160
(when I find out the truth.)

100
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,320
Write this down.

101
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,200
And this, make it clear.

102
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,839
Director Jiang,
the production department said

103
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,119
our supplier of yellow diamond

104
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:30,359
suddenly broke the contract.

105
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,040
The other large raw material suppliers

106
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,920
don't have what we want.

107
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,359
The production has stopped now.

108
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:35,268
How could this happen?

109
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:36,709
Are yellow diamonds
really in high demand?

110
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:39,600
It seems that someone is playing tricks.

111
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,920
But how did they know in advance

112
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,119
that we were using yellow diamonds?

113
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:44,440
Is there a mole?

114
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,700
Very likely.

115
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,279
So what should we do?

116
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,279
Finding the mole is not the top priority.

117
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,279
We must find the raw materials first.

118
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,168
That's right.

119
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:53,839
The release date
has been officially announced.

120
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,320
It will be terrible if the product

121
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,440
can't be launched on time.

122
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,440
Can we use
champagne diamonds instead?

123
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:01,200
They are not even close.

124
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:05,920
Let's take a look
at the raw material market first,

125
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,640
and see if we can
find more yellow diamonds.

126
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,600
If it really doesn't work,

127
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,359
we'll think of another solution,

128
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:12,640
and see if we can find
alternative materials.

129
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,320
OK, let's go.

130
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,040
I don't know why

131
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,839
the media got the news so early.

132
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,239
It seems that

133
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,279
it's a deliberate attack on Jun Yue.

134
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,760
Boss, the board of directors
is anxious.

135
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:32,760
They said it's your responsibility.

136
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,279
They are right.

137
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:37,760
Let's go and solve
the production problems first.

138
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,079
Are you looking to purchase
a batch of yellow diamonds from me

139
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:45,119
to help Jun Yue?

140
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,359
Do you know that
DK and Jun Yue are competitors?

141
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,818
No wonder

142
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,279
you asked me out for a meal suddenly.

143
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,880
It turns out to be a trap.

144
00:06:57,119 --> 00:06:59,160
I really don't know what to do now.

145
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,119
I have visited

146
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,920
every raw material market around here,

147
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:05,079
but it's still not enough.

148
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,399
Look how anxious I am.

149
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,720
OK, I'll kindly help you.

150
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:14,910
Really?

151
00:07:15,145 --> 00:07:16,466
I will fix your necklace.

152
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,451
I promise!

153
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:22,279
As long as you're happy.

154
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,600
Thank you.

(The pregnant wife of the President of Jun Yue
has an affair with DK's President)

157
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:31,160
This news

158
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,480
might affect our listing.

159
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,040
- Yeah, that's right.
- Do you know about this matter?

160
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,519
Why would we enter
the jewelry industry?

161
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,760
Now it's all messed up.

162
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:39,160
Young people are always aiming too high.

163
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,988
We shouldn't have
entrusted Jun Yue to you.

164
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:41,862
- Yes.
- That's right.

165
00:07:41,863 --> 00:07:42,776
Do you agree?

166
00:07:42,777 --> 00:07:44,679
If you took over,
there wouldn't be so many troubles.

167
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,962
- Yeah.
- I agree.

168
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,320
I just hope to retire early,

169
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:50,200
how could I have the energy
to run a company?

170
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,600
Don't be anxious, guys.

171
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,200
We are all family.

172
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,320
Let's see what Junye will say.

173
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,600
OK, OK, go on.

174
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,559
There is a detailed explanation

175
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:00,359
of the response plan in front of you.

176

The Production Department
will work overtime to produce.

178
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,600
We won't miss the release date.

179
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,920
This way, the negative impact on Jun Yue

180
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,200
can be lowered to the minimum.

181
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,720
The cost has increased so much,

182
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,440
everyone will lose money.

183
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:17,000
The priority now

184
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,160
is to restore the brand image of Jun Yue.

185
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,040
In terms of profitability,

186
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,000
it can only temporarily compromise.

187
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,200
- We are not making money?
- What? Compromise?

188
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:26,399
Why bother doing business
if we are not making money?

189
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,880
We should just
cut off the jewelry section now

190
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
to stop loss in time.

191
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:32,039
Cousin, you have to think of a solution.

192
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,239
- Yeah.
- You have to think of something.

193
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:34,640
We should stop loss now.

194
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,880
- That's right.
- Where is Jiang Shishi?

195
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,080
Director Jiang took a leave today.

196
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,840
- I think she's at home.
- Cousin, say something.

197
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,000
Please say something!

198
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,159
- He left.
- He left.

199
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,042
Don't leave.

200
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,919
Young people, you know,

201
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,000
are always impatient.

202
00:08:47,187 --> 00:08:48,062
Sit down, sit down.
