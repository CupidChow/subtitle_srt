9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,880
Mom, how do you feel?

10
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,360
Are you uncomfortable?

11
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:44,799
I feel uncomfortable all over.

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,720
If you're angry, just let it out.

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,040
Your anger has damaged your liver.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,200
Look at you.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,479
You are divorced and lost your job,

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,880
and now you are pregnant.

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,520
What will you do in the future?

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,759
There will always be a way.

19
00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:04,170
Careful.

20
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:09,720
We need to pay the bill.

21
00:01:18,199 --> 00:01:19,480
I don't have enough money here.

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,519
How much do you have?

23
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,199
I have nothing.

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,239
What about the card
I gave you last time?

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,680
I've used up that little money long ago.

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,000
You...

27
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,995
Mom also spent some.

28
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,879
Hey, didn't Dad leave you

29
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:35,599
an antique necklace?

30
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,080
Just pawn it.

31
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,760
Hurry up and go get it.

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,639
Do you want me to get it for you?

33
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,199
But...

34
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,959
What did I do to deserve this?

35
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:51,000
I don't even have money for my disease.

36
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,279
(Should I explain)

37
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:04,639
(about the affair first?)

38
00:02:06,328 --> 00:02:07,188
(Wait a minute.)

39
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,759
(Why should I explain?)

40
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,639
(It's his problem
that he doesn't trust me.)

41
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:15,479
(Forget it.)

42
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,000
(I'll just get it and leave.)

43
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,720
You are sick?

44
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:23,839
I'm fine, why are you here?

45
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:26,880
Oh, I may have left my necklace here.

46
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,440
I think it's in the drawer
of the bedside table.

47
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,240
If it's inconvenient...

48
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,440
It's not. Come in.

49
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,119
I'll go put on some clothes.

50
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:50,240
I happen to be free today.

51
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,679
Let's go get our divorce certificates.

52
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,800
(Nanxun District
Government Service Center)

53
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,839
Our relationship
has officially ended now.

54
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,440
That's right.

55
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:19,279
Oh, the necklace.

56
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,600
(Divorce Certificate)

57
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,759
And this.

58
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,520
It's for you.

59
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,080
It's your part of the property.

60
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,680
(Real Estate Ownership Certificate)

61
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:44,080
When we signed
the divorce agreement,

62
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,279
I have said that

63
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:46,600
I won't take anything

64
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:48,000
that belongs to your Qi family.

65
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,639
You are still saying that.

66
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,119
We are divorced.

67
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,240
Of course we should state it clearly.

68
00:03:58,119 --> 00:03:59,119
Do you need a lift?

69
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,514
(Sorry, Shishi.)

70
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:18,519
(The separation is just temporary.)

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,079
(I will find out the truth,)

72
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,839
(and all of this will pass.)

73
00:04:58,679 --> 00:04:59,839
You have

74
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,200
divorced Qi Junye?

75
00:05:16,937 --> 00:05:17,780
Get in.

76
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,840
(Superstar)

77
00:05:44,588 --> 00:05:45,440
Hello?

78
00:05:45,441 --> 00:05:46,302
What's wrong with you?

79
00:05:46,307 --> 00:05:47,880
You didn't tell me
about such a big thing?

80
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,000
Do you still see me as your friend?

81
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
We wouldn't even know it

82
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,799
if your brother hadn't called me.

83
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:52,720
Come to the hospital now!

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,119
I got it.

85
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:02,202
To the hospital?

86
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,279
Boss, why did you
have to divorce her?

87
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,679
Only in this way

88
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,279
can Shishi completely
get separated from me.

89
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,160
Those people

90
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,679
who are aiming at me

91
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,839
won't do anything to her now.

92
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:37,200
You are protecting your beloved wife
through divorce.

93
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,279
You are making it hard for yourself.

94
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,679
Boss, another group of people
have left the company.

95
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:47,399
Some project authorities
have also changed.

96
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,959
Investigate this project for me.

97
00:07:00,343 --> 00:07:01,195
OK.

98
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:14,440
Excuse me, which bed is Ms. Jiang in?

99
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:16,720
Liu Shi. Yuesheng.

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,880
Shishi.

101
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,200
Shishi, why are you crying?

102
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,440
Did you bully her?

103
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,720
It has nothing to do with me.

104
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:25,320
It has nothing to do with him.

105
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,679
Is it because of the medical bills?

106
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,239
Don't worry, Liu Shi and I are here.

107
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:33,000
Shishi, don't worry about the money.

108
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,320
I know a liver cancer specialist.

109
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
I'll call him now.

110
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,000
It's so nice to have you all.

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,881
Don't worry.

112
00:07:39,882 --> 00:07:41,799
Don't worry, we're here for you.

113
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:51,279
What are you doing here?

114
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,119
Go contact that liver cancer specialist.

115
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,440
It's done.

116
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,119
I made the arrangement

117
00:07:58,119 --> 00:07:59,519
when you were crying like girls.

118
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,760
Shishi, I have to go.

119
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,839
They are waiting for me at the site.

120
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm leaving, bye.

121
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,119
Take care of her.

122
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:07,880
- Goodbye.
- Shishi.

123
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,279
Call me anytime if you need anything.

124
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,640
Just go, bye.

125
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,570
Goodbye.

126
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:12,920
Let's go in.

127
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,399
You left this in my car.

128
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,840
(Divorce Certificate)

129
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:20,857
Thank you.

130
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:21,930
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,480
Actually, it was me

132
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,440
who caused the shortage of materials
for Jun Yue's new products.

133
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,160
I somehow guessed it.

134
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,440
After all, in such a short time,

135
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,520
only your group

136
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,479
can hoard so many
precious gemstone materials.

137
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:39,840
But I'm curious about something.

138
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,520
How did you know
I was using yellow diamonds?

139
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,880
Who is the mole in Jun Yue Group?

140
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,840
That is a trade secret.

141
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:48,922
OK.

142
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,679
Anyway, you still helped us in the end.

143
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:55,559
I like you. What can I do?

144
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,599
There is no big problem.

145
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:01,960
As long as there's a right liver source,

146
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,000
you can have the surgery immediately.

147
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:05,000
Doctor,

148
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:07,400
is the success rate of matching

149
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,280
between family members higher?

150
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:10,599
That is right.

151
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,880
Thank you, Doctor.

152
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,097
Don't worry.

153
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,098
Thank you.

154
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,520
I have to thank you
for saving my life.

155
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,520
You are welcome, Ms. Jiang.

156
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,440
By the way,

157
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,760
Shishi has been pregnant

158
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,960
with your baby.

159
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,000
When will you get married?

160
00:09:28,239 --> 00:09:29,640
If you don't do it now,

161
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,200
it will be harder for Shishi
to fit in a wedding dress.

162
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,760
Mom, please don't talk nonsense.

163
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:34,080
Sorry.

164
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,440
- Don't listen to her nonsense.
- It's OK. Ms. Jiang,

165
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,880
I'll visit you later again.

166
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:38,724
Have a good rest.

167
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,320
He should take responsibility for this.

168
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,280
Are you really going to
raise this child on your own?

169
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,280
Don't worry about the baby.

170
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,650
Moreover,

171
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,280
it's not the time
to worry about this now.

172
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,320
Look at you.

173
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,919
Come with me for a matching test.

174
00:09:59,119 --> 00:09:59,970
Stop.

175
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,080
You can't go.

176
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:04,320
Mom, at such a moment,

177
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,520
you are still worried about your son?

178
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,200
I mean you are not allowed to go.

179
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,080
Why?

180
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,080
Because you are pregnant.

181
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,280
Then I can do the check first,

182
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:14,159
and have the transplant surgery

183
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:15,799
after I give birth to the baby.

184
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,520
You just can't go.

185
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:23,119
Mom, are you
hiding something from me?

186
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:26,919
Since you're not telling me,

187
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,880
we are going for the matching test.

188
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,320
You are not my biological child.
