00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:45,279
Have some water.

10
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,000
Are you OK?

11
00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:57,119
Did I say something disgusting?

12
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,479
Do you want to take a rest?

13
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:11,639
Take some rest here.

14
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,239
You can leave now.

15
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,625
Leave?

16
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,360
I'm not leaving,
I'll take care of you here.

17
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,639
I don't need you to take care of me.

18
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:38,040
It's already late.

19
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,360
Give me a little space.

20
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,080
I am too tired to drive now.

21
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:43,879
Sleep on the couch then.

22
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:44,959
This is a double bed.

23
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,680
I want to sleep alone.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,919
Fine, I'll sleep on the couch.

25
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,440
Call me if you need anything.

26
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,319
That's more like it.

27
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,080
Jiang Shishi.

28
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,800
Do you want to continue being Mrs. Qi?

29
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,240
I need you.

30
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:33,839
Nobody would be
a better Mrs. Qi than you.

31
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,160
(Jiang Shishi, wake up!)

32
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:39,839
(Don't be tempted by his fine body!)

33
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,919
(Once a scumbag,)

34
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:43,199
(always a scumbag.)

35
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,639
(He doesn't love you at all.)

36
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,786
(Jiang Shishi,)

37
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:03,160
(I swear you will become)

38
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,839
(my wife again.)

39
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,080
My baby, are you hungry?

40
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,839
Mom will find some food for you.

41
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:42,639
Good morning. Did you sleep well?

42
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:47,440
This is definitely a first!

43
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,039
The great President Qi

44
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,520
actually made breakfast for me.

45
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:53,240
If you become Mrs. Qi again,

46
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,479
I can do this every day.

47
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,279
No, thanks.

48
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,880
You can still eat it.

49
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,240
I made a Western-style breakfast.

50
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,279
Ms. Jiang, please try it.

51
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:07,440
(It seems that he's really trying hard
to win me back.)

52
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:08,880
I can really eat it?

53
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,839
It's not poisonous.

54
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,519
Not bad.

55
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,519
It's really not poisonous!

56
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,079
Every time I see you, I want to...

57
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,399
Jiang Shishi.

58
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,079
Don't tell me you are pregnant.

59
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,239
I'm not pregnant with your baby anyway.

60
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,040
Why do you care?

61
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,480
Since you are already divorced,

62
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,239
just get away from Junye.

63
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:09,239
You think you can get back to his side

64
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:11,000
because you are pregnant?

65
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,239
How do you know about the divorce?

66
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,679
Junye told me of course.

67
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:19,279
Qi Junye is not stupid enough

68
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,920
to tell you about that.

69
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:23,880
It must be that Ms. Song

70
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,480
who's yearning for a grandson.

71
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,000
You...

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,720
You reminded me.

73
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,679
Maybe

74
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,640
I can really get back to him

75
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,399
if I'm pregnant.

76
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,279
- You...
- But you can rest assured.

77
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,720
I am not pregnant now.

78
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,359
I just drank too much last night.

79
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:41,000
That's why I vomited.

80
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,799
Once I get pregnant in the future,

81
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:43,959
I'll tell you the good news

82
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,880
as soon as possible.

83
00:05:57,679 --> 00:06:00,519
The boss's woman is really good.

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,799
She actually said I'm disgusting!

85
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,048
Boss.

86
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,200
I have got it.

87
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:18,440
Jiang Shishi didn't vomit

88
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,839
because you were disgusting.

89
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:22,399
She just drank too much last night.

90
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:23,376
She drank too much?

91
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,399
Hey, why did you bring me here?

92
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,679
Spring has passed,

93
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:39,320
can you stop being so horny?

94
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,799
Why did you bring me here then?

95
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:44,799
I'll show you something.

96
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:55,839
There's gonna be a good show.

97
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,720
President Qi.

98
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,359
- President Qi.
- President Qi.

99
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:07,258
Let's start.

100
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,079
I'll do it first.

101
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,600
As the first series design

102
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,880
of Jun Yue in the jewelry industry,

103
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:21,079
my core design concept is

104
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,720
Original.

105
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,239
That's all I have to say.

106
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,200
Thank you.

107
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,900
By the way,

108
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,880
in the end,

109
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,000
there is another video
I want to share with everyone.

110
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,200
I just wanted to try out my new camera,

111
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,559
but unexpectedly,

112
00:07:58,559 --> 00:08:00,359
it recorded something interesting.

113
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,640
(Product Date)

114
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,600
That's...

115
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:05,399
It's just a small product launch event,

116
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,799
now you'll have nothing

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,799
to show everybody.

118
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,120
(Copying)

119
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,058
That's...

120
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,040
Isn't that Director Chu?

121
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,359
- How could she do this?
- I know!

122
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,577
This...

123
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:21,839
You don't have to apologize so formally.

124
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,519
That's not me!

125
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,640
Stop it! That is not me!

126
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
Junye.

127
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,640
Junye, this is not true.

128
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,919
I was also there that day.

129
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,599
I only believe what I see
with my own eyes.

130
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,969
Chu Yu,

131
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,200
you are fired.

132
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,320
But I did all that for you.

133
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,840
- Junye, Junye.
- You did that just for yourself.

134
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,520
Don't be cocky.

135
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,799
You lost again.

136
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,840
Don't forget our bet.

137
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,400
Don't show up in front of me again.

138
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,440
This is not over!

139
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,919
You did a great job.

140
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:11,880
I think

141
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,679
only being Mrs. Qi

142
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,479
is a great waste of your talent.

143
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,440
Since Chu Yu is fired,

144
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,939
Jiang Shishi will be the acting director
of the Design Department.

145
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,080
Both of the projects are good.

146
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:25,479
Do them at the same time.
