Luckily, I didn't lose it.

my father left me.

Lin Mochen.

13
00:01:01,427 --> 00:01:02,310
What's wrong with you?

14
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,319
Do you have any candy?

15
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,795
Yes.

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,480
What's wrong?

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,399
You actually almost fainted

18
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,600
because of low blood sugar.

19
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:22,679
Sorry.

20
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,200
What are you looking for?

21
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:35,999
Are you looking for this?

22
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:39,920
What is this?

23
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,319
Why is it broken?

24
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,359
It was not me who broke it.

25
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:51,079
I know.

26
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,200
This necklace was broken
a long time ago.

27
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,466
It is

28
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,759
the only thing my mother left me.

29
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,439
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,639
I understand your feeling.

31
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,079
My dad is also gone.

32
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,279
This necklace

33
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,680
was left to me by him.

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
As long as I wear it,

35
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,479
I feel that my dad is still by my side.

36
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:28,199
Maybe this is the reason

37
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:30,040
why I like jewelry design.

38
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,639
Because it's not just a decoration,

39
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,999
but also an emotion carrier.

40
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,279
You're right.

41
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,999
I will keep it forever.

42
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,600
It's just that I went to many masters,

43
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,880
but none of them could fix it.

44
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,120
As the president
of such a big jewelry group,

45
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:49,400
you can't get it fixed?

46
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,600
Yeah.

47
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:54,800
Let me take a look.

48
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,680
You can fix it?

49
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:09,079
I think I can give it a try.

50
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,680
But it'll take some time.

51
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,999
I'll do my best.

52
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,320
Really?

53
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,359
Thank you.

54
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,400
You are welcome.

55
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:25,439
Morning, President Qi.

Morning.

59
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,839
You haven't had breakfast yet, right?

60
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,040
I have.

61
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,999
Please take it away, President Qi.

62
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,079
Now that I have given it to you,

63
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,040
I will never take it back.

65
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:09,199
What's the matter, Boss?

66
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,599
Where did you get it from?

67
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,199
Jiang Shishi gave it to me.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,961
Is it delicious?

69
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:25,079
To tell the truth,

70
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:25,970
not really.

71
00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:27,009
Not...

72
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,602
...really?

73
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:38,660
Come here.

74
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,280
Listen to me,

75
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:05,520
the key to your problem
lies with Mrs. Qi.

76
00:05:05,641 --> 00:05:06,509
Mrs. Qi?

77
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,440
Except for your two families,
the whole world...

78
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,039
Of course, except for me.

79
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,879
No one knows that
Mrs. Qi is Jiang Shishi.

80
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,000
You have never
announced your relationship.

81
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,319
That's why she said that

82
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,800
she's not Mrs. Qi.

83
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,319
Is the Group's charity banquet
tomorrow night?

84
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,720
This is the most appropriate time
for an official announcement!

85
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:29,319
You're improving!

86
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,225
Get up.

87
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:37,400
Boss, I'm going out

88
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,720

has a charity gala tonight.

92

Director Jiang,
please make sure to attend.

93
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,879
Charity gala?

94
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:52,800
Do I have to be there?

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Basically all the management
of the company will be there.

Maybe you don't,

99
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,199
but President Qi does.

100
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:03,120
- At that time...
- Stop it.

101
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,599
When it comes to charity,

102
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,120
one's sincerity values the most.

103
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,319
It doesn't matter if I
have something valuable or not.

104
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,319
Maybe I will purchase
my own stuff back.

105
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,599
Don't worry.

106
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,599
Just be ready for it.

107
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:14,639
Somebody will purchase your stuff.

108
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,800
Maybe the price will be high.

109
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,000
I have to go now.
