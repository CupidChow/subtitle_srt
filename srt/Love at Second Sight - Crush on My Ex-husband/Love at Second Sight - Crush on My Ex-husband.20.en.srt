00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:39,138
Oh, Shishi.

10
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:41,080
Are you going to Jun Yue later?

11
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:42,720
I need to talk to President Qi

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,720
about cooperation.

13
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,084
OK.

14
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:47,639
I don't want you to drive.

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,000
The driver will take you there.

16
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:50,400
It's OK.

17
00:00:50,419 --> 00:00:51,278
Dad.

18
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:52,680
Zhang took a day off today.

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,000
Maybe I can be her driver.

20
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,840
No need. I can drive myself.

21
00:00:57,919 --> 00:00:58,799
Shishi,

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,720
are you still mad

23
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,959
because of what I said just now?

24
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,440
I have realized my mistake.

25
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,800
I will get along well with you.

26
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,673
Shishi,

27
00:01:06,919 --> 00:01:08,239
just let Yu

28
00:01:08,279 --> 00:01:09,680
drive you there.

29
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,720
Yu, be careful on the road.

30
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:13,239
Send your sister

31
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,879
to the company safely.

32
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:16,279
Don't worry, Dad.

33
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,279
Why are you doing this?

34
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:23,279
We are sisters, right?

35
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,480
This is nothing.

36
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,400
Drop the act. Aren't you tired?

37
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:48,720
What are you doing, Chu Yu?

38
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:50,639
- Get out.
- What are you doing?

39
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,279
Chu Yu, calm down.

40
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:57,680
This won't do you any good.

41
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:58,786
I don't care.

42
00:01:59,279 --> 00:02:00,959
I have nothing left anyway.

43
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:02,120
Jiang Shishi.

44
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:04,400
Why did you come to this world?

45
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,440
Why on earth did you

46
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,680
appear in my world?

47
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,800
You are taking everything from me,

48
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,160
my family love, romantic love,

49
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,160
my career and fame.

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,279
You are taking the things

51
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,639
I schemed to get effortlessly?

52
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:17,479
I never tried to take anything from you.

53
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,520
You take everything for granted.

54
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,839
I hate it.

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,080
I like Qi Junye first.

56
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,919
If it hadn't been for you,

57
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,119
I would have become Mrs. Qi.

58
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,119
And the Chu family.

59
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,880
If it weren't for you...

60
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,919
If it weren't for you...

61
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,479
Why can't I even do this?

62
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,320
Fortunately, you couldn't do it.

63
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,320
Otherwise, you would pay with your life.

64
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:02,162
Jiang Shishi.

65
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,639
Why did you appear in my life?

66
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,759
I could live well without you.

67
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:10,520
What's wrong with you?

68
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,479
Why are you doing this all day?

69
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:14,919
Aren't you tired?

70
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:17,080
The world is so wonderful,

71
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,759
don't you want to enjoy it?

72
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,839
It's like you can only see me.

73
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,759
You really love me so much.

74
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,320
I just don't want to accept it.

75
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:26,679
Why are you so lucky?

76
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,279
After the Jiang family fell,

77
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:29,639
you got the Qi family,

78
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:32,279
and then you got the Chu family.

79
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:35,119
Why are you always so lucky?

80
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:36,440
Aren't you lucky?

81
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,720
You were adopted
by the Chu family as an orphan,

82
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:40,587
and became a fair lady.

83
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:41,520
I was doing good

84
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,080
before you came back!

85
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,279
Did Father give you up

86
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,880
after I came back?

87
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:51,080
You are already very lucky,

88
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,399
but you are wasting your good luck.

89
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:55,800
You... You...

90
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,639
If you want to continue
being jealous of me,

91
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,000
then go on.

92
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,800
I don't care.

93
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,399
OK, let's go.

94
00:04:18,553 --> 00:04:19,453
Let's go.

95
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,643
- Shishi.
- Second Uncle.

96
00:04:39,644 --> 00:04:40,558
Come on.

97
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:41,442
Please come in.

98
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:44,559
I shouldn't call you Shishi,

99
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,079
but President Chu.

100
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,959
Please just call me Shishi, Second Uncle.

101
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,160
I want to confirm with you

102
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,920
on some details of our cooperation.

103
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,160
In the past few days,

104
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,880
we've also made some plans.

105
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,959
- Take a look.
- OK.

106
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,720
Have you been in contact
with Junye recently?

107
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,600
I heard that he is not doing well.

108
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,959
The relationship between us

109
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,519
is completely over.

110
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:14,079
I have seen

111
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,480
what you have gone through.

112
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:16,959
Can you really let go?

113
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,200
You know what, Second Uncle?

114
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,760
My father's death

115
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,320
might be related to Qi Junye.

116
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:32,320
I hate him now.

117
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,239
Besides, I am now

118
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:35,679
the President of the Chu Group.

119
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,880
I can get any kind of man I want.

120
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,720
He's not so special.

121
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:42,559
I don't really need him so much.

122
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:46,480
Good to hear that.

123
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,674
Second Uncle,

124
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,760
I have no problem with the contract,

125
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,519
but I need to have it reviewed.

126
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,239
I will contact you once it's done.

127
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:55,480
- OK, no problem.
- OK.

128
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,320
Goodbye then.

129
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,359
Alright, I'll see you out.

130
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,760
You've lost weight.

131
00:06:01,049 --> 00:06:01,916
Not at all.

132
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,160
Bye, Second Uncle.

133
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,507
Bye.

134
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,559
Shishi, I have something to tell you!

135
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:26,839
Qi Junye, are you crazy?

136
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,480
I want to talk to you!

137
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,839
There's nothing to talk about
between us.

138
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,399
Will we meet again, Shishi?

139
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,959
Shishi, will we meet again?

140
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:39,232
Shishi!

141
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:43,399
You deserve this, Qi Junye.

142
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,000
(Engineering Construction Contract)

143
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,519
These data are simply not enough.

144
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,720
But now I am President Chu,

145
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,799
I can check Jun Yue's data.

146
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,079
I don't want you to take risks.

147
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:18,160
It's OK. As long as Qi Shuli believes

148
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,320
that we have completely broken up,

149
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,959
I can become a plant in Jun Yue

150
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:23,480
through the cooperation.

151
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,600
It's time to put my acting skills to use.

152
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:33,145
Here

153
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,600
is the location we chose.

154
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,959
That factory building there,

155
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,600
I believe you must be familiar with it.

156
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,640
That's where my dad had an accident.

157
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,720
Do you have any thoughts
on the development here?

158
00:07:50,865 --> 00:07:51,720
I want to build this place

159
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,239
into the most luxurious resort,

160
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:56,399
so that my dad can see
the most beautiful scenery.

161
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,880
Let me know if you need me.

162
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,679
Thank you, Second Uncle.

163
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:08,119
Excuse me, I have to take this call.

164
00:08:10,786 --> 00:08:11,678
Hello?

165
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:12,600
Hello, Shishi.

166
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,399
We found that

167
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:16,920
the Jiang's factory building
that was burned down

168
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,079
now belongs to Qi Shuli's company.

169
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:21,640
We also found

170
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,959
the witness to the factory fire

171
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:25,640
was the daughter of the gatekeeper.

172
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,160
We are going to talk with her.

173
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,479
OK, I'll be there right away.

174
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,827
OK.
