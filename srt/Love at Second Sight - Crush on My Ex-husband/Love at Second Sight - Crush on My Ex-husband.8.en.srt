00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:42,200
Hello everyone, I'm now at
the new product launch event

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,639
of Jun Yue Group.

11
00:00:43,639 --> 00:00:44,759
At this event here...

12
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:46,360
Dear guests and media friends,

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,680
welcome to our event.

14
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:48,919
Our new product launch

15
00:00:48,919 --> 00:00:49,959
is about to start.

16
00:00:49,959 --> 00:00:53,000
- Sit down please.
- Are you two reconciled?

17
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,000
I am not sure

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,599
about my feeling for him.

19
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:58,759
Think about Mr. Jiang!

20
00:00:59,279 --> 00:01:00,880
He admitted it himself

21
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,880
that he's responsible for
Mr. Jiang's death.

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,040
Maybe it is also a misunderstanding!

23
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,199
After all, I have worked
in the company for so long,

24
00:01:07,199 --> 00:01:08,960
but found nothing suspicious at all.

25
00:01:08,961 --> 00:01:09,839
In my opinion,

26
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:11,199
you have fallen for him again!

27
00:01:11,559 --> 00:01:12,440
Let me tell you.

28
00:01:12,559 --> 00:01:14,040
You must remember a sentence,

29
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:16,160
"Clever people will never fall in love."

30
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:18,559
Can't you focus on your career?

31
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:24,120
Come on.

32
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:25,792
Let's go.

33
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:36,720
Hello, everyone.

34
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,800
I am Qi Junye.

35
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:42,760
Thank you very much for coming

36
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,519
to the new product launch event

37
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,760
of Jun Yue Jewelry.

38
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,040
Now, Jiang Shishi, our design director

39
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,907
will explain

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,959
her design concept for us.

41
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,080
Applause, please.

42
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,760
You can do it.

43
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,399
Hello everyone, I am Designer Jiang Shishi.

44
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,720
Originality and tranquility

45
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,279
are two stages in my life.

46
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:25,279
Originality was the old me,

47
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,759
when I was
surrounded by fatherly love

48
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:29,240
and living in anticipation
of a better life.

49
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,000
And the present me

50
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:33,279
can feel the tranquility.

51
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,119
I can follow my heart,

52
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,240
do what I like

53
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:37,960
and shine like a diamond.

54
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,639
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

55
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,759
- Junye, thank you so much.
- My mom and little brother?

56
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,399
What are you doing here?

57
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,080
This is not the first time, right?

58
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,720
Shishi, you know we need money.

59
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,999
There's nothing wrong with asking
my brother-in-law for some money.

60
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,759
You need money?

61
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,039
OK, take my card.

62
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,600
Don't come to Junye for money again.

63
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,639
Why not? He's my son-in-law.

64
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:10,320
Take it

65
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,759
or leave it.

66
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,483
Let's go.

67
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,759
It's OK.

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,039
We got the money anyway.

69
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,479
You have been giving them money

70
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
since we got married?

71
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,800
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:35,039
So you refused when I tried to

73
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,559
borrow money from you

74
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:38,320
to help Jiang Group

75
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,440
because...

76
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,720
Because I had done this

77
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,600
many times.

78
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:44,960
And I think Jiang Group's problem

79
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,759
can't be solved just with money.

80
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,720
Your younger brother

81
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,199
is really not suitable
for running a company.

82
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:54,240
That's why I didn't tell you.

83
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:55,639
I'm sorry.

84
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,279
I didn't know.

85
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:05,434
It's OK.

86
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,720
We are family.

87
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,399
I'll be here for you in the future.

88
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:13,520
OK, stop crying.

89
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,440
I don't think
I can pay you back in this life

90
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,959
for what my family owes you

91
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:40,920
with my current salary.

92
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,959
Then do it in the next life

93
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,040
and the next one after that.

94
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,160
Silly girl.

95
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,720
You are my wife,

96
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:55,399
you don't need to pay me back.

97
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,519
But we have already divorced.

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,279
You don't love me.

99
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,760
Our marriage

100
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,160
is just a transaction.

101
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,640
Jiang family is going downhill,

102
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,160
so I am useless now.

103
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,160
If there is another marriage,

104
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,959
I hope

105
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,720
it's a marriage of love.

106
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,000
Love.

107
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,640
People like us

108
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,399
don't have the qualification

109
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,320
to talk about love.

110
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,799
Let me tell you

111
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,440
a little secret.

112
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,119
Actually, since I was little,

113
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,119
I have never made friends.

114
00:05:54,424 --> 00:05:55,279
And I...

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,200
I never had any hobbies.

116
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:01,399
Even my only marriage

117
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:03,760
was arranged by my mother.

118
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
The reason is simple.

119
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,279
Just because I was born
in the Qi family,

120
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,600
every day,

121
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:12,701
I have to

122
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,519
be cautious and careful.

123
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:19,640
Because I have to become
the pride of everyone.

124
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,320
I can only do

125
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:24,079
the right things.

126
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,600
This is my fate.

127
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,119
My parents have always told me
since I was young

128
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,519
that love,

129
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:32,239
friendship, and things like that

130
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,839
are all meaningless.

131
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,920
Only money and interests
are the most solid stuff.

132
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:41,000
Those who claim that

133
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:43,200
they love you

134
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,519
will often hurt you the most.

135
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,559
To be honest, I...

136
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,279
I don't even know what love is.

137
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,720
But I just

138
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,559
really, really, really want

139
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,600
to see you again.

140
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,440
I don't want you to leave.

141
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:36,119
Qi Junye.

142
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,000
Qi Junye.

143
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,920
Qi Junye.

144
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,440
Honey, I need your shoulder now.

145
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:54,720
Qi Junye.

146
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,600
Don't leave me.

147
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,600
OK. I will never leave you, alright?

148
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,720
Don't ever leave me.

149
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,720
I will never leave you if you behave.

150
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,119
I will behave.

151
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,079
You will?

152
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,040
Really?

153
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,279
I will.

154
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,440
I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

155
00:08:15,202 --> 00:08:16,119
Really?

156
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,160
What about your family?

157
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,079
I don't care.

158
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,320
Look,

159
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,599
I'll tie us together.

160
00:08:36,056 --> 00:08:36,919
Like this.

161
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,000
Again.

162
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,680
♪You are like the weather in my heart♪

163
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,200
♪Will it rain tomorrow♪

164
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:50,640
So we will never be apart.

165
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,119
Never.

166
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,200
Then...

167
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,440
Give me a hug.

168
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,159
Then let's

169
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:58,760
go to bed now, OK?

170
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:00,440
No.

171
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,400
You just want to leave me.

172
00:09:03,648 --> 00:09:04,520
I won't.

173
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,640
Please don't leave me.

174
00:09:06,641 --> 00:09:07,484
OK.

175
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:09,919
I'll hate you

176
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,559
if I can't see you tomorrow morning.

177
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,880
I promise you.

178
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:16,771
OK.
