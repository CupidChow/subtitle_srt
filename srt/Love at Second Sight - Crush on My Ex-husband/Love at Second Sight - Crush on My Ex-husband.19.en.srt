00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,200
President Qi.

10
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:47,759
Miss Chu is here.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,880
Please have a seat.

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,400
I won't beat around the bush with you.

13
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:52,959
I'm here today

14
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:54,200
to discuss cooperation with you

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,560
on behalf of the Chu Group.

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,599
This is the cooperative planning proposal.

17
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,560
Take a look.

18
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:03,639
Miss Chu is really sincere.

19
00:01:04,639 --> 00:01:06,239
But I just want to know

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,199
why you want to
cooperate with Jun Yue.

21
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:10,480
You were there that day.

22
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,959
Isn't it obvious?

23
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,360
Why do you have to ask?

24
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:16,199
You want to get back at Qi Junye?

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,639
I want to make him
regret choosing Jiang Shishi.

26
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:21,839
I want to get the pride I lost for him.

27
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:26,360
Then I hope we can both
get what we want.

28
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,239
May we have a great cooperation.

29
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:39,000
Jiang Shishi, how dare you come!

30
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,559
Calm down, Yu.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,400
Dad, why are you here?

32
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,480
I have something to say.

33
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:47,964
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,863
President Qi.

35
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:51,040
I have to interrupt you now.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,160
Starting from today,

37
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,760
all the affairs of the Chu Group

38
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:57,839
will be handled by Shishi.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,760
So Yu can't sign

40
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,199
this contract.

41
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,959
Dad, what are you saying?

42
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,160
Why are you doing this?

43
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:07,745
President Chu,

44
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,759
what do you mean?

45
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,039
The Chu Group doesn't plan
to cooperate with Jun Yue anymore?

46
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,000
Of course we do.

47
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,160
I am still willing
to cooperate with Jun Yue

48
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,399
on behalf of the Chu Group.

49
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:18,000
I believe our cooperation

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,960
will be successful.

51
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,000
Is that right, Second Uncle?

52
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,962
Of course.

53
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,482
Please have a seat.

54
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,818
Yu.

55
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:30,082
Shishi, let's have a good talk.

56
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:30,995
OK.

57
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,160
What did you say?

58
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:35,360
Jiang Shishi
is your biological daughter?

59
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,199
Yes, Yu.

60
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,960
Listen to me.

61
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,479
Shishi

62
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,360
was lost when she was 3 years old.

63
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,240
We looked for her for a long time
but couldn't find her.

64
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,519
At that time,

65
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,679
I thought she was kidnapped
by human traffickers.

66
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,399
Because of this matter,

67
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:52,880
her mother was sad for many years.

68
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,039
So shortly after you came to this family,

69
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:55,883
she just...

70
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,559
So the reason why
you and Mom adopted me

71
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:00,520
was that your own daughter

72
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,880
was missing?

73
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,960
I was just a substitute?

74
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,119
Yu, you can't say that.

75
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,160
In the past years,

76
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,759
me and your mother

77
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,759
treated you as our own daughter.

78
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,279
Now that Shishi

79
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:17,199
is back, then

80
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,880
we've got another family member,

81
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,199
and you've got a sister.

82
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,080
So you should get along

83
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,559
as sisters, OK?

84
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:24,800
But why are you sure

85
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,559
she is your biological daughter?

86
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:31,960
(That day at the engagement banquet,)

87
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:35,279
I saw Shishi wearing a necklace.

88
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,360
I recognized it.

89
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,960
That's been passed down
in our Chu family for generations.

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,960
It's one of a kind.

91
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,800
Thanks to that necklace,

92
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
I found out that

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,360
Shishi had been very close to us.

94
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,399
You can't be sure

95
00:03:50,552 --> 00:03:51,399
just because of

96
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:52,839
a necklace.

97
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,700
(Judicial Appraisal Opinion
of the Institute of Forensic Science)

98
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,240
I know it will take some time

99
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,000
for you to accept this,

100
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,000
but for Shishi,

101
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,839
we owe her.

102
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,000
So the Chu Group

103
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:15,000
will be a little compensation.

104
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,839
But don't worry.

105
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:18,839
Although she has come back,

106
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,959
my love for you will not diminish.

107
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:27,040
Dad.

108
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:28,959
Don't worry.

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,880
I will take good care of my sister.

110
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,200
You are my good daughter.

111
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,880
My good daughter.

112
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,160
I specifically sent

113
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
my best driver to pick you up.

114
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:43,880
You'll choose your room later.

115
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,880
Thank you, Dad.

116
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,320
Chu Yu, your sister is here.

117
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,200
Shishi, how was your trip?

118
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,043
Welcome home.

119
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,079
It was a fine trip.

120
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,880
I have returned
to my own home after all.

121
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,359
I just don't know
if you're feeling good.

122
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,880
Of course.

123
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,079
My sister has returned,

124
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,559
I'm so happy.

125
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:02,915
Dad,

126
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,000
maybe my sister can have my room.

127
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,119
It's spacious there.

128
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,160
Don't bother.

129
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,399
I don't like using things
that others have used.

130
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:10,839
It doesn't matter.

131
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,399
You finally came back.

132
00:05:12,482 --> 00:05:13,359
Later,

133
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,760
you can choose

134
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,040
any room you want.

135
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,760
Tell me if you need anything.

136
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:18,760
I will get you the moon if you want it,

137
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,959
let alone a room.

138
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:22,097
- Come on.
- Thank you, Dad.

139
00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:23,519
I'll show you around your own home.

140
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,938
This way.

141
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:31,359
Junye, Junye, open the door.

142
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:33,359
Junye.

143
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,922
Take a look at this.

144
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,880
Chu Yu was actually adopted.

145
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,200
Jiang Shishi is the true daughter
of Mr. Chu.

146
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:40,674
Look.

147
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,200
That's great.

148
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,279
Luckily you ran away with her before.

149
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,040
Have you two made up?

150
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,399
Now the Chu family will definitely
lend a helping hand.

151
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:53,679
We haven't made up,
she rejected me.

152
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,000
How could she possibly reject you?

153
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,640
That's Jiang Shishi,

154
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:59,079
she always listens to you.

155
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,559
How could she possibly refuse?

156
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:02,040
That was before the divorce.

157
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:05,359
Mom, it was you
who personally drove her out.

158
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,239
That's it. I'm going to bed. I'm tired.

159
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,035
Jun...

160
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:12,440
So what?

161
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,720
I drove her away,

162
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,239
so I'll get her back.

163
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,079
(Jiang Shishi  Release to send)
Shishi, are you free on Saturday?

164
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,600
Do you want to come
and have some tea?

165
00:06:22,825 --> 00:06:23,678
OK.

166
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:24,623
Good.

167
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,480
I heard the girl of the Jiang family,

168
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,839
Madam Qi's daughter-in-law,

169
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,600
is the missing daughter of Mr. Chu.

170
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,959
And

171
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,559
that girl named Chu Yu

172
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,200
was actually adopted.

173
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,000
She is the real heiress.

174
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,000
No wonder she was
so arrogant before.

175
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:45,440
She has a backer now.

176
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,491
Hello, everyone.

177
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,359
I hope as an uninvited guest,

178
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,200
I'm not ruining your fun.

179
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,880
Ms. Chu, don't say that.

180
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,440
You are welcome here.

181
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,399
That's right.

182
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,559
You are more beautiful
than a few days ago.

183
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,600
Yes.

184
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,475
Is that so?

185
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,436
Yes.

186
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,480
Thank you.

187
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,799
Which beauty salon do you go to?

188
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,160
Your skin looks so tender.

189
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,279
I can tell you are a lucky person

190
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:10,559
at a glance of your face.

191
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,200
That's true.

192
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,359
You're not angry with me anymore?

193
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:14,839
Ms. Chu,

194
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,200
what happened last time

195
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,880
was my son's fault.

196
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,640
I have scolded him.

197
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:21,000
Please don't take it to heart.

198
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:22,531
I wouldn't dare.

199
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,399
Mrs. Qi, your earrings are so nice.

200
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,200
Right? I just bought them.

201
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,051
So beautiful!

202
00:07:29,268 --> 00:07:30,159
Go ahead.

203
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,559
Just go, you are a man,

204
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:32,799
you shouldn't be shy.

205
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,292
Look.

206
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,893
Go ahead.

207
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,600
They are really going to reconcile.

208
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,526
Shishi.

209
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:47,679
What do you want?

210
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,880
Can we have a talk?

211
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,279
Sorry, I don't have time.

212
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,239
I'm glad to see you all today.

213
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:58,679
I have to go now. Excuse me.

214
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,720
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

215
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,760
Qi Junye, stop bothering me.

216
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:08,200
I can't possibly be with a person

217
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:09,399
who is wicked, narrow-minded

218
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:11,239
and self-righteous.

219
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:16,880
Junye.

220
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,239
Go get her.

221
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,239
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

222
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:24,799
- It's normal for a couple to fight.
- Indeed.

223
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,119
Come on, have some tea.

224
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,305
Mochen.

225
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,337
You are done?

226
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,200
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

227
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,978
Dad.

228
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,880
Shishi, you are home.

229
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,559
This is my friend, Lin Mochen.

230
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Nice to meet you, Mr. Chu.

231
00:08:52,546 --> 00:08:53,390
Good.

232
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,440
Lin Mochen, sit down.

233
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,280
I have hardly met

234
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,760
Shishi's friends yet.

235
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
Come on, have some water.

236
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:07,359
How long have you known Shishi?

237
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:08,359
Not very long,

238
00:09:08,359 --> 00:09:09,200
but

239
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:10,840
we are like old friends.

240
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,000
Shishi is a kind-hearted girl.

241
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,559
You young people

242
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,039
should help each other.

243
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,559
In the future, this world

244
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:21,440
will be yours.

245
00:09:21,599 --> 00:09:22,640
We've got a guest?

246
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,599
I just cut a watermelon.

247
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,559
They say the center of a watermelon

248
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:28,479
is for the person you like the most.

249
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:31,000
Shishi, you can have this.

250
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,760
Thank you, Yu.

251
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,039
If I'm not wrong,

252
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,520
you must be President Lin of DK.

253
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,919
Could it be that
the previous rumor was true?

254
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,338
What rumor?

255
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,520
It said that Shishi had an affair

256
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,400
with President Lin.

257
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,919
You also think
I'm that kind of person?

258
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,840
I'm really sad.

259
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,520
I thought at least my family
wouldn't misunderstand me.

260
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,259
Yu.

261
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,599
Look what you have done.

262
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,880
You made your sister upset.

263
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,520
Shishi, don't be angry.

264
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,000
It's all my fault.

265
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:08,440
I'm sorry.

266
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,203
It's OK.

267
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,799
Just trust me in the future, Yu.

268
00:10:13,593 --> 00:10:14,478
Mr. Chu,

269
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:15,760
since Shishi
has already arrived home,

270
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,640
it's time for me to leave.

271
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,719
I still have some job to do.

272
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,559
OK, no problem.

273
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,280
Come again when you have time.

274
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,640
Shishi, see Mochen out.

275
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,599
OK, I'll see him out.

276
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,919
Goodbye, Mr. Chu.

277
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,359
Please come again.

278
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,520
Thank you for today.

279
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,919
I'll treat you to a meal another day.

280
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,000
Don't mention it. It's just a small favor.

281
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,760
However, you should be careful of that Chu Yu.

282
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:41,080
I think she is running out

283
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,280
of patience against you.

284
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,159
She's pretending to be innocent.

285
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:46,599
I can do that too.

286
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:49,320
OK. See you around.

287
00:10:49,536 --> 00:10:50,435
Goodbye.
