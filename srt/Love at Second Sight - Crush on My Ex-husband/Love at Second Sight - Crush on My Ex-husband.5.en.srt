The beautiful Ms. Jiang Shishi.

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,360
Would you do me an honor

11
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:45,919
to let me give you a ride?

12
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:47,439
Why are you here?

13
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,439
The filming ended early today,

14
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,040
so I came here to pick you up.

15
00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:56,599
My superstar is always so reliable.

16
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,802
Of course.

17
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,091
Get in the car.

18
00:00:59,115 --> 00:01:00,021
Come on.

19
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,000
Surprise.

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,760
It's really a surprise!

21
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,360
Mom, why are you still up?

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,599
Explain this to me.

23
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,199
What are you busy with all day long?

24
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:40,720

you are a great designer?

(Divorce Agreement)

27
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,279
It's such an important matter,

28
00:01:57,279 --> 00:01:59,000
why didn't you discuss it with me?

29
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,639
But this is really a good thing.

30
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:03,839
Back then,

31
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
I didn't agree

32
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,120
with your marriage at all.

33
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:09,360
She shouldn't live
in this house anymore.

34
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,960
I have packed her stuff.

35
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,279
She can move out tonight.

36
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,720
Mom, where can she go
at this late hour?

37
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,479
You also know it's late.

38
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,119
She still hasn't come back yet.

39
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:19,880
Who knows what she's doing out there.

40
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't wanna see her again anyway.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,859
Mom.

42
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,039
Thank you for this morning.

43
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,279
No problem,
call me when you need it again.

44
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:28,639
- OK. Thank you.
- Take care.

45
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,320
Since you're not happy in his house,

46
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:37,880
why don't you just move out?

47
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,960
Anyway, you are divorced.

48
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,800
Could it be

49
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:44,479
that you still like him?

50
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,399
I like him? Come on!

51
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,000
Good for you,

52
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,119
you have found
a new boyfriend already.

53
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:52,479
That being the case,

54
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,679
take your trash

55
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:54,919
and get out of our house.

56
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,810
Mom!

57
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:58,096
Junye.

58
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,681
Let go.

59
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:13,279
I said let go!

60
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:17,049
Give it to me.

Hello.

63
00:03:41,893 --> 00:03:42,759
Hello, Boss.

64
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:44,759
I have already sent all the information

65
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,600
about Liu Shi to you.

66
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,919
Why are you suddenly
interested in him?

67
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:53,479
He's super popular now,

68
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,960
especially among girls.

69
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,080
For our company, he's...

70
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:02,960
He is not even as handsome as me.

71
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,479
(Personal Information)
What do they see in him?

72
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,279
Welcome to Shishi's

73
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:09,160

00:04:10,179 --> 00:04:11,759
Come on.

75
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,700
Have a drink!

76
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,160
Sorry, I don't drink.

77
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,480
You're acting strange today.

78
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,279
Drink it up!

79
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:20,320
- Come on.
- Sorry, I really don't drink.

80
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:21,359
I really can't drink.

81
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll drink with you guys.

82
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:25,160
Cheers. Have fun.

83
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,200
OK, come on.

84
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,183
Cheers.

85
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,051
Shall we continue?

86
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,880
Of course. Come on.

87
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,440
Let's drink.

88
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,399
OK, come on.

89
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:38,118
Let's have a drink.

90
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:39,640
Here.

91
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,119
Sorry, I really don't drink.

92
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:41,994
It's non-alcoholic.

93
00:04:43,921 --> 00:04:45,499
OK. Thank you.

94
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,040
Cheers.

95
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,000
I didn't expect that

96
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,920
President Qi would come

97
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,000
to my single party.

98
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:04,799
Come on.

99
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:07,799
This drink is on me.

100
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,273
Come back with me.

101
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,440
I won't.

102
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:15,279
Do you want to take me back
to the Qi family?

103
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,160
I remember I was just kicked out.

104
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,320
That's not what I meant.

105
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,119
I don't care.

106
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,399
It's not work time now,

107
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:25,760
please stay out of

108
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,839
my personal life, President Qi.

109
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,239
Hey, you wanna take her away like this?

110
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:35,800
I don't think it's appropriate.

111
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,480
Mind your own business.

112
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,519
Don't forget about our agreement.

113
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,200
There cannot be

114
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,040
any negative news within a month.

115
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,079
Are you threatening me?

116
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,799
You did that to me first.

117
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,160
The party is not over yet,

118
00:05:58,799 --> 00:05:59,880
but the protagonist is leaving?

119
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,679
Don't you think it's inappropriate?

120
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,880
She's not single.

121
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,352
Shishi,

122
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:16,959
you can refuse
if you don't want to leave.

123
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,480
You are wearing sunglasses
in such a dark place,

124
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:20,839
aren't you afraid you might fall?

125
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,920
Unexpectedly, Liu Shi, the superstar,

126
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,519
actually has time for a party.

127
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,040
You have become a has-been so soon?

128
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,160
Don't worry about it, Mr. Qi.

133
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:42,079

You want me to get in your car?
