Why haven't you left yet?

12
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,779
Shouldn't you be happy that
I'm working overtime voluntarily?

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,440
Are you working overtime

14
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,480
or doing something

15
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:09,080
you shouldn't be doing?

Don't tell me you are
playing Minesweeper again.

17
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,505
I'm done.

18
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:25,232
I'm going home.

19
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:40,720
Shishi, Madam Qi said
there would be guests,

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,199
and she wanted you to be ready.

21
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,720
(Forget it, arguing with her
will only waste more time.)

22
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,879
Okay, I got it.

23
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,199
Shishi, you have changed your style?

24
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:00,680
Junye likes it simple recently?

25
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,279
I think it looks good.

26
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,760
Mom, I want that.

27
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,360
Shishi, your necklace looks pretty.

28
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,039
Take it off and let us take a look.

29
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,199
Sorry, it's not convenient.

30
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:13,720
It's just an ordinary pearl necklace,

31
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,960
why are you so stingy?

32
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:16,960
You have so many necklaces,

33
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,360
why don't you give him one?

34
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,199
He won't break it anyway.

35
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:23,279
I'm sorry about that.

36
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:27,520
Come on, sorry about that.

37
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,960
What's wrong with you?

38
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,679
Shishi, what are you doing?

39
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,600
Tell your own child to behave!

40
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,960
He's so undisciplined!

41
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,919
Where are his manners?

42
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:38,199
How can you say that to a child?

43
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,039
He's so little.

44
00:02:39,235 --> 00:02:40,119
Every now and then,

45
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:41,399
you would hold such a gathering

46
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:43,440
on which you do nothing
but compare with each other,

47
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,960
it drives people crazy!

48
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,679
Look!

49
00:02:46,679 --> 00:02:48,199
Look at yourselves!

50
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:50,000
What else can you do besides comparing?

51
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:51,800
Jiang Shishi, what are you talking about?

52
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,674
They are all guests.

53
00:02:52,675 --> 00:02:54,720
- Apologize to them now.
- I won't.

54
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,520
This is the manner of your Qi family?

55
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,119
I don't deserve to be in such a place.

56
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:00,017
Goodbye.

57
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,759
I'm sorry. Please don't be angry.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,700
Ignore what she said.
That's what she's like.

59
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,000
- Let's have some tea.
- Don't take that to heart.

60
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,600
Come on, let's have some tea.

61
00:03:06,997 --> 00:03:07,880
What are you doing?

62
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:09,639
- Stop!
- Be careful.

63
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,479
Stop it now.

64
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,000
Be careful!

65
00:03:14,119 --> 00:03:15,880
- Don't run, be careful.
- Slow down.

66
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,778
Be careful.

67
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,479
What are you doing?

68
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,759
Watch out.

69
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:26,880
Qi! Jun! Ye!

70
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:40,880
(He's such a narcissist.)

71
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,498
(She peeked at me.)

72
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,379
(Looks like she wants to
paint my portrait.)

73
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,440
(He's reading half-naked.)

74
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:01,360
(Is he stupid or what?)

75
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,279
You might catch a cold.

76
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:08,440
I'm in good health.

77
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,760
(He's even holding the book
upside down.)

78
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:40,497
Qi Junye.

79
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,799
Go to bed.

80
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:50,137
He's burning up.

81
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:53,880
You had to do that.

82
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,000
(No, he is Qi Junye,)

83
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,399
(your scumbag ex-husband.)

84
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,679
(You need to calm down,)

85
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:03,799
(and stay away from him.)

86
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,480
You...

87
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,239
(Forget it, I'll just do a good deed.)

88
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,920
(Why is she sleeping here?)

89
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,239
Oh my goodness.

90
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,519
I'm going to be late.

91
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:37,465
Qi Junye.

92
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:39,799
Can you give me a ride?

93
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,279
I will pay.

94
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,279
Why did you get up?

95
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,679
I didn't mean to oversleep.

96
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,399
Just give me a ride.

97
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,559
If you are really going to be late,

98
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,799
just stay at home.

99
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,811
You can take a day off.

100
00:06:56,239 --> 00:06:58,559
I still have a lot of things to do
at the company.

101
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
(Waiting to be picked up, 28th)

102
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:09,160
Unbelievable!

103
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,440
She will have a good rest at home.

104
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:30,160
You just can't accept my goodwill.

105
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,640
(Sketchbook)

106
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,160
I thought your design
would be impressive.

107
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,480
That's it?

108
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,519
It's none of your business.

109
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,480
I just don't want you to bring shame
on the Design Department.

110
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,119
I thought you were capable.

111
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:56,160
Maybe you have been
a housewife for so long

112
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,839
that your aesthetic sense declined.

113
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,480
I'm looking forward to
Director Chu's masterpiece.

114
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,200
I hope your masterpiece

115
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:04,440
won't be defeated

116
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,839
by a housewife's work.

117
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,040
Dare to make a bet?

118
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,640
Let's bet on whose design
will be used for this project.

119
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:11,897
What are the stakes?

120
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,480
If you lose,

121
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,399
you can never appear

122
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:15,959
in front of Junye again!

123
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:17,440
And if you lose,

124
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:19,480
don't show up in front of me again.

125
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:22,160
There's no way
I'm going to lose to you.

126
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:47,679
(She's still not leaving
at this late hour.)

127
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,400
(Jiang Shishi,
you're quite hard-working.)

128
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,200
(For the sake of that,)

129
00:08:58,599 --> 00:08:59,719
(I'll just give you a ride.)

130
00:09:08,359 --> 00:09:09,799
The beautiful Ms. Jiang Shishi.

131
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:10,880
Would you do me an honor

132
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:12,440
to let me give you a ride?

133
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,039
Why are you here?
