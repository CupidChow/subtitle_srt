=Episode 6=

9
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,119
You can live here from now on.

10
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:02,579
Jiang Shishi? What are you doing here?

11
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,720
Is there anything wrong with me
being in my husband's place?

12
00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:08,080
But you are dressed up like this
in the middle of the night,

13
00:01:08,559 --> 00:01:09,639
who are you trying to seduce?

14
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:11,198
I...

15
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:13,760
I came to borrow a bottle opener
from Junye.

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,760
From dawn to dusk,

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,279
you say "Junye" a thousand times.

18
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,599
What is your problem?

19
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:19,706
You...

20
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:21,480
Jiang Shishi, you crossed the line.

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,720
Junye.

22
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:25,160
Junye.

23
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:28,120
Junye.

24
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,040
Didn't you already

25
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:31,160
take my bottle opener?

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,480
Did I?

27
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,120
Last Tuesday,
my car was sent to the garage.

28
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,160
You said you'd got some wine.

29
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,252
Let me see

30
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:48,239
what this is.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,400
Junye,

32
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:56,919
I have received some wine,

33
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,199
but I forgot to buy a bottle opener.

34
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,559
Do you have one?

35
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:04,519
Maybe we can have a drink together.

36
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:06,000
I have a bottle opener.

37
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:07,160
But I can't drink with you.

38
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:09,440
Come in and get it yourself.

39
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,720
(Looks like those photos)

40
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,240
(were Chu Yu's dirty trick.)

41
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,880
(She's such a wicked person.)

42
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,080
Do you need anything else?

43
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,160
If that's all,

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,240
we'll go to bed now.

45
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,679
You... You are staying?

46
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,000
What a weird question.

47
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:30,399
Can't I stay in my husband's house?

48
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,759
What belongs to him

49
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,960
also belongs to me.

50
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,199
Haven't you already...

51
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,919
What's yours is mine, right?

52
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,960
Then may I ask,

53
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,520
what else can we do for you, neighbor?

54
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:50,960
Then I will leave you alone.

55
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,882
Goodbye.

56
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,199
(You think I don't know
you are divorced?)

57
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,559
You are the only child of the Chu family,

58
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,320
the Chu Group is counting on you.

59
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,919
My dad doesn't want me
to work too hard,

60
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,320
so in the future, our company

61
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,800
will be run by my husband.

62
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:16,360
I think Junye

63
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,000
and you

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,919
are a perfect match.

65
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,839
Madam Qi, please don't say that.

66
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,360
After all,

67
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,360
Junye is married.

68
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,399
I'll tell you a secret,

69
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,199
Junye is already divorced.

70
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,479
He's divorced?

71
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,479
(I didn't expect those photos)

72
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,199
(would work so well.)

73
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,458
(What a good news.)

74
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't believe
you have got back together.

75
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,919
Why did you buy such a house?

76
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,650
I believe

77
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,800
Ms. Song doesn't know about it, right?

78
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,360
I just feel that it's quiet here.

79
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
And it's convenient for work.

80
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,119
So I bought it.

81
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,240
You enjoyed your quiet life here,

82
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:05,639
but what about me?

83
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,399
Do you know how much grievance

84
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:08,320
I have suffered

85
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,360
because of your mom?

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
My father passed away early,

87
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,399
so my mom raised me alone.

88
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,960
And she has been
in her climacteric these years,

89
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,160
of course she's hard to get along with.

90
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,160
But you have been quite fierce recently,

91
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,559
you handled it very well.

92
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,959
I have been fierce? Is that a good word?

93
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:28,040
Do you dare to say that again?

94
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,239
What are they doing?

95
00:04:33,119 --> 00:04:34,559
What are you doing?

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,200
Let me get up.

97
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,600
You're pressing on me.

98
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,720
- Junye!
- Let me get up then!

99
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,634
Easy!

100
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,600
Why are you pushing me so hard?

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Let go of me now.

102
00:04:44,444 --> 00:04:45,320
Then let me get up.

103
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,519
Let go of me.

104
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,160
Easy, easy.

105
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,720
Let me go now. You are hurting me.

106
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:55,559
Are you OK?

107
00:04:55,559 --> 00:04:56,519
Be careful.

108
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,200
Jiang Shishi, this isn't over yet.

109
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,559
I will regain what I lost sooner or later!

110
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,732
You... You...

111
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,239
What are you looking at?

112
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,359
Haven't you seen
a beautiful woman eavesdropping?

113
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,119
Which house had a power failure?

114
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,799
Get lost! There's no power failure.

115
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,200
Are you done?

116
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,472
No.

117
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,119
You like me.

118
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,119
I just heard your heartbeat.

119
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,720
Your heart was racing.

120
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,559
You just startled me.

121
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:36,559
Do you want to continue being Mrs. Qi?

122
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,320
Qi Junye,

123
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,200
are you out of your mind?

124
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,799
Actually, I began to regret it

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,320
soon after

126
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,600
I signed my name

127
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,320
on the Divorce Agreement.

128
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:56,440
Since we divorced,

129
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,959
I found that

130
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,200
nobody would be

131
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,000
a better Mrs. Qi than you.

132
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:06,399
I

133
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,600
hope you can reconsider it.
