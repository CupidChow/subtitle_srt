(Jun Yue Group)

10
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:57,754
Hi, Shishi.

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,479
Ladies and gentlemen,

12
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,479
may I have your attention?

13
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:01,479
Let me introduce.

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,599
This is our new colleague
in the Design Department.

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,239
Let's give her a warm welcome.

16
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,400
Hello, everyone.

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,480
My name is Jiang Shishi.

18
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:10,919
As a newcomer,

19
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:12,720
I'm afraid I'll need your help.

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,919
Thank you in advance.

21
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,360
I believe you haven't had breakfast yet.

22
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:19,290
This is the dessert I made,

23
00:01:19,306 --> 00:01:20,199
try it please.

24
00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:21,480
If you like it,

25
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,480
I'll bring some more tomorrow.

26
00:01:22,617 --> 00:01:23,515
Thank you.

27
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:24,400
Here.

28
00:01:25,532 --> 00:01:26,400
Try it, please.

29
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:28,319
Thank you.

30
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:32,279
Boss, the cake Shishi made
is really good.

31
00:01:32,839 --> 00:01:33,714
Do you

32
00:01:34,074 --> 00:01:34,953
want to have a piece?

33
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:44,879
I see.

34
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,440
You must be tired of eating cakes
made by Mrs. Qi.

35
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,360
I'll eat it for you.

36
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,919
You should lose some weight.

37
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,559
Go to our suburban office now.

38
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:00,720
I need the document immediately.

39
00:02:01,324 --> 00:02:02,199
Go there by foot.

40
00:02:03,018 --> 00:02:03,879
I...

41
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:11,320
Could this Jiang Shishi

42
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,800
be the rumored Mrs. Qi?

43
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,679
Hard to say.

44
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:15,919
Many people told me that

45
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,360
only their families were invited

46
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,679
to their mysterious wedding.

47
00:02:20,753 --> 00:02:21,600
Nobody knows

48
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,639
what Mrs. Qi looks like.

49
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,786
She is not the only string-puller.

50
00:02:25,787 --> 00:02:26,679
What do you mean?

51
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,360
Let me introduce
a new colleague to you all.

52
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:30,440
- President Qi is here. President Qi.
- President Qi.

53
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,283
President Qi.

54
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,759
Listen up, everyone.

55
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:35,479
This is the new director of Jun Yue.

56
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,160
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

57
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:43,759
Nice to meet you, too.

58
00:02:44,054 --> 00:02:44,921
My name is Chu Yu.

59
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:48,119
I hope we can enjoy working together
in the future.

60
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:50,119
- Welcome, Director Chu.
- Welcome, Director Chu.

61
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:51,000
- Welcome.
- Shishi.

62
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:53,399
Why are you here?
What a coincidence!

63
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,320
Director Chu, you know each other?

64
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,199
Yes.

65
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,160
We were college schoolmates.

66
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,919
But I went to France
right after the graduation,

67
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,240
so we haven't been in touch.

68
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,720
So many years have passed,

69
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,039
but you are still so hypocritical.

70
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,639
You wicked woman.

71
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,119
Shishi,

72
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,440
why are you still so rude?

73
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,360
After all, I am your boss now.

74
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,399
I thought we were classmates.

75
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,290
You...

76
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,000
I've seen it all.

77
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,080
Come on, back to work.

78
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,199
Come on.

79
00:03:35,626 --> 00:03:36,479
I thought

80
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,919
you would be a housewife for a lifetime.

81
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,679
Why are you working now?

82
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,559
You were anxious?

83
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:43,720
I understand.

84
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,279
Junye never admitted your identity

85
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:47,199
in front of people.

86
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,039
It's enough for him to admit it
in front of the law.

87
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,199
It's better than being a gold-digger

88
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,199
waiting to pick up

89
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,399
somebody's leftovers.

90
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:58,039
Who are you calling a gold-digger?

91
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,199
You're the gold-digger!

92
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,240
This is not over.

93
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:02,119
Jiang Shishi, stop!

94
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:03,600
Who were you calling a gold-digger?

95
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,120
(Jun Yue Group)

96
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,039
What are you two doing?

97
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,639
Junye,

98
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,399
I don't know what I did wrong,

99
00:04:10,399 --> 00:04:12,000
but she just hit me.

100
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,519
Jiang Shishi, you are unreasonable!

101
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,200
- You don't have what it takes
- What are you doing?

102
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,160
to be a good actress.

103
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,679
I'm just trying to help,
you are welcome.

104
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,119
I just did what she wanted me to do.

105
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,239
It's reasonable.

106
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,359
Junye,

107
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,519
you see, she crossed the line.

108
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,600
How could she do this?

109
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,359
Junye!

110
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,679
Seafood makes it harder to have a baby.

111
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,799
Don't eat too much.

112
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,600
Why did you bang your chopsticks?

113
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,880
How rude.

114
00:04:58,119 --> 00:04:59,640
Remember, you are Mrs. Qi.

115
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:02,119
I'm sorry.

116
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,200
I really don't care about
being Mrs. Qi at all.

117
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:08,200
And I don't care
what Mrs. Qi should look like.

118
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:09,640
If you don't like it,

119
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:11,559
you can find another one.

120
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,600
Do you know who are you talking to?
I'm your mother-in-law!

121
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:14,494
Mother-in-law?

122
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,160
Have you ever treated me
as your daughter-in-law?

123
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,320
You have just been treating me

124
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,000
as a tool for giving birth to babies.

125
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:23,959
However, I don't want to be that

126
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,359
anymore from now on.

127
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,114
Jiang Shishi, you're becoming
more and more presumptuous!

128
00:05:27,115 --> 00:05:28,061
Mom.

129
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,839
I just bought
a set of jade jewelry for you.

130
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,839
Why don't you go and take a look?

131
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,760
You are still eating?

132
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,320
Of course.

133
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,119
After all, I am not a...

134
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,480
I am actually pregnant?

135
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,760
Yes, congratulations, Shishi!

136
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,160
You've finally fulfilled your dream.

137
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,359
Not a person
who does nothing at home at all.

138
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:04,640
Working consumes a lot of brain cells.

139
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,079
I need to make up for it.

140
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:09,559
Can't you be like before?

141
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,359
This is a home, not a court.

142
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:14,559
Is right or wrong that important?

143
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:20,399
Like before?

144
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,640
Look at you now.

145
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,239
You've got a ferret face,

146
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:28,239
and you are narrow-minded
and self-righteous.

147
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,160
How can I be like before?

148
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,679
I am full.

149
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:39,679
Ferret face?

150
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,880
I don't have a ferret face.

151
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,569
Jiang Shishi!

152
00:06:57,559 --> 00:06:58,440
Where is my pajamas?

153
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,399
Jiang Shishi!

154
00:07:06,064 --> 00:07:06,971
Jiang Shishi!

155
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Please handle your own matters
in the future.

156
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,119
Don't call me
if there's nothing wrong.

157
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,923
Wait,

158
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:33,600
did she just despise me?

159
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,239
How could she despise me?
