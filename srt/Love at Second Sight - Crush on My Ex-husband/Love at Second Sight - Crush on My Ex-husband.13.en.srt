Shishi.

10
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,439
The superstar is here to visit you,

11
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,360
and you are not even looking at him.

12
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,119
What are you laughing at?

13
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:53,520
Let me tell you,

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,560
if I hadn't persuaded the doctor

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,560
in advance with my charm,

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,200
Qi Junye would have known
about your pregnancy.

17
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:02,560
Your charm?

18
00:01:02,599 --> 00:01:05,160
I remember you are famous for your acting.

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,680
That doesn't mean I don't have charm.

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,559
OK, OK.

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,080
Thank you, superstar.

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,199
That's more like it.
What are you watching?

23
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,680
(Qi Junye protected his wife,
Mrs. Qi's identity is finally revealed)

24
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:21,760
Qi Junye actually admitted
he is your husband.

25
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,279
This is

26
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:25,279
the first time he did that, right?

27
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:28,519
That's cool.

28
00:01:29,018 --> 00:01:29,878
Cool?

29
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:32,120
I can't believe the two of you.

30
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:34,599
You're divorced already!

31
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:37,800
We are still in the cooling-off period.

32
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:41,160
You do need to cool off.

33
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:43,040
Do you still like him?

34
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,319
To be honest,

35
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,480
he has really changed a lot recently.

36
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:52,199
He's not as cold as before,

37
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:53,919
and he takes good care of me.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,919
So I think...

39
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:57,160
So you fell for him again?

40
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,319
Does he like you?

41
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:01,879
He risked his life to save me.

42
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,440
So I think he must do.

43
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,360
But he has also said that
he didn't believe in love.

44
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,160
He didn't believe in love?

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,039
I won't act in any show

46
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,039
that has this line in the script.

47
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,240
But these are not the point.

48
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,880
After all, there is still

49
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,960
one most important problem
between us.

50
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,199
About Mr. Jiang,

51
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:30,639
have you ever thought about
asking him directly?

52
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,559
Let me think about it.

53
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,320
- Shishi.
- Mochen?

54
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,320
I think this guy

55
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:42,639
is much better than that scumbag.

56
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,360
- What are you doing?
- What did you say?

57
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,320
Shishi, take a good rest.

58
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:47,839
- Let's go.
- I have to go.

59
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:48,729
OK, bye.

60
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,607
Buddy.

61
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,395
How are you feeling,

62
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Ms. Jiang Shishi?

63
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,520
It's a lot better now.

64
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,240
I think I can be discharged tomorrow.

65
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:58,945
That's good.

66
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,039
But from what I know about you...

67
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,399
You know nothing about her.

68
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
Excuse me, Mr. Cao...

69
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:20,611
Oh, no, Mr. Lin.

70
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,759
I'm allergic to pollen.

71
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,600
Are you allergic to pollen

72
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:25,919
or to me?

73
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:29,290
I'm leaving now.

74
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:30,457
Goodbye.

75
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,800
How did I not know

76
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,440
that you are allergic to pollen?

77
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,960
I am allergic to playboys.

78
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,360
(Outpatient)

79
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
Are you saying

80
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:19,640
Qi Junye put my brother

81
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,239
in a subsidiary?

82
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,920
He did do that.

83
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:24,320
He doesn't want your brother

84
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,679
to always ask you for money.

85
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,320
He has to learn to make a living.

86
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,920
Otherwise, you'll have to
support the family alone,

87
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,160
and that must be hard for you.

88
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:34,119
When did he become
so concerned about me?

89
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,040
He has always been like this.

90
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,440
The reason why
he brought you to Jun Yue

91
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,119
was to help you

92
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:41,000
ensure your basic living.

93
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,679
Although he is usually

94
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,040
cunning,

95
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,920
treacherous

96
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,000
and ruthless,

97
00:04:46,496 --> 00:04:47,348
to be honest,

98
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:48,959
you are his only exception.

99
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,320
You can't sleep?

100
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:02,160
Don't you have work to do?

101
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,559
You are much more important than work.

102
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,119
Are you still the Qi Junye I know?

103
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:15,987
Well,

104
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,959
why don't we check it out?

105
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,399
It is too late now,

106
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:23,720
maybe you should go home.

107
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:25,559
It's too late,

108
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,000
so I'm not gonna leave.

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,119
I'll stay and accompany you.

110
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,559
But I am still sick.

111
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,160
What are you thinking?

112
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,600
I just want to stay and chat with you.

113
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:48,920
We haven't had a chat like this
for a long time.

114
00:05:52,577 --> 00:05:53,440
Qi Junye,

115
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,040
thank you for everything
you have done for my family.

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,640
We are family.

117
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:04,405
Jiang Shishi,

118
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:06,799
I love you.

119
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,799
But didn't you say

120
00:06:09,799 --> 00:06:11,959
love is the most unreliable thing?

121
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:16,160
There is nothing that is
100% reliable in this world.

122
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:17,440
I just know that

123
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,440
I want to be with you.

124
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:21,559
I want to be with you forever.

125
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,440
Maybe there is nothing I can trust,

126
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,320
but I trust you.

127
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,714
Qi Junye,

128
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:44,440
I'll ask you a question.

129
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,399
You can choose not to answer,

130
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,679
but you can't lie.

131
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,440
Was my father's death

132

your father's death

135
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,359
was an accident.

Although your dad is gone,

137
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,320
I will love you

138
