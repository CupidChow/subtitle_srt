9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,050
- You are awake.
- Qi Shuli, what do you want?

10
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,200
Don't move.

11
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:58,880
Qi Shuli, let me go!

12
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,200
What are you doing?

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,479
You can't get out of this.

14
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:03,560
Qi Shuli, you are shameless.

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,120
Let go of me!

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,160
Haven't you always missed your dad?

17
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:09,839
I will send you to his side later.

18
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:12,760
Qi Shuli, you are destroying yourself.

19
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,839
Let's do some negotiation, OK?

20
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:17,279
Negotiation?

21
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,919
He came pretty fast.

22
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,644
Don't move.

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,658
Junye.

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,879
Calm down, my dear nephew.
Where is the stuff?

25
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:38,433
Throw it over.

26
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:41,120
I know you hate the Qi family's guts.

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,279
It's impossible

28
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:45,480
for you to escape unscathed now.

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,480
I only have one request.

30
00:01:47,953 --> 00:01:48,800
You can have Jun Yue

31
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,879
and the whole Qi family.

32
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:50,825
I

33
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,879
will stay here and that's OK.

34
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,239
But Jiang Shishi is innocent.

35
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,563
Let her go.

36
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,760
Junye.

37
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,599
No matter what happens tonight,

38
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,800
we'll forget about everything.

39
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:04,480
You can have all the evidence.

40
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,399
Beg me, beg me!

41
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,090
Junye.

42
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:20,039
Unexpectedly,

43
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,000
you are such an affectionate person.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,119
My brother and sister-in-law

45
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:26,919
carefully cultivated you
for so many years,

46
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:29,600
yet you're actually doing this for a woman.

47
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,559
Throw it over.

48
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,714
Throw it over!

49
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:47,017
Step back.

50
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:51,960
Step back!

51
00:03:01,559 --> 00:03:02,759
- Shishi!
- Junye!

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,639
Qi Junye, I can't let it go like this!

53
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,839
Back then, to take the family property,

54
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:12,479
your parents ruined my life

55
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,479
so that I can never be a father.

56
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,080
I also want you to know what it's like

57
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,080
to have no descendants at all!

58
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,399
Junye, leave me and just go!

59
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,559
- Just leave me!
- I said

60
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:30,520
I would be with you forever.

61
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,080
I won't let you slip away again.

62
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:45,937
Junye.

63
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,650
Shishi, are you OK?

64
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,618
Junye!

65
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,520
Junye! Junye!

66
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,689
Junye!

67
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:03,679
Help!

68
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,442
Junye!

69
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,121
Junye!

70
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,200
Boss!

71
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,359
Boss! boss!

72
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:31,250
(Police)

73
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,760
Zhao, change his dressing later.

74
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,323
OK.

75
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,768
Doctor,

76
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:40,959
how are they?

77
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,320
The male patient
still needs observation.

78
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,640
The female patient
just breathed in some smoke.

79
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,519
She will wake up soon.

80
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:45,519
Thank you, doctor.

81
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:48,600
Now

82
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:51,239
I don't hate that scumbag
as much anymore.

83
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,279
Me too.

84
00:04:55,119 --> 00:04:56,279
I even kind of hope

85
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,559
they can reconcile.

86
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:58,799
Me too.

87
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,679
Shishi, you're awake.

88
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,519
How do you feel?

89
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,519
Junye... Junye...

90
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,079
Don't worry, he is still alive.

91
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,519
Qi Shuli has been arrested.

92
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:26,729
Easy.

93
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,313
Easy.

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,945
Junye.

95
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,519
Junye, will you marry me?

96
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:44,079
Will you?

97
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:07,119
Qi Junye,

98
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,760
let's get married, OK?

99
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,120
(Several days later)

100
00:06:31,239 --> 00:06:32,098
Here comes the groom.

101
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,880
Junye is so handsome today.

102
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,619
Congratulations!

103
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,572
Shishi.

104
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:27,119
During the time of divorce,

105
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,720
I have been thinking about something.

106
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,480
Was I too used to your existence

107
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,679
because we were too close?

108
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,079
Maybe that's why

109
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,119
I ignored the shining points on you.

110
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,440
This month of cooling-off period

111
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:45,279
gave me a chance

112
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,679
to reexamine myself carefully.

113
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:50,122
It turns out that

114
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,679
in my world,

115
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,399
love is just an added value.

116
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,279
It's more like a silent transaction.

117
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,279
Your generosity,

118
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,138
sincerity,

119
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,226
persistence,

120
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,547
kindness

121
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,914
and courage

122
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,880
taught me what love is.

123
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:12,920
That is a kind of love

124
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:17,040
that only the two of us understand.

125
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:21,000
But at that time,

126
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,559
I was so arrogant

127
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,839
and narrow-minded

128
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:27,359
that I didn't know how to cherish you.

129
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:30,880
I hope

130
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,599
it's not too late now.

131
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,393
Shishi,

132
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:38,520
are you willing to

133
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,880
become my Mrs. Qi again?

134
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:53,799
- Marry him!
- Marry him!

135
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,723
Marry him!

136
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:01,401
Qi Junye,

137
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,960
thanks to you,

138
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:06,119
I understand

139
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,559
that love is not a one-sided thing.

140
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,200
It requires mutual effort and hard work.

141
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,359
We can only love each other better

142
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,039
by becoming a better self.

143
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:24,599
Although love has made us
a little crazy,

144
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,599
it has also

145
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,400
made us happy.

146
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:34,586
Qi Junye,

147
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,559
are you still willing to be my husband?

148
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,411
Yes, I am.

149
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,000
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

150
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:48,520

151
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,760
