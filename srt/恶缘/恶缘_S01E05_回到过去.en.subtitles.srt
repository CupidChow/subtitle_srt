1
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,926
Why doesn't she just take some
fucking sleeping pills if she can't sleep?

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,012
That bitch is fucking insane.

3
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,441
She has no fucking clue.

4
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:47,172
Why do you keep
sneaking glances back here?

5
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,007
-Something fascinating?
-No, sorry.

6
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,685
Fuck. Anyway,

7
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,813
when did everything get so screwed up?

8
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,322
Was that when it all started?

9
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,452
Off you go.

10
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,415
Go someplace nice.

11
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:21,891
I can see clearly.

12
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,280
All right.

13
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,254
Where are they now?

14
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,507
Even if you go, you won't meet them.
They're on the move together.

15
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,926
So we have no solid evidence yet?

16
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,513
No, we do have evidence.
My employees are tailing them as we speak.

17
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,224
That's what you told me last time too!

18
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,769
You said you'd be finished in a week.
What's taking so long?

19
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,355
Of course, we have
solid evidence even now.

20
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:13,484
We have more than enough evidence,
but we just want to be absolutely certain.

21
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,320
Unlike other agencies,

22
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,575
we only formally notify our clients
once we have concrete evidence.

23
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,160
You can trust us.

24
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:25,914
Okay. I'm counting on you.
Please give me a call.

25
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:29,792
Yes, ma'am. Please don't worry
and get some solid rest.

26
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,306
Shit. This is nuts.

27
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,725
Bring the camera.

28
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,018
Right.

29
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,524
What took you guys so long?

30
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:54,901
Did you get some pictures?

31
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,029
Well, speak up. Did you collect evidence?

32
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,239
The thing is…

33
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,241
What?

34
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,535
Jeez, you're so frustrating!
The client just called and kept asking--

35
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,247
Boss! You need to see this.

36
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,542
So you did get photos.
Why didn't you just say so?

37
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,462
All right. Good work.

38
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:15,880
Great.

39
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,092
Hey, what…

40
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,808
I think we should hurry
and call the police.

41
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:38,152
TEN HOURS BEFORE THE FIRE

42
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,654
BASTARD

43
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,117
Is the money ready?

44
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,201
Did you sleep well?

45
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,578
I'll see you at 8:00 p.m. tonight.

46
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,290
Where?

47
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,335
If I tell you, would you even know?
You moron.

48
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:58,089
I'll send you the address,
so try to find your way there.

49
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,653
Meet me at dock two
at the Guhoe Port at 2:00 a.m.

50
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:21,988
And the money?

51
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,698
I'll pay you once I'm on board.

52
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:27,577
We'll set sail without you
if you're even a minute late.

53
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,536
Don't worry.

54
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,780
Hey, Yanbian Chink.

55
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:10,078
You could at least say hi or something.
Why just stand there, glaring at me?

56
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,412
You're embarrassing me.

57
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,717
KARMA

58
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,760
Thank you, brother!

59
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:08,678
6 MONTHS EARLIER

60
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,179
-Thank you.
-Whoa, what is this?

61
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,473
Here! Food for the body and soul.

62
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,891
-I want it after you.
-Okay.

63
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,893
And you, Toto.

64
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,856
-Homemade booze.
-This precious makgeolli…

65
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,024
And you, Jjong.

66
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,030
Treasure that. It's fucking rare.

67
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,240
Thank you, brother.

68
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,118
Anyway, how long were you in here?

69
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,453
About two years, I think?

70
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,496
I don't fucking know.

71
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:42,670
Hey, Yanbian.

72
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,840
You get out next month?

73
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,974
I hear there are many jobs
for Korean-Chinese people.

74
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:55,933
Call me.

75
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,978
There's nothing I won't do to make money.

76
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,106
You sure are one grumpy Chink.

77
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:05,902
Come out. Time to go home.

78
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,571
Yes, sir! Guys, this is all yours.

79
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,407
-Thank you, brother!
-Congratulations, brother!

80
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,366
Thanks!

81
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:30,676
We're over here!

82
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,304
Well done for hanging in there!

83
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:41,062
CHAPTER 5
REWIND

84
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,147
Excuse me. Can I bum a smoke?

85
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,607
-What?
-A cigarette.

86
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,525
Sure.

87
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,860
Congrats on getting out.

88
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,292
Whoa, now that's more like it.

89
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:11,759
What the hell?

90
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:16,180
Hey, Yu-jeong!

91
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,682
My God.

92
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:22,520
You came to pick me up?
Did you miss me that much?

93
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,189
Why are you goofing off like an idiot
outside the prison?

94
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,735
-Hurry up and get in.
-All right, let's go.

95
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,451
Did you have a job interview?

96
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,706
No. I was hustling
a fund manager in Yeouido.

97
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:46,210
He was just about to hand over the money,
but the fucking cops stormed in.

98
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,255
Didn't I tell you to always be aware
of your surroundings?

99
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,717
I guess things haven't been easy
without me.

100
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,427
You sound pissed.

101
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,722
Men are such sissies.

102
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,309
You're the only guy I know
who will stick his neck out.

103
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,811
Right?

104
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:08,691
Even back in high school,
you always said that men are sissies.

105
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:12,486
You said that's why we should use women
to give them courage.

106
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,322
Yeah, that's the universal rule.

107
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,241
All right! Let's go and check things out.

108
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:21,662
Let's see how much these fucking idiots
have in their wallets.

109
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,247
Here we go.

110
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,888
We have a new member today.
Let's give her a big hand!

111
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:43,059
Hello. Thank you.

112
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,936
I'm new here,
so please help me learn the ropes.

113
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,854
Have some coffee.

114
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,607
Yes, thank you.

115
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,528
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

116
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,988
-Yes, hello.
-I'm…

117
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,327
DOCTOR KIM NAM-JUN

118
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,704
You run a dermatology clinic.

119
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,375
Yeah, it's small, though. In Apgujeong.

120
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,542
Apgujeong, I see.

121
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,353
My little fairy, did I keep you waiting?

122
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:32,817
Who the heck are you?

123
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,197
-Who are you?
-Who do you think?

124
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,449
Honey.

125
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,121
Shit.

126
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,249
This is all I can give you now.

127
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,834
Open your credit card app.

128
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,964
See the section for loans?

129
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,966
Where? I don't see that.

130
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,259
MAXIMUM LOAN
30 MILLION WON

131
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,343

00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,430
Here! Let me show you.

133
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,684
It's right here!

134
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,311
This will show you all the loan options.

135
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,229
-See?
-Yes.

136
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,064
Here, 15 million. Select it. That's it.

139
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,402
See? It works fine.

140
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,779
What do you mean it doesn't work?

141
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:19,947
He sure is good.

142
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,491
I'll bring some ice cream for you.

143
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,371
Yeah, listen to Mommy.
She's one scary woman.

144
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:32,084
My daughter sure is pretty. All right.

145
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,588
Daddy will see you tomorrow, then.

146
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,344
-Where are you going?
-Chairman's office.

147
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,096
-You can't go in!
-I know that.

148
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,848
I said you can't go in!

149
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,434
Who are you?

150
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:51,020
Mr. Chairman, you're quite photogenic.

151
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,649
She's young enough to be your daughter.
What were you doing?

152
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,567
All right.

153
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,110
What? What are you…

154
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,155
Wait outside.

155
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:08,120
Sir. Why don't we have a cup of tea?

156
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:09,997
Quietly.

157
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,962
Why is he taking so long?

158
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,884
Old men are slow at everything, you know.

159
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:26,222
Can he even get it up at that age?

160
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,769
I can make a dead man get it up.

161
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,438
Damn.

162
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:37,566
You're so fucking cool.

Ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand…
Fifty million. Nice.

166
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,208
-Where are you going? Let's party.
-What for?

167
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,085
We should work harder.

168
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,503
What? Come on.

169
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,046
See ya.

170
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,683
Hey, handsome.

171
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,309
You came early.

172
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,020
Yeah, I had something to do in the area.

173
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,524
She sure is good.

174
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,193
So fucking diligent.

175
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:27,992
What is this?

176
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:31,787
Hello?

177
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,415
It's been a while.

178
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,334
Who's this?

179
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,003
Have you already forgotten me?

180
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,338
It's me.

181
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:42,840
Jang Gil-ryong.

182
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,008
Right!

183
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:45,926
The Yanbian Chink?

184
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:52,266
We used to sleep under the same blanket.
Hearing your voice is making me emotional.

185
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,560
What?

186
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,063
Hold on one second.

187
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:01,191
-Have you eaten?
-No, not yet.

188
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,359
Then we should order.

189
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,778
Sang-hun.

190
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,781
-Yeah?
-What do you think of me?

191
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,828
-What?
-I like you.

192
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,497
Okay, so? What's up?

193
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,961
You're not exactly the type of guy
to call me just to say hi.

194
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,715
Let's…

195
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,468
do a job together.

196
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,887
A job? Sounds good.

197
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,597
Where are you?

198
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:46,779
Get in!

199
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,502
You're looking great.
You've even grown a beard.

200
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,839
So how much is the insurance payout?

201
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,800
200 million.

202
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,595
Do you actually believe that? How naive.

203
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,265
A person's life has a market price too.

204
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,268
What kind of idiot gets insurance
for 200 million these days?

205
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:23,190
See? This is why Korean-Chinese people
get scammed left and right in Korea.

206
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:29,780
Anyway, who is this degenerate fucker
that asked you to kill his own father?

207
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,908
The red jacket over there.

208
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,748
Where? That guy?

209
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,211
Hold up.

210
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,549
That fucking prick over there?

211
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,010
Have you met him before?

212
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,679
I saw him a few times around town,
growing up.

213
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:58,142
In small towns, all the delinquents
kind of know each other.

214
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:02,730
My God, he was a total moron.
I guess he hasn't changed one bit.

215
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,524
He doesn't exactly have
a trustworthy face.

216
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,693
I know, right?

217
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,071
That's the face of a man
who'd murder his own father.

218
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,740
Think about it.

219
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,951
Someone who has no savings
and barely makes two million won a month

220
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,746
but buys a Mercedes
on a 600-month payment plan?

221
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,916
He isn't just car poor.
We call that a genuine idiot.

222
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:49,234
Do you think I can be forgiven
by doing this?

223
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,739
Brother, you are doing your very best.

224
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,535
My son committed too big a sin
for me to be forgiven.

225
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,455
I'll pray with all my heart too.

226
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:08,253
I really don't think that will be enough.

227
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,340
I think…

228
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,385
I must offer my all to God.

229
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,189
Brother!

230
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:38,450
Your birthday is this week, isn't it?
We planned a small party for you.

231
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,787
Goodness, I'm too old for parties.

232
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,748
Come with me. Everyone's waiting for you.

233
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,000
Gosh, I'll have to pass.

234
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,338
To be honest, I haven't fully recovered
from the accident,

235
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,049
and I would like to rest tonight.

236
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,385
But everyone's waiting for you.

237
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,972
I'll see you next week. Bye.

238
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,535
Oh, I forgot.

239
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,246
I should have given him his cake.

00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,847
-That's him, right?
-It's him.

242
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,391
Okay! Fuck.

243
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,784
What the hell? Shit.

244
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,415
Just die already!

245
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,726
I saw a man get out of the car and…

246
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,771
Oh no, what should I do?

247
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,321
What's he doing?

248
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,500
Hey, Yanbian!

249
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,585
Fuck. What the…

250
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,551
Holy fuck.

251
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,850
There's a witness. We need to run!

252
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,018
Wait.

253
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,395
He's not dead, damn it!

254
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,397
This geezer just won't fucking die.

255
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,694
-Grab him.
-What are you doing?

256
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:22,030
We can't leave him here while he's alive!
We need to clean up this mess!

257
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,950
How can I work with you
if you don't know shit? Pick him up!

258
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,862
YU-JEONG

259
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:07,617
Is he dead?

260
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,998
Fuck! The thing is,
the cause of death can't be asphyxiation.

261
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,587
I'll get the money from him
no matter what.

262
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,298
Take care of the rest.

263
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,520
What the fuck is he doing?

264
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,275
YU-JEONG: ARE YOU IGNORING MY CALLS?

265
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,028
Damn, this is…

266
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:47,115
THE IDIOT'S PASSED OUT ON MEDS
GET HERE NOW

267
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:04,758
Hey, Yanbian.
Let's split up here, all right?

268
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,009
I have somewhere to be.

269
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:10,013
I'll take care of the rest.

00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,321
Where the heck are you?
At this rate, he'll wake up soon.

272
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,283
Yeah, I know I should head there now, but…

273
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,077
But what?

274
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,330
Why are you dawdling?
Don't you want to make money?

275
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:39,626
Of course I want to make money.
I just have a bigger picture in mind.

276
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,004
What? What are you even talking about?

277
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:47,426
Are you drunk? Get it together, seriously.

278
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,681
Hello? Hello--

279
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,519
Seriously, do you have a death wish?

280
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:01,273
What are you doing?
We don't have time, you shithead.

281
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,232
Listen, Yu-jeong.

282
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:07,404
I have a brilliant idea.

283
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:12,325
I'm going to tell you what our plan B is.
Listen up, okay?

284
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,110
Damn, it's freezing.

285
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,491
Jeez, he's heavy.

286
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,784
This is fucking exhausting.

287
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,329
Plan B, my ass.

288
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:10,759
Jeez, fuck me!

289
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,762
Come on, old man…

290
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,351
Hey, old man. Help me out here, all right?

291
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,019
God bless you.

292
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:25,690
YU-JEONG: ON MY WAY

293
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,608
They're coming.

294
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:37,035
Whoa, shit. Jeez.

295
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:39,829
One,

296
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,832
two, three.

297
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,887
That's why things have turned
into this shitshow?

298
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,222
SIX HOURS BEFORE THE FIRE

299
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,266
I wanted to bury him well.

300
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:02,978
But that four-eyes didn't dig deep enough
because he's an amateur.

301
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:06,856
I couldn't exactly tell him I was a pro.
I was in a tough spot.

302
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,026
None of this would've happened
if you'd dealt with it quietly.

303
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,362
Why did you do something like that
with the body?

304
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,531
You told me to take care of it!

305
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:17,909
Everyone has their own way
of doing things.

306
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,663
That's enough.

307
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,958
Let's not dwell on the past.
Let's focus on the present.

308
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,335
Now all that's left

309
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,422
is to deal with that moron.

310
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:37,012
What about the money?
Are you sure it's ready?

311
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,680
If it turns out to be a lie,

312
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:43,852
I will chop off
that bastard's hands and feet, one by one.

313
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,566
I like your determination,

314
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,735
but it makes me curious about something.

315
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,155
About what?

316
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,449
Why the rush to go back to China?

317
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,994
Did you cause some sort of trouble
that I don't know about?

318
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,083
Take some close-ups of his neck too.

319
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:11,046
Take photos of all the footprints.
Be careful not to disturb the dirt there.

320
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,423
Damn it.

321
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,140
Chief.

322
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:23,933
What?

323
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,393
Look there, sir.

324
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:39,741
The rear doors look good.
Nothing wrong with the rear bumper.

325
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,452
Sir, the car's good to go.

326
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:45,789
Renting it for a day will be 120,000 won.

327
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,541
Thank you, sir.
Why don't you take a look for yourself?

328
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,542
Give me the key.

329
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,628
-Pardon?
-I said, give me the key.

330
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:52,962
Right.

331
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,526
You know this punk, don't you?
Where is he now?

332
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:28,915

Did that hurt?

336
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:14,335
That's what you get for pissing me off,
you fucking son of a bitch!

337
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:30,477
This is where we put an end
to this fucked-up bond of ours.

338
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,605
I'll go get the money.

339
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,998
Go back to the car and…

340
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,482
STOP

341
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,961
Try acting up again, you prick.

342
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,308
Get in!

343
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:10,660
Did something exciting happen?
Why were you snickering like that?

344
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,037
I just find it funny.

345
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:15,623
-What's funny?
-This situation.

346
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,587
The voice recorder.

347
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:27,635
And the money?

348
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,471
I'll give it to you there.

349
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,642
Don't fuck with me.

350
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:39,272
I'll give it to you there.
Do you have trust issues?

351
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,775
Let's go and get the money.

352
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,529
What the…

353
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,447
Jeez.

354
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,324
What did I say?

355
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,452
This is why I fucking said
I should tag along.

356
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:55,538
That idiot. He's trying to be smart.

357
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,857
All right, stop.

358
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:23,983
Come this way!

359
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,276
INSPECTION IN PROGRESS

360
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,279
-Roll down your window, please.
-Stop there, please.

361
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,405
What? At this hour?

362
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,077
Next car. Move forward, please.

363
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,329
-Forward, please.
-Thanks for cooperating.

364
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,414
Thank you for your cooperation.

365
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,332
Oh no.

366
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,293
I guess you've committed many sins.

367
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,461
Next car, please.

368
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,922
I did kill your father.

369
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,720
This way, please. Over here.

370
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,389
Son of a bitch.

371
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,225
All right, stop.

372
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,478
We need your cooperation.
Please move along. Next!

373
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:04,732
Yes, this way, please! All right, stop.

374
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,110
-Hello, Officer.
-We're conducting inspections.

375
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,450
The gentleman with the hat.
I need to see your face.

376
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,329
Yes, move along!

377
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,792
Why? Shouldn't you first tell us
what's going on?

378
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,546
Two bodies were found in Guhoe
a few days ago.

379
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:31,759
This man is the prime suspect.
If you see him, please call us.

380
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,553
Sure.

381
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,393
Wow, this bastard. Look at his eyes.

382
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,561
MURDER SUSPECT WANTED

383
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,938
He looks like a total psychopath.

384
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:48,568
-What's going on?
-Why aren't they moving?

385
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,280
Were you scared?

386
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:02,749
Damn it.

387
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,587
Registration number 175D 1487.

388
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,213
We've found the suspect's vehicle.

389
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,717
It appears he's fled to the mountains
from the Guhoe city limits.

390
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,428
Hurry and search the mountains!

391
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:20,683
Fuck. I think I'm screwed.

392
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,480
-Yes, I'm on my way now!
-Sir!

393
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,439
What is it?

394
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,193
Han Sang-hun's car was found
near the Guhoe city limits.

395
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,569
What? And the driver?

396
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:34,739
We believe he ran into the mountains.
We're trying to track him.

397
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,658
Detective Park, trace the vehicle's route
and report back to me.

398
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,077
-Yes!
-Everyone on standby.

399
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:39,994
Yes, sir!

400
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,230
What is this place?

401
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,732
I used to hang out here when I was young.

402
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,276
This place brings back many memories.

403
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,404
What do you think? Do you like this place?

404
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,282
Let me say this again.

405
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,868
You didn't do the job properly.

406
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,330
Saying you deserve the money
is just plain wrong.

407
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:28,292
Do you think I'm asking to get paid
for killing your father?

408
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,838
If I get caught, you won't be safe either.

409
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,009
Thanks. So you're worried about me?

410
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,386
If you understand me,

411
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,596
go get the money now.

412
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,200
This is where we put an end

413
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,661
to our fucked-up bond.

414
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,153
It was in the trunk?

415
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,654
Just check it.

416
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,071
You son of a bitch.

417
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:42,218
You were practicing in the parking lot.
What do you think?

418
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,470
It's not that easy, is it?

419
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,180
You fucking Chink.

420
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:08,286
Hey, where are you now?

421
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,501
This just in.

422
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:18,754
A man suspected of disposing of the bodies
of a man and woman in their thirties

423
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:23,217
in a derelict building
in Yeonri-dong, Guhoe, yesterday morning,

424
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,720
stole the male victim's vehicle and fled.

425
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:29,724
He abandoned the car and fled when he saw
police conducting roadside inspections.

426
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:34,437
The suspect has a muscular build
and is approximately 182 cm tall.

427
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,648
It is suspected that he is wearing
a brown coat and glasses,

428
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,818
and the police believe
that he is still somewhere in Guhoe.

429
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:41,777
GUHOE ON LOCKDOWN

430
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,488
-What are you doing?
-I'm totally fucked!

431
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,615
I'm fucked! Damn it!

432
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:50,995
Let's deal with this bastard first.
With money, we can find a way out.

433
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:54,415
My face is out there now!
No amount of money can help me disappear.

434
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:58,169
The China-bound boat is coming.
Once we get on that, this'll all be over.

435
00:38:58,252 --> 00:39:00,504
The area's been completely locked down.

436
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,881
We can't go there now!

437
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,215
Then what do you suggest?

438
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,343
It's not like you have a better plan!

439
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,544
Is he about the same height as me?

440
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,652
We should get going.

441
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:10,991
Why don't we…

442
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,464
You son of a bitch…

443
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,092
Whoa! Jeez.

444
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,428
Yanbian, you fucker. Chill.

445
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,806
You shouldn't underestimate
the Republic of Korea.

446
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,642
Fucking moron.

447
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,195
Sayonara.

448
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,373
You're the first one to die.

449
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,609
God, my head's killing me.

450
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:38,996
You're awake.

451
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,334
What the…

452
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:46,795
All right.

453
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,883
You wear this.

454
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,015
You… Who are you?

455
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:58,933
Me?

456
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,477
Let's see.

457
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,606
Who do you think I am?

458
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:07,233
Sorry?

459
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,530
Listen carefully.

460
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,907
I am you.

461
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,078
What are you saying?

462
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:22,122
I told you. I'm you, got it?

463
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:26,877
You're a fucking lunatic.
Hurry up and untie me.

464
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,087
Untie me, you asshole.

465
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,382
"Hurry up and untie me, you asshole."

466
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,721
You're slow to catch on.

467
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,352
I'm going to become you.

468
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:47,815
You'll become me?

469
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,400
That's right.

470
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:51,777
As of this moment…

471
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,906
I am Park Jae-yeong.

472
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:09,378
