1
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,140
We need more people on the hoses!

2
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,780
How long until the fire's out?

3
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,284
We'll have it out shortly.
The firefighters are preparing to enter.

4
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,952
Search from the left.

5
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,542
-Search the central stairs too.
-Yes, sir!

6
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,431
What the hell is this?

7
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:03,354
It's dark in here.
It's much darker inside, so…

8
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,649
What the heck?

9
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,198
Captain! We've found a survivor
in the second-floor stairway!

10
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:16,993
What's their status?

11
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,162
I saw him move. I think he's alive!

12
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,082
Excuse me, sir. Can you hear me?

13
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,460
A survivor in the second-floor stairway!
Requesting backup!

14
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,049
-Sir, hang in there.
-Coming through!

15
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,259
Hang in there. We're almost there.

16
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,887
-What's his condition?
-He's a burn victim.

17
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,555
-His oxygen levels?
-Eighty.

18
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,933
-His blood pressure?
-100 over 70.

19
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,518
-One second.
-One, two, three!

20
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,897
-Does he have a contact?
-His identity is unknown.

21
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,815
What happened?

22
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,067
A fire in a derelict building in Guhoe.

23
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,736
This was the biggest hospital nearby.

24
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,863
-I need morphine.
-Yes, sir.

25
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,908
Wait. We can't give him morphine.

26
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,910
He could go into shock.

27
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,411
The pain will be unbearable.

28
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,959
Sir, we're going to treat you now.

29
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:09,796
It's going to hurt,
but you need to stay with us.

30
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,298
Don't hold it in.
Scream if you need to, okay?

31
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,553
-Cut the clothes first.
-Okay.

32
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,638
-Please hold him down here.
-Got it.

33
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:19,806
Here's some saline.

34
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,099
-I'll cut the sleeve.
-Yes.

35
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,269
I'll get the dressings for sterilization.

36
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,298
KARMA

37
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,751
Yes, Lee Ju-yeon speaking.

38
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,505
You've already exceeded your daily dose.

39
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,508
I told you, I'm in so much pain!

40
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,843
Throwing a tantrum like this
changes nothing.

41
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:21,803
Damn it!

42
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,891
You're a doctor, aren't you?
How can you ignore your patient's wishes?

43
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,603
It looks like
you're in a lot of pain, sir.

44
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,939
Is this where it hurts? Or here?

45
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,524
Stop!

46
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:39,112
You shouldn't throw things like cups
because you're angry that you're in pain.

47
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,614
All right. You should apologize.

48
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,826
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,494
Politely, please.

50
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,413
I apologize.

51
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,748
You must've been in a lot of pain.

52
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,126
It's great that you apologized.
How nice was that?

53
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,090
If we keep giving you opioid painkillers,

54
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,427
we can't help you
if the pain gets worse later on.

55
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:06,931
It hasn't been long since your surgery.
The pain should ease in a few days.

56
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,558
And you, sir.

57
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,852
-Yes.
-You can't do that to a patient.

58
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,772
Considering the pain he is experiencing,
it's completely understandable.

59
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,151
Right, but… right here, Doctor.

60
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,361
Dr. Lee!

61
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,741
Are you all right?

62
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,075
I'm fine.

63
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,879
Excuse me, Dr. Lee?

64
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,717
It's nothing important.

65
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,803
Since I meet a lot of people,
I can notice certain things.

66
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:49,640
Your face is full of worry,
Dr. Lee Ju-yeon.

67
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,810
If you ever have a concern
or a problem that needs solving,

68
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,689
or if you need to find someone,
please give me a call.

69
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,901
Then I will… I'm sorry, one moment.

70
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,279
This is the Harmless Agency,
harmless to everyone.

71
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,531
Hwang Cheol-mok speaking.
How may I help you?

72
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,699
Give me a call.

73
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,242
Yes.

74
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,370
Yes, hello, sir.

75
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,664
Right, I was going to send you an update.

76
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,416
JEONG-MIN:
ARE YOU COMING?

77
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,672
We did our very best,

78
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,634
but we couldn't
perfectly reconstruct your skin.

79
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:28,888
We struggled more than we expected
with the wounds on the face.

80
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,934
You inhaled a lot of smoke,
so your airways are damaged too.

81
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,103
Your voice won't sound like it used to.

82
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,938
Let's see.

83
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,815
Wait, there's no name here.

84
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,817
They rushed him in as an emergency case.

85
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,151
I see.

86
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,946
I'm Park Jae-yeong.

87
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,533
Have you contacted your family?

88
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,869
I have no family.

89
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,497
Please take good care of Mr. Park.

90
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,581
Yes, sir.

91
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:06,717
What's up?

92
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,095
Let's go.

94
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,152
You saved my life.

95
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,531
Thank you.

96
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,749
Apply wrap dressings to Mr. Park
and let me know.

97
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,251
Yes, sir. Will do.

98
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,879
Should we go ahead and put him on oxygen?

99
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,589
Put in an order and monitor him.

100
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,506
Yes, sir.

101
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,470
Hey, Ju-yeon.
Why are you so spaced out today?

102
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,181
I'm sorry, sir.

103
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,850
Dr. Yoon, keep an eye on Park Jae-yeong.

104
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:57,643
Yes, sir.

105
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,571
What's with you today? Is something up?

106
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,698
It's nothing.

107
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,576
There's clearly something.

108
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,497
I told you, it's nothing.

109
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,877
Don't be like that. Just tell me.

110
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,756
I'm tired.

111
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,425
I'm heading out.

112
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,014
Hey, Ju-yeon.

113
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,743
I'm Park Jae-yeong.

This is Park Jae-yeong's chart.

120
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,462
What do you want with this?

121
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,090
I had to check something.

122
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,426
Could've asked me. Do you know him?

123
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,262
It's really nothing. Don't worry.

124
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:41,140
Hey, don't give me that.
How could I not worry?

125
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:44,518
One second.

126
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,064
Hello?

127
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,445
Right now?

128
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,115
No, I'll leave now.

129
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,409
Okay.

130
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,295
From now on, just talk to me first,
whatever the problem is. Okay?

131
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,798
I have to go.

132
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,676
Remember I told you
I have something tonight?

133
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,512
All right, bye.

00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,728
How could we take photos
inside the hotel room?

141
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:54,398
We can track them and collect
security footage along the way.

142
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,984
That should more than suffice as evidence.

143
00:12:59,028 --> 00:12:59,862
Right.

144
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,322
Of course I know.

145
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,074
In fact, I know better than anyone
how you feel.

146
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,661
I was gonna drown myself in the Han River
when I found out my wife was cheating.

147
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:10,956
Right.

148
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:12,750
Exactly, ma'am.

149
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,502
At times like this,

150
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:18,339
it's important to stay calm,
or things could backfire.

151
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,885
Anyway, we are doing things step by step,
so please trust us and be patient.

152
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,054
We'll be in touch
as soon as there's an update.

153
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,808
Yes, of course.
You can put your worries to rest.

154
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,352
My gosh.

155
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,188
You managed to find my office.

156
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:40,110
The building is a little creepy, isn't it?

157
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,656
There used to be other agencies
in this building,

158
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,741
but they all shut down due to the economy.

159
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,036
Hard work isn't enough
to succeed in this business.

You need sources and connections,
whether they're academic or regional.

162
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,126
So you used to be a cop.

163
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,796
Yes, I was a police detective
for many years.

164
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,923
I really don't mean to brag,

165
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:05,052
but when clients see that,
they know they're in good hands.

166
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,430
Would you like me to explain more
about what we do here?

167
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,685
This is the amount you mentioned.

168
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,983
Gosh, it's the full amount,
not just the retainer.

169
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,319
All right, very well.

170
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,908
How would you like me to help you, Doctor?

171
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,879
I need you to find the people here.

172
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:48,304
I want to know where they are
and how they're doing.

173
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,724
Is that all?

174
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,477
Is there a problem?

175
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,773
I feel bad for charging you five million
for such a simple investigation.

176
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:04,111
I just need you to find out exactly
where they live now

00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,071
and how they're doing.

178
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,055
We're back.

179
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:31,972
We're back.

180
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,308
So, how is she doing?

181
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,768
She's distraught.

182
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,563
We passed on the condolence money
in your name.

183
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,900
How could she be okay
when her husband died like that?

184
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:47,237
By the way, is the woman who just left
a new client?

185
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:51,617
She is,
but you guys don't need to worry about it.

186
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,993
I'll handle it myself.

187
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:53,911
Sure.

188
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,457
Hey, Detective Kang. It's been a while.

189
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,419
Have you eaten?

190
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,587
You had a burger?

191
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,507
Well, I'm just calling because…

192
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,803
I'm looking for someone.

193
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,563
Sir!

194
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,858
How's the derelict building case going?

195
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,945
The survivor's still in bad shape,
so we haven't interviewed him yet.

196
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,949
The bodies believed to belong
to the suspects were completely charred,

197
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,368
so forensics are taking a while.

198
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,161
Sorry I called when you're so busy.

199
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,373
Come on, it's your livelihood.
Of course I should help.

200
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,834
You were once my supervisor.

201
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,504
Thanks. I'll buy you a drink next time.

202
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,839
No need for a drink.

203
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,716
Visit the precinct.

204
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,760
Why do we have to meet in secret,
like you're some criminal?

205
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,931
Forget it. How could a cop
fired for bribery show up there?

206
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,018
We both know your boys took bribes,
and you just took the fall.

207
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,770
-Enough. Let's drop it.
-God, you're so cranky.

208
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,688
I'm off.

209
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,772
Wait! By the way,

210
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,900
why are you suddenly looking
for those rapists?

211
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,237
What do you mean?

212
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,905
Didn't you know?

213
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:16,201
The case shook the entire city of Guhoe
many years ago.

214
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:20,956
Well, I put a copy of the case report
in the envelope, so have a read.

215
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,043
I'm working late again today,
so I have to go. Sir!

"Park Jae-yeong, Yoo Tae-jun."

221
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,659

VICTIM DETAILS
NAME: LEE JU-YEON

224
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,130
Man, it really hurts.

225
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,491
I'm in so much pain.

VICTIM STATEMENT, LEE JU-YEON
IN THE CASE AGAINST PARK JAE-YEONG…

227
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,879
I AGREED TO A BLIND DATE
WITH PARK JAE-YEONG, A SENIOR

228
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:56,969
ON DECEMBER 10TH
AT A CAFÉ CALLED DANDELION TERRITORY

DANDELION TERRITORY

230
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,001
Sorry.

231
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:30,961
I'm late, aren't I?

232
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:34,506
I was preparing something with my friends,
and it took longer than expected.

233
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,507
It's okay.

234
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,927
Thanks to you, I got to read and relax.

235
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,888
But I asked to meet you.

236
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,558
Thanks a lot for sticking around
and waiting for me.

237
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,242
You have calluses on your hand.

238
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,287
Probably because I work out
with my friends every day.

239
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,789
It's hard to get rid of them.

240
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,542
My dad's hands were like that too.

241
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,544
Does this remind you of your late father?

242
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,839
Your hands suddenly reminded me of him.

243
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:21,053
Wait, how did you know
that my dad passed away?

244
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,263
I heard it from your friends.

245
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,390
To tell you the truth,

246
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,268
I've been quite interested in you
for a while.

247
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,864
-It must be past 10:00 p.m. Let's hurry.
-Sure.

248
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:56,630
What's that?

249
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,689
INTERROGATION IN PROGRESS

250
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,606
Get in.

251
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:16,525
Stand over there.

252
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,526
Yes, sir.

253
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,947
You punks. Stand up straight.

254
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:23,782
Hey, the camera.

255
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,453
-Is it filming?
-This is fucked up.

256
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:29,955
This is fucking cool.

257
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,748
They're the suspects.

258
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,294
I know it's hard, but please tell us
everything you remember.

259
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:36,795
Okay?

260
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,173
We'll get out soon anyway.

261
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:42,259
You, get in.

262
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,889
I fucking bolted, but fuck…

263
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,104
Why is Jae-yeong there?

264
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,982
He's a victim, just like me.

265
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:00,652
That punk, Park Jae-yeong,
is the one behind everything.

266
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,114
Just shut the fuck up.

267
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,317
It hurts so bad.

268
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:49,993
HARMLESS AGENCY

269
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,119
Dr. Lee.

270
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,579
I've looked into all of them.

271
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,206
Okay.

272
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,917
First off, Yoo Tae-jun.
After the incident--

273
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,171
Gosh, I'm sorry.
I can't help but bring up that incident.

274
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,633
No, it's okay. Go ahead.

275
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,550
All right.

276
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:09,012
After the incident,
Yoo Tae-jun kept going in and out of jail

277
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:12,224
for offenses like robbery
and sexual assault.

278
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,477
He died three years ago behind bars.

279
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,231
I think he had a hard time in jail

280
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:22,484
after the other inmates found out
he had raped a minor.

281
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,947
As for Yang Yong-seon,

282
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,909
he had quite a lot of drug-related priors,

283
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:34,413
but he died last year
of a methamphetamine overdose.

284
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,916
I never believed in karma,

285
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,210
but this makes me think
it might really exist.

286
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:49,636
And Park Jae-yeong?

287
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:52,389
Park Jae-yeong is the only one
who's still alive.

288
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:56,977
It looks like he's been living
a quiet life since then.

289
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,938
He's been wandering around without a job

290
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,066
and now lives in Paju.

291
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,193
Would you like his address?

292
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,030
I'll call you back.

293
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,259
This is Lee Ju-yeon.

294
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:33,555
The patient in room 402
needs a hydromorphone injection.

295
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,257
Shit.

296
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:13,678
Damn it.

297
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,560
Hey, Detective Kang.

298
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,980
Sir, it's almost noon.
Were you still sleeping?

299
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:26,775
You know we detectives work at night.

300
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,902
Anyway, what's up?

301
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,111
What's going on?

302
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,198
Park Jae-yeong's one of the guys
you were looking for, right?

303
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,115
ASSAILANT PROFILE

304
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,492
Yeah, Park Jae-yeong.

305
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:37,077
What about him?

306
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:40,705
Well, it turns out
that Park Jae-yeong was that guy.

307
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:41,831
"That guy"?

308
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,923
Where have you been?

309
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,592
You didn't even call me.

310
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,097
I told you the other day.

311
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:02,644
My relative wanted to be examined by me,
so I had to go to Namyangju.

312
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,440
Why do you ask?

313
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,569
Hey, no funny business.

314
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,363
What do you mean, funny business?

315
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,365
It's just a side hustle.

316
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,492
For things to work out with you,

317
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,579
I should at least own a house.

318
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,998
Shall we have a drink tonight?

319
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,086
I'd love that.

320
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,714
Anything you want to eat?

321
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,467
I'll be right back.

322
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,888
I actually meant to call you.

323
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,725
Hello, Dr. Lee.

324
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,603
I'm calling because I was mistaken
about something.

325
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,397
How should I say this?

326
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:51,693
Park Jae-yeong isn't in Paju right now.

327
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,028
What are you saying?

328
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,573
Well, I'm very sorry.

329
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:00,243
Just tell me.

330
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,414
Park Jae-yeong is literally
right next to you.

331
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,711
-You mean, in the hospital?
-How did you know?

332
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:13,006
He's an inpatient at the hospital now,
in room 402.

333
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,800
That recent fire in a derelict building.

334
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,679
The sole survivor was Park Jae-yeong,
the guy you were looking for.

335
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,543
PARK JAE-YEONG, M, 36

336
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,255
Excuse me, Doctor.

337
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,301
We're Guhoe Police.

338
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:27,557
We need to ask Mr. Park some questions
regarding the fire in Guhoe.

339
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:28,975
May we go in?

340
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,730
Sure.

341
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,329
Hello.

342
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,458
Your doctor said you're allowed visitors,
so here we are.

343
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:57,086
I'm Detective Kang Yeong-sik
from Guhoe Police.

344
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,175
Yes, hello.

345
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:06,888
It's still hard for me to speak.

346
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:11,559
You're the only one who can give us
a statement regarding the case,

347
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,311
so we have a few simple questions.

348
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,562
We'll be recording this.

349
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,401
Why did you go to that derelict building?

350
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:23,655
I never went there.

351
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:26,991
I was abducted.

352
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,375
Oh boy.

353
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:45,844
And then?

354
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:49,639
Well, when I woke up and finally came to,

355
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,976
I was inside that building.

356
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,644
Where were you exactly?

357
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,440
I was tied to a chair.

358
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,370
Could you describe the situation
in detail?

359
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,789
Two men were fighting.

360
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,258
What is this? What the hell is going on?

361
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,427
Fighting about what?

362
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,095
I'm not sure.

363
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:34,392
I guess… they were fighting
about whether they should kill me.

364
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,112
Thank you.

365
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:48,990
Then,

366
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:53,453
one of the men started pouring gasoline.

367
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:55,705
All over the place.

368
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,499
Hold up, wait! What are you doing?

369
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:12,931
Wait!

370
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:15,058
Stop!

371
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,063
Wait! Why are you doing this?

372
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,368
I don't remember what happened after that.

373
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,538
This must be hard, so thank you.

374
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,792
Since this is a criminal case,

375
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:44,587
standard procedure requires us
to confirm the victim's identity.

376
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,673
We'll be taking your fingerprints.

377
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,971
But I…

378
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,015
Do you think that will be possible?

379
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,519
What do you think?

380
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,234
Well, we'll find a way.

381
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,695
Okay, I'm sorry
I couldn't be of much help.

382
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:15,952
And one more thing.

383
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,330
Your aunt contacted us, Mr. Park.

384
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,290
She must have known you'd be alone.

385
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:24,252
She wanted to come to the hospital,
so we gave her the details.

386
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:28,673
I see.

387
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,050
-Thank you.
-All right, then.

388
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,406
Yes.

389
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:58,077
Could you please ask my doctor
to come to my room?

390
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,987
Doctor, you're here.

391
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,495
Why did you show up?

392
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,165
-Sorry?
-After everything I did to forget you…

393
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,129
Why the hell did you show up?

394
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,356
I didn't know you'd be here either.

395
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,776
You're a doctor now, Ju-yeon.

396
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,069
You've made it.

397
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,866
It's been about 20 years, hasn't it?

398
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,041
What are you doing?

399
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,548
Come sit here.

400
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,345
We should catch up on each other's lives.

401
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:29,061
You'll find it fucking amusing
when I tell you how I ended up here.

402
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,408
What the hell?

403
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,787
I've dreamed of doing this
countless times.

404
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,374
Stabbing you in the neck.

405
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:02,511
Ju-yeon.

406
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:26,118
Here, I got these
for everyone on your team.

407
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,955
You've taken such good care of me.

408
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,332
You shouldn't have. Thank you for these.

409
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:38,714
I heard you were really worried
about me last night.

410
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:42,760
Thank you for everything. Take care.

411
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,680
-Have a good day.
-Get home safe.

412
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,480
What happened?

413
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,398
Sorry?

414
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,901
Oh, Mr. Park?

415
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,070
He's going home today.

416
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:04,407
We told him we couldn't discharge him yet,
but he insisted.

417
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,534
He's going home?

418
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,412
He told Professor Lee
he wanted to be treated as an outpatient.

419
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,998
I heard he got over a month's supply
of pain meds.

420
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,000
He must really hate hospitals.

421
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,136
Excuse me, nurse.

422
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,222
My husband is going home today,
but his clothes are gone.

423
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,432
Sorry?

424
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,392
His clothes are gone?

425
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:03,799
Doctor.

426
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,346
Don't you remember me?

427
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,268
What… do you mean?

428
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,978
You really don't remember me?

429
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:19,523
You?

430
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,653
Park Jae-yeong.

431
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,907
How can you not remember me?

432
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,035
How?

433
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:49,845
Get in.

434
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,704
Don't act like you don't recognize me.

435
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,874
I, for one, know exactly who you are.

436
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,569
Don't grimace, and take a good look.

437
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,447
So?

438
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:51,949
Do you recognize me?

439
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,744
I bet you don't.

440
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,164
You've never seen this face before.

441
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,295
Listen carefully.

442
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:10,009
The Park Jae-yeong you remember
doesn't exist anymore.

443
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,143
If you don't even have the guts
to fucking look at me…

444
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,521
don't act like you know me.

445
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,597
Where to, sir?

446
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,641
-Let's go to Paju.
-Sure.

447
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:54,488
Whoa!

448
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,032
What the fuck?

449
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:00,077
Hey! What the heck are you doing?

450
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:16,302
You play pretty rough for a doctor.

451
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,178
Do you still have more to say?

452
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,598
Well, do you?!

453
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,851
I still have trouble sleeping…

454
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,522
because of you.

455
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:31,525
Okay, so?

456
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:35,863
Even if it's just one night…

457
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,700
I want to sleep well, like others.

458
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:43,829
Without any dreams.

459
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,091
Fuck, this bitch is crazy.

460
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,596
Then again, of course you'd be clueless.

461
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:04,141
-Let's go.
-Sorry?

462
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,060
I said, let's go!

463
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:06,977
Okay, sure.

464
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:32,961
But you know what?

465
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,006
I think I'll be able to now.

466
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:38,884
Because…

467
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,471
I am going to kill you.

468
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:07,199
