1
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:33,575
God, my head's killing me.

2
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,111
We need more people on the hoses!

3
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,831
How long until the fire's out?

4
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,335
We'll have it out shortly.
The firefighters are preparing to enter.

5
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,253
Search from the left.

6
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,468
-Search the central stairs too.
-Yes, sir!

7
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,891
It's dark in here.
It's much darker inside, so…

8
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,353
What the heck?

9
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,609
Captain! We've found a survivor
in the second-floor stairway!

10
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,153
What's their status?

11
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,196
I saw him move.

12
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,405
I think he's alive!

13
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,909
Excuse me, sir. Can you hear me?

14
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,544
-Sir, hang in there.
-Coming through!

15
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,712
Hang in there. We're almost there.

16
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,340
-What's his condition?
-He's a burn victim.

17
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,050
-His oxygen levels?
-Eighty.

18
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,386
-His blood pressure?
-100 over 70.

19
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,012
-One second.
-One, two, three!

20
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,392
-Does he have a contact?
-His identity is unknown.

21
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,309
What happened?

22
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,520
A fire in a derelict building in Guhoe.

23
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,231
This was the biggest hospital nearby.

24
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,358
-I need morphine.
-Yes, sir.

25
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,403
Wait. We can't give him morphine.

26
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,405
He could go into shock.

27
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,948
The pain will be unbearable.

28
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,370
Sir, we're going to treat you now.

29
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:46,291
It's going to hurt,
but you need to stay with us.

30
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,793
Don't hold it in and scream, okay?

31
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,298
-Cut the clothes first.
-Okay.

32
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,133
-Please hold him down here.
-Got it.

33
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,342
Here's some saline.

34
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,609
We did our very best,

35
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,820
but we couldn't
perfectly reconstruct your skin.

36
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:20,074
We struggled more than we expected
with the wounds on your face.

37
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,120
You inhaled a lot of smoke,
so your airways are damaged.

38
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,289
Your voice won't sound like it used to.

39
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,124
Let's see.

40
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,001
Wait, there's no name here.

41
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,921
-They rushed him in as an emergency case.
-I see.

42
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,132
I'm Park Jae-yeong.

43
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,219
Have you contacted your family?

44
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,307
I have no family.

45
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,560
I see, so you don't have a guardian.

46
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,355
Please take good care of Mr. Park.

47
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,606
Yes, sir.

48
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,574
What's up?

49
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:03,952
Let's go.

50
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,961
PARK JAE-YEONG

51
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,051
You saved my life.

52
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,347
Thank you.

53
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,862
KARMA

54
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:29,162
FIFTEEN DAYS BEFORE THE FIRE

55
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,214
THIS IS YOUR LANDLORD
YOU HAVEN'T PAID THREE MONTHS' RENT

56
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,174
Rent, my ass.

57
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,082
Man, something's gotta give.

58
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,131
ASSHOLE: CONGRATS! TODAY'S THE DAY

59
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,701
ASSHOLE

60
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,804
It's none other
than the Bentley Flying Spur.

61
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:16,144
Look at the exterior.
It's luxurious-- high-end--

62
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,812
Now, let's go inside--

63
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,148
This car could totally be yours.

64
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,985
Do you see I've made 500 million won?
This isn't a scam.

65
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,947
I was sure
I could turn a profit at this interval,

66
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,325
so I used leverage,
something like 30 or 40 times.

67
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,995
This rude-ass asshole.

68
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:37,373
It's way too early for this.
How many damn times is he gonna call?

69
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:46,340
Even if you can only invest a little,
just trust me. You will turn a profit.

70
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,309
130M

71
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,160
Sit.

72
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,961
Why aren't you answering my calls?

73
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,840
Well, I was just…

74
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,092
I think I just--

75
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,554
You little shit.

76
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,724
Sir, please.

77
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,059
"Asshole"?

78
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,352
No, I didn't mean--

79
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,604
Don't you think "asshole" is a bit rude?

80
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,606
Please, just let me explain.

81
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,774
I'm your elder.

82
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,901
Please hear me out, sir!

83
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,213
Sir.

84
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,524
How do you feel now?

85
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,694
This is why you should have believed me.

86
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,988
You wouldn't believe me,
so I had no choice.

87
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,949
-I'll pay you back.
-I had to bring you on a field trip.

88
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:38,619
Sir, I'm going to pay you back.
I'll pay you back. I will!

89
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:42,164
Of course you will. Only an idiot
wouldn't pay me back after seeing this.

90
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,084
I swear I'll pay you back
as soon as I can.

91
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,056
All right.

92
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,935
I'm giving you a month.
That's more than enough time.

93
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:06,480
If I don't hear from you
by the end of those 30 days,

94
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,024
your body parts

95
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,444
will be used to save others' lives.

96
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,155
Am I crystal clear?

97
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,199
Now then,

98
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:22,705
let's make sure
that you and I never meet again, okay?

99
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,751
I'm sorry. Thank you.

100
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,295
Damn it.

101
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:39,156
CHAPTER 1
THE MAN WITH LOAN SHARK DEBTS

102
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,424
MONEY DUE
D-29

103
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,604
That happened, right?

104
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,202
This way.

105
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,380
Hey! It fell even more.

106
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,632
Where are you going?

107
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,217
So what?

108
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,597
According to you,
it should be going up by now.

109
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,183
It's not my fucking fault
a neighbor country's at war.

110
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,852
That's not what I meant.

111
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,730
You said you'd pay me back
once your coin rises--

112
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:56,525
Something has to fall
before it can start to rise.

113
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,611
Why are you making me so uncomfortable?

114
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,906
Damn… Hey.

115
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,867
If you keep this up,
I won't pay you back even if it does rise.

116
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,368
What? Hey, man, come on.

117
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,078
Just calm down, will you?

118
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,581
For fuck's sake.

119
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,252
Stop pestering me like this.
You're stressing me out.

120
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,421
All right, I'm sorry.

121
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:23,135
-Have you eaten yet?
-No, I'll eat something now.

122
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,688
If he's dead,
he could at least let me know.

123
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,606
FATHER

124
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,649
CALLS
FATHER (5)

125
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,735
Stop causing such a scene!

126
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,321
Do you think this place runs on leniency?

127
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,406
Why are you firing me?

128
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,742
I explained it already.

129
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,537
The company isn't doing well!

130
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,581
But I didn't hear anything like that
from the others.

131
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,671
You're new, so you're still learning
how things work here, right?

132
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,214
I can't fire a veteran employee.

133
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,678
Is it because I'm Korean-Chinese?

134
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,347
You're unbelievable.

135
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,059
You, my friend,
have some twisted victim mentality.

136
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:16,188
If someone heard you,
they'd think I was a racist or something.

137
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,399
-You hear me?
-My child is very sick.

138
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:22,152
-I have to send money back home.
-That's none of my business.

139
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,197
Our inmate labor partnership
ends this month anyway.

140
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,534
We don't need you anymore,
Mr. Jang Gil-ryong.

141
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,454
I'll throw in an extra couple
of hundred thousand won as severance,

142
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,456
so don't take it personally--

143
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,834
Damn, what's with that guy?

144
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,719
You know I have no power around here!

145
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:55,978
Man, that guy's totally cutthroat.

146
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,910
Why are all of my contacts dead broke?

147
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:16,332
I sent you money two days ago.
How come you're already asking for more?

148
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,084
It's not like I'm lounging around.

149
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,298
How's the kid doing?

150
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:30,596
I'll do my best to make some more money
as soon as possible,

151
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,932
so hang in there, all right?

152
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,561
Fucking chink.

153
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,615
KOREAN-CHINESE TATTOO

154
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,454

00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:58,707

AND TRADEMARK HAND TATTOO

156
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,640
FATHER

157
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,104
Why didn't you answer my calls?
This is urgent, damn it!

158
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,731
I need some money. Quickly.

159
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,195
Yes? That's me.

160
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,280
Who is this?

161
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:34,952
You're from where?

162
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,746
PAJU TO GUHOE

163
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,678
GUHOE, THE CITY OF HAPPINESS

164
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,179
Oh boy.

165
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,872
Where's Park Dong-sik, the patient?

166
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,583
You'll find him to the left.

167
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,144
You sleeping?

168
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:45,564
Are you asleep?

169
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,570
Do you even know
what your son's going through right now?

170
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,447
How can you sleep?

171
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,076
Excuse me.

172
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,538
Could I please talk to you for a minute?

173
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,165
Why?

174
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,917
It won't take long.

175
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,838
Your father suddenly jumped
in front of my car.

176
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,715
I tried my best to avoid him, but…

177
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,385
You saw him, so you'll know.

178
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,263
I barely hit him. It was a slight bump.

179
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,189
Fully loaded with a petrol engine.
This is a top-notch trim.

180
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,316
Do you like cars?

181
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,069
What if I do?

182
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,030
I was just…

183
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:38,951
Trust me, I'm not saying I'm innocent.

184
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,161
I feel horrible about what happened.

185
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,959
Whether you're repenting or not
doesn't really matter.

186
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,878
Will your insurance handle it?

187
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,632
Actually, that's why
I wanted to talk to you.

188
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,884
The truth is,
I can't make an insurance claim.

189
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,638
I was hoping we could settle this
between ourselves.

190
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,894
Is that so?

191
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,898
Well, my father is quite old.

192
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:10,816
-You know?
-Right.

193
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,610
And it obviously wasn't a fucking bump.

194
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,653
It was a slight…

195
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,449
Even if that's true,
you hit a man with a car.

196
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:23,579
A few X-rays and some physiotherapy
aren't going to magically heal him.

197
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,206
No, of course not.

198
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,042
I know that better than anyone.

199
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,717
Here. Take this.

200
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,185
It's five million won.

201
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,195
It's three million.
It's more than I expected.

202
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,614
So he's someone you know?

203
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:02,701
We used to be close a long time ago.

204
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,579
He's not doing great financially,
so I agreed to settle.

205
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,916
Times are hard.
There's no point in making matters harder.

206
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,085
How come he drives a luxury imported car
when he's struggling?

207
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:16,632
How come everyone you know
is a total disaster?

208
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:21,053
Driving an imported car
doesn't mean you're rich. It's all debt.

209
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,806
Can't you hang out with people
who have their shit together?

210
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,728
What happened to your face?
Did you get into another fight?

211
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,605
It's complicated.

212
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:34,691
Why are you still
messing around like that at your age?

213
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,402
If you get yourself in trouble again,

214
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,530
I'll make sure
that you and I are both dead.

215
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,531
Seriously.

216
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,659
Cut it out, okay?

217
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,204
Has the IV given you newfound energy?

218
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,544
Go home and bring me
some clothes and toiletries.

219
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,629
Can I…

220
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:57,756
Let me borrow this.

221
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,425
I need money urgently. Okay?

222
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,929
Come on, help your son out.

223
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,889
I'll pay you back!

224
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:06,974
Are you okay?

225
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,312
-How did you know I was here?
-You didn't show up to the cathedral.

226
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,189
I got worried and called you,

227
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,608
but a nurse here answered your phone.

228
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,861
It was just a minor bump.
I'm totally fine.

229
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,281
My goodness.

230
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,243
You know how to have fun, huh, Dad?

231
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:32,416
I was wondering
why my rent hadn't been paid in months.

232
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,918
So this is where money goes.

233
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,004
What?

234
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,883
You can date, but nothing more.
Don't make things complicated later on.

235
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,428
We'll talk later.

236
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:51,143
I'm so very sorry.
I didn't raise my son properly.

237
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,401
How did it go?

238
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,278
You're all good now.

239
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:05,991
Thank you so much.
Thank God you're young and understanding.

240
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,244
All right, then. Take care.

241
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:11,705
Hold on.

242
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,250
Yes?

243
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,423
-What are you doing?
-I smell alcohol.

244
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,842
Sorry? What are you saying?

245
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,886
Come on, don't play dumb.

246
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,346
You were drunk driving.

247
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,431
You reek of alcohol.

248
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,392
Let's not drag this out, shall we?

249
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,103
Another three million,

250
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,357
and I won't tell anyone
that you were drunk.

251
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,193
There's an ATM over there.

252
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,362
Goddamn it.

253
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,615
Should I report you, then?

254
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,373
Wait here, then.

255
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,317
What's the passcode?

256
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,903
-Your mom's birthday and mine.
-What?

257
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,908
Your mom's is on the fifth,
and mine's on the 12th.

258
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,202
Nice number.

259
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:39,960
On your way here, stop by the cathedral
and make a donation.

260
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:43,255
What? Why?
Are you made of money or something?

261
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,883
Should I tell him we're not settling
and call the police?

262
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,385
Okay, fine.

263
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,098
My old man sure is sharp.

264
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,477
Too sharp for his own good.

265
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,643
Neat!

266
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,737
DONGHWA LIFE

267
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,616
INSURANCE CERTIFICATE

268
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,423
IN CASE OF DEATH
BY MOTOR ACCIDENT OR DISEASE

269
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,091
500 MILLION WON TO IMMEDIATE FAMILY

270
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:31,404
If I don't come up with something,
I'll be dead in a month.

271
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,661
Five hundred million
would solve all my problems.

272
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,332
I can't just wait around
for my old man to die.

273
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,544
I'd be the one to croak first.

274
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:52,509
If that idiot had run him over properly,
I wouldn't be stuck in this predicament.

275
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,177
This is stressful as fuck.

276
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,764
Excuse me, sir.

277
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,313
Could we ask you a favor?

278
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,650
Can you buy us some cigarettes?

279
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,530
What a day.

280
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,664
Guhoe High hasn't fucking changed a bit
since I was there.

281
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,166
It's still writhing with delinquents.

282
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,086
So you're a Guhoe High alumnus.

283
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,797
Then we should ask you more politely.

284
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,966
Please buy us some cigarettes, sir.

285
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,721
Sure, I'll give you some. Here.

286
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,391
Go buy some for yourselves, you brats.

287
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,018
Fucking ridiculous.

288
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,562
It's cold, so go home.
You'll catch a cold.

289
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,276
If someone politely asks for a favor,

290
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,362
it's fucking rude of you to just take off.

291
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,323
What? "Fucking"?

292
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,826
Do you pricks have a death wish?

293
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,704
I already have too much on my mind,
you fucking bastard!

294
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:06,416
Come here.
I said, come here, you little fucks!

295
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:09,669
If you can't buy them,
figure out a way to steal!

296
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,046
Fuck you, moron!

297
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,132
Come here, you little bastards.

298
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,597
For fuck's sake.

299
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,770
This motherfucking neighborhood!

300
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:45,288
HOW TO AVOID INHERITANCE TAX
ON DEATH BENEFITS

301
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,834
Fucking moron!

302
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:52,504
He's probably dead.

303
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,881
Are you dead? Does it hurt?

304
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,257
Go on. Search him.

305
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,678
It's all right.

306
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,263
Hey, I found it.

307
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:03,223
Damn.

308
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,307
Fuck, man!

309
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,433
Whoa, score!

310
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:09,646
Look. You told us to steal,
so we did, sir.

311
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,399
-Wait, hey!
-Why?

312
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,901
Holy shit! It's a Rolex.

313
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,446
-Fuck.
-Come on!

314
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,990
-Hand it over.
-No.

315
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,409
What do you mean, no?

316
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,285
Fuck.

317
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:29,999
For fuck's sake.

318
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,503
Fucking persistent.

319
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:35,714
What is this shit?

320
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,550
Underwear? What a loser.

321
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,135
Come on. Let's go.

322
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,553
Hey, wait up!

323
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,539
MONEY DUE
D-28

324
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:59,547
How can someone possibly be left
in the street unconscious for hours?

325
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:03,510
People rarely use that alley.
It's hard to even find witnesses.

326
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,596
What about security cameras?
There must be some cameras.

327
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,848
Actually, there are no cameras
in that area.

328
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,100
What? There are cameras
everywhere these days.

329
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:14,729
We don't have cameras installed
in every alley and street in the country.

330
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,606
Our budget's limited.

331
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,401
Where does all our tax money go, then?

332
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,908
Why are you getting up?
Just stay lying down.

333
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,703
Where are you going?

334
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:35,250
Is there anything you remember
about the attacker?

335
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,251
No, nothing.

336
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,813
Hey, I found it.

337
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,314
Fuck, man!

338
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,319
You told us to steal, so we did, sir.

339
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,711
Actually, there are no cameras
in that area.

340
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:24,090
We don't have cameras installed
in every alley and street in the country.

341
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,884
Our budget's limited.

342
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,930
Hey, do you remember that guy
who was fired the other day?

343
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,557
-What?
-The Korean-Chinese guy.

344
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,516
Who?

345
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,728
You know, the one with a mean face.

346
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:38,104
Right, Mr. Jang Gil-ryong.

347
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,314
That's him.

348
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,317
Can you find out his address for me?

349
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,902
Why all of a sudden?

350
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,987
Please, just find out for me!

351
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,031
Okay. Why are you yelling--

352
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,922
LEASE AGREEMENT

353
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,386
Have you got it?

354
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,028
Fuck, you scared me.

355
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,075
Do you know what they're eating?

356
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,579
They take car parts
from junkyards in Korea

357
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,707
and sell them to people in Yanbian.

358
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:24,544
I guess they made good money today,
since they're feasting on beef.

359
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,130
Leave unless you're here to sell.

360
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:32,010
I don't really like it
when strangers poach on our turf.

361
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,765
Hey, Jang Gil-ryong.

362
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,562
Don't you know me?

363
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,106
We used to work together.

364
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,110
I guess you don't know me.

365
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,990
Why are you here?

366
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,868
I heard you need a lot of money.

367
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,328
Want a job that pays big?

368
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:04,500
Just get the job done,
and you can earn a small fortune.

369
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:07,962
How much are we talking?

370
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,298
Sixty million.

371
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,176
I like the sound of that.

372
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:16,012
Really? I hope you'll like the job too.

373
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,432
Go on and tell me.

374
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,184
What's the job?

375
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,938
I need you to kill someone.

376
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,963
Who would I need to kill?

377
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:54,717
My father.

378
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:04,018
Every Friday, my old man
goes to this cathedral in Guhoe.

379
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,023
To get to the cathedral,
there's an alley you have to walk through.

380
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,067
Deal with him in that alley.

381
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,444
I just need to kill him? That's it?

382
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,156
It needs to look like an accident,
not a murder.

383
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,325
Otherwise,
I'd be first on the suspect list.

384
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:21,828
So what do I do?

385
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,540
Wait in the alley, and when he shows up…

386
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,626
run him over.

387
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,672
If I deliberately run him over,

388
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,465
isn't that also murder?

389
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,802
There are no cameras in that alley,

390
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:40,388
so the police won't know
if it was deliberate.

391
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,723
A car accident is just that, an accident.

392
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,641
A hit-and-run.

393
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:48,521
The insurance payout is 200 million.
I'll give you a 30% cut, so 60 million.

394
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,524
That's what you'll get for the job.

395
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:56,195
Once the job's done, you take the money,
pack your things, and go back to China.

396
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,322
End of story.

397
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:04,996
How can I trust you?

398
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:12,253
All right, look.
I was recording this entire conversation.

399
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,300
We're in the same boat now.

400
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:33,232
You're hiring me to kill your own father?

401
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,404
Does that bother you?

402
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,448
No.

403
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:42,950
I actually like it.

404
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,332
It tells me that I can trust your plan.

405
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,466
Please try not to squint.

406
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:08,976
I'll give you a week's worth of medicine.
Come back to see me next week.

407
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,937
This will scar badly, won't it?

408
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,147
The gash wasn't big,
so it'll be all right.

409
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,887
I'll assist you with the payment.

410
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:52,186
Including the wound care,
your total comes to 9,000 won.

411
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,188
I'll get your prescription. Please wait.

412
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,499
Here you go.

413
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:38,691
HAVE YOU GONE NUTS?

414
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,951
Fuck, man.
Do I seem like a nice person to you?

415
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:54,999
Like you said, we're in the same boat now.
Don't get mad at me.

416
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,251
How did you find me here?

417
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,171
Didn't you see that night?

418
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,049
Many of my hometown friends are here.

419
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:09,972
Didn't I tell you that we're not to meet
until this whole thing is over?

420
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,560
I thought we should have
this conversation in person.

421
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,938
What the hell are you talking about?

422
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,984
I did some research, you see.

423
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,820
Turns out your insurance payout
isn't 200 million won.

424
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,783
30% of 500 million is 150 million.

425
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,078
Isn't that the amount I should be getting?

426
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,462
It doesn't matter how much I'm getting.

427
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,090
You agreed to do it for 60 million.

428
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:48,260
Don't be like that.
Partners should trust one another.

429
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,056
If you don't want me to do the job,
just say so now.

430
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,933
We can just call off the deal now.

431
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,359
It's tomorrow night.

432
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,194
Got it?

433
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,280
Get the job done quietly,

434
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,699
and I'll come find you.

435
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:17,331
With your money, 150 million.
A 30% cut of the 500 million.

436
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,252
You'd better not be lying to me this time.

437
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:26,257
If you lie to me again,
who knows what might happen to you?

438
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:30,719
The moment you kill my old man,
I'll be a murderer too.

439
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,515
I like that temper of yours.

440
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:36,851
Wait for the good news.

441
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:41,313
Fucking chink.

442
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,483
150 million?

443
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:49,405
Do you think I'm mad enough
to give you 150 million, you chink?

444
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,664
I forgot that I had a question.

445
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,501
What will you do tomorrow?

446
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,461
Me?

447
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,589
I plan to be very fucking busy tomorrow.

448
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:09,675
Hey, it's me.

449
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,761
I'll come later with a friend.

450
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:16,223
We'll be there around 8:00 p.m.
8:30 p.m. at the latest.

451
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,226
All right.

452
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,403
Hey!

453
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,030
Get in here!

454
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,823
-Hello!
-Yes, hello.

455
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,660
My goodness, what's gotten into you?

456
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,746
You're offering to buy me drinks?

457
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,956
You talk as if I never fucking buy.

458
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,833
Well, you haven't recently.

459
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,128
I'm indebted to you for many things,
you know.

460
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,882
-Let's have some meat. It's been a while.
-Great, let's dig in.

461
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:53,093
I ordered pork belly,
but you can order some beef.

462
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,303
Eat all you want.

463
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,013
All right, sounds good.

464
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,348
Let's see.

465
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,645
Bravo.

466
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,398
It'll burn. Hurry up and eat.

467
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,527
What's their temperatures?

468
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:11,695
Did you give them meds?

469
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,365
How come the kids are all sick?

470
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,491
-All right
-Let's go.

471
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:17,243
Let's go for round two.

472
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,870
I'm really sorry, but I have to get home.

473
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,330
What? So suddenly?

474
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:23,666
My wife's home with the kids,
and they're sick.

475
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,834
-Come on, let's go.
-I really can't!

476
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,921
I booked us girls at the karaoke bar.
You can't back out now!

477
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:32,216
I want to go, too,
but you know my wife wears the pants.

478
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,134
-Don't go yet.
-Thanks for dinner.

479
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,886
See you at work. I'm sorry!

480
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,096
Chang-seop!

481
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,769
Damn it. That idiot's never helpful.

482
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,694
This complicates things.

483
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:54,446
You're leaving already, hon?

484
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,448
I'm so sad to see you go.

485
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,285
I have to get going. I really do.

486
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,078
-You should stay.
-Hey!

487
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:04,623
You girls will remember me, right?

488
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,667
Of course we will. You gave us a huge tip.

489
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,420
You have to remember me.
I gave you a huge tip, okay?

490
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,130
-Sure. Come again.
-Okay.

491
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,756
-I'll come again.
-Goodbye.

492
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,092
-All right, see you.
-Get home safe! Bye!

493
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:18,846
Crap.

494
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,068
Order number 58!

495
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:35,112
-Here.
-Thanks.

496
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:38,824
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

497
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:09,897
Order number 60.
Your bulgogi burger combo is ready.

498
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,653
A shrimp combo
and one cheese stick, please.

499
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:29,041
Hello? Can I order?

500
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,589
Here's the shrimp combo and cheese stick!

501
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:43,389
Order number 62,
your takeout order is ready.

502
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:46,517
All right, let's drive this baby now.

503
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,520
I'm going to go fast and furious
on the road today.

504
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,330
Damn.

505
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,377
He didn't go to the restroom once.

506
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,716
Even so, I still think these finishes

507
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,763
aren't good enough
for a watch that costs 15 million.

508
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:51,558
Even taking into account inflation,
maybe it would be worth 10 million.

509
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,019
The steep price tag just isn't justified--

510
00:46:58,774 --> 00:46:59,942
Hello?

511
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,658
All right, okay.

512
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:09,451
I heard you!

513
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:12,079
The credit card payment isn't due
until next month!

514
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:15,499
Jeez.

515
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:19,336
However, according to IWC,
the value of this iconic watch…

516
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:24,716
Nice.

517
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,135
-It's lunchtime. Let's eat!
-Guys, let's eat!

518
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,805
-Hey, come on.
-Let's finish up after we eat.

519
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,766
How come there aren't any jobs these days?

520
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,154
HIT-AND-RUN ACCIDENT IN GUHOE

521
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,781
NO SEARCH RESULTS

522
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,117
Stupid fucking chink.

523
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,578
Doesn't he know how to use a phone?

524
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:09,761
Hello?

525
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:12,681
Hello, this is Chief Park In-seok
of the Giyeon Police.

526
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,310
I need to talk to you
concerning Mr. Park Dong-sik.

527
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,645
You are his son, are you not?

528
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:20,981
Yes.

529
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,567
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news,

530
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:26,361
but your father has passed away.

531
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:32,659
We need you to come here to confirm
that it is him and collect the body.

532
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,996
Are you sure that it's my father?

533
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:39,583
We'll fill you in on the details
when you get here.

534
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,378
Okay, I'm coming now.

535
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,293
Father.

536
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:26,880
Dad.

537
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,130
Father.

538
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,648
I'm sorry, Father.

539
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,609
I'm so sorry.

540
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,217
Oh boy.

541
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,061
What happened to him?

542
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:08,273
It appears
he was in a car accident last night.

543
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:14,446
Who did it?

544
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:16,782
Where's the bastard now?

545
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:23,038
We just launched the investigation,
so we don't have any suspects yet.

546
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:26,666
You don't have any suspects?
So you haven't caught them?

547
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,836
-I'm afraid not.
-Aren't you a cop?

548
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,839
What do you even do
if you can't catch a hit-and-run driver?

549
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:36,009
Security cameras
are everywhere these days!

550
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,804
Yes, that's true, but in this case…

551
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,810
Listen. This accident,

552
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:50,357
I don't think it was a simple hit-and-run.
I think someone deliberately hit him.

553
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:55,570
"Deliberately"?

554
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:58,698
That's right. We have a witness statement.

555
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,368
After the car first hit your father,

556
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,912
the driver didn't brake
but actually reversed,

557
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:08,291
as if they wanted to make sure
that your father was dead.

558
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,466
Witness? There's a witness?

559
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,010
That's what the witness said?

560
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:20,387
Yes.

561
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,144
Just a moment.

562
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:30,188
When I was making the call
after witnessing the accident,

563
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:32,774
a man got out of the car
and started following me.

564
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:36,027
It was dark,
so I couldn't really see his face, but…

565
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,530
She must be the witness.

566
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:42,868
Yes. She went to the same cathedral
as the victim.

567
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,383
Just now…

568
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:05,682
I saw… a man get out of the car, and…
Oh no, what should I do?

569
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:20,780
We'll take your statement in a bit.

570
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,950
Let's go to the morgue first,
so you can confirm the wounds.

571
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,035
Okay.

572
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:25,952
This way, ma'am.

573
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,056
Oh dear.

574
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,559
Excuse me, officer.

575
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:54,272
In any case, it was a car accident, right?

576
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:55,941
That's for sure, right?

577
00:53:57,067 --> 00:54:00,070
I mean, it had to be.
I'm sure it was just a hit-and-run.

578
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:02,864
My father never wronged anyone

579
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:05,700
or did anything
to make someone deliberately hurt him.

580
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,994
He lived an honest life.

581
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,542
There's something more important

582
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:18,255
than the witness statement
that makes us think it wasn't an accident.

583
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:23,635
The victim of a simple car accident
wouldn't be found buried underground.

584
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,638
Sorry?

585
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:28,848
Your father was found in the mountains.

586
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:31,601
Someone buried him there in secret.

587
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:46,700
My goodness, are you all right?
Sir, please calm yourself.

588
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,119
Wait a second. I'll get you some water.

589
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,812
That son of a bitch.

590
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:21,985
What have you done? You bastard.

591
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:48,756
