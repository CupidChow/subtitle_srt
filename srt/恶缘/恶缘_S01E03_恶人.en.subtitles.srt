1
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,225
I've always seen these things
at Korean medicine clinics.

2
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:18,560
Did you buy it at a shop?

3
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,437
Shoot.

4
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:26,359
Or is it custom-made?

5
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:28,153
How did you find me?

6
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:30,947
Well,

7
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:34,743
I saw your clinic business card.

8
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:39,748
You left it on your car window.

9
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,958
"Clinic director Han Sang-hun."

10
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:48,173
I guess I exerted myself
more than I realized that night.

11
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,175
My shoulders really hurt.

12
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,719
Maybe acupuncture could help.

13
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:58,391
Since you're a doctor of Korean medicine,
you must be skilled in physical therapy.

14
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,809
What are you playing at?

15
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,191
I did a lot of thinking that day,

16
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,069
and…

17
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:16,451
it… suddenly occurred to me.

18
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,664
"No matter how I look at it,
this is wrong."

19
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,543
How could a human
possibly do such a thing--

20
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:28,838
So what? Are you saying
you'll report it to the police?

21
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,509
I couldn't do that.

22
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,594
I gave you my word.

23
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,013
I even received a modest sum for it.

24
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,181
So?

25
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,016
So?

26
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:44,979
I was thinking…

27
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,031
I'd like another 30 million.

28
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,336
KARMA

29
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,928
Father.

30
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,265
Dad.

31
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,744
If I get busted, I'm totally fucked.

32
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,162
Get a grip.

33
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,164
Keep it together.

34
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,249
If I get busted, I'm fucked.

35
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:39,510
I need to verify where you were
on the day of the incident.

36
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,513
Right.

37
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,350
We can talk later
if this isn't a good time for you.

38
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,144
No, now's fine.

39
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,480
Let's just do it now.

40
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:56,152
Where were you
on the evening of the accident?

41
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,530
That evening?

42
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,370
Well, I had dinner with a friend of mine.

43
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:08,331
Then I went to a karaoke bar.

44
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,626
I went to the karaoke bar alone.

45
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,922
My friend suddenly had to head home.

46
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,800
I didn't notice anything strange.

47
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,929
He didn't sing.
He just talked, but that was about it.

48
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,765
-Said he wasn't in the mood to sing, no?
-Yeah.

49
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:30,853
He also said he'd come more often
and gave us a huge tip.

50
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,606
NOVEMBER 10, 22:50
VISITED A 24-HOUR LOTTERIA

51
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,360
Have you seen this man?

52
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,487
He was here last week.

53
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,364
How long did he stay?

54
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,993
He had a burger
and pretty much stayed the whole night.

55
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:48,413
But how did you remember him right away?

56
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:52,250
-Sorry?
-Well, you must get a lot of customers.

57
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,211
It's interesting how you remembered him
from just a photo.

58
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,213
I guess you're right.

59
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,342
I don't know. I just remembered him

60
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:02,885
somehow.

61
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:08,975
DONGHWA LIFE

62
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,643
-Hello. How may I help you?
-Hello.

63
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,439
I'm here to collect my death benefit.

64
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,149
Oh, right.

65
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,527
My father died in a hit-and-run.

66
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,654
-I see.
-Number 48!

67
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,247
Please give me a moment.
I'll assist you shortly.

68
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,334
Will it be paid out today?

69
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:39,047
The case is still being assessed.
I'll assist you further shortly.

70
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,049
-Should I wait back there?
-Yes.

71
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,427
Thank you.

72
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,930
Next, number 50!

73
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,408
FUCKING CHINK

74
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,244
Number 53!

75
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,173
Excuse me, miss.

76
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,299
Yes, sir?

77
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,509
Is it still not done?

78
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,094
I'm sorry, sir.

79
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,471
Could you please wait a little longer?

80
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,389
What?

81
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,891
I'm number 46. Right now, it's…

82
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,811
Number 68? Please have a seat.

83
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:38,981
Bye, I'm off.

84
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,274
Have a good evening.

85
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,734
Take care.

86
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:45,947
Hello, sir?

87
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,741
Got it. Thank you.

88
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,161
Number 46?

89
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,291
We've kept you waiting for so long.
We'll assist you right away.

90
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,640
I've been waiting for three hours.

91
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,392
Shouldn't you at least apologize?

92
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:17,562
My apologies.
The assessment took longer than expected.

93
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,440
Sorry we kept you waiting.

94
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,357
You…

95
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:24,902
Here.

96
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,992
It's five million won.

97
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:40,251
CHAPTER 3
THE UNRIGHTEOUS

98
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,006
It doesn't look like
we can pay this out now.

99
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:45,923
Sorry?

100
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:51,137
We've investigated this internally
and checked the police report.

101
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,973
We can't pay this out right away.

102
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,433
Why not?

103
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,810
We don't yet know
if this was a simple accident

104
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:03,316
or if someone deliberately
killed your father for the insurance--

105
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,567
"Someone"?

106
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,360
"Someone"?

107
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:11,574
Don't get me wrong.
I didn't mean it the way you're thinking.

108
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,868
We need to get the facts straight.

109
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:17,538
The contract makes it sound like
there's an immediate payout upon death.

110
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,706
You won't pay me now?

111
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,167
I'm not saying we won't pay it out.

112
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,295
My father contributed for ten years,
and you won't pay me?

113
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,298
What I'm saying is,
we need a thorough evaluation.

114
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,384
There's nothing wrong with this legally.

115
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,553
This is standard procedure for claims.

116
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,138
You could just sign off on it!

117
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,475
Are you trying to fuck me over
with this bullshit?

118
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,354
You're rather foul-mouthed,
and you're being rude.

119
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,396
So what?

120
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,774
Should I call the police?

121
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,526
The police?

122
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,904
If you keep rushing us like this,
it will only cause more delays.

123
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,451
Also, don't you think I'd be more inclined
to help you if you were more polite?

124
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,413
Okay, you're right.

125
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:04,210
-I'm sorry. I got a little too worked up.
-Right.

126
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,547
I just lost my father,
so I'm not in my right mind.

127
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,631
Right, of course.

128
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:13,553
And about that day at the hospital,
I was rude to you.

129
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,637
I apologize.

130
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,806
Don't worry about it.

131
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,933
Please take good care of this.

132
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:22,395
See how nice it is
now that you're talking so politely?

133
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,689
Politeness begets politeness, you know?

134
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,483
Hold on one second.

135
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,281
It's our company's 30th anniversary.

136
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,117
We're giving this to our clients
to show our appreciation.

137
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,287
Don't forget to take this,
and I'll be in touch.

138
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,750
I'm in a bit of a rush.
Please take good care of it.

139
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,836
Don't worry. Take care.

140
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,846
Damn it.

141
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,653
GUHOE FUNERAL HOME

142
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,722
MONEY DUE
D-16

143
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,683
A big one's coming.

144
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,604
A huge sum.

145
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,524
Mr. Park? One moment, please.

146
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,402
Yes?

147
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,906
We haven't received your deposit yet.

148
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:03,663
We need a deposit to provide meals
and ensure the funeral proceeds smoothly.

149
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:05,748
Sir?

150
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,918
Get in.

151
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,176
CONDOLENCE BOX

152
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,722
-Use this.
-Sorry?

153
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,933
Take this money as the deposit.

154
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,226
Bring that box back.

155
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,436
Okay.

156
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,110
What are you doing?

157
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,487
What do you think? I paid the deposit.

158
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,615
If you don't like what you see,
pay up, Auntie.

159
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,119
It's not like you'll pay.

160
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,958
-Was it a good turnout?
-You know your father lived a quiet life.

161
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,377
Damn, the funeral will cost quite a bit.

162
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,755
Don't you know
why your father lived like that?

163
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,927
You're the reason he lived like a hermit
and did nothing but volunteer at church.

164
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,055
I'm exhausted. That's enough, okay?

165
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,684
All right.

166
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,062
We shouldn't do this in front of him.
Let's drop it.

167
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,441
There's a guest inside. Go and say hello.

168
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,027
Who is it?

169
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,071
How would I know? He's your guest!

170
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,348
What the hell are you doing here?

171
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,809
You weren't answering your phone,

172
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,562
and you didn't even come home.

173
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:55,858
I had to see you,
so I had no choice but to come here.

174
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,111
You shouldn't be here.

175
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:05,034
You shouldn't be here
as the chief mourner either.

176
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,961
Stop stuffing your face and come with me.

177
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,184
Hey.

178
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,979
Did you think I'd be intimidated
if you showed up like this?

179
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,898
That's none of my business.

180
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,652
I did my job, so I should get paid.

181
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:40,653
"Paid"?

182
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:44,740
Are you asking me to pay you
after how badly you fucked up?

183
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,077
All I did was kill him, as you told me to.

184
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,372
Then you should've left him there
as you were told.

185
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,375
Why did you have to move the body
and fuck everything up?

186
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,753
Why complicate things by moving him
and burying him on a mountain?

187
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,130
I'll be the first one they suspect,
you bastard!

188
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,508
He was alive.

189
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:04,844
What?

190
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,638
He was still alive, and he saw my face.

191
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,432
And?

192
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,518
Must I describe the entire process?

193
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,900
When you do these jobs,
you always run into unexpected variables.

194
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,904
But the amount that was promised
can never be a variable.

195
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,156
Otherwise…

196
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,327
someone else could get hurt.

197
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,328
Do you get me?

198
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,292
Don't touch me, you fucking chink.

199
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,554
Wait in the alley,
and when he shows up, run him over.

200
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:53,183
-Turn it off. I said, turn it off!
-If I deliberately run him over…

201
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,185
There are no cameras in that alley.

202
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,272
Have it ready by the end of the week.

203
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,816
I'll give this to you then.

204
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,868
How could he hire someone
to kill his own father?

205
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,829
Savage motherfucker.

206
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,542
WELCOME TO PAJU

207
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,177
Had a good day?
I see you're having a feast.

208
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,513
-There you are.
-What took you so long?

209
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,682
I had to take care of something.

210
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,892
Let me go get changed.

211
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,936
All right, man. Guys, let's eat.

212
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,820
I'm seeing her next week.

213
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:14,074
Hey, seriously? For real?

214
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,493
Man, you've still got it.

215
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,289
Drinks are on you if it goes well.

216
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,332
-Go get us more booze.
-All right.

217
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,225
Can I borrow your lighter if you have one?

218
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,690
Sure, why not?

219
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:48,544
Just now, weren't you in the junkyard
where my buddies work?

220
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,755
Why are you leaving without saying a word?

221
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,550
Well, I…

222
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,596
I need an auto part,
so I wanted to know the price,

223
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,765
but you seemed to be done for the day.

224
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:03,934
Where's your car?

225
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,395
Right, my car…

226
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:12,901
It won't start 'cause of the missing part,
so I obviously couldn't drive here.

227
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,117
I'll come back another time.

228
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:24,955
Hey.

229
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,679
Don't forget your lighter.

230
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,184
Next time, I'll call before I--

231
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,402
Did that degenerate motherfucker send you?

232
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:44,159
CIVIL SERVANT BAEK JI-HUN
NATIONAL POLICE

233
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,443
FUCKING CHINK

234
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,404
What is this?

235
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,157
He was trying to steal my voice recorder.

236
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,285
I couldn't just let this prick
sneak out like that.

237
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:09,202
Wait.

238
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:13,332
So you're saying you killed a cop?

239
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,625
What the hell were you thinking?!

240
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:20,797
Don't forget that recorder has you on tape
asking me to kill your father.

241
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,345
I'm going back to China tomorrow.

242
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,804
So?

243
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,932
Have the money ready by then.

244
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,392
Have the money by tomorrow?

245
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:37,022
The insurance might not even pay me.
How could I have the money by tomorrow?!

246
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,650
You said you'd give me a week.
Now you want it by tomorrow?

247
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,819
Did you not see the photo?

248
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,823
I'm not sparing you
because I'm incapable of killing you.

249
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,784
You have until tomorrow.

250
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,412
If you want to live,
get the money ready immediately.

251
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,832
Hey, wait. Jang Gil-ryong?

252
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,210
Fuck!

253
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,553
That fucking bastard.

254
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,959
You're asking to get whacked.

255
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,338
You will die on this soil.

256
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,719
This is vengeance for my father.

257
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,434
It suddenly occurred to me.

258
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,770
"No matter how I look at it…

259
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,773
this is wrong."

260
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:06,111
How could a human
possibly do such a thing--

261
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:09,406
So what? Are you saying
you'll report it to the police?

262
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,076
I couldn't do that.

263
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,162
I gave you my word.

264
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,581
I even received a modest sum for it.

265
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,748
So?

266
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,169
I was thinking…

267
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,426
I'd like another 30 million.

268
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,179
What?

269
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,306
I've been racking my brain,

270
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,933
and that only seems fair.

271
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,936
Give me another 30 million,

272
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,272
and I'll be off your mind for good.

273
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,565
You have my word.

274
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,466
I'll send it to you this week.

275
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:13,512
I knew I could count on you. Thank you.

276
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,597
But I can't give you any more.

277
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:19,518
Yes, I am fully aware
that this is your limit, sir.

278
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,978
Shall I write down my bank account--

279
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,605
It'll be in my recent transfers.

280
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,689
Right, of course.

281
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,109
Sorry for taking up your time
when you're busy.

282
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:29,945
I'll be off, then.

283
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:35,867
Sir?

284
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,037
Stay strong, sir!

285
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,585
You work so hard.

286
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,046
I brought you some pastries and cake.

287
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,881
Thank you.

288
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,634
Are you a friend of Dr. Han's?

289
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,345
Yes, we recently became close.

290
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,390
He's so easygoing and very generous.

291
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,101
Always willing to give to those in need.

292
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,563
He may not look it,
but he has a tender heart.

293
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,691
-I know.
-I didn't even offer you coffee.

294
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:10,443
-Would you like something to drink?
-No, I'm good.

295
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:12,070
I have somewhere to be.

296
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,489
I'll come back another time.

297
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,116
Feel free to visit us anytime.

298
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,450
Thank you. Take care.

299
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:22,789
Fuck!

300
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,809
Yes, hello?

301
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,853
Mr. Han Sang-hun, right?

302
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,313
Yes, speaking.

303
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,565
We're finished with the repairs.

304
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:59,409
The damage was worse
than I'd initially thought.

305
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:02,621
-It must've been a serious accident.
-Water deer are pretty big.

306
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,623
You hit a water deer?

307
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,293
Yes.

308
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,006
I'll settle up.

309
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,467
That's strange.

310
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,093
It really was a water deer.

311
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:22,766
It's just that the hood was dented,
but the front bumper was totally fine.

312
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:26,186
If you hit something running towards you,
the bumper is usually damaged.

313
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:34,027
Then again, water deer can jump,
so I guess this could have happened.

314
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,862
Anyway, I'll go run the card.

315
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,470
Sir, what are you doing?

316
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,597
Excuse me, sir?

317
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,684
Can't you see that we're sorting this?

318
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,853
Seriously. Will you please stop?

319
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,070
Please.

320
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,262
There.

321
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:00,822
Fuck, this isn't it.

322
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,496
Hold on, Yu-jeong.

323
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,499
Don't you want it?
I think this guy down here likes it.

324
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:15,420
Yu-jeong, there's a rest stop coming up.
Let's do it there.

325
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,005
But I want to do it now.

326
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,410
It fell from above.

327
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,208
The body fell from above.

328
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,544
Somewhere above… Fuck! It fell from above.

329
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:00,423
It fell from above.
It fell from fucking above!

330
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,304
How did it fall from above?

331
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:09,224
Above?

332
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,024
Hold on.

333
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,694
Fucking hell. Maybe this is it?

334
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:54,978
That motherfucker!

335
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,022
SANG-HUN

336
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,120
I thought you didn't want us
to stay in touch.

337
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,913
That bastard orchestrated everything.

338
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:17,166
-What do you mean?
-The accident that night.

339
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,627
That crazy bastard staged the whole thing.

340
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,379
What are you saying all of a sudden?

341
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,881
I didn't hit a walking man.

342
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:26,092
That bastard pushed him off the overpass.

343
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,095
You're not making sense right now.

344
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,139
I just checked my dashcam.

345
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,810
I knew something was off about him.

346
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,062
Now this fucking asshole
wants 30 million more?

347
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,273
Does he think I'm a fucking half-wit?

348
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,358
So what should we do now?

349
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,569
We can't even report him.

350
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,489
I'm reporting him.

351
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,407
What?

352
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:53,369
Ultimately, I didn't kill that man.
I'd only have to pay a DUI fine.

353
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,204
But you buried him.

354
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,582
I'll say that bastard
threatened me to do it.

355
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,169
Who do you think the cops will believe?
A murderer or a doctor?

356
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,466
I just need you to talk to them.

357
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,844
Then we'd be in the clear.

358
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,140
All right.

359
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:19,270
Let's go to the police station together.
I'll help you.

360
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:22,690
Thanks, Yu-jeong. For real.

361
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,443
I'll come to you now.

362
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,029
Okay.

363
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,489
Come on, get in.

364
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,242
I'm too scared to get in that car.

365
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:17,996
All right, fine.

366
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,819
So this jerk orchestrated everything?

367
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,738
He's totally out of his mind.

368
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:12,341
Hey, I didn't know you smoked.

369
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,804
That means he was there,
prepared to do this.

370
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,893
He must have been waiting
on that overpass.

371
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:26,064
But don't you think it's odd?

372
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,234
-What is?
-How did he know that we'd drive by?

373
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,654
Obviously, he didn't know that.
We were just unlucky.

374
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:36,991
You think so?

375
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,202
Of course. What else could it be?

376
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:43,081
You and I were the only ones
who knew we'd be driving by at that time.

377
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,425
Hey.

378
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,594
Four-eyes.

379
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:02,850
Who taught you
to whine and ask women for money?

380
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,644
You call that being a man?

381
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,981
-What?
-Fuck! Your breath stinks.

382
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:14,070
Can't you talk
with your damn mouth closed?

383
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,448
Why do you look so surprised?
How fucking annoying.

384
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:22,495
Hey.

385
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,914
Look at this.

386
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,583
See these numbers?

387
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:31,170
They're all messages from guys
begging to buy me drinks in Apgujeong.

388
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,175
Do you think someone like me would want
to hang out with a loser like you?

389
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,969
What a fucking moron.

390
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,764
Fuck.

391
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,309
-What did you say?
-Fuck.

392
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:46,269
-Hey!
-What?

393
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,771
-Who the fuck are you?
-Got a death wish?

394
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:49,772
Hey.

395
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,649
Did you think I really liked you?

396
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:52,859
-Let go.
-Do you?

397
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:56,237
You fucking bitch, you're all plastic.
Do you want me to fucking end you?

398
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,157
Run your fucking mouth again.

399
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:03,828
Go on!

400
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,666
Die!

401
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,217
What the hell?

402
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,678
Come on, sir. That's enough.

403
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,474
You motherfuckers!

404
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,439
Hold it tight
so I don't smell his bad breath.

405
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,778
That disgusting creep. So annoying.

406
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,038
That's gross!

407
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:50,666
He looked like a gullible dumbass,
so I thought he was a moron.

408
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,585
He could have really fucked us over.

409
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:57,590
This is why people in our line of work

410
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,842
must be careful until the job is finished.

411
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,262
Fucking loser.

412
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:07,099
The issue now
is where we should dispose of him.

413
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:10,895
True. We can't go back to Mt. Chowol.

414
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,146
No, we can't.

415
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:20,780
Let's just take him to our hometown.
To that quiet place you know so well.

416
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,448
The place I know?

417
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,121
Right, that place.

418
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,415
Sounds good.

419
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,127
-All right, let's go.
-Let's go!

420
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:11,706
Why can't I catch a break these days?
I guess it's just not my year.

421
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:15,251
You always run into unexpected variables
when you do these jobs.

422
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:22,258
You keep saying the right things,
which isn't like you, you know?

423
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,136
I've been reading some books.

424
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:27,555
Something funny?

425
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:32,810
They say that when someone
acts out of character, they'll soon die.

426
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,437
Who the fuck said that crap?

427
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,564
Hey, that's a load of crap.

428
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,860
Now we're talking.
That's more like you, you know?

429
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,323
What are we going to do with this?
Just bury him?

430
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:47,366
This thing here?

431
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,869
Yeah, we should.

432
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,788
As you know, I'm not the type
to kill with my own hands.

433
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:56,000
Besides, I'm sure he'd prefer to live
a few more minutes.

434
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,210
Sure. Do whatever you want.

435
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:03,257
We'll make it seem like he disappeared
after getting threats over gambling debts.

436
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,844
Did you get that from a book too?
What are you reading?

437
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,638
Yu-jeong, you've gotten smarter.

438
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,806
Fuck you.

439
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,268
Let's listen to some music.

440
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:19,231
Wow.

441
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,317
That's heavy stuff.

442
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,692
Hey, it's still here. Who knew?

443
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:06,404
Right? How long has it been?

444
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,946
What are you doing? Come on out.

445
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:50,906
You want me to dig too?

446
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,450
Women can pick up a shovel too.

447
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,286
We need this done before sunrise. Get out.

448
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,746
I just got my nails done today!

449
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,039
Get out. Take this.

450
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:00,875
Get out now.

451
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,587
For fuck's sake.

452
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,005
Hurry.

453
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,342
I can't believe I have to dig a hole
in the middle of the night.

454
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,395
Wow.

455
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,899
It's been so long.

456
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,735
This brings back old memories.

457
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,695
What a crazy bitch.

458
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,073
What are you doing? Get over here.

459
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,784
Come on. Hurry.

460
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:40,414
All right, take a look here.
This is where his head will be.

461
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,709
From here all the way to here.
His legs will go here.

462
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,878
We have to dig a long hole. Got it?

463
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:46,795
Show me.

464
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,386
You're good.
You should do it all by yourself.

465
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,851
Dig properly.

466
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,984
Damn, I can't do this anymore.

467
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,238
Do it by yourself.

468
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:15,032
We have to finish digging
before he wakes up.

469
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,825
Come on, we've dug enough.

470
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,577
We need to dig deeper. I would know.

471
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,538
Just a bit more!

472
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,666
We're not digging a king's tomb.
That's enough!

473
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:24,583
It's not.

474
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,669
Dig out these stones.

475
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,005
-Almost there!
-You'll strike oil at this rate.

476
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,507
Stop cracking jokes and dig!

477
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,509
Give me a cigarette.

478
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:37,596
-Just hurry up and help me, okay?
-I want a cigarette!

479
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,350
Okay, let's have a smoke.

480
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:48,732
Thank you.

481
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,736
This is not easy.

482
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,697
You said you needed to dig more.

483
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,533
What the fuck are you doing?

484
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,451
I'm fucking exhausted.

485
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:05,207
Hey, that pit totally suits you.

486
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,001
Bitch, you're fucking insane.

487
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,168
That's your grave.

488
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,425
Let's finish this up.

489
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,594
After everything I did for you.

490
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,596
You keep talking nonsense.

491
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,308
You fucking snake!

492
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,020
You're laughing?

493
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,955
Fucking bitch!
I bet you thought I was a complete moron!

494
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,723
Do I still look like
a fucking moron to you?

495
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,808
Stupid bitch,
you didn't even go to college.

496
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:10,022
I'm way out of your league.
How dare you run your mouth!

497
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,523
You fucking bitch!

498
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,944
Fucking whore.

499
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,326
Shit.

500
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,122
-You little fuck--
-Wait!

501
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,334
Just let me go now,

502
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,836
and I'll give you
another 30, no, 50 million.

503
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,801
-Then send the money now.
-Now?

504
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,220
I can't right now,

505
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,139
but I'll take out a loan!

506
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,641
You little shit.

507
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,936
Fuck.

508
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:53,816
Who do you think you're fooling?
You prick, you were going to report me!

509
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:56,985
No, I won't! I swear I won't report you.

510
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,280
I won't report you. Please don't kill me.

511
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,410
You literally snapped
that tiny girl in half, and what?

512
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:07,371
You're asking me to spare you?
You fucking joker.

513
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:11,625
I got too emotional!
I just couldn't control my anger.

514
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:15,170
I'm not in my right mind now. Please…

515
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,882
Please don't kill me.
I'll give you more money--

516
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:25,973
Let's not overcomplicate things.

517
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,934
Let's just keep this nice and simple.

518
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,527
Fucking hell.

519
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:40,904
You motherfucker.

520
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,801
For fuck's sake.

521
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,054
Damn this son of a bitch.
I don't have time for this!

522
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:46,804
LEE YU-JEONG

523
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,722
-We won't get caught.
-Let's eat it on the way.

524
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,224
Didn't you say you're on a diet?

525
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,559
-I did, but--
-Yeah, you said that.

526
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:53,852
Are you Lee Ju-yeon?

527
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,772
Yes, I am.

528
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:58,982
We're from the media club.

529
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:02,653
We're making a promotional pamphlet
for the school festival.

530
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:06,782
We'd love to have you on the cover.
What do you think?

531
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,285
-Hey, that's awesome.
-It's so cool.

532
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:13,163
You'd be the face of our school.
We could make a great cover.

533
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:16,208
Weren't you meant to be
on the cover of the pamphlet?

534
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:21,046
She acts shy,
but that bitch sure gets what she wants.

535
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,048
That fucking bitch.

536
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:38,856
Congrats.

537
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:40,983
You look pretty on the cover.

538
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,401
Thanks.

539
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,864
I heard we were the two final candidates.

540
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,409
It would have been me
if they hadn't picked you. Too bad.

541
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:51,368
Really?

542
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,371
You would've done a much better job.

543
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,290
I felt really awkward.

544
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,793
Well, that's not what's important now.

545
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,795
What are you doing this Saturday?

546
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,423
I don't have any special plans. Why?

547
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:06,717
-Do you want to go on a blind date?
-Blind date?

548
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,051
After seeing this,

549
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,554
all the boys are pestering me
to set them up with you.

550
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:13,974
I told them you're in my class,
and they're hounding me.

551
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:19,396
Come on! Don't let me down, Ju-yeon.

552
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:25,736
Just come. Meet me at the café downtown
at 4:00 p.m. this Saturday.

553
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,321
Wear something nice.

554
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:31,992
You should date like everyone else.

555
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:33,660
What are you, a loser?

556
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,581
Okay, let's do it.

557
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:39,708
Great.

558
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,605
Have fun, boys.

559
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:21,458
Who are you?

560
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,882
Why are you doing this to me?

561
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,894
Please let me go.

562
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,832
Don't!

563
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,593
NEUROSURGERY LEE JU-YEON

564
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,526
Fucking bastards.

565
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:55,130
