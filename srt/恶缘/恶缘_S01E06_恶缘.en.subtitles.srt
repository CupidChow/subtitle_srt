1
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,639
Hey!

2
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:16,808
Fuck!

3
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,602
You can't just leave me here!

4
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,187
Aren't you the little fighter?

5
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:24,691
Fucking hell.

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,944
Hey, you! Hey!

7
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,780
You bastard! Untie me now.

8
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,282
What the hell are you doing?

9
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,242
What is that bastard doing?

10
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,878
You're in on it
with that Yanbian bastard, aren't you?

11
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,213
-With that Korean-Chinese.
-What?

12
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:50,091
Fuck, man. Is that even important now?

13
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,970
Fine. I'll give you the money.
I'm telling you that I'll pay you.

14
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,389
The insurance claim review
is taking longer than expected.

15
00:00:56,473 --> 00:01:00,101
It'll be sorted within a month.
No, I'll have it sorted in a week.

16
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,686
Hey, think about it.

17
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,105
You need me alive to get the money, right?

18
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,283
I guess the car rental facility
filled the gas tank to the brim.

19
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,827
I had a hard time carrying it up here.

20
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,412
Don't kill me.

21
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,289
Stop this.

22
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,708
-I said stop!
-Hey!

23
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:27,212
Show some respect, punk.
Don't push your luck.

24
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:30,173
I graduated three years before you.

25
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,549
Guhoe High!

26
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,427
My apologies, sir.

27
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,346
Please don't kill me.

28
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,849
You were a moron back then,
and you're still one now.

29
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:40,809
Think about it.

30
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,894
Given the current situation,

31
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,687
do you really think

32
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,773
I'd do that for you?

33
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:56,366
Please don't kill me!

34
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:06,918
Somebody help me! I'm in here!

35
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:10,713
Fire! There's a fire here!

36
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,132
-Nice and warm.
-A fire!

37
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:16,886
There's a fire!

38
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,930
Right, the Yanbian Chink is over there.

39
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,100
Put out the fire, you lunatic!

40
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,434
Shut up, you idiot!

41
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,315
How are you doing in there?

42
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,209
I've done nothing wrong.

43
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,797
That Korean-Chinese guy…
It was all his fault, sir.

44
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,007
Come on.

45
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,178
I get that you're desperate,
but that's just a blatant lie.

46
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,229
Please, I'm begging you. Please…

47
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,189
Off you go.

48
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,708
I'll live for both of us.

49
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,432
Fucking hell.

50
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,025
I should live an honest life.

51
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,645
Shit, I'm stuck.

52
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:09,976
Excuse me, sir.

53
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:12,979
Don't mind me.

54
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,440
Let's go.

55
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,942
It's not that.

56
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,277
We're here.

57
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,910
KARMA

58
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:29,824
Hey!

59
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,701
What the heck are you doing?

60
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,257
You play pretty rough for a doctor.

61
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,134
Do you still have more to say?

62
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,386
Well, do you?

63
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:53,181
I still have trouble sleeping

64
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,141
because of you.

65
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,068
Fuck, this bitch is crazy.

66
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,197
Let's go.

67
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,945
Do you know that patient, Park Jae-yeong?

68
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,740
In life…

69
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,536
have you ever hated someone?

70
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,332
Enough to want to kill them.

71
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,586
What's this about?

72
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,422
We've all met someone like that in life.

73
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:11,551
Someone…

74
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,013
who turns you into someone you're not.

75
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,350
Is Park Jae-yeong that someone for you?

76
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,192
No.

77
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,237
Don't worry about it.

78
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,739
I must have been mistaken.

79
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,161
I've been feeling a little down lately,

80
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,248
so I'm just saying what comes to mind.

81
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,920
It's nothing.
You don't need to look so worried.

82
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,631
You sure you're okay?

83
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,676
Yeah, I'm fine.

84
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,180
Don't you need to do your rounds soon?

85
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,599
You should get going.

86
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:04,353
Yeah, I should head back inside.
It's chilly, so don't stay out too long.

87
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,354
See you.

88
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,148
Goodness. Look at the state of this place.

89
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,166
This must be it.

90
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,752
Moron.

91
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,754
What a crazy jerk.

92
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,842
That bum really fucking drank this?

93
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,345
It's wine.

94
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,704
Motherfucker.

95
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,289
He used it as an ashtray…

96
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,720
Park Jae-yeong.

97
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:05,725
"Eight, seven, zero, eight, two, three,
one, two, one, eight…"

98
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,604
"Eight, seven, zero, eight, two, three,
one, two, one, eight, five…"

99
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,689
Park Jae-yeong.

100
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:16,068
Eight, seven, zero, eight,
two, three, one, two…

101
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,947
Eight, seven, zero, eight,
two, three, one…

102
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:35,004
CHAPTER 6
KARMA

103
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:51,061
NARCOTICS LOCKER

104
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,847
Dr. Lee. I was just about to call you.

105
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,225
I saw that you just sent me
three million won.

106
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,061
That's all I have at the moment.

107
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,105
Why all of a sudden? Did something happen?

108
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,692
I need you to…

109
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,655
do something for me.

110
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,407
I see. You should've just told me.

111
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,077
If it's a simple job,
I could do it for free.

112
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,787
Anyway, how can I help you?

113
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,917
It's not an easy request, but…

114
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,148
INSURANCE MANAGER

115
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,496
Yes, Park Jae-yeong speaking.

116
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,207
Hello, Mr. Park. How have you been?

117
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:39,128
Yes, well, I gave my father
a good send-off.

118
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,256
How about you? Have you been well?

119
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,716
Me? Same old, you know.

120
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,261
Anyway, I called to let you know…

121
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,178
Yes.

122
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,891
…the death benefit from your father's
accident has been paid out.

123
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,608
Right, well,

124
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,568
my father, he…

125
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,656
Thank you. So… the deposit's been made?

126
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,619
Or should I send you my bank details?
I have a new account.

127
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,997
Well, the thing is…

128
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,415
-Yes?
-Gosh, it's…

129
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:21,045
The thing is, there's a bit of a problem.

130
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,798
-A problem?
-I'm not sure how to tell you this.

131
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,552
A week before Mr. Park,
I mean, your father, passed,

132
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:31,263
he changed the beneficiary
on the insurance policy

133
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,099
from you to someone else.

134
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:38,896
He left a will without you knowing,
so we couldn't check it beforehand.

135
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,692
I think you'll have to contact
the beneficiary who received the money

136
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,236
and try to figure things out with them.

137
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,573
-Fuck.
-There's nothing we can do now.

138
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,992
Sorry it ended up like this.

139
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,579
Whoa, shoot! Oh dear!

140
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,373
-Oh no! This is…
-Hey! What the fuck?

141
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,500
-For fuck's sake!
-Oh no. It's everywhere.

142
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,919
What should we do?

143
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,963
-This coffee, it's…
-Leave it.

144
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,882
-Coffee stains are tough to get out.
-I said leave it.

145
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,509
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

146
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,636
-I'm sorry--
-I told you to fucking drop it!

147
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,181
Well, I'm sorry. Sorry about that.

148
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,352
Excuse me!

149
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,189
I think you dropped this. Here.

150
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,248
-You booked a ride to Guhoe, right?
-Yeah, let's go already.

151
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,165
All right.

152
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,703
GUHOE CATHEDRAL

153
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,464
Where are they?

154
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,674
Where is everyone?

155
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,011
Where are you fucking hiding?

156
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,514
You stole my insurance payout.
Where the fuck are you hiding?

157
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,186
Come out.

158
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,229
Get the fuck out here!

159
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,525
Before I wreck this place.

160
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,990
You must be Brother Park Dong-sik's son.

161
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,159
So it's you?

162
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,535
You pocketed it?

163
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,540
Then you must know why I'm here, right?

164
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:08,837
Before your father passed,
he told me that you'd visit after he died.

165
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,964
I guess the two of you really hit it off.

166
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,050
Your father was a good man.

167
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,260
A man of great character.

168
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,387
A man so good that he caused this mess?

169
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,475
You should respect your father's decision.

170
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,602
Don't talk to me about fucking respect!

171
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,898
Stop talking shit and just hand it over.

172
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,526
You're a complete stranger.

173
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,445
It would be wrong of you
to keep the payout, wouldn't it?

174
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,155
Don't you agree?

175
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:37,908
I can't do that.

176
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:39,743
What?

177
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:42,246
He asked us
to spend the money on the cathedral

178
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:45,082
and the patients
at our convalescent hospital.

179
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,543
It was entirely his decision, and…

180
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,339
Look, Sister.

181
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,136
Do I look like I have time
to play word games with you?

182
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,097
Do I? I'm a patient too.

183
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,683
I am.

184
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,562
So give me my money
while I'm asking you nicely.

185
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,356
My money that my father gave you!

186
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,952
I'm certain that my son
won't accept the situation.

187
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,496
He might even cause a scene.

188
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:30,043
However, I trust there will come a day
when he repents for all his sins.

189
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,088
I assure you that I am fully coherent
and mentally sound

190
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,382
as I am recording this.

191
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,641
This is bullshit.

192
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,520
This fucking father and son, seriously…

193
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,206
You. What are you doing here?

194
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,666
Why are you here?

195
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,461
Are you stalking me?

196
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,297
Is that it?

197
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,635
You must be a total wacko.

198
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,387
All right, fine.

199
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:26,058
Let me hear it.
What the hell did I do to you?

200
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:27,643
Go on.

201
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,063
Come on, tell me. I'm genuinely curious.

202
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,320
If you don't have the guts to say it,

203
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,740
just forget it and move on, okay?

204
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,827
Those fucking eyes…

205
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,438
Shit.

206
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,566
I'll see you again!

207
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:40,424
Just wait. I'll make you cough it up
one way or another.

208
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,371
Fuck, my head hurts.

209
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:37,689
Fuck.

210
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,086
Shit.

211
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,642
Did that fucking geezer put a curse on me?

212
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:23,860
Fucking hell.

213
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,458
This bitch is seriously off the rails.

214
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,099
Hey, creepy lady.

215
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,476
Okay, all right.

216
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,895
I admire your persistence,

217
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:04,568
so I'll tell you the truth
for the first time in my life.

218
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,485
Listen up.

219
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:10,657
The truth is,

220
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,618
I'm not Park Jae-yeong.

221
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,829
Park Jae-yeong is already dead.

222
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,458
Why would I lie to you?

223
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,668
I don't even know who you are.

224
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:26,882
You were yelling in the church,
demanding your father's insurance payout.

225
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,925
Park Dong-sik's son…

226
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,053
Park Jae-yeong said that.

227
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,264
No.

228
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,641
That was…

229
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,438
This is all so fucked up.

230
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,028
That was because…

231
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:52,574
Well, there was a fucking reason
for all that.

232
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,451
Got that? Are we fucking good now?

233
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:56,870
Fuck.

234
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,249
You haven't changed one bit.

235
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,419
You're the same.

236
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,174
Back then and even now,

237
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,010
you're the same son of a bitch.

238
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,348
You fucking bitch!

239
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:21,102
I'm not him! Okay?

240
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,104
I'm not him.

241
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,317
I fucking told you I'm not him.
What about it

242
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,361
don't you

243
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:31,863
fucking understand?

244
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,366
Park Jae-yeong is already…

245
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,201
Damn it.

246
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,351
You have to die for this to end.

247
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,069
Ju-yeon.

248
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,994
How did you find me?

249
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,371
Stay back!

250
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,874
-Don't come any closer.
-What are you trying to do?

251
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,459
It's none of your business.

252
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:28,920
Leave.

253
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,839
Don't do this, Ju-yeon.

254
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,924
If you do this, you'll lose everything.

255
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,178
Doctor.

256
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,851
I fucking swear I don't know anything.

257
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,687
I don't care.

258
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,777
I know everything.

259
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,158
I know what happened to you.

260
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,578
What do you mean?

261
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:02,996
I asked someone I know

262
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,832
to find out who Park Jae-yeong was.

263
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,627
I needed to know

264
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,630
why you were acting strange
and saying weird things.

265
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:14,966
I'm sorry.

266
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,556
Then you really shouldn't stop me.

267
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,186
-Don't you understand why I'm doing this?
-I do.

268
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,147
I want to kill him myself
in the most brutal way.

269
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,315
Can't you see?

270
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,777
Think about everything you've endured.

271
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,823
You shouldn't ruin your life
over scum like him.

272
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,034
Hear me out. I…

273
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,998
Let's go, Ju-yeon. Please?

274
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,829
What a colorful life you live.

275
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,457
Dr. Lee Ju-yeon.

276
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:02,949
This face…

277
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,997
I'll remember this face.

278
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,597
Where the fuck did they go?

279
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,532
Fucking hell.

280
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,959
This shithole of a neighborhood.

281
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,963
UNCLE

282
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:49,931
Hello.

283
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:52,767
Now?

284
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:55,937
I can't right now.

285
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,857
Okay, I'll call you.

286
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,116
Is something wrong?

287
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,913
A relative of mine is sick.

288
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,835
Then you should go.

289
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:22,922
I can go tomorrow.

290
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,800
Let's stay together tonight.

291
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,472
If they're sick,
you should tend to them now.

292
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,308
You should go.

293
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,394
Still…

294
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,023
I'm fine.

295
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,650
Go take care of them.

296
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,254
GUHOE MURDER SUSPECT'S DNA NOT FOUND

297
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,465
GUHOE DERELICT BUILDING
ARSON-MURDER CASE REPORT

298
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,637
DERELICT BUILDING AFTER THE FIRE

299
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,808
We have to report
to the higher-ups tomorrow. Get on it.

300
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,436
You should go home, sir.
I'll finish this up.

301
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,188
Don't worry about me. Drink up.

302
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,273
Perfect, thank you.

303
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:25,902
And then?

304
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,988
Well, when I woke up and finally came to,

305
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,032
I was inside that building.

306
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,367
Where were you exactly?

307
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,411
I was tied to a chair.

308
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,247
Could you describe the situation
in detail?

309
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,167
Two men were fighting.

310
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:42,710
Stop.

311
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,171
Go back.

312
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,135
When I woke up and finally came to,
I was inside that building.

313
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,053
FLOOR PLAN

314
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,347
Where were you exactly?

315
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,517
I was tied to a chair.

316
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,186
Hang on.

317
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,938
He was tied to a chair?

318
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,361
And the victims' identities?

319
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:11,990
The thing is,
the bodies were completely burned.

320
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:15,076
Forensics say a full DNA analysis,
including dental comparisons,

321
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,704
can take anywhere
from two weeks to over a month.

322
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,872
Where's Park Jae-yeong?

323
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,560
Please open.

324
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:12,925
What the…

325
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,580
Whoa, shoot! Oh dear!

326
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:45,792
-For fuck's sake!
-Oh no. It's everywhere.

327
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,920
What should we do?
Coffee stains are tough to get out.

328
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,172
-I'm sorry--
-I told you to fucking drop it!

329
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,049
Well, I'm sorry. Sorry about that.

330
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:00,264
Excuse me!

331
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,725
I think you dropped this. Here.

332
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:08,022
This bitch is fucking out to get me.

333
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,459
That fucking bitch.

334
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:40,680
Yes, Park Jae-yeong speaking.

335
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,932
I'm Detective Kang Yeong-sik
from Guhoe Police.

336
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:43,891
Are you at home?

337
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,187
Yes, I am. Why?

338
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:53,067
We need to interview you as a witness.

339
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,194
Can you come to the station now?

340
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,326
It's quite late.

341
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,162
I'll go tomorrow.

342
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,124
He's home.

343
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,084
-Hit the gas.
-Yes, sir.

344
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:28,895
Fuck!

345
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,116
Park Jae-yeong.

346
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:01,844
GUHOE HIGH SCHOOL

347
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,430
The fuck is this?

348
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,367
LEE JU-YEON
1ST YEAR, CLASS 3

349
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,973
-Nice, bottoms up!
-You're here.

350
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,267
Fucking hell.

351
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:52,895
What's going on?

352
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,648
Why does the queen of Guhoe High
look so upset?

353
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,192
At school…

354
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,655
there's a bitch who's getting
on my fucking nerves.

355
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,073
There is?

356
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,075
Who is she?

357
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:14,041
It's her. I'm trying to figure out
how to teach her a fucking lesson.

358
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,376
"Lee Ju-yeon"?

359
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,461
Never heard of her.

360
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,089
She's a nerd, so you guys won't know her.

361
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,843
She's fucking pretty.

362
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,179
Do you want to deal with her?

363
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,433
Come on. I already graduated.

364
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,559
I couldn't.

365
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,061
Besides, I've been to juvie,
so I need to lie low.

366
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:39,525
Then what am I supposed to do?
For fuck's sake.

367
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:42,111
There must be plenty
of horny pricks at school.

368
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:46,157
-Toss her their way.
-They're too young for such a big job.

369
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,159
Fuck.

370
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,370
Hey, Yu-jeong.

371
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,748
The thing about men

372
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:57,043
is that they'll find some courage
if they can have a girl.

373
00:38:57,543 --> 00:39:00,379
Throw her out there,
and they'll swarm like hungry dogs.

374
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,454
Shit.

375
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,502
Mr. Park Jae-yeong.

376
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:42,922
Hello? Mr. Park Jae-yeong.

377
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,757
For fuck's sake.

378
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,300
Mr. Park Jae-yeong!

379
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,971
Step aside.

380
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,001
Hey, Detective Choi. Look at this.

381
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,547
Pain reliever.

382
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,091
We have a DNA sample
from Park's rented vehicle, right?

383
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,801
Yes, we have the analysis report.

384
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:31,595
-Good. Call Forensics here now.
-Yes, sir.

385
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,141
Once we compare the samples,
we'll know if he's the same person.

386
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,738
AIRPORT BUS
ARRIVING SOON

387
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,429
Oh boy.

388
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:29,195
"Congrats. Today's the day."

389
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,322
What the…

390
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,117
Is it that bastard's birthday?

391
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,370
Congrats…

392
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,941
What is this?

393
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,360
Wait, who are you?

394
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:33,759
JU-YEON

395
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,104
JU-YEON

396
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:49,483
-Hey.
-Did you meet up with your relative?

397
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,614
They're on their way now.
I'm waiting for them.

398
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,242
Ever since that day…

399
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,246
I've had the same dream every night.

400
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,001
Park Jae-yeong shows up in it.

401
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,465
Then I…

402
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:17,344
stab him over and over again…

403
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,389
in the neck.

404
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,604
I've killed him thousands of times…

405
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,110
but it never leaves me happy.

406
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,740
Not even for a single moment.

407
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,665
I'd have felt that way
if I'd stabbed him today.

408
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,254
Showing up at that moment…

409
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,841
I'm not sure I did the right thing.

410
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,344
It was all my choice.

411
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,641
So don't agonize over it.

412
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:06,810
I won't either.

413
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:13,025
Okay. Don't worry about anything,
and sleep well.

414
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:15,944
I'll see you tomorrow at work.

415
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:17,279
Okay.

416
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:19,907
Hope your relative is okay.

417
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,667
The thing you asked me to look into.
Did it all get sorted out?

418
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,338
Yes, thanks to you.
Thank you for your help.

419
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:43,592
Of course, anything for you.
I heard today is your last day.

420
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:46,970
-Yes.
-Why?

421
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,265
-Did we not treat you well?
-It's not that.

422
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:52,851
It's just time I moved on.

423
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:57,523
I get it. It's not exactly a job
you can take pride in.

424
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:01,485
But it helped me pay off my student loan
and save for my marriage.

425
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,696
You earned it by working hard.

426
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:09,993
If you ever miss us, just give me a call.
We're friends, you know?

427
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,620
I will.

428
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:14,164
This

429
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,291
is a farewell gift.

430
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:18,836
Thank you.

431
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:21,171
You did a good job.

432
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,260
By the way,

433
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,554
when you're working today,

434
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:31,431
go ahead and harvest everything of use.

435
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,560
Even if you spare him,
we'll kill him anyway.

436
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,708
Look where you have ended up…

437
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,754
Mr. Park Jae-yeong.

438
00:48:58,685 --> 00:48:59,561
Thank you.

439
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:05,192
I think there's been a misunderstanding.
If you could just untie me…

440
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:07,277
I'm not Park Jae-yeong.

441
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,695
Then who are you?

442
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,197
My name is

443
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,367
Kim Beom-jun.

444
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,203
Kim Beom-jun.

445
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:22,334
Eight, four, one, two, zero, seven,
one, zero, eight, one, two, two, seven.

446
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:26,964
Don't you remember what you said
at the hospital that day?

447
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:30,425
What did I…

448
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:39,101
Doctor, what are you doing here?

449
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:40,769
Doctor.

450
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,148
Please don't kill me.

451
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:48,276
You clearly stated your name that day.

452
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:54,741
That was just…

453
00:49:55,867 --> 00:50:00,330
I had a bit of a situation.
Doctor, please let me explain--

454
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,666
A scumbag like you never speaks the truth.

455
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,545
You just say whatever comes to mind.

456
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:11,341
No, please believe me.
You're making a big mistake. I'm…

457
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,845
Fucking idiot! Look at me!

458
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,687
You motherfucker.

459
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:39,369
I normally administer general anesthesia…

460
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,956
but I won't today.

461
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,208
Don't kill me, please.

462
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,418
Please don't…

463
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,589
The moment I saw your face,

464
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,467
I thought of this for the first time.

465
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,552
What? Thought what?

466
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,430
That picking up this side gig
was a great call.

467
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:04,895
Why the fuck are you doing this to me?

468
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:08,356
Why?!

469
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:11,985
Just…

470
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,197
think of this as bad karma.

471
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:14,881
Did you sleep well?

472
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,216
Yeah.

473
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:18,218
I didn't have any dreams.

474
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:20,387
I'm glad.

475
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:24,558
Is your relative better?

476
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:27,727
Yeah.

477
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:31,189
It all went well.
I don't have to go back anymore.

478
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,861
Well done.

479
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:39,823
Shall we have dinner together?

480
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,167
I want to go home. It's been so long.

481
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,545
I want to see my mom.

482
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:56,298
All right.

483
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:11,771
Hey, Ju-yeon.

484
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:16,151
There are only good things ahead.

485
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:20,989
Thanks.

486
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,479
Shoot. This thing took my money.

487
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:55,649
Why won't this come out?

488
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,566
What the…

489
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,621
Wow. Nice one, Doctor.

490
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,707
It always gets stuck here.

491
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,459
So you even fix vending machines.

492
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,254
What brings you to the hospital?

493
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:23,551
Everyone here
is a potential client of ours.

494
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:24,970
I'm promoting my services.

495
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:30,475
Would you like something?
Do doctors drink canned drinks too?

496
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,185
You were waiting for me, right?

497
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:36,773
There's been an update in your case.

498
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:42,320
If it's uncomfortable to talk here,
it might be best to go someplace else.

499
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:45,907
No.

500
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:49,035
You don't need to tell me.

501
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,079
But…

502
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:53,123
There's nothing else I want to know.

503
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:58,920
Very well, then.

504
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,215
We're happy when our clients are happy.

505
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,176
-Thank you for everything.
-I should thank you.

506
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,094
Take care.

507
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,147
