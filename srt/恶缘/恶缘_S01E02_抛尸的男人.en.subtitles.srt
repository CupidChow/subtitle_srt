00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,429
Hello, subscribers.

2
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,055
It's a wonderful morning.

3
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:15,724
It's so cold right now.

4
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:19,769
The weather has definitely gotten
much colder since my last video.

5
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,771
It's freezing.

6
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,691
Can you guys see my breath? Maybe not.

7
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,320
Ta-da!

8
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:32,824
Wow.

9
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,200
What a view, right?

10
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:40,623
It's too cold right now,
so I'll quickly get ready to head down.

11
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,542
See you guys in a bit.

12
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:47,005
All righty, let's start packing.

13
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,137
All right.

14
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,307
I'm all packed up now.

15
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,393
Let's make our way down together.

16
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,149
Mt. Chowol is known for its rough terrain,

17
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,109
so not many hikers come here.

18
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:12,072
That means it's quiet,
so you can get a good night's sleep.

19
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:18,203
If you come here, I suggest that you bring
at least one mini carton of soju.

20
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,291
What was that?

21
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,044
Hold on, guys.

22
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,055
Guys, there's a dog here.

23
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:42,685
Can you see it?

24
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,206
That scared me.

25
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:07,544
What is that?

26
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,672
What was that dog eating?

27
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,185
A body?

28
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,232
Hello?

29
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,526
I'm on Mt. Chowol right now.

30
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,611
There's a dead body here.

31
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,615
No, it's a dead human body!

32
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,630
KARMA

33
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:46,100
When was the last time
I ever felt this way?

34
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,103
My life has been quite eventful,

35
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,940
but I've never felt
such a great sense of accomplishment.

36
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,400
I remember snorting at a friend

37
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:58,613
who said men make money
to get the women they want.

38
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,324
I finally get it now.

39
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:11,209
CHAPTER 2
THE MAN WHO DISPOSED OF THE BODY

40
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,838
Hi, babe. Sorry I'm late.

41
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,092
You're earlier than I expected.
You're cold. Take a seat.

42
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,262
I was almost here,
but the traffic just outside was terrible.

43
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,597
I had the taxi driver pull over
and walked here.

44
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:28,101
The traffic's bad because it's Friday.
You must be so tired.

45
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,687
I looked this place up. It's super famous.

46
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,563
I made the reservation two months ago.

47
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:37,151
The head chef is actually French,
and the restaurant is Michelin-starred.

48
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,530
Nice, so it's the place to be.

49
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,826
So, what did you order?

50
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,330
I was waiting for you to get here
so we can order what you like.

51
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,587
You still don't know what I like?

52
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:02,093
I thought I should ask you,
just to be sure.

53
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,974
Your face is red because you're flustered.

54
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,017
Is it really?

55
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,769
Yeah, it's cute.

56
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,771
"Cute"? Come on, stop it.

57
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,904
-I'm going to the ladies' room.
-Of course.

58
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,128
-Please hurry.
-Yes, sir.

59
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,755
Where to next?

60
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,382
There's a good dessert place nearby.

61
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,468
I saw it on TV recently and made a note.

62
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,474
Why? Don't you feel like something sweet?

63
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:54,520
Right now,
I'm in the mood for something else.

64
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,606
What?

65
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,733
Gosh, seriously.

66
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,401
Come here.

67
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:05,490
I want to spend the night with you.

68
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,125
But it's Friday night.
I wonder if they'd have rooms available.

69
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,754
Let's go somewhere quiet.
It'll be romantic, just the two of us.

70
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,006
Sure, sounds good.

71
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:29,764
Get in.

72
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:34,936
Careful.

73
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,178
What do you think?

74
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,931
-Isn't it nice and quiet here?
-Yes.

75
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,559
Who'd expect to find a lodge
in such a remote area?

76
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,561
How did you find it?

77
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,354
I've been here before.

78
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,314
You've been here?

79
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,774
Why?

80
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:31,451
Well, I came hiking with my friends
to Mt. Chowol and stayed the night here.

81
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,411
You know I like hiking.

82
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,586
My gosh, you're so timid.

83
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,388
Ta-da!

84
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,308
A friend brought back
this delicious wine from France.

85
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,436
I brought a bottle
so we could have it together.

86
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,732
If I drink,
we'll probably have to sleep here tonight.

87
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,320
Tomorrow's Saturday anyway.
You're not working tomorrow, are you?

88
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:11,240
No, I'm not, but…

89
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,245
What's with you?
Are you going to keep ruining the mood?

90
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,247
You want to just do it sober?

91
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,333
No, that's not what I meant.

92
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,252
I'm on this medication.

93
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,631
I took it earlier.
For three hours, I can't--

94
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,570
One glass can't hurt.

95
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,081
What? When?

96
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,419
Seriously.

97
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,302
All right, then.

98
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,721
I'll leave now.

99
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:16,681
What?

100
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,559
What is it?

101
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,312
Did something happen?

102
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,525
I have to go somewhere now.

103
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:28,776
Now?

104
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,363
Where? It's past midnight.

105
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,116
My close friend's father passed away.

106
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,617
Really?

107
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,997
It's so annoying
after coming all this way.

108
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,542
But your friend's father passed away.
You should be there.

109
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,505
I wonder if I can find
a designated driver at this time.

110
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,343
It's late, and we're in the middle
of nowhere, so I doubt it.

111
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,805
But I drank,
so I probably shouldn't drive.

112
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,643
Fine. I'll just get myself a taxi.

113
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,605
It stopped raining, so it should be fine.
Just go back to bed.

114
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,150
No.

115
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,238
It's late, so I doubt we'll run into cops.

116
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,616
I'll drive you to the funeral home.

117
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:17,950
Let's go.

118
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:30,546
I'M ON MY WAY NOW

119
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,383
Texting your friends?

120
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,971
Yeah. It is urgent,
so I'm texting everyone to let them know.

121
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,015
Sorry it's such a rough night.

122
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,938
You must be tired.

123
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,192
You should've slept more. It's my fault.

124
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:54,320
It's fine.
It's better to go before traffic.

125
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,825
I'm sorry I snapped at you earlier.

126
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,414
Don't worry about it.
Your friend's father passed…

127
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,499
You're just kind.

128
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,542
You snapped because you're too kind.

129
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,672
Thanks, babe.

130
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:19,845
By the way, it was really nice.

131
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,515
It's been a while since I came.

132
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:27,103
Really? I guess
taking the herbal medicine paid off.

133
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,647
You're adorable.

134
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,821
Oh dear, looks like someone's sleepy.

135
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:38,948
I'll wake you up.

136
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,329
Hold on, Yu-jeong.

137
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,125
Don't you want to?
I think this guy down here likes it.

138
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,128
No, it's not that I don't want to.

139
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,965
We're on a foggy mountain road,
so it's dangerous.

140
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,467
Dozing off while driving
is even more dangerous.

141
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:11,397
Yu-jeong, there's a rest stop coming up.
Let's do it there.

142
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,023
But I want to do it now.

143
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,545
What was that?

144
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,464
What did we hit?

145
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,384
A water deer?

146
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:42,678
No.

147
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,930
Then what was it?

148
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,682
I think…

149
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,352
we hit a person.

150
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,270
What?

151
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:16,962
Fuck.

152
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,179
Shit.

153
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,658
Don't tell me he's…

154
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,370
He's not dead, is he?

155
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:51,705
He's dead.

156
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:04,134
No, he can't be. Let's call 911.

157
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:07,763
When they get here,
they'll be able to save him.

158
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,223
What are you doing?

159
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,102
-We should call it in.
-You know that I drank.

160
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,647
-I know that, but--
-Make that call, and I'll be arrested.

161
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,276
-My life would be over.
-We can't just leave him--

162
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,278
I drank and drove.

163
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:27,032
I hit a person who's now dead.
But what? You want to call it in?

164
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,162
Don't raise your voice.

165
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,582
Someone might hear you.

166
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,460
Right, I'm sorry.

167
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,131
I can't think straight right now.

168
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,553
This is why I didn't want to drink.

169
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,223
What do we do now?

170
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,393
What should we do? I'm totally fucked!

171
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,355
I told you I didn't want to drink.
Why did you make me?

172
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,482
Why did you force me to fucking drink?

173
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,402
I'm fucking screwed.

174
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,613
Why did you make me drink?!

175
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,699
-Babe.
-If only I hadn't drunk!

176
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,285
Babe, look!

177
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,916
Did you have an accident?

178
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,793
Yes.

179
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,921
My car skidded on that turn.

180
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,631
Oh dear.

181
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,968
Well, do you need any help?

182
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,428
I already called insurance,
so it's all right.

183
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:14,056
I'm good with cars.

184
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,102
I think I should take a look at your car.

185
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,145
That's all right.

186
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,731
I called my insurance company.

187
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,816
Insurance company?

188
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,443
I think there have been
several accidents due to the fog.

189
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,820
I guess so.

190
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,447
It's cold. You should get going.

191
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:31,991
I'm really okay.

192
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:36,537
Your girlfriend's waiting.
You should get going.

193
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:41,959
All right, then.

194
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,086
Right.

195
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:45,963
Hold up.

196
00:16:56,765 --> 00:17:00,894
Do you know a place around here

197
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,939
where we could stop for a rest?

198
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,025
Come on, let me ask him.

199
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:06,942
I see.

200
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,528
There's Oasis Stay.

201
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,822
You can find it with your GPS.

202
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,407
It's nice and clean.

203
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,035
Oasis, huh? Okay.

204
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:21,123
You must have been in a rush.
You should zip up your fly.

205
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,375
Right. Thank you.

206
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,509
Fuck.

207
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,390
You didn't take a photo, did you?

208
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,601
It was too awkward.

209
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,644
There was a woman in the car too.

210
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,979
-It's all right.
-Damn.

211
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,647
We have confirmation, so it's fine.

212
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,701
What happened?
Don't tell me we've been busted.

213
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,505
What are you doing?

214
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,427
I asked you what you're doing.

215
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,804
Can't you hear me?

216
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:18,806
Holy fuck.

217
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,522
Babe!

218
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,370
What the hell are you planning to do?

219
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,375
Let's bury him.

220
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,293
-What?
-Think about it.

221
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,048
On this cold night,

222
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,426
this old, disheveled man was jaywalking.

223
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,305
There's probably no one who'd miss him
if he disappeared.

224
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,599
Have you gone totally insane?
That's nonsense!

225
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,102
What's truly insane
is the situation we're in.

226
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,525
Babe, hold on.

227
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,777
Let's try to think rationally.

228
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,904
You're not in your right mind now!

229
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,366
He's already dead anyway.
It doesn't matter how he died.

230
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:27,124
Don't you think it's important
to do our best with what we're given?

231
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:30,252
-What do you even mean?
-Let's just go into the mountains.

232
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,629
We'll talk on the way, Yu-jeong.

233
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:36,133
What's with you today? Snap out of it!

234
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,565
Why did this fall?

235
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:53,942
Babe?

236
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,660
What do we do now?

237
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,753
For fuck's sake.

238
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,465
-That son of a…
-Babe!

239
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,553
Fuck.

240
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,904
Who is this guy?
Why are you putting him in there too?

241
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,412
What's your plan, huh?

242
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,705
I have no idea.

243
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,833
In any case,
we can't leave a witness here.

244
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,419
Just get in.

245
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,138
Do you want me to end up in jail?

246
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,681
Stay here, then.

247
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:06,700
Thanks.

248
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,328
I'll take care of the rest.

249
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,496
Don't worry.

250
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,206
Buckle up.

251
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:51,119
MT. CHOWOL HIKING TRAIL MAP

252
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,858
What happened to the man
under the overpass?

253
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,153
Is he dead too?

254
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,407
He's alive.

255
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,827
Then why did you bring him here?
What are you going to do?

256
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,956
He's the only witness.

257
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,500
What do you think?

258
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,086
Babe.

259
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,381
You wouldn't.

260
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,425
Would you?

261
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:49,302
You're not that kind of person, are you?

262
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,866
Please help!

263
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,243
-Fuck.
-Help!

264
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,120
Wait. Where are you going?

265
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,998
Somebody please help me!

266
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,001
Get me out of here!

267
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:24,379
Help me out! Get me out of here!

268
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,881
Damn this prick.

269
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,008
Please save me!

270
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:30,385
Fucking idiot.

271
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:33,346
Just shut the fuck up.

272
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,140
Damn.

273
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,103
I really saw nothing.

274
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,273
I swear I won't say a word.
Please let me go.

275
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:46,401
If you saw nothing,
what do you mean you won't say a word?

276
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:50,572
I mean that I really know nothing,
so please let me go.

277
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,073
Somebody, help!

278
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,493
Shut up!

279
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:58,205
You fucking idiot,
I told you to shut the fuck up.

280
00:24:59,164 --> 00:24:59,998
You got that?

281
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:02,959
Please don't kill me.

282
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,462
Killing one person or two
makes no difference.

283
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,214
Do you understand?

284
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,217
Yes.

285
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:15,972
Your bank details?

286
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,058
Sorry?

287
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,477
Fucking earmuffs.

288
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,522
Don't make me repeat myself.

289
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,024
I don't give a shit anymore.

290
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:28,318
What's your bank account number?

291
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,488
Hanjin Bank.

292
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,533
-Three, four, nine…
-Hanjin Bank.

293
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,578
It's three, four, nine… three, two,

294
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,873
one, three, eight, two, six, four.

295
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,585
Check your account.

296
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:55,929
NOVEMBER 11, 1:55 A.M.
10,000,000 WON DEPOSIT

297
00:25:58,765 --> 00:25:59,683
Listen carefully.

298
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,060
We're accomplices now.

299
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,396
"Accomplices"?

300
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:05,939
That's right.

301
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,233
If I left you here like this,

302
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,151
you would die anyway.

303
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:13,863
You kept your life and made some money,
so be grateful.

304
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,366
Get out.

305
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,954
I said, get the fuck out!

306
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,415
Okay.

307
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,388
Thank you, sir.

308
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,100
Where are you going?

309
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,477
Sorry?

310
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,188
I'm going home.

311
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,566
I paid you, so you need to do some work.

312
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,192
Work?

313
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:54,988
What work…

314
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:21,806
Follow me.

315
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:29,522
Hurry up.

316
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,865
Shit.

317
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,039
Wait for me.

318
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:50,210
Wait, my ass. This is not a picnic.

319
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:52,796
Get over here!

320
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:56,925
Shit.

321
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,579
What are you waiting for?
Come here and dig!

322
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:32,210
Put that down, will you?

323
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:39,718
Fuck me for giving ten million
to such an idiot.

324
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:50,729
Are you all right?

325
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,273
What do we do?

326
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,652
Just dig. We must finish before sunrise.

327
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,948
Shit.

328
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:10,623
Fuck.

329
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,044
Frozen ground makes it tough, doesn't it?

330
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,486
What…

331
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,930
Don't you think…

332
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,519
it's a little too shallow?

333
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:17,690
I think we should dig deeper.

334
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,114
Keep your useless opinions to yourself.

335
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,909
There's no time. We must bury him fast.

336
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,083
Fucking whining and mumbling nonstop.

337
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,306
You should've left some.

338
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,893
Excuse me…

339
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:38,813
I…

340
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,191
kept thinking while digging the ground.

341
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:46,487
I just can't stop thinking…

342
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,783
that ten million is too little.

343
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,537
What?

344
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,999
Please give me another ten million.

345
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,293
That's only fair.

346
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,338
-What are we going to do?
-Shit.

347
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,522
I'll give you 20 million more.

348
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:27,862
End of discussion. Sound good?

349
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,949
Yes, let's do that.

350
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,451
Sounds good. Thank you.

351
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,995
Babe, are you sure about this?

352
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,376
Let's just go home, please.

353
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:45,755
Put on your seat belt.

354
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,465
Okay.

355
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,184
Yu-jeong.

356
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,690
Take a shower and get some sleep.
I'll call you later.

357
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,860
It'll be okay, right?

358
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,740
I don't know.

359
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,618
Don't worry, though.

360
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,081
I'll head in, then.

361
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,154
Fuck.

362
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,291
Sir.

363
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,586
I'd also like to go home now.

364
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,379
Yeah, you can go.

365
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,174
Jesus Christ.

366
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,594
I still need you to transfer the money.

367
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,570
NOVEMBER 11, 7:30 A.M.

368

PAYMENT SENT
BALANCE: 3,021,064 WON

369
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,577
Really, thank you.

370
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:29,335
From this moment on,
we bury what happened today forever.

371
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,048
Put your worries to rest, sir.

372
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:36,801
Take care.

373
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,418
Fucking hell.

374
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:40,114
I'm really sorry to ask,

375
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,950
but I don't have money for a taxi.

376
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,121
I'm really sorry.
I didn't bring my wallet.

377
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:53,711
Sorry.

378
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,430
Sorry about that. Drive safe.

379
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,528
What a lunatic.

380
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,448
For fuck's sake.

381
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,044
Here's your invoice. Take a look.

382
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:35,962
Thank you.

383
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,593
AUTO INSPECTION AND REPAIR INVOICE

384
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,303
4.8 million won?

385
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,141
Shit.

386
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,986
BODY BURIED ON MT. CHOWOL

387
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,612
FAMILY CAMPING TRIPS TO MT. CHOWOL

388
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:14,643
Take photos of him entering the building.

389
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,062
-Got it.
-Great.

390
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,784
EXAMINATION ROOM 1

391
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,204
I'M SORRY TO EVEN ASK YOU THIS

392
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:21,627
YOU'RE NOT SICK, ARE YOU?
PLEASE TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND CALL ME

393
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:28,509
I HAD TO FIX THE CAR AND STUFF
SO MONEY'S A LITTLE TIGHT

394
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,010
COULD YOU CHIP IN?

395
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,141
Ever since I slipped
and fell in the kitchen,

396
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:38,018
I get terrible back pain
even if I just move around a little.

397
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,980
Another doctor told me to do
warm compresses,

398
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:43,607
so I do them all the time,
but they haven't helped.

399
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,192
Excuse me, Doctor?

400
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,445
Yes.

401
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,821
You're listening, right?

402
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:51,532
Of course. Once you start getting
back pain at your age,

403
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,033
it doesn't go away easily.

404
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,870
I'll prescribe you
a week's worth of medicine for now.

405
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:58,330
But the medicine is so expensive.

406
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,833
You seem to charge more than others.

407
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,585
That's not true.

408
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,466
All right, I understand.

409
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,094
Let's see how you get on for now,

410
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,555
and then I'll give you…

411
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:17,766
LEE YU-JEONG:
CALL ME WHEN YOU HAVE A MOMENT

412
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,477
The nurse will see you out.

413
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:24,231
Hey. I'm sorry I forgot to text you back.
I had a lot going on too.

414
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:25,649
I get it.

415
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,361
You must be stressed too.
I'm sorry for even asking.

416
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,489
I had to take out a loan

417
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,533
to move to this new clinic.

418
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,035
Don't be sorry.

419
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:37,786
I should chip in too.

420
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,539
I'll try to get the money this week.

421
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:42,791
Thanks.

422
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,085
God, this is embarrassing.

423
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:50,799
One more thing. I don't think
we should contact each other for a while.

424
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,844
You know, just in case.

425
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:56,555
You understand, right?

426
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,852
Yeah. I understand.

427
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:05,189
All right. Thanks for understanding.

428
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,107
Get some rest.

429
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:08,442
All right.

430
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,448
I refuse to pay all of it. No way.

431
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,201
It's her fault I was drunk.

432
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,956
Fuck.

433
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,756
I'll start seeing patients in 30 minutes.
Don't let anyone in.

434
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,299
Yes, sir.

435
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:41,892
Fuck.

436
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,625
I told you not to…

437
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:10,921
I told you not to let anyone in.

438
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,939
Did you manage to get some rest, sir?

439
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:02,593
