My wallet's completely empty.

184
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:15,832
You'll be okay, dude.

185
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,874
Just call your favorite customer tonight.

186
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:20,541

for me, Daddy?"

188

[lively music]

191
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,083
I can lift my legs. Whoo!

192
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,374
[Korn] How about a race?

193
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,041
- [Sorn] Come on.
- Woo-hoo!

194

[whistle blowing]

195
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,832
[traffic cop] Hey, what are you doing?

196
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:50,541
Over here. Let's go.

202
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,333
I was told...

203
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,000
that, um,

204
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,958
the Thai government has decreed,

205
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:12,166
well, entertainment companies
must close down.

206
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,166
Just for two weeks, but...

207
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:17,582
it includes us.

208
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:19,457
- [host 1] What?
- [host 2] What are we supposed to do?

209
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,124
- [host 3] They can't be serious.
- [host 4] This is so bullshit.

210
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,541
[host 5] How can they just shut us down
like that?

211
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,707
[host 6] Come on, they can't do that.
Come on.

212
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,082
[host 1] What are we supposed to do
in the meantime?

213
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:27,291
[host 2] I still have bills to pay.
Help us.

214
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,624
- Is the government gonna pay for that?
- [host 3] It's so fucked up, man.

215
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,875
[Madame M] All right, boys.
Settle down. Quiet.

216
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,625
No matter what,

217
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,916
I'm gonna do my best
to help you all, okay?

218
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:41,166
Today is the last day
before the long break.

219
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,458
There will be many customers.

220
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:47,457
Go get ready. Go, go, go. Now.
The customers will be here soon.

[man] Mm-mm.

223
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,666
No need. Put it on my tab.

224
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,332
And, uh, make him crispy noodles
for his wife.

225
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,416
Yes, sir.

226
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,541
Hello, Ji.

[lighter clicks]

228
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,207
So, Joe, how can I help?

229
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,416
[Joe inhales deeply]

230
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,500
I think you know why I'm here.

231
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,333
You know, Ji,

232
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:36,541
the last job you did for me

233
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:38,958
was superb.

234
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:43,208
You didn't get caught, left no trace.

235
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,583
If you don't do this next one,

236
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,250
who knows what will happen?

237
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,041
[Joe] I came here to warn you.

238
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:00,375
I don't want you to end up
like the guy before you.

239
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,958
Especially, since you have a wife and kid.

240
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:17,208
Piece of advice for you, be careful.
You're a dad now, right?

241
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,416
[Bhoom whimpering]

253
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,083
I'm in, Joe.

254
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,333
I decided to take the job.

255
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,125
[Ji] So, how was your life as a soldier?

256
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:09,791
Well, it wasn't too different
from being a monk.

257
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:16,541
[Sorn] <i>We had to wake up at the same time,

[TV shuts off]

267
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,000
[chief] I'm here to invite all monks
and novices to join the army.

268
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,916
[abbot] Come on, they're all good men.
Look at them in the robes.

269
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,291
Don't make them fight people in battle.

270
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:10,208
If we don't go after them,
they'll be in our backyard.

271
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,374
You know what that means?

272
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:16,666
The Burmese soldiers will take our food
and burn our villages,

273
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,750
and leave us in awful poverty again!

274
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:22,250
[chief] And still,
you want to hide yourself at the temple?

275
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:37,416
Do we have any say in this?

276
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,083
I don't think so.

277
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:42,041
Have we ever had a choice in the past?

[birds chirping]

279
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,791
[Wan] Should we cross
the border into Thailand?

280
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:40,375
It's not very far from here.

281
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:43,582
[Yoon] Can we ever come back?

282
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:45,791
I mean, if we cross over to that side?

283
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,333
You and I, we'll leave together.
To hell with this.

284
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:57,957
That would be a mistake.
It's easier said than done.

285
00:24:58,041 --> 00:24:59,791
It's a daydream, Wan.

286
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:02,249
I think we've got it good here, you know?

287
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:04,666
A place to sleep and all the food we need.

288
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,999
Do you even know anyone over there?

289
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:09,500
Any idea where you'll sleep
or what you'll eat?

290
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,625
I'll figure it out.

291
00:25:13,583 --> 00:25:16,374
Ugh, you're inviting me with no plans.

292
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:18,000
You haven't thought about anything.

293
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:20,416

Are you coming with me?

297
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,250
I'll walk away.

298

[Yoon] Wan.

299

Are you really just gonna
leave me here alone?

300
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,666
I really want you to come along. Okay?

301
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,999
But I have to try.

302
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:33,125
I want to choose what my future is like.

end up working here, Sorn?</i>

304

[Sorn] Actually, I did many jobs
before this, Ji.

305
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:42,666
From construction jobs to waiting tables.

354
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:26,832
Hey, it's your first day here,
just take it easy.

355
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:28,708
You're new to Chiang Mai, right?

356
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:30,374
Yeah, bro.

357
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:33,749
- Is it that obvious?
- Over there, those green shoes.

358
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:36,541
Everyone who runs away from the army
wear shoes like that.

359
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,374
Anyway, just do your best out there, okay?

360
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:42,832
Work your charm, you'll get some tips.
You'll be great.

361
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:44,708
- Bye.
- All right. Thanks, man.

362
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:48,750
[sighs]

363
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:50,833
All right.
[chuckles]

364
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:01,541
[Sorn] <i>It felt strange at first.</i>

365
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:05,000
<i>But as time went by, I got used to it.</i>

366
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:10,958
Can you guess

367
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:14,791
the first thing I bought myself
with the money I made?

368
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:18,416
A motorcycle?

369
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:20,083
Try again.

370
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:25,249
How about a cell phone?

371
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:26,500
Not that, either.

372
00:31:28,791 --> 00:31:29,999
A pair of sneakers.

373
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:32,082
[chuckles]
Really? Why?

374
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:34,291
Well, when I wore the green ones,

375
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:36,333
my friends would joke about it.

376
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:39,166
Really?

377
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,750
Mm-hm.

378
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:46,375
I have to make myself look
as Thai as possible.

379
00:31:47,708 --> 00:31:50,707
Occasionally, when we went out
wearing the green shoes,

380
00:31:50,791 --> 00:31:52,083
looking like hillbillies,

381
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:54,041
we'd get stopped by the police.

382
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:57,707
And the police,
they... they fucking scare me.

383
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,125
They always rip me off.

384
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,958
The police are bastards,
you know what I mean?

385
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:10,625
[clanks]

386
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:15,291
[brooding music]

387
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:25,291
[loud thud]

388
00:32:37,708 --> 00:32:39,750
[Ji] <i>Actually, I snuck in quietly.</i>

389
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,166
<i>I slowly unbolted the lock.</i>

390
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:47,500
[keys jangle]

391
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:50,291
[exhales deeply]

392
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:57,125
[foreboding music]

393
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:00,666
WIPE OUT

394
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:09,250
ESCAPE SOTUS

395
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:11,750
STOP ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCE

396
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:32,749
What was the problem with him?

397
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:33,874
[fire roaring]

398
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:37,499
- [Ji] <i>He was a bad guy.</i>
- [people clamoring]

399
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:42,749
<i>He caused conflicts in society
and kept blaming the government.</i>

400
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:45,457
- [protester 1] Tear gas! Run!
- [people scream]

401
00:33:45,541 --> 00:33:48,957
[Ji] <i>Nothing would have happened
if he had just kept to his studies.</i>

402
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:50,541
[protester 2] Tyrant assholes!

403
00:33:51,125 --> 00:33:53,041
[Ji] <i>Our country needs peace.</i>

404
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:56,000
- [coughing]
- [distant yelling]

405
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:08,750
Hey, Ji.

406
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:13,250
When we're done,
can I go home with you this time?

407
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:17,166
What? You normally hurry home, don't you?

408
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,416
[neck cracks]

409
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:22,500
I only have about 400 baht to my name.

410
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,958
And the club is closing down.

411
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:27,708
I'm not sure how I will survive.

412
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:34,041
Mm-hm, yeah, okay.

413
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:36,250
Come with me tonight.

414
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,457
I think you and I can get
into something fun.

415
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:41,083
[chuckles]
Thank you, Ji.

416
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:46,083
[foreboding music]

417
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,750
[tense music]

418
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:57,000
[spray paint rattles]

419
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:00,958
[spray paint fizzing]

420
00:35:06,208 --> 00:35:08,832
NO ONE SHALL BE SUBJECTED
TO ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCE

421
00:35:08,916 --> 00:35:11,125
[Ji] Do you see the man
putting up the posters?

422
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,249
His name is Wuth.

423
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:15,750
He's 22 years old.

424
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:19,125
He looks just like an ordinary young man.

425
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:22,291
He must have had some drinks
with his friends.

426
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:27,291
This is my next target.

427
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:35,166
If I had a job for you to do,
and it's paid,

428
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:37,083
would you be interested?

429
00:35:37,958 --> 00:35:39,500
I would be, yeah.

430
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:41,458
What kind of job?

431
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,291
[Ji] A guide.

432
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:46,916
Take my friend and I
to your hometown in Myanmar.

433
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:50,999
[Sorn] But how will we get there?

434
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:53,541
Isn't the checkpoint closed
because of COVID?

435
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,041
You know another way.

436
00:35:58,416 --> 00:35:59,416
[inhales sharply]

437
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:01,250
But...

438
00:36:01,916 --> 00:36:04,291
coming back that way is nearly impossible.

439
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:09,458
And I don't really want
to go back to Myanmar.

440
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:15,458
[sighs]

441
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:18,791
[Ji] So are you gonna take my friend
and me to your hometown?

442
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,708
I can't do it.

443
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:26,625
[ominous music]

444
00:36:34,416 --> 00:36:38,999
BOOZER KARAOKE

445
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:40,333
Hey, what's up, Sorn?

446
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:42,541
- Good night.
- [Bee] Night.

447
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:48,249
- No sugar daddy to see you off.
- What sugar daddy?

448
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,791
There were no customers,
so I made nothing.

449
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:53,708
It's okay. Maybe tomorrow.

450
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:55,916
We're closed for COVID.

451
00:36:57,791 --> 00:37:00,416
Things may be closing,
but at least we're still here.

452
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:05,541
Come on. Let's go home.

453
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:10,375
[engine starts]

454
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:21,166
[suspenseful music]

455
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:28,916
[suspenseful music continues]

456
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:36,291
[Sorn] Come on. Give me a smile.

457
00:37:58,125 --> 00:37:59,208
[Bee groans]

458
00:38:17,416 --> 00:38:18,416
Sorn.

459
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:21,166
Sorn.

460
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:24,333
Sorn.

461
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:28,958
Hey, Sorn, did you pay rent?

462
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:34,958
[grunts softly]

463
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:40,250
- Huh?
- I asked if you already paid the rent.

464
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:43,375
Not yet.

465
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:45,416
[sighs]

466
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,833
Do you still have the money?

467
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,500
Sorn, where's my money?

468
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,291
It paid for a passport I need.

469
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,291
Oh, that's great, yeah.

470
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,499
I thought I'd be able to earn more money
if I had a passport,

471
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:00,999
so I spent the money on it.

472
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:02,332
Like an investment.

473
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:03,791
Oh, a passport, huh?

474
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,000
How's that going?

475
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:07,707
Everything's closed because of COVID.

476
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:08,749
You know that.

477
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:10,416
Yeah, and that's why we need that cash.

478
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,457
So what do you want me to do?

479
00:39:11,541 --> 00:39:13,041
Why didn't you ask me about it?

480
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:18,208
[Sorn breathing deeply]

481
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,249
[Sorn] Hello, Nan.

482
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:24,582
- [Nan] Well, hello.
- [Korn] Hi.

483
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:25,999
[Nan] Clean your hands first.

484
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:27,874
You're not even wearing masks.

485
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:30,582
We want to know
when our passports are gonna come.

486
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:33,249
[Nan] It's only been a couple of days.
They're not ready yet.

487
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:35,082
You'll just have to wait a little longer.

488
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:36,875
Do you mind if we cancel them?

489
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,041
[Nan] Oh, I'm sorry,
it's too late to cancel them.

490
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:43,666
[Sorn] Can you tell us
when the passports will be ready?

491
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,374
[Nan sighs]
Listen, boys. I'm also waiting for them.

492
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:49,541
But due to this COVID, you know how it is.

493
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:51,583
Everything is getting delayed.

494
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:55,249
Why are you keeping our money
if the system is so wretched up?

495
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:59,666
[Nan] Well, see, I didn't ask you
to give your money to me.

496
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:02,457
You gave it to me yourself.
Do you remember?

497
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:03,874
I remember.

498
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:06,999
That was before I needed the money.
Can you give it back?

499
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:08,874
Or can you help hurry it up?

500
00:40:08,958 --> 00:40:11,166
[Nan] I am trying to help you.
I'm helping you now.

501
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,499
But there's COVID.
Do you understand there's COVID?

502
00:40:13,583 --> 00:40:14,916
- [Korn] We'll just head out.
- [Sorn] I understand.

503
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,332
- [Nan] Okay, you guys need to go now.
- Sorn, let's go.

504
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:17,666
[Nan] I'll call you
when the passports are ready.

505
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:18,874
So you don't have to bother me.

506
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,374
[Sorn] I'm asking you
because I don't have any money right now.

507
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:23,332
[Nan] Man, he talks
as if we have a lot of money.

508
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:25,666
Everyone is affected by COVID.

509
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:29,208
[car approaching]

510
00:40:31,666 --> 00:40:33,666
[driver 1] Two carpenters
and two plasterers.

511
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:40,541
[worker] Okay, let's go.

512
00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:47,458
[sighs]

513
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,625
When we first got here,
why didn't I notice this heat?

514
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,332
Well, to be fair,

515
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:04,791
we worked in a bar
where it's nice and cool.

516
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:06,707
Well, you have a point there.

517
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:07,791
[sighs]

518
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:18,500
[car approaching]

519
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:24,375
[driver 2] I need five people.

520
00:41:29,916 --> 00:41:30,958
[Sorn] All right.

521
00:41:31,875 --> 00:41:34,791
Do you know what...
what kind of job we're gonna do?

522
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:36,624
Who cares? We're gonna do it.

523
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:37,707
[both chuckle]

524
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:38,874
[car starts]

525
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:40,958
[engine revving]

526
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:46,166
[motorbike engine revs]

527
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,166
[car honking]

528
00:42:26,416 --> 00:42:29,416

533
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:42,333
- [worker] Hey, the cops are here.
- [cop 1] Go, go, go.

534
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:44,083
[Korn] Sorn!

535
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,250
You need to show me your work permit.

536
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:01,916
[lieutenant] Do you have
any documents or permits?

537
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,833
Do you have a passport?

538
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,499
If you don't, you've broken the law.

539
00:44:10,583 --> 00:44:12,500
We're gonna have to lock you up for that.

540
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,333
I do have a passport coming.

541
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:19,041
I can give you their number,
you can call. It's true.

542
00:44:19,125 --> 00:44:20,291
[lieutenant] No, no.

543
00:44:22,333 --> 00:44:25,375
Then can I talk to someone higher up?

544
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:28,832
[lieutenant] Huh?
You trying to get on my nerves?

545
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,416
Hey, take him away.

546
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,707
He's annoying.

547
00:44:32,791 --> 00:44:34,332
[Ji] Calm down, Lieutenant.

548
00:44:34,416 --> 00:44:35,625
I'll take it from here.

549
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:37,332
[lieutenant] Yes, sir.

00:44:37,416 --> 00:44:39,291
[retreating footsteps]

551
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:40,458
It's you.

[door opens, closes]

553
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,416
I didn't know you're a cop.

554
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:57,875
So, what happened today?
What did you do to get caught?

555
00:44:58,708 --> 00:45:00,832
[Sorn] I was trying to work.
I don't have a passport.

556
00:45:00,916 --> 00:45:03,500
Oh, Nan's been holding out?

557
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:07,916
But... Nan works with cops?

558
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,041
Sorn, do you remember the offer I made...

559
00:45:15,916 --> 00:45:17,250
the other day?

560
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,291
Well, what do you think?

561
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:23,958
Think of what?

562
00:45:26,083 --> 00:45:30,291
[Ji] You remember I asked you
to take my friend and I to the other side?

563
00:45:31,333 --> 00:45:33,333
To visit your hometown in Myanmar.

564
00:45:39,958 --> 00:45:42,208
I don't know why
you don't want to go back there.

565
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:45,875
But they're going to put you away,

566
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:48,666
unless you help me out.

567
00:45:57,041 --> 00:46:00,750
Then will I get to come back
if I take you the whole way?

568
00:46:02,875 --> 00:46:03,875
[Ji sighs]

569
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:24,041
[tense music]

570
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:27,666
[Ji] This is just part of your reward.

571
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:30,333
If you help me finish this,

572
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:32,500
I'll pay you well.

573
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,958
But first, you have to promise me...

574
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:43,208
that you will help me.

575
00:46:51,833 --> 00:46:54,374
[Wuth] I've already checked the VPN.
It's all secured.

576
00:46:54,458 --> 00:46:56,041
They won't be able to track me.

577
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,500
Bitch, I know it's risky,
but I really need the hard drive.

578
00:47:05,791 --> 00:47:09,000
I'll check it all again
before I release it tomorrow.

579
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:12,375
You're planning out, right?

580
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:14,541
There's an escape route for me?

581
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:17,500
- They're not playing this time.
- [trunk clanks]

582
00:47:19,958 --> 00:47:21,125
I'll see you soon.

583
00:47:21,666 --> 00:47:22,666
Bye.

584
00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:27,749
There's a gun behind you. Be quiet.

585
00:47:27,833 --> 00:47:29,707
And just do as I say,
and you'll be all right.

586
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,708
[clicks]

587
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:35,832

[Wuth grunts]

594
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:06,000
You're Wuth, that right?

595
00:48:11,125 --> 00:48:14,083
Why do you feel the need
to stand up against human trafficking?

596
00:48:16,208 --> 00:48:18,249
What makes this a hill you wanna die on?

[rats squeaking]

598
00:48:20,583 --> 00:48:22,458
You're aware
of who you're up against, right?

599
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:29,791
[Wuth] There's no reason not to risk it.

600
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,583
Imagine if you were me.

601
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:36,666
If you gone through half of what I have,

602
00:48:38,125 --> 00:48:39,708
you'll be right where I am.

603
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:42,708
Have you thought about that?

604
00:48:47,541 --> 00:48:50,208
[pocket rustles]

605
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:59,082
Do you really think you're gonna change
anything with what you're doing?

606
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:00,125
Hm?

607
00:49:00,833 --> 00:49:02,416
At least I'm doing something.

608
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:04,625
And the truth is,

609
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:06,500
if Bhoom was alive,

610
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:09,374
I wouldn't have to be here.

[ominous music]

612
00:49:16,791 --> 00:49:17,958
Is it really worth it?

613
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:21,750
I might end your life today, kid.

614
00:49:23,541 --> 00:49:24,958
[Wuth] And if I just vanished?

615
00:49:27,291 --> 00:49:28,541
Then what happens?

616
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:33,083
Then someone will come and fight for me.

617
00:49:35,291 --> 00:49:37,041
Just like I'm fighting for Bhoom.

618
00:49:43,375 --> 00:49:44,666
[Wuth] I'm dying to know,

619
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:46,833
if it weren't me sitting here,

620
00:49:47,541 --> 00:49:48,791
but maybe your mom,

621
00:49:49,416 --> 00:49:52,000
or your wife, your baby,

622
00:49:53,416 --> 00:49:55,958
would you dare do the same to them
as you're doing to me?

623
00:49:58,333 --> 00:49:59,500
You're a killer.

624
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,582

[Wuth] <i>Breakfast is ready, Bhoom.</i>

629
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,791
Gotta eat, you know?

630
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:12,957
[Bhoom] Look at this, Wuth.

631
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:14,999
Eaun just sent this over to me.

632
00:51:15,083 --> 00:51:16,708
All these documents prove...

633
00:51:18,125 --> 00:51:20,041
the Thai government
and a bunch of executives

634
00:51:20,125 --> 00:51:21,958
are all involved in human trafficking.

635
00:51:39,708 --> 00:51:41,166
So, what are you going to do?

636
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:45,708
I have to tell everyone.

637
00:51:52,625 --> 00:51:54,708
- I'll be right back.
- [keys jangle]

638
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:57,875
Bhoom.

639
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:00,833
Have some breakfast first.

640
00:52:02,416 --> 00:52:03,708
I'll eat when I'm back.

641
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:05,583
[chuckles]

642
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:07,583
See you.

[car engine revving]

644
00:52:42,166 --> 00:52:43,750
What is your plan for him?

645
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:52,124
Leave him at the temple
where you're ordained,

646
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:53,416
and return by morning.

647
00:52:54,375 --> 00:52:55,583
That's the plan.

648
00:53:08,166 --> 00:53:09,875
You won't actually kill him?

649
00:53:13,416 --> 00:53:15,958
My job was to make Wuth disappear.

650
00:53:16,875 --> 00:53:18,041
Like Bhoom did.

651
00:53:19,708 --> 00:53:21,291
But I don't want to kill him.

652
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:25,375
I'm tired of sinning.

653
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:34,125
So, why kill to begin with?

654
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:39,916
I wasn't given a choice at the time.

655
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:43,791
But now, I have more freedom.

656
00:53:45,583 --> 00:53:46,791
'Cause I have you now.

657
00:54:03,958 --> 00:54:05,708
Do I have a choice anymore?

What is it?

659
00:54:22,958 --> 00:54:25,291

[car door closes]

00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:02,291
[Wuth] Untie me.

665
00:55:04,875 --> 00:55:06,125
Let's make a run for it.

666
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,500
Let's run, Sorn.

667
00:55:10,833 --> 00:55:17,499
STOP THE CAR

668
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:18,750
Let's let them through.

669
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:29,750
I need a help over here!

[suspenseful music]

671
00:55:43,458 --> 00:55:44,708
[Ji] We better split up.

Hey, come back.

673
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:54,166
I can't trust anyone.

674
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,416
I appreciate it.

Don't do that again.

You're nearly home again, Sorn.

Are you happy?

683
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,958
I don't want to go home, so no.

We're almost there, Wuth.

685

That's a lie.

00:57:22,791 --> 00:57:24,666
I heard everything back there.

00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:28,166
You killed Bhoom.

[Wuth sobbing]

690
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:31,250
[Wuth] You're a murderer.

691
00:57:32,333 --> 00:57:34,666
You know they asked me
to kill you too, right?

692
00:57:38,875 --> 00:57:41,166
I'm risking my life to save your ass.

693
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,291
[Ji] If I didn't help you cross
the border, you would get killed.

694
00:57:47,875 --> 00:57:49,333
And it wouldn't just be you either.

695
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:53,041
Everyone you care about
would be rounded up and murdered.

696
00:57:55,416 --> 00:57:57,166
You're welcome for helping you.

697
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,416
You're not helping anyone.

698
00:58:01,458 --> 00:58:03,957
It doesn't matter if I'm alive or dead.

699
00:58:04,041 --> 00:58:06,916
No one should be forced to disappear
just because he told the truth

about what's going on.

It's a short walk from here. Not far.

707
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:10,500
Can we take a break?

708
00:59:11,125 --> 00:59:12,208
What did you say?

709
00:59:12,708 --> 00:59:14,000
Can we take a break?

710
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:17,083
Fine. Sorn, stop here.

711
00:59:27,166 --> 00:59:28,083
[sighs]

712
00:59:30,625 --> 00:59:32,875
[bird trilling]

713
00:59:36,958 --> 00:59:38,291
This'll help you walk.

714
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:44,250
[handcuffs clinking]

715
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:53,166

01:00:41,541 --> 01:00:44,333
[sobbing continues]

719
01:00:52,833 --> 01:00:55,958
[all panting]

720
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:07,375
- [rifle cocks]
- [Yoon] Who are you? Put your hands up.

721
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:10,958
Ji, Wuth, put your hands up.

722
01:01:20,291 --> 01:01:21,291
Hi, Yoon.

723
01:01:23,458 --> 01:01:24,541
Hey, Wan.

724
01:01:25,583 --> 01:01:28,499
[footsteps approaching]

725
01:01:28,583 --> 01:01:29,916
Tie them up.

726
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,916
- Come on. Come on. Come here.
- Come.

727
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:37,875
[ominous music]

728
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:55,708
You're Wan, right?

729
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,625
[chief] What the fuck were you thinking?
Why'd you come back?

730
01:02:05,375 --> 01:02:06,583
Why'd you desert?

731
01:02:08,916 --> 01:02:11,125
Being a soldier was really that bad, huh?

732
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Hm?

733
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:17,291
Why aren't you answering me?

734
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:26,291
You bastard!

735
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:27,750
You're such a coward.

736
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:32,250
You escaped all alone,

737
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:36,333
and left your family fighting
for autonomy all alone.

738
01:02:38,666 --> 01:02:40,791
Because of people like you,

739
01:02:41,458 --> 01:02:43,750
we've never won a fight against Myanmar.

740
01:02:47,625 --> 01:02:50,124
All right, guys, lock him up on his own.

741
01:02:50,208 --> 01:02:51,208
[soldiers] Yes, sir.

742
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:53,125
[thwacks]

743
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:05,250
[Sorn panting]

744
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:18,250
Yoon.

745
01:03:25,375 --> 01:03:26,375
Yoon.

746
01:03:29,541 --> 01:03:30,875
I'm still your friend.

747
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:41,791
Hey, Yoon.

748
01:03:43,083 --> 01:03:44,541
I'm still your friend.

749
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:00,916
Hey, Yoon, are you gonna
leave me like this?

750
01:04:02,458 --> 01:04:05,291
You came back for what exactly, you idiot?

751
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:10,333
You don't wanna kill me.

752
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:14,333
So that I can keep living...

753
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,041
and keep suffering.

754
01:04:20,875 --> 01:04:22,750
You want me to go into hiding.

755
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:30,750
Because it feels better to you
than killing me and being done with it.

756
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:32,833
[Ji sighs]

757
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:38,708
But it's too late for you
to find absolution.

758
01:04:43,416 --> 01:04:44,833
You killed a man.

759
01:04:47,791 --> 01:04:49,333
And he'll never come back.

760
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,708
[rapid footsteps]

761
01:05:01,166 --> 01:05:03,166

763
01:05:26,833 --> 01:05:28,541
[explosion in distance]

764
01:05:31,916 --> 01:05:34,375
[birds squawking]

765
01:05:41,291 --> 01:05:43,416
[Wuth] I think you better do
what your boss says.

766
01:05:44,791 --> 01:05:45,791
[Wuth scoffs]

767
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:53,791
Just kill me.

768
01:05:57,833 --> 01:05:59,125
Don't you get it?

769
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,375
[Ji] I spared your life.

770
01:06:05,416 --> 01:06:07,333
And brought you all the way here

771
01:06:08,666 --> 01:06:09,958
to quit that gig.

772
01:06:11,291 --> 01:06:13,416
[snickers]

773
01:06:15,416 --> 01:06:16,541
You quit, huh?

774
01:06:19,708 --> 01:06:23,291
[Wuth scoffs] Have you finally realized
you're serving a fucked-up system?

775
01:06:23,375 --> 01:06:24,875
[explosion in distance]

776
01:06:26,458 --> 01:06:28,457
The thing you have to know is that,

777
01:06:28,541 --> 01:06:32,416
that someday, this majorly
fucked-up system will collapse.

778
01:06:33,708 --> 01:06:35,125
And you'll go down with it.

779
01:06:42,083 --> 01:06:43,333
[Ji] Someone's coming. Hide.

780
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,041
Stay here.

781
01:06:47,375 --> 01:06:50,083
[fighting grunts]

782
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:54,708
[both grunting, groaning]

783
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:07,500
[foreboding music]

784
01:07:08,708 --> 01:07:11,041
[grunting]

785
01:07:15,416 --> 01:07:16,583
- [thwacks]
- [grunts]

786
01:07:19,958 --> 01:07:22,041
[Wuth panting]

787
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:27,250
[heavy breathing]

788
01:07:42,416 --> 01:07:44,291
[soldier grunting]

- [thwacks]
- [thuds]

791
01:08:00,916 --> 01:08:02,832
What are they trying to do?

792
01:08:02,916 --> 01:08:06,458
I told them to go back to Thailand.
Why did they come back here?

793
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:09,249
They aren't going back to Thailand.

794
01:08:09,333 --> 01:08:12,958
They came all this way to go
to the temple, so he can join.

795
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:14,875
Oh.

796
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:16,916
Here, we can stop.

797
01:08:25,541 --> 01:08:27,207
[Yoon] So, what's your next move?

798
01:08:27,291 --> 01:08:29,083
[Sorn] I don't know. What's next, Ji?

799
01:08:35,916 --> 01:08:37,333
[Ji] I'll leave Wuth to you.

800
01:08:39,041 --> 01:08:40,500
You take him the rest of the way.

801
01:08:43,291 --> 01:08:44,458
As for me,

802
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:47,333
I have to go back to Thailand.

803
01:08:48,541 --> 01:08:50,791
If the sun rises and I'm not back,

804
01:08:51,541 --> 01:08:52,875
we're all in trouble.

805
01:09:06,625 --> 01:09:08,208
If I take you back to Thailand,

806
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:13,708
I'd kill you.

807
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:18,958
I would have no choice.

808
01:09:23,375 --> 01:09:24,541
You need to stay.

809
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:27,416
For your own good.

810
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:37,166
This bag has all of your belongings.

811
01:09:55,916 --> 01:09:56,916
Hey, Wan.

812
01:09:57,666 --> 01:09:59,333
You know what has to be done, right?

813
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,625
What are you saying?

814
01:10:03,541 --> 01:10:06,083
[Yoon] I'm saying they can't know
I helped you.

815
01:10:10,833 --> 01:10:11,750
Mm.

816
01:10:16,458 --> 01:10:20,333
[Sorn] Ji, you need to shoot him
in the shoulder.

817
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:27,416
Let's use my pistol. It's more realistic.

818
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,583
[pistol cocks]

819
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:31,875
Cover your ears.

820
01:10:35,041 --> 01:10:36,583

- [gasps]

821
01:10:49,458 --> 01:10:51,958

[sighs]

825
01:11:45,875 --> 01:11:47,166
[exhales deeply]

826
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:55,416
[Wuth] I don't think I can walk anymore.

827
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:58,750
[Sorn] Just keep going,
we'll be there soon.

828
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:01,375
[Wuth] What does that mean?

829
01:12:04,791 --> 01:12:07,708
[Sorn] It means stop complaining
and keep on walking.

830
01:12:24,666 --> 01:12:25,666
Come on, Wuth.

831
01:12:27,041 --> 01:12:28,000
Let's go.

832
01:12:39,166 --> 01:12:41,375
Come on, let's get in the water.

833
01:12:49,458 --> 01:12:50,875
Take off your clothes and get in.

834
01:12:55,083 --> 01:12:57,083
[water trickling]

835
01:13:34,583 --> 01:13:35,625
Get in.

836
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:37,708
[Wuth] Just a second.

837
01:13:59,208 --> 01:14:00,875
It's cold.
[shudders]

838
01:14:03,833 --> 01:14:04,791
Hey.

839
01:14:05,416 --> 01:14:06,416
Really?

840
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:08,374
Come on.

841
01:14:08,458 --> 01:14:10,458
[birds chirping]

842
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:26,625
[Wuth] I'm not sure
if I'm gonna miss Thailand while I'm here.

843
01:14:29,625 --> 01:14:32,250
Who knows, maybe I'll miss Thailand a lot.

844
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:38,208
[Sorn] I thought you hated Thailand.

845
01:14:39,583 --> 01:14:41,666
[Wuth] How can I hate my homeland?

846
01:14:47,166 --> 01:14:48,583
[Wuth] I love my homeland.

847
01:14:51,583 --> 01:14:53,208
I want to make it better.

848
01:14:57,208 --> 01:14:59,000
I want to live a good life.

849
01:15:03,125 --> 01:15:05,458
I want to be with the people I love.

850
01:15:14,041 --> 01:15:17,041
[Sorn] I don't even know
where my home is anymore.

851
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:27,125
[breathes deeply]

852
01:15:40,458 --> 01:15:41,583
[Wuth] It's okay.

[rain pattering in distance]

859
01:18:06,291 --> 01:18:07,916
- [Wuth] I hold it like this?
- [Sorn] Yeah.

860
01:18:08,791 --> 01:18:10,124
[Wuth] Should I hold it tight?

861
01:18:10,208 --> 01:18:12,374
- [Sorn] Yeah, like that.
- [Wuth] Okay.

862
01:18:12,458 --> 01:18:15,874
[Sorn] After that,
you should twist to roll the fabric.

863
01:18:15,958 --> 01:18:17,000
[Wuth] Like this?

864
01:18:17,583 --> 01:18:19,041
[Sorn] Hold it, pull it tight.

865
01:18:19,125 --> 01:18:20,666
[Wuth] Like this, right? Roll it this way?

866
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:22,582
- [Sorn] Yep.
- [Wuth] Do I need to raise it this high?

867
01:18:22,666 --> 01:18:24,458
- [Sorn] Not quite that high, no.
- [Wuth] Okay.

868
01:18:27,333 --> 01:18:29,083
- Like this?
- [Sorn] Yeah.

869
01:18:29,666 --> 01:18:32,541
- And then, you go...
- I take my arm out, right? That way.

870
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:34,457
[rain pattering]

871
01:18:34,541 --> 01:18:35,874
- Exactly.
- And then?

872
01:18:35,958 --> 01:18:37,875
Then it goes right this way.

873
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,208
[chuckles]

01:18:48,041 --> 01:18:50,375
[chuckles]
Am I pretty, Mrs. Sorn?

876
01:19:02,541 --> 01:19:05,500
I wonder if living here
will distract me from everything.

877
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:11,833
Just take your time to adjust.

878
01:19:12,625 --> 01:19:16,791
Consider this to be like...
to be like your second home.

879
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:21,957
Hm.

880
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:23,541
I'll have to do that, I guess.

881
01:19:29,083 --> 01:19:31,666
[breathes deeply]

01:19:32,291 --> 01:19:34,291
[bell ringing in distance]

01:19:47,041 --> 01:19:48,125
This is for you.

884
01:19:51,666 --> 01:19:53,166
Ji left it for you.

885
01:20:14,458 --> 01:20:16,125

[keys jangling]

889
01:22:00,375 --> 01:22:02,791
[car approaching]

890
01:22:11,375 --> 01:22:12,458
[groans]

891
01:22:25,041 --> 01:22:26,458
[lock clanks]

892
01:22:33,833 --> 01:22:35,125

894
01:24:15,333 --> 01:24:17,708
[background chatter]

895
01:24:24,833 --> 01:24:26,958
Bee, are you okay?

896
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:33,125
You haven't heard from Sorn yet, huh?

897
01:24:35,416 --> 01:24:36,375
Not a word.

898
01:24:38,208 --> 01:24:39,625
Did you report him missing?

899
01:24:42,125 --> 01:24:44,541
He's illegal. It's pointless to try.

900
01:24:45,083 --> 01:24:46,416
The police won't care.

901
01:24:50,208 --> 01:24:51,791
Even if they did care,

902
01:24:52,833 --> 01:24:54,416
he's still undocumented.

903
01:24:55,458 --> 01:24:56,666
Ah, damn it.

904
01:24:57,541 --> 01:24:59,250
That really sucks, I'm sorry.

905
01:25:00,291 --> 01:25:03,583
Well, you should stay
with Daddy Meng for a while.

906
01:25:04,458 --> 01:25:06,791
'Cause he does pay you really well,
if nothing else.

907
01:25:11,458 --> 01:25:12,541
Look, honey.

908
01:25:13,416 --> 01:25:16,332
He's offered you so much
that you haven't taken.

909
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:18,624
Like a condo, and a car, and a...

910
01:25:18,708 --> 01:25:21,791
Whatever it is, just take it
and thank him for it.

911
01:25:21,875 --> 01:25:23,666
Especially with COVID, you know?

912
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:28,750
Accept them now,
and then start over with your man.

913
01:25:37,333 --> 01:25:38,416
Hey, what are you...

914
01:25:40,291 --> 01:25:42,958
[background chatter]

915
01:25:46,333 --> 01:25:49,083
They hired you to be here,
so stop pouting.

916
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,166
I'm getting in.

917
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:59,124
I'm back! Whoo!

918
01:25:59,208 --> 01:26:01,458
[all whooping]

919
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:05,291
Huh? Here I come!

920
01:26:05,375 --> 01:26:06,416
Yeah!

921
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,499
- [laughter]
- [indistinct chatter]

922
01:26:08,583 --> 01:26:10,625
All right! Okay!

923
01:26:33,583 --> 01:26:35,541
- [customer] Hey there.
- Hello, sir.

924
01:26:35,625 --> 01:26:37,707
- [customer] How much?
- How about 2k?

925
01:26:37,791 --> 01:26:39,500
[customer scoffs]
Come on, this economy?

926
01:26:41,583 --> 01:26:42,750
Twelve hundred baht.

927
01:26:44,166 --> 01:26:45,333
[customer] One thousand.

928
01:26:47,583 --> 01:26:48,666
Okay, yeah.

929
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:51,041
[customer] Okay, what are you
gonna do for that?

930
01:26:51,666 --> 01:26:53,333
Anything you want, I'll do.

931
01:26:55,125 --> 01:26:56,250
[customer] Get in.

932
01:27:37,916 --> 01:27:39,583
It's tiring, being poor.

933
01:27:41,375 --> 01:27:43,250
- [Sorn] It's fine.
- [Bee chuckles]

934
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:45,583
Yeah, you would say that.

935
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:54,291
So, what would an easy life be like?

936
01:27:55,083 --> 01:27:56,166
Hmm...

937
01:27:56,958 --> 01:27:59,791
Well, if I were rich,

938
01:28:00,583 --> 01:28:02,291
we could be anything.

939
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:05,707
We could go to a luxurious hotel,

940
01:28:05,791 --> 01:28:07,582
<i>and eat as much shrimps and crabs
as we want.</i>

941
01:28:07,666 --> 01:28:08,791
<i>How about that?</i>

942
01:28:20,041 --> 01:28:21,458
Let's negotiate.

943

[inspector] Som.

946
01:28:52,833 --> 01:28:53,875
Inspector.

947
01:28:54,625 --> 01:28:55,750
Have you heard from Ji?

948
01:28:56,458 --> 01:28:57,416
[inspector] Not yet.

949
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:01,375
But I've ordered everyone
to look into it as a matter of urgency.

950
01:29:03,083 --> 01:29:04,666
You don't have to wait here.

951
01:29:15,958 --> 01:29:17,957
