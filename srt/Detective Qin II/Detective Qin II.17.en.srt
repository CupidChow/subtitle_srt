1
00:00:33,023 --> 00:00:36,044
=Detective Qin II=

2
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:38,988
=Episode 17=

3
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,520
This is the evil god statue?

4
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,120
You don't believe it, do you?

5
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,840
I don't believe in them.

6
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,160
I'm simply relaying the rumors.

7
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,400
It doesn't mean I believe.

8
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,920
Who made this?

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,240
Why is the face covered with cloth?

10
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,120
It's said the ones seeing the evil god

11
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,960
will die within three days,

12
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,680
as miserably as Qian Hansheng died.

13
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,360
So Mr. Qian

14
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,720
saw the evil god statue

15
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,680
and then died?

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,000
Can you please stop echoing each other?

17
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,600
About what's underneath,

18
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,160
can't we go down and look?

19
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,360
Detective He,

20
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,320
you're a police officer, you go.

21
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,160
Bao Long.

22
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,080
Boss.

23
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,120
What did you say you found just now?

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,360
Boss, after thorough search,

25
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,760
I noticed just one carpet
in the living room.

26
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,320
Any clues?

27
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,960
Nothing much, just the usual.

28
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,880
I don't believe monsters and demons.

29
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,600
Let's go have a look at Mr. Qian's body.

30
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,400
How smelly! What's that smell?

31
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,160
It rained heavily last night.

32
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,760
Water exposure hastened bodily decay.

33
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,200
The stab wounds are facing downwards.

34
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,520
Obviously,

35
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,160
the attacker thrust upward.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,200
So the assailant must be

37
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,640
much shorter than the victim.

38
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,000
Moreover,

39
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,400
there might be another possibility.

40
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,600
Perhaps the assailant was

41
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,760
crouching or sitting on the ground.

42
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,600
Mr. Qian was killed with a single stab.

43
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,440
The knife wound patterns are neat.

44
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,320
No property loss was found.

45
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,920
We do not rule out

46
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,760
he may have known the murderer.

47
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,200
The victim's skin is grayish-white,

48
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,280
swelling in the belly area.

49
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,440
Strange, why would it be this color?

50
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,560
Be careful.

51
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,480
Get down.

52
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,840
Do you think

53
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,640
the charred blanket
in front of the evil god statue

54
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,760
is the same as this one?

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,680
Actually, there was a person inside

56
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,600
It seems evil god

57
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,480
doesn't want us to know too much.

58
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,120
Some traces can't be completely hidden.

59
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,279
- Bao Long.
- Yes.

60
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,440
Go out and bring help.

61
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,320
Yes, sir.

62
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,320
It seems someone else should be here.

63
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,520
This person is the key to the case.

64
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,320
Ensure timely medication.

65
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,480
The symptoms should improve.

66
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,320
Thank you, Dr. Chu.

67
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,640
Mr. Chu,
why did Qin Yang's illness worsen?

68
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,520
The side effects of scopolamine

69
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,880
came sooner than I expected.

70
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,560
This medicine can't be used anymore.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,080
Don't listen to him.

72
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,640
The medicine brings me comfort.

73
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,800
Otherwise, when it rains,

74
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,920
I feel worse than death.

75
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,880
What Mr. Chu said

76
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,240
you have a mental illness?

77
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,040
What's this all about?

78
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,600
Why are you afraid of the rain?

79
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,320
That's all in the past.

80
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,560
Let's skip that.

81
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,440
What is that?

82
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,880
This is from that assistant just now.

83
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,440
The medicine is bitter,

84
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,520
so he left me this.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,240
And I am leaving it for you.

86
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,560
I understand.

87
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,600
I know why Mr. Qian self-ignited.

88
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,680
The black powder we saw in the morgue

89
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,360
is actually burnt sugar.

90
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,280
How could there be sugar there?

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,920
Potassium chlorate.

92
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,960
It is tasteless.

93
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,600
But it emits a pungent odor
when it decomposes.

94
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,160
That's what we smelled in the morgue.

95
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,600
Sugar and potassium chlorate
can ignite upon contact.

96
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,960
Everyone, step back.

97
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,320
What is this?

98
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,680
It actually has such power.

99
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,680
Far more effective than lime powder.

100
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,720
If I could carry some in my bag...

101
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,120
Be careful.

102
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,720
It is intrinsically unstable.

103
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,120
Before you tossed it,

104
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,080
it might've lit already.

105
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,040
Potassium chlorate,

106
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,640
can ordinary people get it?

107
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,800
Latest news,

108
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,160
the afternoon before Qian Hansheng died

109
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,160
he took Miss Qian to the photo studio.

110
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,120
I remember now.

111
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,360
It needs potassium chlorate
for photography!

112
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,200
At four in the afternoon,

113
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,120
Mr. Qian brought Miss Qian here
for photos.

114
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,600
They left about half an hour later.

115
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,160
You have so many customers every day.

116
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,720
For each of them,

117
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,120
you remember when they came?

118
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,640
No, they left deep impression.

119
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,720
In my shop,

120
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,000
they had a big fight.

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,240
I feared it'd harm business.

122
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,520
So I kept looking at my watch.

123
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,240
What was the fight about?

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,800
I don't know.

125
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,920
Anyway, Mr. Qian slapped Miss Qian.

126
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,560
Miss Qian had her picture taken
after wiping away tears.

127
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,760
That expression was...

128
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,960
I'll find it for you.

129
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,040
For every customer,

130
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,560
I keep a photo.

131
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,760
For advertising.

132
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,760
Oh, there was another strange thing.

133
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,920
What?

134
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,600
I remember it rained heavily that night.

135
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,840
Coming.

136
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,320
Isn't this Miss Qian?

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
How did you get so drenched?

138
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,720
Dad sent me here for photos.

139
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,240
Photos are always picked the next day.

140
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,160
Dose Mr. Qian needs them urgently?

141
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,280
Give me the photos.

142
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,600
The rain is heavy.

143
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,960
Come in and take a seat.

144
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,120
Give me the photos.

145
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,480
Twelve o'clock?

146
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,919
Mr. Qian's approximate time of death.

147
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,440
Miss Qian is actually
Mr. Qian's adopted daughter.

148
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,560
And it's said Mr. Qian worships
an evil god.

149
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,600
Who knows what Mr. Qian intended to do
to Miss Qian?

150
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,120
I've found the photo.

151
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,080
How could this be?

152
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,800
My negatives were clearly fine.

153
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,760
(Fire god disrespects burn

154
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,280
