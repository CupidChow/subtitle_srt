00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:35,936
=Detective Qin II=

2
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:38,976
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,680
You were the first to find the body.

4
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,160
- Take away.
- Okay.

5
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,080
How can you arrest people at will?

6
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,440
What's wrong with it?

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,360
Ghosts claim lives, right?

8
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,440
Nonsense!

9
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,200
The troupe leader
was certainly murdered.

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,280
And I have heard that

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,080
you made a fuss as soon as
you entered the theater.

12
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,880
You insisted on drawing the curtains.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,880
Therefore,

14
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,560
I have enough reason to suspect that

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:06,920
you

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,840
are the prime suspect
in this murder case.

17
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,040
Take me back to the station?

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,120
Let me be beaten into submission

19
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,960
to settle this case?

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,800
I don't care whether
you are the prime murderer

21
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,600
in this murder case.

22
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,840
I, He Hongfeng,

23
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,840
just dislike you people

24
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,280
who deceive with trickery.

25
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,400
Detective He.

26
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,960
You seem very confident about this case.

27
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,560
How about I read your fortune?

28
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,880
Okay.

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,720
I want to see

30
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,120
what pearls of wisdom
we can expect from you.

31
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,040
You must have been an army recruit.

32
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,120
Did you desert and run away here?

33
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,160
You must have spent numerous money

34
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,920
to become this captain, right?

35
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,760
By the way,

36
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,120
you need to get your stomach fixed.

37
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,840
It's not good to put it off.

38
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,280
I'm not a deserter.

39
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,560
Thus, everything else is accurate?

40
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,000
You checked me out.

41
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,160
It's just simple face reading.

42
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,040
Deceptive talk. Take him away.

43
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,120
Since you want to arrest him,

44
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,520
take me away too.

45
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,080
I am with them.

46
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,280
Miss Shen, you...

47
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,800
Yes, and me.

48
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,000
You...

49
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,440
Take them all away.

50
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,440
How about Mr. Shen...?

51
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,400
Upon arrival,

52
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,800
you should serve Miss Shen well.

53
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,000
Go.

54
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,880
Step back.

55
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,720
Alright.

56
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,920
Further away.

57
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,440
Turn your head.

58
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,080
The face-reading was really amazing.

59
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,240
Can you teach me?

60
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,520
He Hongfeng's right hand
has thick calluses

61
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,680
on both sides of his fingers.

62
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,480
This is caused by
years of pulling the trigger.

63
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,480
But policemen also need to hold guns.

64
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,720
They use pistols.

65
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,040
He Hongfeng's left palm and four fingers

66
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,480
also have obvious calluses.

67
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,120
This is left from
holding a rifle for a long time.

68
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,880
When he came close to me,

69
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,120
his right collarbone was sunken.

70
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,400
It's caused by the recoil from

71
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,320
years of rifle use.

72
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,680
Therefore, he's not just a soldier,

73
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,360
but a veteran.

74
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,160
Then how do you know he's a deserter?

75
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,200
I heard that

76
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,320
Sichuan Warlord Liu Xiang
once established an army,

77
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,800
called Shenji Army.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,880
Each of them wore a medal

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,720
with a swastika pattern engraved on it.

80
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,120
I noticed at his waist,

81
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,360
he also wore one.

82
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,120
Only the inscription
on the medal was scratched.

83
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,920
Most of this unit died,

84
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,760
so if he is not a deserter,

85
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,320
he must be hiding something.

86
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,160
What about the stomach disease?

87
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,840
He has bad breath.

88
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,240
You're sick too.

89
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,720
I don't have bad breath.

90
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,120
Brush your teeth carefully.

91
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,080
Miss Shen, take care.

92
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,640
Slow down.

93
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,960
Sir, he is here.

94
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,000
You really treat here
like your own detective agency?

95
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,000
Do I?

96
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,360
This shabby little place

97
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,160
is worse than my detective agency.

98
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,840
Just ask me quickly.

99
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,720
I need to get back to sleep.

100
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,480
The police station's food is so good.

101
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,880
Delicious!

102
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,040
Don't just stare.

103
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,280
Go ahead and enjoy it. Don't be shy.

104
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,640
You... How did you get to know Qin Yang?

105
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,680
We've been neighbors since childhood.

106
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,440
Three years ago,
my parents entrusted me to him.

107
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,880
And then they never came back.

108
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
They are tomb raiders.

109
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,280
They probably died in some tomb.

110
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,520
I'm sorry. I...

111
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,440
It's okay, I'm not upset.

112
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,600
They say grave robbing is a sin.

113
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,960
They must have foreseen this result.

114
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,320
Over three years,

115
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,840
I have sought to be his student

116
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,520
to learn various skills.

117
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,920
Then to find their remains

118
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,840
and bury them.

119
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,040
Although he refused,

120
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,760
this doesn't hinder his status

121
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,960
as a hero in my heart.

122
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,480
He? A Hero?

123
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,760
Why are you going to theater?

124
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,600
Just to watch plays.

125
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,880
Is it illegal to bring two girls?

126
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,200
You are so shameless.

127
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,880
From the beginning, I disagreed

128
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,360
to let Miss Shen follow you.

129
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,840
This is what you've been
giving me a hard time for.

130
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,080
If it weren't for the
fifty dollars each month,

131
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,360
I wouldn't want my little broken temple

132
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,840
to accommodate such a young lady.

133
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,480
Think it carefully.

134
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,160
Do you think Qin Xiaoyang
is just for the money?

135
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,120
Or else?

136
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,560
Actually, he is a very
great and kind person.

137
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,240
However, he has run the
detective agency into such a state.

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,040
There used to be quite
a few people coming to him.

139
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,320
While he only takes on
some strange cases.

140
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,120
Faced with many poor people,

141
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,840
he also chooses to help for free.

142
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,280
Even with that,

143
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,960
it's not like he can't pay the rent.

144
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,400
I don't know about that.

145
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,640
Maybe...

146
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,760
He's saving money to get married.

147
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,080
Are you still eating that?

148
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,320
Here you are.

149
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,360
Stop the nonsense.

150
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,280
Tell me what you know.

151
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,680
If I were you,

152
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,120
I would focus on checking

153
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,760
the truth behind the
Wutong's death three years ago.

154
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,920
I don't believe in
female ghost claiming lives.

155
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,040
It's up to you.

156
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,480
However,

157
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,520
maybe someone who's
been dead for three years

158
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,680
does come back for revenge suddenly.

159
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,800
Get me some water.

160
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:18,688
(Honest and just)

161
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Did He Hongfeng give you a hard time?

162
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,400
I'm helping the police with a case.

163
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,400
Why would they give me a hard time?

164
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,240
