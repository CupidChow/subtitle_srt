00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:36,000
=Detective Qin II=

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,976
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,720
My mom died from an illness

4
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,880
when I was a kid.

5
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,480
Rou.

6
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,720
This is the Obscure Market.

7
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,720
Anything is possible.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,920
It can even help you communicate
with the dead

9
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,560
and let you see the person
you most want to see.

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,280
Come over here. Let me give you a hug.

11
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,000
Make her take the medicine.

12
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,000
Three-Eyes, it's been a while.

13
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,960
You really see yourself as Yang Jian

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,960
Qin,

15
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,960
I truly didn't know

16
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,520
this girl was your girlfriend.

17
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,800
If she's fine,

18
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,840
it's alright.

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,200
If anything happens to her,

20
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,200
you'll be in trouble.

21
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,520
Qin, that narcotic doesn't have
such strong effects.

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,000
You're awake?

23
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,520
Are you okay?

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,440
I'm fine. Thank you.

25
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,440
Good to hear that.

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,400
You are worth fifty silver dollars
a month.

27
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,640
Luckily I arrived in time.

28
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,960
Otherwise,

29
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,600
you'd have been sold to a brothel.

30
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,640
We can't just let this slide, right?

31
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,199
Alright, I need to ask you
about something.

32
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,880
Qin.

33
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,640
Whether to abduct or to hit kids,

34
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,800
as long as you need,

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,920
I can provide everything.

36
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,240
Who has bought Datura metel recently?

37
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,640
Qin, the Obscure Market
has its own rules.

38
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,120
Aren't you making things
difficult for me?

39
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,640
Do you know who she is?

40
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,400
She is Shen Rou.

41
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,520
Her dad was the former police chief,
Shen Zhenhai.

42
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,840
You've offended her this time.

43
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,600
Do you know the consequences?

44
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,640
Qin.

45
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,880
The rules of the Obscure Market

46
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,200
are that there are no rules.

47
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,160
You want to spew saliva at me, huh?

48
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,480
The account book.

49
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,480
Read it as you like.

50
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,560
I may

51
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,800
do anything,

52
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,560
but I still need to protect myself.

53
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,000
Everyone who buys medicine here

54
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,280
must sign their names,

55
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,760
just in case of a situation
like today's.

56
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,960
How does the person look?

57
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,120
Definitely prettier than her.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I couldn't see her face

59
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,600
but I could still feel her charm.

60
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,080
Anything more detailed?

61
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,200
Right,

62
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,480
it seems she writes with her left hand.

63
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,280
Mr. Qin, I'm not sure
if I should say this.

64
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,680
Cut the crap.

65
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,080
You're here

66
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,880
to investigate the case

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,600
of the female ghost taking lives?

68
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,600
I advise you to give up right now.

69
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,160
Why?

70
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,720
Aside from buying Datura metel,

71
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,200
she bought some other medicines.

72
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,800
(Bai Feng, clove, Datura metel)
I've heard that these medicines

73
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,160
can be used to create
the Mystery Powder.

74
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,400
Mystery Powder?

75
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,040
Yes, Mystery Powder.

76
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,640
With just a whiff,

77
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,440
you can see nature's mystery.

78
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,920
Actually,

79
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,280
it's just a type

80
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,040
of potent hallucinogenic narcotic.

81
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,280
And only the Night God Society
knows its formula.

82
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,240
The Night God Society again?

83
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,519
Qin, I advise you not
to investigate further.

84
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,560
You know the Night God Society
might commit

85
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,520
all kinds of evil.

86
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,560
Even you

87
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,880
might find them hard to deal with.

88
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,640
When did she come?

89
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,560
Five days ago.

90
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,080
I remember the opera troupe
also came five days ago.

91
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,120
Is the murderer in the opera troupe?

92
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,840
What is the Night God Society
that the guy just mentioned?

93
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,200
When the world is in chaos,

94
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,440
many monsters have emerged.

95
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,160
The Night God Society will stop
at nothing to amass wealth

96
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,920
and they have great ambitions.

97
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,280
This is indeed quite tough.

98
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,120
If even you think it's tough,

99
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,560
doesn't that mean...

100
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,680
He Hongfeng.

101
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,120
Someone in our police station

102
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,640
said you came to Obscure Market.

103
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,280
It wasn't me.

104
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,400
Let's hear it. What have you found?

105
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,640
A lot. You go first.

106
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,840
Okay.

107
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,200
Here's the deal.

108
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Let's exchange one piece of information
for one.

109
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,680
How does that sound?

110
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,480
Deal.

111
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,720
Come with me.

112
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,520
Miss Jingjing,

113
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,920
we're conducting an investigation.

114
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,720
It won't be convenient for you to go.

115
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,040
Besides,

116
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,040
our police station's meal expenses

117
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,800
have really gone over the budget.

118
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,760
Who said I was going with you?

119
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,080
I'll eat at home.

120
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,560
Alright. Let's go.

121
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,840
Detective He, you look haggard.

122
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,360
It seems the case is urgent.

123
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,680
Put away your face-reading tricks.

124
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,920
Although I'm cooperating with you,

125
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,720
it doesn't mean I believe your nonsense.

126
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,440
Now, the people in the city say

127
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,960
a female ghost is taking lives,

128
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,880
causing widespread panic.

129
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,600
The chief has given me an order

130
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,240
to solve the case within three days.

131
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,440
Tell me,

132
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,000
what's found in Obscure Market?

133
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,200
You go first.

134
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,520
Three years ago,

135
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,000
the troupe leader made Wutong
serve the guests.

136
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,600
Wutong refused.

137
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,240
And then those guests

138
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,360
beat her to death.

139
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,560
I've found out

140
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,920
that the deceased Mr. Wang was
at the scene back then.

141
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,120
According to the elders
in the opera troupe,

142
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,040
after she died,

143
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,120
her body was thrown
into the Mass Grave Hill.

144
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,440
I sent someone there

145
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,240
and they found the body.

146
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,760
Do you have the exact time
of Wutong's death

147
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,840
and her birth time?

148
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,040
Those records

149
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,000
cannot be shown to you.

150
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,000
Just to solve the case.

151
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:20,627
(Deceased: Wutong)

152
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,816
(People involved:
Bai Feng, Li Dabai, Su Jiucai, Yu Dawei)

153
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,920
Shouldn't be.

154
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,640
How many guests were present that year?

155
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,320
Three.

156
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,720
Alright, I've said plenty.

157
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,480
It's your turn.

158
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,440
Mystery Powder.

159
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,440
Night God Society.

160
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,120
Who are you?

161
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,320
Who else could I be, Mr. Li?

162
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,240
You filthy woman.

163
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,760
