00:01:16,403 --> 00:01:19,616
(Joy)

4
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:53,888
(Joy)

5
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,920
The Underworld King takes a concubine.

6
00:02:11,155 --> 00:02:11,560
(Ex-police chief Shen Zhenhai)

7
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,400
Shen Rou did not return
for the whole night.

8
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,240
If anything happened to her,

9
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,880
you're done.

10
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:18,880
(Captain He Hongfeng)

11
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,600
Mr. Shen, please don't worry yet.

12
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,000
I've already sent people to search.

13
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,080
There will be news soon.

14
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,880
And you!

15
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,720
How do you even serve as a policeman?

16
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,640
How can a person just disappear?

17
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,560
What are you two waiting for?

18
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,120
Hurry up and find her!

19
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,400
Yes, sir!

20
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,040
We searched all day already.

21
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,680
Not a single clue is found.

22
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,960
How about you?

23
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,360
Even you found nothing, let alone me.

24
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,400
Then why do we go out of the city?

25
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,040
In the dead of night, I must add.

26
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,080
Jingjing, you're not even afraid
of disguising as a ghost.

27
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,800
- Are you afraid of the dark?
- Who said I was scared?

28
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,120
That was just...

29
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,160
What are you doing?

30
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,320
You almost pulled my pants off!

31
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,560
Paper money?

32
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,240
Red.

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,960
Red paper money!

34
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,960
Isn't this Shen Rou's purse?

35
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,640
Seems she has been here.

36
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,520
Who's there?

37
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,600
Me, me.

38
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,520
Liu Ping?

39
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,760
It's me, Liu Ping.

40
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Liu Ping, I've long suspected
there's something wrong with you.

41
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,280
Are you the Underworld King?

42
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,400
I am not.

43
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,320
You said the Underworld King's
taking a concubine.

44
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,120
I just wanted to have a look.

45
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,880
I wanted to see Lanlan once more.

46
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,760
When Sun Lanlan came back,

47
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,680
you even fainted.

48
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,560
You're not scared now?

49
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,160
That was before.

50
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,160
Whether she is dead or alive,

51
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,000
I want to see her one more time.

52
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,160
I

53
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,560
failed her.

54
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,880
How?

55
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
Actually,

56
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,480
the day she ran away from her wedding,

57
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,920
she came to me first.

58
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,320
Liu Ping, take me with you.

59
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,320
I don't want to marry someone
I don't know.

60
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,480
As long as you take me away,

61
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,760
I'm willing to be with you!

62
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,800
But my father is already old.

63
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,200
I have to take care of him.

64
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,080
Besides, eloping requires money.

65
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,520
The outside world is in turmoil now.

66
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,560
What if...

67
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,880
No "what ifs"!

68
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,800
How can you

69
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,040
still be a coward now?

70
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,760
Listen to me.

71
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,560
A wise man has given me...

72
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
The bride is here!

73
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,880
Liu Ping, don't let me down
like this anymore.

74
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,040
No matter what happens later,

75
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,080
wait for my return.

76
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,680
Lanlan, Lanlan!

77
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,000
Sun Lanlan asked you to wait for her?

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,880
Yes.

79
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,360
That's why I said Lanlan must have

80
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,000
something to tell me when she came back.

81
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,880
But I fainted from fear right then.

82
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,200
And I suspect there's something fishy
about her death.

83
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,920
She knew how to swim.

84
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,280
But she suddenly drowned.

85
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,280
That's just too odd.

86
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,960
Mr. Sun mentioned guidance from someone,

87
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,600
and Sun Lanlan said the same.

88
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,080
This can hardly be a coincidence.

89
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,160
Do you think

90
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,720
it's likely

91
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,280
that Sun Lanlan is not dead?

92
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,840
There's a legend about

93
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,520
a pill that induces a death-like state.

94
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,800
Maybe she took one of those.

95
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,560
That pill is not that miraculous.

96
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,440
It can only slow down a person's
pulse and heartbeat.

97
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,960
A qualified physician

98
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,040
would've seen through it.

99
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,920
Wait a minute.

100
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,880
That day, there was

101
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,000
a wandering physician by the riverbank.

102
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,640
He took Lanlan's pulse.

103
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,240
And after that, he said Lanlan was dead.

104
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,040
What else did he say?

105
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,360
He asked us to bury her as soon
as possible, for dying in red

106
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,720
is inauspicious.

107
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,720
I suppose he must be that person.

108
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,400
The bloody handprint on the windowsill

109
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,280
means she did go back to you.

110
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,360
But she must have been taken back.

111
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,720
Then the Lanlan I saw?

112
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,400
An illusion of yours.

113
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,720
In other words,
you scared yourself into fainting.

114
00:06:46,931 --> 00:06:50,336
(Soulless)

115
00:06:50,707 --> 00:06:51,968
(Soulless Village)

116
00:06:53,971 --> 00:06:57,640
(Soulless Village)

117
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,680
I get the chills wearing this at night.

118
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,120
Aren't you afraid of nothing?

119
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,600
Scared of wearing some clothes?

120
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,600
Shut up!

121
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,520
The night of the full moon,

122
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,520
an auspicious day.

123
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,360
Underworld King takes a concubine.

124
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,560
Paper men for wedding procession.

125
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,120
Sir.

126
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,960
You are late.

127
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,160
Just got out of the ground.

128
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,680
So we arrived a bit late.

129
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,560
This bunch is so bad.

130
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,680
Go on in, it has already started.

131
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,800
The night of the full moon,

132
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,960
an auspicious day.

133
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,640
Underworld King takes a concubine.

134
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,720
Paper men for wedding procession.

135
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,400
The night of the full moon,

136
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,240
an auspicious day.

137
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,960
Underworld King takes a concubine.

138
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,040
Paper men for wedding procession.

139
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,400
Gentlemen, you're in luck.

140
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,560
We recently received some new brides,

141
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,320
each one of the finest quality.

142
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,160
The same old rules.

143
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,800
Whoever offers the highest price
gets the pick.

144
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,400
So they use ghost marriage as a front.

145
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,000
They are trafficking women.

146
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,559
But the expressions of these girls

147
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,760
are so strange.

148
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,240
I think they've been poisoned.

149
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,240
It looks like they've overdosed
on dragon lychee.

150
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,960
Commonly known as "mad fruit".

151
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,320
It can cause muscle stiffness,

152
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,400
a vacant stare and blurry consciousness.

153
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,680
So it seems

154
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,320
Sun Lanlan was poisoned
by that evil physician.

155
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,920
After faking death,

156
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,160
they sneaked her here.

157
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,800
Truly malicious.

158
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,760
This is how the poisoner

159
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,880
control the poisoned.

160
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,440
If not treated in time,

161
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,320
in mild cases, organs are damaged,

162
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,520
and in severe cases,
it leads to immediate death.

163
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,080
Then Lanlan must be in great danger now.

164
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,320
Dear guests,

165
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,840
next up is our precious.

166
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,760
Just arrived yesterday,

167
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,200
the best of the best!

168
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,320
- It's Shen Rou!
- Don't move!

169
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,240
She's poisoned too. What should we do?
