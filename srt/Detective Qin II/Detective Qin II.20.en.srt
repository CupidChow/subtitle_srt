00:00:33,023 --> 00:00:36,044
=Detective Qin II=

2
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:38,988
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,640
Miss Qian, if you go now,

4
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,480
you may yet see him once more.

5
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,560
I know,

6
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,720
Mr. Chu drove me away intentionally.

7
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,640
Intentionally?

8
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,520
I don't want to make him upset.

9
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,240
So I will listen to him,

10
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,920
live well,

11
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,640
be a doctor, cure the sick, save lives.

12
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,640
I know it all.

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,040
He is the

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,600
gentlest person in the world.

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,520
Miss Yuan,

16
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,160
Mr. Qin,

17
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,360
thank you very much.

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,040
Then, I'll be going.

19
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
Farewell.

20
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,200
The time has come, execute immediately!

21
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,200
Why did you bring me here?

22
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,880
Her name is Yaya.

23
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,800
Two years ago,
while probing a trafficking ring,

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
the bunch of animals,
to destroy evidence,

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,640
smothered all the children to death.

26
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,160
By the time I got there,

27
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,400
only she was still alive.

28
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,320
Mr. Qin, look, I defeated the monster!

29
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,040
Yaya, you're amazing!

30
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,080
Go and play.

31
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,840
That boy's name is Dongdong.

32
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,080
His parents were killed by bandits

33
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,840
who disguised as monsters.

34
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,320
Dongdong hid in a water tank, survived,

35
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,200
but witnessed everything.

36
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,720
Apart from them,

37
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,480
there're other kids in the orphanage

38
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,720
whose lives are tragic.

39
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,400
Once people turn evil,

40
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,520
they can be much worse than monsters.

41
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,160
Thus, you're money-hungry

42
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,640
for helping these orphans here?

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,760
I once wanted to help all the weak

44
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,480
and settle all the injustices.

45
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,360
But there are so many injustices.

46
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,640
How could I handle them all by myself?

47
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,480
So I can only do as much as I am able

48
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,200
to help those who need help.

49
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,560
At least, save a few kids like Yaya.

50
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,760
Help all the weak,

51
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,480
and settle all the injustices?

52
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,600
You...

53
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,400
There are no wholly evil in the world.

54
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,480
Only unforgivable humans.

55
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,080
The truth of all demons

56
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,880
is merely a result of people's actions.

57
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,400
Good and evil, right and wrong,

58
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,160
how can they be clearly defined?

59
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,400
Indeed, the old me wouldn't
have helped Doctor Chu

60
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,480
to conceal the truth.

61
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,760
Perhaps you have changed me.

62
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,120
(At first, I thought you were just)

63
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,560
(a swindler.)

64
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,399
(But later I found out)

65
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,800
(you were solving the case
in a different way,)

66
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,399
(bringing justice to light.)

67
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,040
(Qin Yang,)

68
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,000
(it's great to have met you.)

69
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,120
According to Chu Jiangping,

70
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,360
this is where Night God Society

71
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,800
stores their Mystery Powder.

72
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's go.

73
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,480
We're counting on you, Jingjing.

74
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,440
No problem.

75
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,760
Who's there?

76
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,520
Skulking around.

77
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,480
Come out!

78
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,640
It's a ghost!

79
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,120
This is boring.

80
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,320
Qin Yang, come take a look.

81
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,720
They are trafficking girls

82
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,200
while also dealing in these drugs,

83
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,960
in order to exploit all sorts of desires

84
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,200
to manipulate the powerful elite

85
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,600
as well as the common people.

86
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,480
They expand their influence in this way.

87
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,360
They may seek their portion amid chaos

88
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,560
to become a local warlord.

89
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,800
- Where?
- Right over there.

90
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,600
Qin Yang, I'm exposed!

91
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,360
Help, Qin Yang!

92
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,480
Stop right there.

93
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,880
Qin Yang, come quickly!

94
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,600
I can't hold on any longer!

95
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,880
For calling me ugly!

96
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,120
I'll beat you!

97
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,240
