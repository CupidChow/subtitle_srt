=Detective Qin II=

2
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:38,912
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,440
- It's Shen Rou.
- Don't move.

4
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,360
She's poisoned too. What to do?

5
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm in for fifty taels.

6
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,000
A hundred taels here.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,960
Five hundred taels here.

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,320
Come on, darling.

9
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,080
They outnumber us.
We have to outsmart them.

10
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,080
I'll go and stall them.

11
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,320
You two wait here for me.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,800
Where is Liu Ping?

13
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,160
Lanlan. Lanlan.

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,280
It's me, Liu Ping.

15
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,920
What happened to you, Lanlan?

16
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,720
Lanlan.

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,480
She has been poisoned,

18
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,680
and she's still so bashful.

19
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:44,960
Before,

20
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,760
she escaped to find her lover.

21
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,000
Then we had to cut her tongue out.

22
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,360
However, before she escaped,

23
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,640
she still shouted out her lover's name.

24
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,520
His name is...

25
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,480
Liu Ping.

26
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,520
You are Liu Ping, aren't you?

27
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,640
You little guy,

28
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,440
you really don't know your place.

29
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,000
Hold on.

30
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,440
Give me a good and loud kowtow.

31
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,480
And then, tell me

32
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,800
how you sneaked in here.

33
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,560
Perhaps if I'm in a good mood,

34
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,000
I might just let you live.

35
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,760
(Lanlan,)

36
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,520
(it's all my fault.)

37
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,520
(It's my cowardice)

38
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,680
(that has got you into this mess.)

39
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,400
(It's me who failed to protect you.)

40
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,920
(Today, I'll risk everything
to avenge you.)

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,160
I will...

42
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,440
I will kill you.

43
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,760
What?

44
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,960
Speak louder!

45
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,040
I didn't hear it.

46
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,800
Kill him!

47
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,840
Get out of the way!

48
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,920
Lanlan,

49
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,360
Lanlan, Lanlan.

50
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,400
You really know how to trouble me.

51
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,560
I'm so sorry.

52
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,880
However, Sun Lanlan
has seen your bravery.

53
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,600
Who are you?

54
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,680
Do you know who we are

55
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,640
and how many noble guests we have?

56
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,360
I don't care who you are.

57
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,000
I only know that
you're a bunch of tricksters

58
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,680
who disregard human lives.

59
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,520
Deal with him!

60
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,920
I've practiced martial arts
since childhood.

61
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,040
I am proficient in Wing Chun,
Tai Chi Palm, Bagua Fist,

62
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,720
and Hung Gar Iron Wire Fist.

63
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,360
If you're not convinced,
let's have a try.

64
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,840
Jingjing.

65
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,240
Where is he?

66
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,840
Sweetheart, I am coming.

67
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,640
I'll devour you tonight.

68
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,000
It's not yet decided
who will devour whom tonight.

69
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,880
Although your appearance is a bit off,

70
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,680
you're a free gift after all.

71
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,840
Come here, with the lights off,
I can just make do with it.

72
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,880
For free?

73
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,760
A free gift?

74
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,640
What am I lacking?

75
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,360
What am I lacking?

76
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,640
What am I lacking?

77
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,160
Don't hit me.

78
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,120
Off the lights?

79
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,200
A free gift?

80
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,520
Coming for what?

81
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,160
Qin Yang, Qin Yang.

82
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,720
Qin Yang.

83
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,560
Jingjing.

84
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,280
Didn't I tell you to run westward?

85
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,440
Where is the west?

86
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,800
Isn't the west right here?

87
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,960
It could also be over here.

88
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,800
Stop there!

89
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,320
I'm telling you

90
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,760
this way is the east.

91
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,520
This way is the west.

92
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,200
Where can you run to this time?

93
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,760
Tell me who you are?

94
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,440
In that case, I won't pretend.

95
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,880
I am the Jade-faced
Little Flying Dragon,

96
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,760
who knows astronomy and geography

97
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,200
and is proficient in the Five Elements
and Bagua. My name is Mr. Qin.

98
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,120
What?

99
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,280
Mr. Qin.

100
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,440
Never heard of it.

101
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,160
You are so out of touch.

102
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,520
Do you know what this is?

103
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,280
What is this?

104
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,320
Doesn't it mean eight?

105
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,240
Eight?

106
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,360
This is a hand.

107
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,720
It's also a gun.

108
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,640
A gun?

109
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,720
A gun.

110
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,120
A gun, haha.

111
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,440
Fine, if you dare, shoot here.

112
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,120
This is what you said.

113
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,000
I said it.

114
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,120
Take them all away.

115
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,480
Yes, sir. Don't move!

116
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,080
Get down. Cover your head!

117
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,360
- Take them all.
- Go.

118
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,480
Night God Society won't
let you get away with it.

119
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,720
Night God Society?

120
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,480
Hurry up!

121
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,560
Go!

122
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,280
Not bad at shooting.

123
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,520
Actually, the shot was off target.

124
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,600
I was aiming at your forehead.

125
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,240
That's enough.

126
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,560
I will personally
take all these people away.

127
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,560
Miss Shen will be left in your care.

128
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,440
Notify me immediately
if anything happens.

129
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,600
Notify you?

130
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,840
Who do you think you are?

131
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,320
Hey, what's the deal, Mr. He?

132
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,760
Do you want to fight me?

133
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,080
Is your gun quicker

134
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,440
or my fist?

135
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,960
Do you know what this is called?

136
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,560
You're overestimating yourself,

137
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,880
asking for humiliation,

138
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,120
digging your own grave...

139
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,000
No.

140
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,720
I haven't eaten yet.

141
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,520
I'll fight you after a meal.

142
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,400
I can beat you up at any time.

143
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,200
Are you two kids?
You're still bickering?

144
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,640
Miss Shen Rou is still poisoned.

145
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,039
It's okay.

146
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,600
If the poison remains for three days,

147
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,680
it will cause irreversible effects.

148
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,000
Within three days,

149
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,480
I have a way.

150
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,880
Are you sure?

151
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,880
Of course!

152
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,040
Behave yourselves!

153
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,200
Hurry up!

154
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,520
Go!

155
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,880
Bao Long.

156
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,280
Sir.

157
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,920
Let them go.

158
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,200
But they...

159
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,080
I have my own plans.

160
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,320
