00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:38,912
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,000
You shameless guy.

4
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,600
What are you getting?

5
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,160
He's just getting
silver needles for you.

6
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,560
Look, he wants to give you acupuncture.

7
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,200
Investigate before speaking.

8
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
Don't be so rash.

9
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,080
This time, if I was late,

10
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,400
you'd have been taken for a ride.

11
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,480
I'm so sorry. Thank you.

12
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,200
I'm not blaming you,

13
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,800
but you should think before act.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,440
If anything really happens to you,

15
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,120
your father would kill me.

16
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,000
What are you doing?

17
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,400
She is still here.

18
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:35,960
I'll be going.

19
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,520
I don't like owing favors to people.

20
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,600
You can strike me to release your anger.

21
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,320
I don't hit women.

22
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,880
Mr. Qin.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,800
Liu Ping?

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,120
You busy?

25
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,200
You're here.

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,280
How about Sun Lanlan?

27
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,800
Thanks to you, Lanlan's poison is gone.

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,000
But her tongue is seriously injured.

29
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,400
I'm afraid...

30
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,000
As long as she is alive.

31
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,360
I have another favor to ask.

32
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,800
I want to marry Lanlan.

33
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,720
I would also like you to
help persuade our parents.

34
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,200
Do you know what
she's been through in Soulless Village?

35
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,920
And once you're married,

36
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,840
you will meet
the gossip from your neighbors.

37
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,240
How will you face it?

38
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,480
I know that.

39
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,560
But I still want to marry her.

40
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,120
I already owe her too much.

41
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,040
This time, I don't want to
be weak any longer.

42
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,800
Thank you, Mr. Qin,
for saving my daughter.

43
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,320
If you need anything, just tell me.

44
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,600
I'm supposed to
take money from people to help them.

45
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,520
However, I have figured out something.

46
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,840
I'm looking forward to
your guidance, Mr. Qin.

47
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,440
Mr. Sun,
is your business not doing well,

48
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,760
and your family is unfortunate?

49
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,160
You're incurring the Door-Crashing Evil,

50
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,640
which affects your luck

51
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,200
and disrupts magnetic field.

52
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,280
No wonder.

53
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,560
How do I break it then?

54
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,760
Do we have to move out?

55
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,640
No need.

56
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,640
You just need to dismantle this door

57
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,360
and install it on the other side.

58
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,160
This would neutralize
the negative results.

59
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,360
Mr. Qin, just by closing the door,
I'll break the spell?

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,760
In fact, all because your door
faces the Liu family's main entrance.

61
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,280
You're stealing each other's business.

62
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,360
The guests see that
you have great resentment,

63
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,840
so they won't come in.

64
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,360
Now, each of you
takes your own business,

65
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,120
and the issue is resolved.

66
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,240
Furthermore,

67
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,200
you need to cook
a bowl of noodles for each other to eat.

68
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,360
Just a bowl of noodles
can break the spell?

69
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,640
Poor business is due to

70
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,360
the overt and covert conflicts.

71
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,520
The many misfortunes are also
due to discord among neighbors.

72
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,000
To fully improve it,

73
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,800
it still depends on you, Mr. Sun.

74
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,400
Mr. Qin.

75
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,240
Mr. Sun, you pledged to be my first
customer before my business launch.

76
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,400
After so many years,
why haven't you come?

77
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,680
You didn't come here, either.

78
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,960
What do you want?

79
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,800
I'm here to propose marriage.

80
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,279
Mr. Sun, I want to marry Lanlan.

81
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,560
This is the noodles I made.

82
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,600
What do you think of them?

83
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,000
Your knife-shaved noodles
can't compare to mine.

84
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:32,760
Here's the deal.

85
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,800
After your marriage, I will
teach you to make knife-shaved noodles.

86
00:05:22,003 --> 00:05:24,384
(Qin's Detective Agency)

87
00:05:24,384 --> 00:05:25,240
(Mass Grave Hill)

88
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,280
(The Wang's Residence)
Here is Mr. Wang's residence.

89
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
This is the Mass Grave Hill
outside the city.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,160
A peddler at the entrance
of the Wang residence told me

91
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,840
that when Mr. Wang died,

92
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,000
he saw a woman in red

93
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,240
singing in the yard.

94
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,560
Just like what I saw at the Mass Grave.

95
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,400
Who's there?

96
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,040
I examined the body of Mr. Wang.

97
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,280
The report shows

98
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,560
that in his nasal passages,

99
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,080
traces of Bi'an Cigarette Oil
were found in small amounts.

100
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,000
Similar to the Bi'an Cigarette Oil
traces at the Mass Grave.

101
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,200
Qin Yang.

102
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,480
Qin Yang!

103
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
That makes sense.

104
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,640
What you said all makes sense.

105
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,200
By the way,
why did you go to the Mass Grave?

106
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,560
The peddler asked me if I dared to go,

107
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,720
so I went there.

108
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,840
Don't open it.

109
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,680
Suspect's fingerprints inside.

110
00:06:34,643 --> 00:06:35,840
(Claiming Lives)

111
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,800
It is

112
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,640
a fresh technique in the concept

113
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,840
of Western investigation.

114
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,040
It's okay to not understand.

115
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,000
To put it simply, it's...

116
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,600
Where did this thing come from?

117
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,280
At the entrance to Mr. Wang's mansion.
What's wrong?

118
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,200
The entrance to Mr. Wang's mansion.

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,160
It seems someone has tipped off.

120
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,360
Oh, what's the date today?

121
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,400
The third.

122
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,160
The third?

123
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,200
Yang Yao.

124
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,680
The second changes, as does the fifth.

125
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,120
The fourth signifies the present,
and the first undergoes earthly change.

126
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,920
The sixth signifies the present,
while the third is different.

127
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,400
The wandering soul
transitions to return.

128
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,720
The prevailing Yao is Kan,
and the responding is Li.

129
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,880
Fire and water not yet in harmony.

130
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,120
Yin and Yang are imbalanced.

131
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,120
South is up, and north is down.

132
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
Today is the day of Jia Wu.

133
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,520
North signifies infelicity.

134
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,200
We should check up the north.

135
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:53,696
(Fengxi Building)

136
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,600
The Fengxi troupe

137
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,960
used to be famous all over town.

138
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,160
This paper is thicker than
normal writing paper.

139
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,680
Usually it's posters that
often use such thick paper.

140
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,600
The one edged in black

141
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,120
is only used by this theater
in the north of the city.

142
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
You've already found it.

143
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,560
Test? Fingerprints?

144
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,280
Miss Shen, you don't know that

145
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,880
you should pay attention to details?

146
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,480
Then why did you say
"north signifies infelicity"?

147
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,080
There's a lot more I can teach you.

148
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,000
Jingjing.

149
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,120
Are you saying that this troupe
was very famous back then?

150
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,880
Yes, it's said that their
leading actress, Wutong,

151
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,840
had an incredibly mystical skill
of quick change and displacement.

152
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,680
She can be on one end of the stage,

153
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,920
and then shift to the other.

154
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,120
Wutong?

155
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,280
Jingjing, regarding the matter
of this actress,

156
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,600
how much more do you know?

157
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,560
No more.

158
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,920
It seems like
the performance suddenly stopped.

159
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,040
Why?

160
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,320
That's because three years ago,

161
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,840
Wutong passed away.

162
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,360
You are...

163
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,280
I'm just an old maid
sweeping the floor here.

164
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,760
You're interested in Wutong too?

165
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,000
What else do you know?

166
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,760
Looking back to those years,

167
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,280
Miss Wutong was indeed
a beauty of her time.

168
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Countless dignitaries spent much money

169
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,720
just to hear Miss Wutong sing
"A Dream in the Garden".

170
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,240
Unfortunately, it was three years ago,
the day before yesterday.

171
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,160
Right here.

172
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,800
Miss Wutong died unexpectedly.

173
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,760
Right here?

174
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,840
Such a coincidence.

175
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The day before yesterday was
when Mr. Wang was killed.

176
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,040
I don't think
this is a mere coincidence.

177
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,680
What's up?

178
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,800
Where's troupe leader?

179
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,480
He is preparing backstage,

180
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,560
and won't see anyone.

181
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,360
It's urgent.

182
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,400
Not seeing anyone.

183
