1
00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:35,936
=Detective Qin II=

2
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:38,880
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:46,035 --> 00:00:47,872
(The Grave of Sun Lanlan)

4
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,280
Liu Ping is even more chicken than me.

5
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,600
He actually fainted on the spot.

6
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,000
Give him some time.

7
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,480
The coffin has scratches inside.

8
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,160
The same

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,599
like those on Liu Ping's

10
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,840
windowsill.

11
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,240
Doesn't that mean

12
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,200
Sun Lanlan really went to Liu Ping?

13
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,920
It seems that there is someone

14
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,560
behind every unusual event.

15
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:20,840
Don't.

16
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,440
This is a "mouth coin".

17
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,560
If you touch it,

18
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,760
she will come to you at night.

19
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,600
Do you know what the mouth coin means?

20
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,920
Isn't it just travel money for the dead?

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It can bribe underworld messengers.

22
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,720
So they won't suffer on the way.

23
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,160
Jingjing, stop that nonsense.

24
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,160
After death, the face can easily deform.

25
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,680
Placing the mouth coin

26
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,760
preserves their appearance,

27
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,680
so they can leave with dignity.

28
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,120
But placing it in a paper doll's mouth

29
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,560
is a bit too deliberate.

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,320
I have found

31
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,919
a temple for an underworld god.

32
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,120
If we go there...

33
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,840
You should stay away from the case.

34
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,480
Why?

35
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,080
I am your tutor, listen to me.

36
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,880
I didn't admit it.

37
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,280
I joined the agency for convenience.

38
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,520
You should go to Huayue House

39
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,800
and keep drinking.

40
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,400
You really think I went there to drink?

41
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,080
This is the reward I got from there.

42
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,840
You were working?

43
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,840
It was that time you punched me.

44
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,800
They said there was a cat demon,

45
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,160
and called me over.

46
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,560
What cat demon?

47
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,760
It's all nonsense.

48
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,920
There was none.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,840
It was just

50
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,480
a thief with some sneaky tricks.

51
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,080
Do you need
to read girls' palms for investigations?

52
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,280
Don't ask.

53
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,080
The clue is in this pouch.

54
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,560
If you figure out my method,

55
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,800
I will let you continue.

56
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,560
But before that,

57
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,400
you must stay here,

58
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,440
and don't go anywhere.

59
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,000
It's a deal.

60
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,480
Mr. Qin,

61
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,000
I'll go get Lanlan's birth time.

62
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,440
Mr. Qin, ensure her peaceful rest.

63
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,520
Rest assured, as long as I'm here,

64
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,080
there's no case that can't be solved.

65
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,360
Thank you.

66
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,880
I'm right, aren't I?

67
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,440
The Reverse Bow is inauspicious.

68
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,320
That's why they have so many troubles.

69
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,600
It sounds reasonable.

70
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,880
Then, tell me why it's inauspicious.

71
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,560
Reverse Bow, a house built
on the exterior curve of a river

72
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,080
or the outer side of a road.

73
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,880
It'll be hit by chaotic energy fields,

74
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,800
affecting fortune.

75
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,400
That's what the books say.

76
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,840
Listen,

77
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,440
the so-called Reverse Bow

78
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,360
is when roads and rivers form
an outward arc.

79
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,040
Houses built here are

80
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,240
easily affected
by flood and waterlogging effects.

81
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,440
The same goes for roads.

82
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,000
Facilitating vehicles

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,520
may collide with houses on outer arc.

84
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,160
Do you understand?

85
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,880
Also, where is the Reverse Bow?

86
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,520
Isn't there a bend?

87
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,168
There?

88
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,520
Why didn't you mention your house?

89
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,920
There was even a pond there.

90
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,560
And, this road connects the east
and west.

91
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,360
If there really were any bad,

92
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,120
it would be called a Cross.

93
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,680
And the Sun and Liu families

94
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,760
have their shops' doors
facing each other.

95
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,160
It is said

96
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,520
when two doors face each other,
one must recede.

97
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,760
It is likely
to attract gossip and disputes.

98
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,160
Also, don't tell people you know me

99
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,680
nor call me a nickname.

100
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,160
Mr. Qin,

101
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,160
the birth time.

102
00:04:43,859 --> 00:04:45,632
(Sun Lanlan's birth time)

103
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,240
What's wrong?

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,120
What's your special today?

105
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,840
I'll go cook it for you.

106
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,120
I want sliced noodles.

107
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,920
Come back!

108
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,560
What's wrong?

109
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,256
(Sun Lanlan's birth time)

110
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,520
Although it is pure Yin,

111
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,600
with the grand fate,

112
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,640
she should have a long life.

113
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,160
Then why did she...

114
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,120
Zhao, aren't you the one
who arranges ghost marriages?

115
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,000
How can you read fortunes?

116
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,560
Fortune telling is just my sideline.

117
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,400
I only do it for the destined.

118
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,960
Not for everyone.

119
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,640
Like you, with a good career,

120
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,680
good luck in love,

121
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,920
a good figure,

122
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,840
and good looks.

123
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,920
Zhao, the blind!

124
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,920
Hurry back.

125
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,000
We'll do it again tonight.

126
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,400
Don't move.

127
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,520
Don't make me hurt you.

128
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,000
In the Obscure Market,

129
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,960
your eyes are the sharpest.

130
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,640
Why are you called "the blind"?

131
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,880
This is just to make a living.

132
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,320
Paperman Zhang said the Underworld King
will marry a concubine this month.

133
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,880
Someone has gone missing.

134
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,040
So I came to ask you.

135
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
A man or a woman?

136
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,000
A living or a deceased one?

137
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,040
A woman, a living person.

138
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,800
Then I didn't do it.

139
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,680
I abide by the rules.

140
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,960
Ghost marriages
do not involve living people.

141
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,720
I heard from Paperman Zhang

142
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,480
recently there's another group of people

143
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,520
competing with you.

144
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,840
Mr. Qin,

145
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,320
not everyone is fit to do this business.

146
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,040
Their paper money is all red,

147
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,080
not professional at all.

148
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,880
Do you have any other business recently?

149
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,320
There actually is one.

150
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,800
I haven't had time to handle it.

151
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,080
Mr. Qin, if you are interested,

152
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,560
you could go have a look for yourself.

153
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,880
Or I can give you a fortune telling?

154
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,920
Go away!

155
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,040
Ugly and bad-tempered.

156
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,040
Miss, let me do it again.

157
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,920
You bad boy.

158
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,080
Let me tell you,

159
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,960
Zhao

160
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,080
was actually telling the truth.

161
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,160
Is anyone there?

162
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,672
(Offerings)

163
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,680
Coming.

164
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,760
I heard Zhao say...

165
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,120
Good that you're here.

166
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,360
You really are handsome.

167
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,440
Your family wants to arrange
a ghost marriage?

168
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,200
Aren't you asking what you already know?

169
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,680
I have a few things I want to ask you.

170
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,960
There will be plenty of time.

171
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,720
Just leave it till later.

172
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,080
Come, let me check out your body.

173
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,600
So strong.

174
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,000
And so stubborn.

175
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,800
So naughty, I like it.

176
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,040
Ma'am,

177
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,040
is there some misunderstanding here?

178
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,520
What misunderstanding?

179
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,400
Didn't Zhao tell you to come here?

180
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,440
Who is having a ghost marriage?

181
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,680
I am.

182
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,480
You?

183
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,400
Come come, quickly give it a try.

184
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,039
I'll be at the bottom, you'll be on top.

185
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,480
Let's try it in this coffin.

186
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,120
I've been a widow all my life.

187
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,360
Now my children are all settled.

188
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,080
Must I still be alone

189
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,320
after I die?

190
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,000
I wanted

191
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,800
to find a young and handsome man
to be buried with me.

192
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,360
Isn't that okay?

193
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,160
I've worked hard all my life.

194
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,960
What's wrong with
enjoying the afterlife?

195
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,240
Don't you fancy me?

196
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,280
I was once the belle in my youth!

197
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,960
I can see.

198
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,200
Listen.

199
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,240
The one to have a ghost marriage
is not me.

200
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,000
Not you?

201
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,600
No wonder.

202
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,640
Zhao said he'd match me with someone

203
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,520
who is about to die of tuberculosis.

204
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,840
You look full of vigor.

205
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,400
So, not you.

206
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,360
Then what are you here for?

207
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,720
I had a few questions for you.

208
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,360
But it's okay now.

209
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,840
That bloody Zhao.

210
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,040
If I had known,
I'd choose the other one.

211
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,720
He charged the money

212
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
but can't find the man.

213
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,640
Is there someone else who does this?

214
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,960
A group from the neighboring town.

215
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,240
They do ghost marriages, alive or dead.

216
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,640
Zhao

217
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,440
is all talk

218
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,040
but really unreliable.
