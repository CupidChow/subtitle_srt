1
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:35,936
=Detective Qin II=

2
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:38,944
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:39,443 --> 00:00:42,960
(The Wang's Residence)

4
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,120
After the incident,

5
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,480
the security has been tightened.

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,880
So what should we do?

7
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,280
So many days have passed.

8
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,560
Are there still any clues?

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,320
As long as it has happened,

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,800
there will always be clues.

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,000
Jingjing, what are you doing here?

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,360
I'm here to protect you, of course.

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,480
If you died,

14
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,680
you couldn't be my master.

15
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,720
Since the last time,

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,000
the beef meatball vendor

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,960
hasn't shown up again.

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,560
He

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,280
probably will never show up again.

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,600
What do you mean?

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,320
The one who killed Mr. Wang
is a female ghost in red.

22
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,040
He is the one who spread this, right?

23
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,480
Could he be the murderer?

24
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,760
Not necessarily.

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,000
For someone who's toiled
their whole life,

26
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,240
a few silver dollars

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,240
might make him do anything,

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,960
let alone tell a lie.

29
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,280
You are just judging others by yourself.

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,760
Let's go in and take a look.

31
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,040
But there are police at the door.

32
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,440
How should we get in?

33
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,800
Do I need to teach you something
so simple?

34
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,320
Force our way in?

35
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,080
The door wasn't bolted.

36
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,880
Of course, I know that.

37
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,320
I'm just

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,600
imitating the murderer's actions.

39
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,680
Why are you laughing?

40
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,200
I'm just thinking about something
interesting.

41
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,960
But we're

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,440
investigating a case now.

43
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,800
What interesting things?

44
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,720
Turns out this ghost

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,480
can also get scratched by branches.

46
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,480
Looks like the murderer climbed

47
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,840
over the wall to get in too.

48
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,840
The murderer is agile like me

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,280
and also a martial arts expert.

50
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,040
What interesting things now?

51
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,480
Last night,

52
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,400
I didn't rest well. I'm sleepy.

53
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,400
Why are you laughing?

54
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,680
In the opera,

55
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,160
there's a type of step called
the ghost step,

56
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,440
which involves tiptoeing

57
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,120
and walking as if gliding.

58
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,640
Climbing over the wall,

59
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,640
clothes scratched,

60
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,440
and footprints.

61
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,560
As I estimate,

62
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,560
the murderer must be an ordinary person.

63
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,000
This murderer is not simple.

64
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,040
This smells like the incense burner

65
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,120
from the Mass Grave Hill.

66
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,160
What are you doing?

67
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,240
My friend abroad

68
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,920
has the most advanced equipment.

69
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,800
If I send this to him,

70
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,680
he can find out the ingredients.

71
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,040
After you send it

72
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,880
and get it back,

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,800
this case will be solved
only in the third season.

74
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,240
This incense ash contains Datura metel,

75
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,760
commonly known as the mandrake flower,

76
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,640
In Western medicine,
it's called atropine.

77
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,120
You understand Western medicine?

78
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,280
What's so hard about Western medicine?

79
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,440
Chinese medicine doesn't
include autopsy.

80
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,520
If not for the autopsy,

81
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,760
the police wouldn't have known
that the victim died

82
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,200
before being hung.

83
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,680
If there hadn't been an autopsy,
who would have known the structure

84
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,840
of Bigan's heart?

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,160
And how can you explain Hua Tuo
intended to perform

86
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,400
a craniotomy on Cao Cao?

87
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,360
Looks like studying abroad

88
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,440
didn't teach you much.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,640
What you said has not been verified
in history.

90
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,840
But it's still more real than parchment
coming from Greece.

91
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,240
Parchment.

92
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,040
Where did they get so many sheep?

93
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,200
Chinese medicine

94
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,160
has long discovered the study of corpses

95
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,640
and autopsy were pointless.

96
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,400
We should first observe
the living person's condition.

97
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,520
As for your claim that the victim
died before being hung,

98
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,720
we can determine it without an autopsy.

99
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,840
As an apprentice,

100
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,480
you still need to learn.

101
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,600
Is that atropine you just mentioned

102
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,960
really so amazing?

103
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,080
Just with the Datura metel
and the ash wood root,

104
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,840
it's not enough to drive someone
to suicide.

105
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,280
There should be other herbs.

106
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,520
There's only one place
where one can buy these herbs.

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,960
You mean...

108
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,760
Obscure Market.

109
00:06:04,403 --> 00:06:07,328
(Market)

110
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:19,200
Fly, fly, fly away.

111
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:25,088
(Memorial)

112
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,720
In the Obscure Market,
don't talk to strangers.

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,160
Otherwise, you never know

114
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,200
what might happen.

115
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,520
You're new here, right?

116
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,640
What's your name?

117
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,600
Round and round.

118
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,880
Round and round?

119
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,600
You...

120
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,240
Shen Rou is gone.

121
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,320
Who's there?

122
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,840
Rou.

123
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,120
Mom.

124
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,160
It's been a long time.
You've gained weight.

125
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,120
Mom, why are you here?

126
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,920
Are you doing well?

127
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,680
Has your dad been harsh to you?

128
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,880
You've always wanted to be a cop.

129
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,840
Don't know if you've become one.

130
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,080
Dad still has a bad temper.

131
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,120
I went abroad to study investigation.

132
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,120
I can become a police officer soon.

133
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,320
I've been doing fine.

134
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,760
That's good. Come here.

135
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,480
Let me give you a hug.

136
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,960
But

137
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,600
my mom died from an illness

138
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,120
when I was a kid.

139
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,720
Rou.

140
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,960
This is the Obscure Market.

141
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,960
Anything is possible.

142
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,160
It can even help you communicate
with the dead

143
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,800
and let you see the person
you most want to see.

144
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,520
Come over here. Let me give you a hug.
