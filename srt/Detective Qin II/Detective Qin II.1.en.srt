00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,160
Lanlan, I'm sorry.

4
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,040
It's all my fault.

5
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,080
If only I had been braver

6
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,760
to take you away,

7
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,000
you wouldn't have died.

8
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,920
Liu Ping.

9
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,800
Liu Ping.

What do you want?

18
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,280
Got an appointment?

19
00:01:59,400 --> 00:01:59,920
Hello.

20
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,120
I'm looking for Qin Yang.

This is Tai's Detective Agency.

24

Qin Yang?

29
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,760
I have an only daughter,

30
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,080
named Shen Rou.

31
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,200
She just returned from abroad.

32
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,960
As soon as

33
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,400
she got back,

34
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,760
she insisted on joining
the police station

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,480
to serve and solve cases.

36
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,200
The most important is

37
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,160
three months from now

38
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,840
is the day she's to marry her fiancé.

39
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,400
As for me,

40
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,320
I just want to ask you for a favor

41
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,400
to let my precious daughter

42
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,760
join your agency for experience.

43
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,560
In any case,

44
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,960
within three months,

45
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,200
make her give up the idea.

46
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,760
Your task'll be finished then.

47
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,120
I'll give you fifty dollars a month.

48
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,240
Consider it as a tuition fee.

49
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,360
This is a picture of my daughter.

50
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,360
Remember,

51
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,160
within three months,

52
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,200
make her give up

53
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,720
and settle down for her marriage.

54
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,640
Good morning, Miss Shen.

55
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,560
Look at you. The banners outside,

56
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,920
are they due to gambling or romance?

57
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,880
Money is an external possession.

58
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,600
It's just a bit of rent.

59
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,480
Really?

60
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,000
You even owe the rent?

61
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,920
Hence, your joining is crucial to me.

62
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,520
Your dad pays me fifty monthly.

63
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,680
If you truly accept me as your tutor,

64
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,360
I will certainly train you well.

65
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,240
Maybe I'll train you instead.

66
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,240
Let's be clear.

67
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,800
I'm here because I promised Dad

68
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,600
to work with you,

69
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,960
so I can keep solving cases.

70
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,080
I don't have to accept you as my tutor.

71
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,880
Also,

72
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,640
I don't need to believe your nonsense.

73
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,800
And, when I am speaking,

74
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,560
can you look at me?

75
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,320
This doesn't really matter.

76
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,480
Anyway, it's all just an excuse.

77
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,680
If the money is good,

78
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,680
I can even take you as my tutor.

79
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,968
Can you change your clothes first?

80
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,304
(Qin's Detective Agency)

81
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,240
I died so miserably.

82
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,320
What the...

83
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,880
This, this really isn't a ghost.

84
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,960
Jingjing, stop messing around.

85
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,000
I have a guest here.

86
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,480
Why didn't you say so earlier?

87
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,320
Hello, I'm Yuan Jingjing,

88
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,040
Yuan Tiangang's 37th descendant.

89
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,760
Who is Yuan Tiangang?

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,960
Yuan Tiangang is...

91
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,280
Yuan Jingjing

92
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,560
hurt her head when little.

93
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,640
She's a bit odd.

94
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,680
She's enjoyed scaring me.

95
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,760
I scare you because we made a bet.

96
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,080
As long as I can scare him,

97
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,400
he must be my tutor

98
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,960
and teach me things.

99
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,000
Right,

100
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,480
this is Shen Rou,

101
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,760
ex-police chief's

102
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,400
precious daughter.

103
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,200
You two should get to know each other.

104
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,440
(I need to go and solve
a big case first.)

105
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,560
Mr. Wang, just arrived huh?

106
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,960
Soft and weak palm,

107
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,360
a pillar reaches to the sky.

108
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,200
You will marry into wealth.

109
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,800
Not bad.

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,600
Do mine.

111
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,600
Do mine first.

112
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
Do mine first.

113
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,320
Wishing you fortune.

114
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,800
Do mine.

115
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,440
A rare phoenix-eye pattern.

116
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,600
A kind heart,

117
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,160
a virtuous wife and good mother.

118
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Great kids, lucky mom.

119
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,320
Not bad.

120
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:37,920
Thank you.

121
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,800
Do mine.

122
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,880
A prominent heated mount.

123
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,400
The liver fire is too strong.

124
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,080
You'll never get married.

125
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,040
Too bad-tempered.

126
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,160
Quite accurate.

127
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,720
I am indeed bad-tempered.

128
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,520
(Police Station)

129
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,080
So, at Huayue House,

130
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,320
did you really hit Qin Yang?

131
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,640
I didn't hit him hard.

132
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,840
If I can't count on him,

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,480
let's find cases by ourselves.

134
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,560
But police will deal with normal cases.

135
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,840
For strange cases,

136
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,880
who would come to us?

137
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,600
(Nemesis)
I've seen a ghost, I need to report!

138
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,760
I need to report!

139
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,840
Go away.

140
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,960
I'm reporting this.

141
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,880
I'm reporting this.

142
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,960
I've seen a ghost.

143
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,560
What are you yelling?

144
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,520
Strange things indeed.

145
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,920
Let's go.

146
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,560
I've seen a ghost.

147
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,840
How is that making sense?

148
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,880
Anyway, it's a person who died

149
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,400
and came back for me!

150
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,120
Do you get it?

151
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,840
That's simply nonsense.

152
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,600
No, I really...

153
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,040
- We can help you.
- Help what...

154
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,200
Miss Shen.

155
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,040
Step back.

156
00:06:51,392 --> 00:06:52,064
Okay.

157
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,440
What's the matter?

158
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,480
I have a neighbor.

159
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,240
Their daughter is named Sun Lanlan.

160
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Recently,
her father forced her into marriage.

161
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,160
She jumped into a river and died.

162
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,920
And then, just yesterday,

163
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,400
she came back to me,

164
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,200
bleeding all over.

165
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,680
Do you think

166
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,840
she has any unresolved matters?

167
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,640
Forced to marry someone she didn't like?

168
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,360
There must be unresolved matters.

169
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,520
Shen Rou, should we take this case?

170
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,040
Are you sure you didn't see it wrong?

171
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,120
I'm sure.

172
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,320
Very close, just this close.

173
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,440
Just this close to me.

174
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,440
I'm absolutely sure.

175
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,760
I don't believe in ghosts and gods,

176
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,320
but since you said you saw it,

177
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,600
it needs to be investigated.

178
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,560
Our agency has taken this case.

179
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,600
Why does this grave look somewhat new?

180
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,440
Mr. Sun calls it
a corpse-preserving spot.

181
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,840
If it's really dug up,

182
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,440
would it spoil the good Feng Shui?

183
00:07:51,475 --> 00:07:53,344
(The Grave of Sun Lanlan)

184
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,520
The so-called corpse-preserving land

185
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,680
is an air-tight spot,

186
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,640
commonly known as "pig brain".

187
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,000
It stays dry for a millennium
and moist for ten millennia.

188
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,960
Neither dry nor moist, only half a year.

189
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,880
(The Grave of Sun Lanlan)
It's said the people buried here

190
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,480
are not subjected to air decomposition.

191
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,800
Their bodies can remain intact.

192
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,320
Yet they can easily turn into zombies.

193
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,840
Did Liu Ping see a zombie?

194
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,200
It's just a legend.

195
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,640
In fact, the soil's
gelatinous stickiness

196
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,080
and acidity and alkalinity are high,

197
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,440
thus the water retentivity.

198
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,360
But whoever chose here
for the Sun family

199
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,120
must have another motive.

200
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,240
Open the coffin, and we'll know.

201
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,600
Are we really going to open it?

202
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,400
The coffin must be opened before dark.

203
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,480
Why before dark,

204
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,400
may I ask?

205
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,720
Because

206
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,800
we didn't bring a light.
