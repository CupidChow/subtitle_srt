1
00:00:33,023 --> 00:00:36,044
=Detective Qin II=

2
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:38,988
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,760
(Fire god disrespects will burn within three days)
How can this be?

4
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,400
Are the rumors true?

5
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,280
The Miss Qian I saw that night

6
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,960
couldn't possibly be a ghost, could it?

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,840
Don't worry.

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,000
This must be the murderer bluffing.

9
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,040
Have there been any thefts?

10
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,240
A thief?

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,800
Indeed there was one.

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,320
It was that very night.

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,320
That thief was really foolish.

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,959
He didn't steal any valuable things,

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,440
but stole many
of my photographic chemicals.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That fits the picture.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,800
At that time, the murderer must have

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,120
tampered with the photos.

19
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,400
Who else came that day?

20
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,560
From this page to this, all here.

21
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,040
When did this person come to the studio?

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,840
He?

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,000
He arrived shortly after Mr. Qian.

24
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,880
This is wrong.

25
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,000
Aconite is poisonous,

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,880
used sparingly.

27
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,080
With the ratio you used,

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,080
the patient would die
before being cured.

29
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,600
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,680
Human life is paramount.

31
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,720
Just saying sorry is enough?

32
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,320
As punishment, copy ten times.

33
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,040
Go to the back room to copy.

34
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,560
Mischievous.

35
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,800
Please forgive us.

36
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,840
Being strict is good.

37
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,080
Strict teacher, fine students.

38
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,840
I still feel a bit dizzy when I got up

39
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,360
I would like to ask you for treatment.

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,760
Upon checking the pulse,
there's no major issue.

41
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,880
Ensure timely medication,

42
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,840
you will soon recover.

43
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,720
That's good.

44
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,640
Actually, I came today

45
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,240
about something else too.

46
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,440
Anything.

47
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,840
The city's richest man, Mr. Qian

48
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,480
died a few days ago.

49
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,240
I've heard it.

50
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,160
Regarding this case,

51
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,960
Dr. Chu, what do you think?

52
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,000
Using living sacrifices to seek fortune
is harmful to harmony.

53
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,160
Mr. Qian suffers a backlash,

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,600
got what he deserved.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So,

56
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,480
Dr. Chu, do you also believe
it was the act of an evil god?

57
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,960
Mr. Qian's wealth

58
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,240
couldn't be from nowhere, right?

59
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,360
Since they didn't appear out of nowhere,

60
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,760
the evil god must have bestowed them.

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,040
This strange doctor must have issues.

62
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,040
I think Mr. Chu is a good person.

63
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,520
Perhaps it's a misunderstanding.

64
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,480
Whether or not he's involved,

65
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,200
he has hinted at an important clue.

66
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,560
Just as I thought.

67
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,920
What clue?

68
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,000
Who gave Qian Hansheng
the evil god statue?

69
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,320
And where did his money come from?

70
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,080
The most important thing is,

71
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,440
this practice of sacrificing maidens

72
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,680
resembles an organization.

73
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,040
Night God Society?

74
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,240
They go around collecting maidens.

75
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,640
If you say
they're related to Qian Hansheng,

76
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,000
that does make sense.

77
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,600
But Chu Jiangping,

78
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,560
what role does he play?

79
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,840
Nothing.

80
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,800
(Fire god disrespects will burn
within three days.)

81
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,000
(Today is the third day.)

82
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,840
You had a nightmare?

83
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,360
Why are you here?

84
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,760
I have a new clue.

85
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,120
Clue? What clue?

86
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,520
The night of the rain,

87
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,160
also the night Dr. Chu saved you,

88
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,600
when he took us to the clinic,

89
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,840
it was precisely twelve.

90
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,280
The same time as Qian Hansheng's death.

91
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,160
This shows he has a perfect alibi.

92
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,920
If you put it that way,

93
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,600
that makes me more suspicious.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,800
Why?

95
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,840
Think about it.

96
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,160
What happened
after we got to the clinic?

97
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,080
There was nothing unusual.

98
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,760
After Dr. Chu treated you,

99
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,120
he gave me a medicinal soup,

100
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,240
saying it expels cold.

101
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,000
I slept soundly until morning.

102
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,040
That's right.

103
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,720
The time on the clock can be adjusted.

104
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,040
Maybe he just wants to use you

105
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,960
as an alibi for his absence.

106
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,120
Moreover...

107
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,640
(Fire god disrespects will burn
within three days.)

108
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,360
(Will burn within three days!)

109
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,680
Never mind, it's nothing.

110
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,840
You haven't been in good shape recently.

111
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,680
What's wrong?

112
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,200
I've been having hallucinations,

113
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,360
as if I've been cursed by the evil god.

114
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,480
There are no evil gods in this world.

115
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,200
Could it be the scopolamine

116
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,000
in your medication?

117
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,680
It has hallucinogenic effects.

118
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,320
Perhaps.

119
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,200
You should stop taking that medicine.

120
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,440
But...

121
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,880
If it rains,

122
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,360
I'll hold an umbrella for you.

123
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,840
If you fall into the lake,

124
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,240
I'll rescue you.

125
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,600
Whatever your future holds,

126
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,680
I will always be with you.

127
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
After all...

128
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,840
Okay, I promise you.

129
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,840
I will never take that medicine again.

130
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,440
Qin Yang!

131
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,240
I've found irrefutable evidence
of that quack's crime.

132
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,880
This is it!

133
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,240
I've long been displeased
with that quack.

134
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,480
After you guys return,

135
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,200
I slipped back, investigated the clinic.

136
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,680
And then I discovered this.

137
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,640
What is this?

138
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,720
An empty photo chemical container.

139
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,400
I've asked the owner of the studio.

140
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,200
This is his.

141
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,560
So, according to our previous reasoning,

142
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,960
he must have used this

143
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,520
to extract that thing

144
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
and caused the explosion

145
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,800
which almost killed us.

146
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,680
So, the murderer must be
that strange doctor.

147
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,720
I, Yuan Tiangang's

148
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,720
37th generation heir, am good, right?

149
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,400
Was this really found in the clinic?

150
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,280
Certainly, in his clinic's back room.

151
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,480
Something is not right.

152
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,280
Even Jingjing

153
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,720
discovered this problem.

154
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,280
Perhaps...

155
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,760
Who are you looking down on?

156
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,240
Qin Yang!

157
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,080
Qin Yang!

158
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,640
What's the rush now?

159
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,560
Big news.

160
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,480
The murderer who killed Qian Hansheng

161
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,440
has surrendered.

162
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,760
It was that doctor, Chu Jiangping.

163
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,000
I told you so!

164
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,520
It's him!

165
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,920
Stop wasting time here.

166
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,760
Let's go!

167
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,120
Or you can talk with me?

168
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,520
Why did you kill Mr. Qian?

169
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,799
For justice.

170
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,559
Justice?

171
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,240
Exactly.

172
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,159
I found him

173
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,290
collaborating with
the Night God Society for years.

174
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,040
Under the guise
of sacrificing maidens to the evil god,

175
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,480
he sold people
for the Night God Society.

176
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,480
The Night God Society
provided financial support

177
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,240
and a medicine for eternal youth.

178
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,240
Eternal youth?

179
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,760
It's nothing but a potency drug.

180
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,440
However, Qian was completely convinced

181
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,640
and believed he had sacrificed maidens

182
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,840
and moved the evil god.

183
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,720
Do you have any evidence?

184
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,160
Evidence?

185
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,000
Over the years,

186
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,320
there have been many cases
of missing girls, right?

187
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,880
Go search Qian's residence.

188
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,720
There are bound to be clues.

189
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,880
Tell me,

190
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,000
what was your method of killing?

191
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,400
Killed means killed.

192
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,560
There are no special method.

193
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,400
It was just to cover up the murder.

194
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,120
I thought of creating the rumor

195
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,640
that Qian had suffered
retribution from the evil god.

196
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,720
Therefore,
I stole the photographic chemicals

197
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,120
to extract potassium chlorate.

198
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,600
That night, I ran into you
when I left Qian's residence.

199
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,440
So I pretended

200
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,400
Night God Society to mislead you.

201
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,920
Unfortunately, I fell short of success.

202
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,760
One last question.

203
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,160
Where is Miss Qian?

204
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,360
Miss Qian?

205
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,440
What does she have to do with me?

206
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,480
No?

207
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,760
Who's responsible then?

208
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,720
- You...
- Go out!

209
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,120
Be honest.
