=Detective Qin II=

2
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:38,988
=Episode 15=

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,680
Lu Mo.

4
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,600
He Hongfeng.

5
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,760
Lu Mo.

6
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,680
He Hongfeng.

7
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,880
The sachet?

8
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,240
Lu Mo.

9
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,240
Lu Mo.

10
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,680
Hongfeng.

11
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,440
Does he look like he's drugged?

12
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,040
Jingjing, use a silver needle
to prick his right hand's ring finger.

13
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,680
Silver needle.

14
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,480
Hurry up.

15
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,760
Silver needle.

16
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,960
Not this one.

17
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,520
Qiqiao mustn't have gone far.

18
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,440
I'll go after her.

19
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,640
I'll go with you.

20
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,760
No, the danger this time

21
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,080
is different from before.

22
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,640
You and Jingjing take good care
of He Hongfeng.

23
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,680
But...

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,240
Do as I say.

25
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,280
I'll go out of town.

26
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,120
The sun is about to set.

27
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,440
That'll cost extra.

28
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,520
Whatever you say.

29
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,520
I'll listen to you.

30
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,480
Then, I'll take this job.

31
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,280
Please.

32
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,720
There's blood on your hand.

33
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,560
Let's call the police.

34
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,720
So you won't do business, huh?

35
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,320
Looks like I have to do this.

36
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,720
The Bell Spell?

37
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,640
Truly ruthless.

38
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,120
He Hongfeng.

39
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,960
Why am I in your arms?

40
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,360
What did you do to me?

41
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,800
You don't remember anything?

42
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,920
I remember.

43
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,640
Qiqiao.

44
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,440
Qiqiao?

45
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,520
What else?

46
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,240
I don't remember.

47
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,160
Think harder.

48
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,800
Oh no.

49
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,120
It's going to rain.

50
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,680
Qin Yang has an illness.

51
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,960
Whenever it rains, he'll...

52
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
Anyway, it'll be very bad,

53
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,080
especially during thunders.

54
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,320
Keep an eye on He Hongfeng.

55
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,240
I'll look for Qin Yang.

56
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,960
Wait a second. Give this to him.

57
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,880
Make him take it.

58
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,080
Are you alright?

59
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,200
I'm okay.

60
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,560
Bro.

61
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,560
Save me!

62
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,040
Bro.

63
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,800
I really didn't expect

64
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,480
that the omnipotent Mr. Qin

65
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,680
would look like this on a rainy day.

66
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,360
Don't come over.

67
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,160
Step back.

68
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,720
If I were you,

69
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,760
I would have shot the head just now.

70
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm not like you.

71
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,280
I won't harm others' lives at will,

72
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,440
or commit those crimes

73
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,240
on behalf of the Night God Society.

74
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,600
Of course, you're not like me.

75
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,760
You are the daughter of the Shen family,

76
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,360
born into a noble family.

77
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,920
But I was born into a poor family.

78
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,880
If it weren't
for the Night God Society's master,

79
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,280
I would still be a poor woman now.

80
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,160
No matter what your background is,

81
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,720
as long as you make a mistake,
you will be punished.

82
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,480
Law is supposed to protect
ordinary people like you

83
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,320
who are still striving to live.

84
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,480
You speak so righteously.

85
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,640
If that were the case,

86
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,480
why would Wutong have joined
the Night God Society?

87
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,160
There'll always be mistakes,

88
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,680
just like this rain

89
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,800
The rain will stop,

90
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,480
but justice will not be blinded.

91
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,960
You really are an interesting person.

92
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,920
Seeing how much you care about Qin Yang,

93
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,120
I guess you must like him.

94
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,560
How about this, Miss Shen?

95
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,880
Let's play a game.

96
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,600
Capture me, the real culprit,

97
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,360
and announce justice to the world,

98
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,320
or save the man you love?

99
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,480
Which will you choose?

100
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,480
Qin Yang.

101
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,800
Qin Yang.

102
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,160
Qin Yang.

103
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,960
Qin Yang.

104
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,200
Qin Yang.

105
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,880
Qin Yang.

106
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,280
I have the medicine.

107
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,080
Come on, take the medicine.

108
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,000
Qin Yang.

109
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,040
Qin Yang.

110
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,400
Wake up.

111
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,560
