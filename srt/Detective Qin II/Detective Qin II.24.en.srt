00:00:33,023 --> 00:00:36,044
=Detective Qin II=

2
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:38,988
=Episode 24=

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,120
(Last time we mentioned,)

4
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,240
(Mr. Qin cleverly unraveled
the murder ghost in the Liu mansion,)

5
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,480
(and captured the murderer
who disguised as the Yellow Immortal.)

6
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,120
(This time, Mr. Qian,
the richest man in town,)

7
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,680
(encountered the backlash
of an evil god at home,)

8
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,360
(and died in a strange way.)

9
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,320
(Even Mr. Qin was cursed
by the evil god.)

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,560
(At this critical moment,)

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,400
(a figure suddenly appeared,)

12
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,520
(and saved Mr. Qin.)

13
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,480
You're not that good.

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,000
A few managed such a beating.

15
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,920
I haven't even eaten yet.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,120
Wait until I'm full.

17
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,280
Full or not, your odds are slim.

18
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,000
Who made the bride marry the groom?

19
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,920
It is the bride
who willingly marries the groom

20
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,560
with the blessings
of relatives and friends.

21
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,920
Groom, do you take
this beautiful woman before you

22
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,840
as your wife?

23
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,560
To cherish her, to protect her,
to comfort her,

24
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,920
and to treat her as a treasure

25
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,080
in sickness and in health,

26
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,480
for richer and for poorer.

27
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,640
Yes, I do.

28
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,880
Bride, do you take
this handsome man before you

29
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,080
as your husband?

30
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,920
To trust him, to support him
and to rely on him

31
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,080
in sickness and in health,

32
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,880
for richer and for poorer.

33
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,720
(Look what the Night God Society
has done over the years.)

34
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,280
(Children are rendered homeless.)

35
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,240
(Lovers are displaced.)

36
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,600
(And Yuan Jingjing.)

37
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,480
(What is her fault?)

38
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,720
(You're talking about the grand cause,)

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,360
(but it's nothing more than for)

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,600
(the shameless wretches
of your own selfish desires.)

41
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,200
(You're worse than demons.)

42
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,280
(Don't expect me)

43
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,720
(to show weakness before you.)

44
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,000
Bride, do you wish to?

45
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,440
Rou.

46
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,200
What's wrong?

47
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,040
Let's go.

48
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,400
Stop here.

49
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,360
What's up?

50
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,080
Fancy a fight?

51
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,200
Come on.

52
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,560
Just go.

53
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,600
Congratulations!

54
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,840

A little boy

71
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,200
risked his life to save me.

72
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,560
He said his dream was to weed out
the strong and support the weak,

73
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,880
and to settle the injustices.

74
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,320
To save me,

75
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,560
he got stabbed in the shoulder.
