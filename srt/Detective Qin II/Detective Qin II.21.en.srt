2
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:39,052
=Episode 21=

3
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,400
Mr. Qin.

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,480
Hello again.

5
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,040
Why are you always around?

6
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,160
What do you want to do?

7
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,360
Mr. Qin has been obstructing

8
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,000
the grand cause of
the Night God Society.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,160
I've been ordered to kill you.

10
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,920
I'm afraid
your hypnosis skill isn't enough.

11
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,760
I already know your hypnotism mechanism.

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,680
And your bell is no longer
effective against me.

13
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,640
It's a pity.

14
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,440
The seeds of hypnosis
have already been planted in you.

15
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,920
They should have sprouted by now.

16
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,960
It's late at night.
Mr. Qin, be careful with the fire.

17
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,320
(Brother, don't leave.)

18
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,600
(Don't leave me alone in the water.)

19
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,880
(Don't go.)

20
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,200
(Brother,
don't leave me alone in the water.)

21
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,200
(Brother.)

22
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,240
Jingjing.

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,000
Jingjing.

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,640
What's on your mind now?

25
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,080
Why am I here?

26
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,640
Where is Shen Rou?

27
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,800
What are you talking about?

28
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,160
You're just dreaming again.

29
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,080
Did you memorize what I just said?

30
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
What did you say?

31
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,880
The Destiny is derived

32
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,320
from the five Taoist arts,

33
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,200
Cultivation, Medicine,
Projection, Observation and Divination.

34
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,000
Wait a moment.

35
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,840
Why are you teaching me this?

36
00:02:34,848 --> 00:02:36,200
You take me on as your disciple?

37
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,480
You're my disciple.

38
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,560
Is that so?

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,000
So that's it.

40
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,520
You had a twin brother

41
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,960
named Qin Ming.

42
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,520
One time, you

43
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,320
both fell into the water
at the same time.

44
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,440
While you watched

45
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,120
your own brother

46
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,800
got swept away by the water

47
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,920
in order to stay alive.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,640
Your survival instinct
fueled your selfishness.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,160
Over so many years,

50
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,760
you have been living
with deep self-blame.

51
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,360
Consequently, you're utterly terrified

52
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,000
of everything related to water.

53
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
Am I right?

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,280
Qin Yang.

55
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,960
It's not me.

56
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,040
It's not me.

57
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,400
How do we...?

58
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,360
Haven't you always wanted to marry me?

59
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,120
While I feel like
I'm forgetting something.

60
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,720
Don't overthink it, Jingjing.

61
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,400
It's a good day coming up.

62
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,720
Let's begin wedding ceremony.

63
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,760
Wedding ceremony?

64
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,000
We can get married
and enter the bridal chamber?

65
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,160
But what about Shen Rou?

66
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,600
Jingjing,
why do you still not understand?

67
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,480
If there's no Shen Rou,

68
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,440
this could be our future.

69
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,040
Qin Yang, I've burnt
all the Mystery Powder inside.

70
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,520
Qin Yang.

71
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,520
Qin Yang.

72
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,960
Qin Yang.

73
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,920
What have you done to them?

74
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,960
My illusion is best at drawing out

75
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,000
the most genuine desires
in people's hearts

76
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,400
and the most desperate fears.

77
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,120
They won't wake up easily.

78
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,720
As for you.

79
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,440
Miss Shen.

80
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,480
I have said

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,640
that when we meet again,

82
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,400
I will take away everything you have.

83
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,040
You can't save

84
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,160
either of them.

85
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,280
Qin Yang.

86
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,680
Wake up, Qin Yang.

87
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,400
(Brother, don't go.
Don't leave me alone in the water.)

88
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,640
(Brother, don't go.)

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,400
(Don't leave me alone in the water.)

90
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,200
Qin Yang.

91
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,400
Qin Yang.

92
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,240
Once there was a little boy.

93
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,560
He told me he had a dream.

94
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,320
He wanted to help the weak,

95
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,280
and to settle
the injustices of the world.

96
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,440
However, there are too many for him.

97
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,520
It wasn't enough to rely on him alone.

98
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,120
Thus, he saved people as best he could.

99
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,600
He also ran an orphanage.

100
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,960
That's right,
that little boy was actually you.

101
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,800
Qin Yang.

102
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,360
I've noticed
the scar on your left shoulder.

103
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,040
While you still want to keep it from me.

104
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,960
You are so silly.

105
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,840
Wake up, Qin Yang.

106
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,280
Qin Yang.

107
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,560
Qin Yang.

108
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,480
(I'll give you an umbrella
when it rains.)

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,720
(If you fall in the lake,)

110
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,080
(I'll rescue you.)

111
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,800
(Regardless of future events,)

112
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,840
(I will always be there with you.)

113
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,840
(Brother, don't leave me.)

114
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,520
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,160
There's someone important outside.

116
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,600
I can't make the same mistake.

117
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,600
I need to go out.

118
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,400
Be careful!

119
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,720
Jingjing.

120
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,720
Hurry up!

121
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,600
Jingjing.

122
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,680
Jingjing.

123
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,800
Hold on. I'll get you to the hospital.

124
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,120
Jingjing.

125
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,440
Come on, take her home.

126
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,240
Yes.

127
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,000
Miss, let's go home.

128
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,280
I'm not going to the hospital.
I want to tell you something.

129
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,120
Qin Yang.

130
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,160
I just had a dream.

131
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,280
Captain.
There's a lot of Mystery Powder here.

132
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,640
In my dream,
you took me as your apprentice.

133
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,480
We rescued my parents together.

134
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,640
In the end,

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,200
we even got married.

136
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,080
Stop talking. I need to
take you to the hospital first.

137
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,960
There's no time left.

138
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,920
Will you marry me?

139
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,920
Actually, I knew

140
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,480
it was a dream.

141
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,760
You kept calling me
Jingjing in a cheesy way.

142
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,920
How could it be?

143
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,400
I will take you as my apprentice.

144
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,160
When you get better,

145
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,559
I will teach you all my skills.

146
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,000
I know why you
didn't take me as your apprentice.

147
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,679
You're afraid I'll die in the grave

148
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,480
like my parents after I learn the ropes.

149
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,040
But I just can't help pestering you.

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,960
I can't help

151
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,920
pestering you,

152
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,760
and playing ghosts to scare you.

153
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,400
I begged you to take me as your apprentice.

154
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,600
Is this love, Qin Yang?

155
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,240
However, in the dream,

156
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,040
why

157
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,400
did I always feel strange

158
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,560
when I married you?

159
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,840
Are you afraid?

160
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,640
I finally

161
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,320
scare you.

162
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,760
Jingjing.

163
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,440
Don't scare me, Jingjing.

164
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,960
You really scared me, Jingjing.

165
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
Jingjing, wake up.

166
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,920
Jingjing.
