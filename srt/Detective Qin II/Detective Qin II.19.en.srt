=Detective Qin II=

2
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:38,988
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:48,992 --> 00:00:50,144
(New Women)

4
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,240
He must be hiding something from us.

5
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,000
Mr. Qian's knife wound is inexplicable.

6
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,400
So many doubts.

7
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,680
We can't close the case yet.

8
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,800
But Miss,

9
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,480
the impact of this case is very bad.

10
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,120
Chu Jiangping confessed to the crime.

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,600
The chief ordered
Chu Jiangping's execution tomorrow.

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,280
We have no choice.

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,160
Since Miss Qian
has been missing for so long,

14
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,760
the Qian family would definitely

15
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,240
place a notice in the newspapers.

16
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,440
But in the newspaper,

17
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,920
there isn't Miss Qian's photo at all.

18
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,800
Really?

19
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,440
How strange.

20
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,280
How can people find her without a photo?

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,800
I suddenly realized

22
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,880
we've never known
what Miss Qian looks like.

23
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,080
This is not normal.

24
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,520
Boss.

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,960
Boss.

26
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,440
You're not normal either.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,480
But I'm good-looking.

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,000
They said that on the night
of Qian Hansheng's death,

29
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,440
Miss Qian's photos

30
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,880
disappeared overnight.

31
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,560
It seems

32
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,160
Chu Jiangping didn't want us know

33
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,400
what Miss Qian looks like.

34
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,600
But why?

35
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,320
Unless we have seen Miss Qian.

36
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,960
The assistant!

37
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,840
It seems

38
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,320
we're a step too late.

39
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,400
Miss Qian, whom we've been looking for

40
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,560
turns out to be right there.

41
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,760
Come on.

42
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,440
Are you looking for me?

43
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,800
You haven't left?

44
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,600
Mr. Chu told me to leave quickly.

45
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,400
But I didn't listen.

46
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,000
Can you tell me

47
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,560
what will happen to him?

48
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,840
He has already confessed

49
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,120
and will be executed soon.

50
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,680
As expected.

51
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,200
Is this his plan?

52
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,360
Tell me

53
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,120
what exactly happened that night.

54
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,320
Mr. Chu doesn't allow me to tell anyone.

55
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,760
But I don't want him to die.

56
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,120
I'll tell you.

57
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,360
Can you save him?

58
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,160
That's why we're here.

59
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,280
Okay.

60
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,880
Then I'll speak.

61
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,960
Daughter, be good.

62
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,920
I have raised you for years.

63
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,080
Your birth time is the most suitable.

64
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,720
Not offering you to the evil god,

65
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,360
how can I prolong my life then?

66
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,000
Good girl, let's go.

67
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,840
Be good.

68
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,040
- Move!
- I won't go!

69
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,320
Believe it or not, I'll kill you now.

70
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,440
Grabbing the knife?

71
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
Try again?

72
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,560
He's not dead yet.

73
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,640
I can help you.

74
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,640
Later, Mr. Chu said

75
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,560
he'll handle everything.

76
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,960
He only sent me to the photo studio.

77
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,720
No matter what the boss asks me,

78
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,960
I should say I've come for the photos.

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,240
Do you know what all you're saying means?

80
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,400
I do.

81
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,520
It means that my father was

82
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,520
in fact, killed by me.

83
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,160
But I just want to help Mr. Chu out.

84
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,560
I know he is a good person.

85
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,360
He shouldn't die here.

86
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,440
Mr. Chu,

87
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,280
the execution is tomorrow.

88
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,120
Anything else to add?

89
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,080
Mr. Qin, since you came to see me
at this time,

90
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,840
I assume you've found out the truth.

91
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,560
Fortunately, she should have gone far.

92
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,440
If you do this,

93
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,240
how will she survive?

94
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,120
I've taught her medical skills.

95
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,000
And I've left all the books to her.

96
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,000
She's smart.

97
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,680
She'll be a doctor in the future.

98
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,040
You two aren't even family.

99
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,200
Is it worth it?

100
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,960
I once had a patient.

101
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,400
I could not save her.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,520
But Miss Qian is different.

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,240
She has no ill intentions.

104
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,760
I believe she can still be saved.

105
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,280
And Mr. Qin,

106
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,640
I remember a woman by your side.

107
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,320
If she hadn't beg me,

108
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,880
I wouldn't have saved you.

109
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,640
My disciple

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,720
is determined to be a good police.

111
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,720
On the one hand,

112
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,360
she wants to bring you, the criminal,
to justice.

113
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,320
On the other hand,

114
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,560
she couldn't withstand
Miss Qian's earnest entreaties.

115
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,160
So,

116
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,080
out of sight, out of mind.

117
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,800
Earnest entreaties?

118
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,640
Dr. Chu, though your plan was perfect,

119
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,800
you still missed one thing.

120
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,400
Why are you still here?

121
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,280
We sneaked her in.

122
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,160
No one knows.

123
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,280
I'm sorry, Mr. Chu.

124
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,120
I've disobeyed again.

125
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,280
But I just wanted to save you.

126
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,800
This was my own decision.

127
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,760
I don't need you to save me.

128
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,080
Mr. Chu,

129
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,800
although you are strict with me,

130
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,120
I know you are the kindest in the world,

131
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,280
the warmest.

132
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,920
What exactly is the reason

133
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,520
that you have become like this?

134
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,640
It's none of your business.

135
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,120
How is it not?

136
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,960
Because I...

137
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,480
I like you, Mr. Chu.

138
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,040
There was girl in my peer.

139
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,320
She went to collect herbs for me once.

140
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,320
The Night God Society abducted her
and sold her.

141
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,320
By the time I found her,

142
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,919
she was already dying.

143
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,559
I tried everything I could,

144
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,320
even sought help from West medicine.

145
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,240
But I couldn't save her life.

146
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,640
I promised her

147
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,200
that on every anniversary of her death,

148
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,800
I would take a photo,

149
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,880
as if she was always by my side.

150
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,000
You just won't listen!

151
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,720
You think you're a princess?

152
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,000
Everything you have is provided by me.

153
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,520
If you don't listen,

154
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,600
next time I will break your leg!

155
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,800
So,

156
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,400
I was just avenging that girl I knew,

157
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,000
and incidentally saved you.

158
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,160
Miss Qian,
if there's any misunderstanding,

159
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,680
please forgive me.

160
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,200
But...

161
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,920
But?

162
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,120
But what?

163
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,640
Do you believe

164
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,520
as long as I die,

165
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,880
before long,

166
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,160
you'll forget me?

167
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,600
Do you know you've ruined my plan?

168
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,040
If you know what's good,

169
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,640
you'd better leave.

170
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,200
Go away!

171
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,920
Even if you don't like me.

172
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,920
I won't forget you.

173
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,920
Miss Qian.

174
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,920
You weird doctor.

175
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,480
Why go so far?

176
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,040
I've never begged anyone.

177
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,680
Today, I ask you two to keep the secret.

178
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,240
The death of Qian is a big deal.

179
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,240
The Night God Society
won't just let it go.

180
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,320
But as long as I die,

181
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,560
Miss Qian will be perfectly clean.

182
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
She'll be out of trouble forever.

183
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,680
But she'll hate you
for the rest of her life.

184
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,040
Is it worth it?

185
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,400
Being separated by life and death,
I know the feeling too well.

186
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,440
Why make her experience it?

187
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,320
So these few herbs

188
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,440
can be combined like this!

189
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,280
I planned to teach you
how to respond to inquiries,

190
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,360
didn't expect you to be quite talented.

191
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,680
Let me try again.

192
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,600
It will be better.

193
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,120
(Senior,)

194
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,120
(in the future,
you will surely meet the one for you.)

195
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,240
Mr. Qin,

196
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,640
have you been constantly experiencing

197
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,160
illusions of angering the Fire God?

198
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,880
(Fire god disrespects will burn
within three days.)

199
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,160
Are you saying that you put something

200
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,080
into the antidote you gave me?

201
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,880
But...

202
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,880
I knew you would check the prescription.

203
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,520
But the part I tampered with wasn't it.

204
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,800
It was the statue.

205
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,600
I anticipated you would touch it.

206
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,640
Though the hallucination isn't fatal,

207
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,560
it's quite unpleasant, isn't it?

208
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,480
You even predicted
that he would touch the statue?

209
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,560
This time, I had to play the villain.

210
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,280
After my death,
Mr. Qin will receive the antidote.

211
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,080
Aren't you two curious

212
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,800
where did Qian get his money from?

213
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,960
Are you referring to Mystery Powder?

214
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,000
Mr. Qin is indeed clever.

215
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,640
Qian has a secret warehouse in the city,

216
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,720
filled with Mystery Powder.

217
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,680
I know where it is.
