1
00:00:33,018 --> 00:00:36,039
=Detective Qin II=

2
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:39,072
=Episode 9=

3
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,280
- Carry it out.
- Yes.

4
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,320
Hurry up! Carry it out!

5
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,680
Don't get into these superstitions.
They don't work.

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,880
Are these exorcism charms?

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,760
Yes, they are.

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,680
You do have good stuff.

9
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,920
Who said "superstitions"?

10
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,240
Shot in the forehead.

11
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,040
We're still a little late.

12
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,160
Mr. Shen.

13
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,560
Rou.

14
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,640
I heard the Night God Society
is involved.

15
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,400
I don't allow you to work this case.

16
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,200
While the case is about to be solved.

17
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,920
If we can identify who is

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,920
the third man in advance,

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,080
we can protect him
before the killer takes action.

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,440
Just leave it to them.

21
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,840
It's a police duty.

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,600
I tell you that

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,360
the Detective Agency is not
to be involved in this anymore.

24
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,680
Do you hear me?

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,000
Yes, I do.

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,440
Leave the rest to the police.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,480
Let's go home.

28
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,880
- Go back.
- Detective He, check it out.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,560
Hongfeng.

30
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,200
Yes.

31
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,440
For the safety of Shen Rou,

32
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,120
you must not let her
get involved in this anymore.

33
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,040
Yes, Mr. Shen.

34
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,120
Keep an eye on her.

35
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,400
Do we really just give up?

36
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,240
I've figured out where the ghost is.

37
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,480
I knew you could do it.

38
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,440
The sequence of the crimes

39
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,680
is always related
to the story of the Peony Pavilion.

40
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,000
If she wants to play a trick
to bring back the dead,

41
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,080
she will choose
the Plum Blossom Nunnery.

42
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,280
Plum Blossom Nunnery?

43
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,480
Du Liniang is buried there.

44
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,080
In context,

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,360
Wutong is buried at Mass Grave Hill.

46
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,400
How do you guess that?

47
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,520
I can't get out.

48
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,200
Wutong?

49
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,400
This is impossible.

50
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,200
You... You're dead.

51
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,320
I killed you with my own hands.

52
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,000
Wutong.

53
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,520
I've looked into your birth time.

54
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,920
You were born on Sept. 21
in the year of the Rooster at 1-3 AM.

55
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,200
Ding fire in early autumn
is gentle yet not weak.

56
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,840
You are delicate and sentimental.

57
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,120
Gentle but strong.

58
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,040
Three years ago,

59
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,760
in the turn of the Year of the Snake,
the Ding fire appeared.

60
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,400
It was a dangerous year
and was full of misfortune.

61
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,200
Ding fire showed a tendency
to get into trouble.

62
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,520
Even if you didn't die,
you would suffer from damage.

63
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,360
However, you're a twin.

64
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,120
Qin Yang.

65
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,520
You're really something.

66
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,240
I didn't expect you to
figure it out in just a few words.

67
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,640
Wutong has died,

68
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,800
but she was just one of the two.

69
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,240
To change form and position

70
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,840
and appear simultaneously
at both ends of the stage.

71
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,920
Wutong should be two people.

72
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,200
They should be twin sisters.

73
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,160
How did you know it was me?

74
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,840
When I met you at the theater,

75
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,200
I noticed your steady steps.

76
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,120
Even with a broom,
you also exposed skills.

77
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,560
You feigned a limp deliberately,

78
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,240
but the habits from years
of learning cannot be hidden.

79
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,240
However, at that time,
I merely thought you were secretive.

80
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,400
What made me suspicious of you was
what I discovered at Mr. Wang's house.

81
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,400
I found toe-tip shoe marks
on the ground at the doorway.

82
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,280
It indicates that the culprit
is a master of the ghost step.

83
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,640
At the same time, I noticed

84
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,680
the knots on the ropes
of two hanged victims

85
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,640
were both skewed to the left.

86
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,080
The Three-Eyes in Obscure Market

87
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,000
said the culprit wrote with left hand.

88
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,280
Therefore, I deduced
the murderer was left-handed.

89
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,760
This reminded me
of when I first saw you,

90
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,120
you were holding a broom
with your left hand.

91
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,120
At the police station,

92
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,080
I deliberately
identified your signature.

93
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,240
This involves secrets
in the investigation.

94
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,840
(Bai Feng)
Although you concealed it,

95
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,440
(Bai Feng)
yet the style of the brush

96
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,680
was still similar to
the handwriting in Obscure Market.

97
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,760
Yes, you are right.

98
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,160
Three years ago, I was supposed to
be serving these people.

99
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,560
While in order to
protect me, my sister...

100
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,440
She went alone.

101
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,080
Listen to me.

102
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,040
The person they are looking for is you.

103
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,160
While we look alike,

104
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,080
so you are me and I am you.

105
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,320
Be obedient.

106
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,280
Even if I was born a moment before you,

107
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,720
I am still your sister. Be obedient.

108
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,680
Miss Wutong.

109
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,040
Hide quickly!

110
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,280
Hurry up! Hide quickly!

111
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,880
She is Miss Wutong.

112
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,240
Miss Wutong.

113
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,520
You are so beautiful.

114
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,360
Beautiful.

115
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,720
Don't touch me!

116
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,120
Come on.

117
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,320
You are so rude.

118
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,280
Let me do it.

119
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,840
Don't touch me.

120
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,840
She bit me.

121
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:20,920
She bit me.

122
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,600
How did she die?

123
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,640
To revenge,

124
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,080
I joined the Night God Society,

125
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,520
and disfigured myself to
merge with theatrical troupe.

126
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,120
Three years.

127
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,920
It has been three years.

128
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,800
I've finally
waited for this opportunity.

129
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,520
Do you think I should give up?

130
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,080
I have money. I have a lot of money.

131
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,680
- Please save me.
- Shut up!

132
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,600
Wutong.

133
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,000
All appearances

134
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,160
are illusions.

135
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,880
If we can see through appearances,

136
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,080
we can get truth.

137
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,480
It's been so long.

138
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,000
You should let it go.

139
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,640
You mean that

140
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,960
I'm the one who's in too deep.

141
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,080
Miss Wutong,

142
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,040
your sister left you this chance

143
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,240
because she wanted you to live

144
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,400
instead of being mired
in bitter vengeance.

145
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,760
Wutong.

146
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,280
Stop singing.

147
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,200
What's wrong with me singing?

148
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,480
You sing out of tune.

149
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,760
Why?

150
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,920
Why do bad people
never get their punishment!

151
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,880
Evil has retribution,

152
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,720
but its time has not yet come.

153
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,280
When can it arrive?

154
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,400
Since the God doesn't care,

155
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,520
and then I will do it.

156
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,880
I will give them their retribution.

157
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,679
Don't shoot!

158
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,919
What are you doing?

159
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,440
Take her to the hospital.

160
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,080
Hurry up! Go!

161
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,160
Hurry up!

162
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,560
You're too late.

163
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,920
She's pointing a gun at me.

164
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,840
I'm friends with your chief.

165
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,320
Miss Shen, are you alright?

166
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,000
Wutong.

167
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,240
Rest in peace.

168
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,040
