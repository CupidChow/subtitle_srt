1
00:00:33,046 --> 00:00:36,067
=Detective Qin II=

2
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:39,011
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,080
Slow down.

4
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,840
How do you feel?

5
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,640
Are you better? Little Beggar.

6
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,520
Who is a Little Beggar?

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,080
I am Yuan Tiangang's...

8
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,680
Alright.

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,200
Come on.

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,000
Drink water.

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,520
By the way.

12
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,880
What else has
the Detective Agency been doing

13
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,920
besides this case?

14
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,480
Nothing else.

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,840
Why are you suddenly asking this?

16
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
Trying to steal our case?

17
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,120
No.

18
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,960
I just feel that

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,840
Miss Shen I know is not fond of smiling.

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,240
But just now,
the way she looked at Mr. Qin...

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,080
You mean that...

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,440
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

23
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,720
What's going on with Mr. Qin these days?

24
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,440
How do I know

25
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,440
what's going on with him?

26
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,040
He's been silent with me recently.

27
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,360
I've known him for so many years.

28
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,960
He's just not interested in me.

29
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,320
Can't investigate.

30
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,840
Can't be his apprentice.

31
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,760
After taking Shen Rou as his apprentice,

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,600
he's happy investigating cases.

33
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,600
Miss Shen is getting married.

34
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,440
If Mr. Shen finds out about this,

35
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,840
he will be very angry.

36
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,400
How about this?

37
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,960
You work at our police station.

38
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,080
Meals are managed.

39
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,320
Shut up.

40
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,800
Who wants to eat your food?

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,440
Haven't you eaten a lot?

42
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,240
You said
the Night God Society criminals.

43
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,840
I think my father mentioned it before.

44
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,920
Chief Shen?

45
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,480
Right.

46
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,320
What did he say?

47
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,800
He said that...

48
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,600
Did you hear any noise just now?

49
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,200
Let's go now.

50
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,520
I was so scared.

51
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,800
Let's go.

52
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,120
Go.

53
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,280
Why do you look so red?

54
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,720
No, I'm not.

55
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,760
According to
traditional medicine, flushing

56
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,840
may be caused
by hyperactivity of the liver yang.

57
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,400
You talk tough.

58
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,960
Did I say anything wrong?

59
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
In terms of facial theories,

60
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,200
flushing could also mean...

61
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,120
Don't say it.

62
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,960
It makes no sense.

63
00:04:16,864 --> 00:04:18,237
(Good Chances)

64
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:02,124
(Ledger)

65
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,600
Are you okay?

66
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,480
You save me again.

67
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,320
Mystery Powder is merely an illusion.

68
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,000
You're injured.

69
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,560
I can't believe you.

70
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,840
It's such a simple trick

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,480
but you fell for it twice.

72
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,720
Although it's just an illusion,

73
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,840
it's still dangerous.

74
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,920
Don't be reckless next time.

75
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,760
Allowing me to join
the Detective Agency as your apprentice

76
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,440
is just for earning
some silver dollars, right?

77
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,720
Or else?

78
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,200
Am I too idle
to find something for myself?

79
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,440
I'm asking
if my father wasn't the ex-chief,

80
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,200
and I was just a common person,

81
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,120
would you...?

82
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,920
There's some noise.

83
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,720
Let's take a look.

84
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,240
Let's go out first.

85
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,520
I've found something good.

86
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,160
Let's return
to the police station first.

87
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,600
Not now.

88
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,920
I always thought there was
something wrong with He Hongfeng.

89
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,880
I heard that
the people from Night God Society

90
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,800
were released by him.

91
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,440
I think you misunderstand him.

92
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,840
He let them go,

93
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,400
but he was following them.

94
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,640
The purpose is
to catch a big fish on a long line,

95
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,200
and find their base.

96
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,680
Why didn't he tell me?

97
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,680
You should go ask him yourself.

98
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,240
Such an embarrassing matter.

99
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,680
How can I say it?

100
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,960
You've done
a lot of embarrassing things.

101
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:54,800
You...

102
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,680
How did you two get here?

103
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,320
Can't we worry about your safety?

104
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,360
You seem to be doing well.

105
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,560
I'm going to sleep.

106
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,360
Jingjing.

107
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,040
What's wrong with you?

108
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,960
It is because...

109
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
And then?

110
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,280
How did these people die?

111
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,520
Actually...

112
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,320
I don't know.

113
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,840
I followed them all the way
until they met up.

114
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,760
However, I dozed off inexplicably.

115
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,720
When I woke up,

116
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,080
they had all been killed already.

117
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,400
Because of this,

118
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,040
Mr. Shen scolded me harshly.

119
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,240
You deserve it.

120
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,120
Do you know
what the contact person looks like?

121
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,680
I didn't see clearly.

122
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,560
But one thing is certain.

123
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,280
It's a woman.
