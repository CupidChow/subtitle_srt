00:00:33,055 --> 00:00:36,076
=Detective Qin II=

2
00:00:36,076 --> 00:00:39,020
=Episode 16=

3
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,160
What a shame.

4
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,720
Such a nice unwed girl.

5
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,160
Your dad sold you to me.

6
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,760
Didn't see this coming, huh?

7
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,960
You...

8
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,760
What are you doing to me?

9
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,680
What am I doing?

10
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,000
Of course, to sacrifice you
to the evil god.

11
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,920
No!

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,720
Don't!

13
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,160
I'm begging you. Please let me go!

14
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,960
I'm begging you!

15
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,120
Wow,

16
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,160
I'm about to achieve immortality.

17
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,960
I'm about to achieve immortality.

18
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,280
Help!

19
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,120
I'm about to achieve immortality.

20
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,720
Help! I'm begging you.

21
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,320
Spare me, please!

22
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,120
Help!

23
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,120
Help!

24
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,880
Help!

25
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,360
His pulse is now stable.

26
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,600
He's out of danger now.

27
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,240
I'm Shen Rou.

28
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,320
My dad is the former police chief.

29
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,440
If you need help in the future...

30
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,200
The gentry often exploits common people.

31
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,280
Merchants often dominate the markets.

32
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,640
How could someone like me
deserve their help?

33
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,800
How can you say that?

34
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,920
Shen Rou is a good person.

35
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,720
I'm just a rustic villager.

36
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,760
I don't want to get involved with you.

37
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,440
Leave as soon as you can.

38
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,920
Mr. Chu,

39
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,480
if you need any assistance,

40
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,320
just let me know.

41
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,080
I'll surely prove to you

42
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,520
my sincerity.

43
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,240
Okay.

44
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,960
The vat for decocting medicine is empty.

45
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,960
If you can fill the water vat
before sunset,

46
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,800
I'll agree to treat this person.

47
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,000
The water for decocting medicine

48
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,960
is from the stream atop the mountain.

49
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,960
It's at least several miles from here
to the mountain top.

50
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,560
Aren't you just bullying her?

51
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,840
I'll go with you.

52
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,640
No way.

53
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,120
She must go by herself.

54
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,840
I'll go right now.

55
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,880
Please do not go back on your word.

56
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,720
Please take care of Qin Yang.

57
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,000
Do you want to take a rest?

58
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,080
It's getting dark soon.

59
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,120
The water in the vat isn't
even half full.

60
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,640
I advise you to give up.

61
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,200
You deliberately make things difficult

62
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,320
and even make snide remarks?

63
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,520
You're really despicable.

64
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,520
It's fine. Since I've promised,
I must do it.

65
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,320
Are you alright?

66
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,360
I'm fine.

67
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,480
What are you doing here?

68
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,280
Decoct the medicine now.

69
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,360
The medicine has been decocted.

70
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,600
If the medicine is decocted,

71
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,040
go transcribe the medical books.

72
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,160
From now on, without my permission,

73
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,760
you're not allowed to come out.

74
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,520
You're used to luxury.

75
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,440
Is it necessary to do this for him?

76
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,880
He saved me before.

77
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,320
So I must save him too.

78
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,600
There's still so much left.

79
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,080
It's already dark.

80
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,840
It's okay. I'll go and get more.

81
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,880
No need.

82
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,880
He's taken the medicine

83
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,400
and is already awake.

84
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,000
Go in and check on him.

85
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,720
Your palm shows quite something.

86
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,640
Look, there's a gold ingot in your palm.

87
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,400
And this wealth line

88
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,640
goes all the way here.

89
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,960
You should have a wealthy
and noble life.

90
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,080
How did you end up working here?

91
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,720
Well, let me tell you.

92
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,800
My detective agency is going to expand
at the end of the year.

93
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,760
How about you invest in it?

94
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,840
Invest a bit in it, okay?

95
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,960
We should have just let you die.

96
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,120
You curse me as soon as I wake up?

97
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,520
Let's continue.

98
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,640
Stick your tongue out.

99
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,600
Let me check your tongue.

100
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,040
Don't be mad.

101
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,440
I've already scolded him for you.

102
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,800
I'm not mad.

103
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,840
He can read palms
for whoever he wants to.

104
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,120
What's it to me?

105
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,840
Shen Rou.

106
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,760
Do you like Qin Yang?

107
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,040
I don't like him.

108
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,160
That's right.

109
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,480
Qin Yang is

110
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,160
like an idiot when it comes to romance.

111
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,600
Who would like him?

112
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,000
Excuse me.

113
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,920
Taking this medicine before going to bed

114
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,960
can help relieve fatigue.

115
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,800
Thank you, Mr. Chu.

116
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
There's one more thing.

117
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,400
Has the patient been taking
this medicine?

118
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,360
Yes, what's wrong?

119
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,920
For how long?

120
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,040
He's been taking it since I knew him.

121
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,320
Is there a problem?

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,400
That explains it.

123
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,000
The main ingredient of the medicine
is Datura metel.

124
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,800
According to Western medicine,

125
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,120
Datura metel

126
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,200
contains a substance called scopolamine.

127
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,760
I remember the Mystery Powder
also contains it.

128
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,320
No wonder Qin Yang could recognize it.

129
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,400
This substance

130
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,520
is used as a central nervous system
depressant

131
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,000
and is helpful in relieving
mental disorders.

132
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,720
You mean,

133
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,520
Qin Yang's fear of rain

134
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,280
is due to mental disorders?

135
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,760
I don't know much
about Western medicine.

136
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,680
I'm not sure about the reason.

137
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,400
However,

138
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,720
I've found he's been taking
an excessive amount of it

139
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,520
and his body is already very weak.

140
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,960
If he takes it for too long,

141
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,480
what's the worst outcome?

142
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,280
He'll die.

143
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,320
He Hongfeng, what brings you here?

144
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,000
Miss Shen.

145
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,280
Mr. Chu, this is our friend,
He Hongfeng,

146
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,560
a captain of the police station.

147
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,160
This is Mr. Chu, who saved Qin Yang.

148
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,680
Nice to meet you.

149
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,360
You can go ahead.

150
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,680
I won't disturb you anymore.

151
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,560
How is Qin Yang?

152
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
He's awake,

153
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,520
as lively as nothing's happened to him.

154
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,560
Something happened in the town.

155
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,000
I need Qin Yang's help.

156
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,400
But he's just recovered, after all.

157
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,760
What serious matter
needs his involvement?

158
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,400
The richest man we met a few days ago,

159
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,640
Qian Hansheng,

160
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,320
was killed last night.

161
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,280
What?

162
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,159
A few days ago,

163
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,640
at the Liu's residence,
you met the richest man,

164
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,080
Mr. Qian, Qian Hansheng.

165
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,360
He was killed last night.

166
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,480
Qian what?

167
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,760
Sir.

168
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,440
Come with me.

169
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,760
You've just recovered.

170
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,720
Are you really okay?

171
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,480
Detective He came to invite me
in person.

172
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,680
I definitely can't refuse me.

173
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,960
Right, Detective He?

174
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,760
Get to the point.

175
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,920
Qian Hansheng and his daughter

176
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,360
didn't come back all night.

177
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,520
This morning, the servant

178
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,960
discovered that he had died at home.

179
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,320
His death was tragic.

180
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,960
What about his daughter?

181
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,040
She went missing.

182
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,200
Moreover, there are rumors.

183
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,440
What?

184
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,360
They say Qian Hansheng

185
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,560
became the richest man so quickly

186
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,480
because he secretly worshiped
an evil god.

187
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,840
What evil god?

188
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,000
That's too ridiculous.

189
