1
00:00:33,055 --> 00:00:36,076
=Detective Qin II=

2
00:00:36,076 --> 00:00:39,020
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,480
Why haven't you left yet?

4
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,720
Mr. Shen tasks me with watching you.

5
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,520
Do you want to throw me in jail

6
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,640
or report to chief Shen?

7
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,680
I get half a bottle
of good wine from the car.

8
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,800
Let's have a drink.

9
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,520
Okay.

10
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's do it.

11
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,840
Let's do it.

12
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,640
If I'd tried to stop you,

13
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,720
Miss Shen wouldn't
have been able to see you.

14
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,840
Aren't you afraid
chief Shen will blame you?

15
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,240
I tell you.

16
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,600
When I was at the police station,

17
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,440
I was busy
investigating cases every day.

18
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,360
I've long wanted to quit.

19
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,920
Thinking about it now.

20
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,440
Investigating cases with you guys

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,320
is the happiest.

22
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,600
So do you want me to go?

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,520
Without walking a mile
in someone's shoes,

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,280
refrain from urging them to do good.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,240
I just want to persuade you

26
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,040
to seriously consider this matter.

27
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,120
How is Shen Rou's fiance?

28
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,240
Just so so.

29
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,560
But he's better looking than you,

30
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,440
taller than you,

31
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,880
and richer than you.

32
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,720
He's well learned and studied abroad.

33
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,960
He has lots in common
to talk about with Miss Shen.

34
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,600
The most important thing is

35
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,560
that he's very nice to Miss Shen.

36
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,520
Isn't that good?

37
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,360
Because of his cowardice, Liu Ping

38
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,720
almost lost his beloved.

39
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,120
Chu Jiangping's memories of the deceased

40
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,040
also ruined his happiness.

41
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,920
So don't make choices
that you'll regret.

42
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,360
More importantly,

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,680
if there are spirits in heaven,

44
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,120
what would Jingjing think?

45
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,040
Don't you disbelieve it?

46
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't believe it.

47
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,640
But I'm saying "if".

48
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,200
Perhaps it's also a comfort to

49
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,360
those of us who are alive.

50
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,240
This could be

51
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,200
the original meaning
of those demons and ghosts.

52
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,120
You're right.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,440
If Jingjing has a spirit in heaven,

54
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,960
she would think I'm stupid.

55
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,640
She would surely put her hands
on her hips and say to me.

56
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,360
Qin Yang, Shen Rou is such a good girl.

57
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,680
How could you not want her?

58
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,480
At this moment,

59
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,680
do you feel like reciting a poem?

60
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,160
Okay, I'll go first.

61
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,680
In the Peach Blossom Grove,
the Peach Blossom Hermitage stands.

62
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,880
Beneath the hermitage
dwells the Peach Blossom Immortal.

63
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,240
The immortal plants peach trees,

64
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,200
and with peach blossoms,
he trades for wine.

65
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,320
Sober, he sits by the flowers.

66
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,360
Drunk, he sleeps under them.

67
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,840
Half-drunk, half-sober,
day after day he goes.

68
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,360
As flowers fall and bloom again,
year after year.

69
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,480
The whole night has passed.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,600
Finally,
I hear you recite a different poem.

71
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,560
Let's drink.

72
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,480
Night God Society?

73
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,400
Today is the day that you die.

74
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,880
Rou, it's time to set off.

75
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,920
Don't delay the hour.

76
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,520
Hurry up.

77
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,160
Miss.

78
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,160
Miss.

79
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,840
It's time for us to depart.

80
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,600
Come together, I'm in a rush.

81
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,920
(As the saying goes, words of wisdom
fail to guide the destined to their end.)

82
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,840
(Great mercy can't cross the path
of those who've chosen to offend.)

83
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,320
(Still Water Run Deep)
Ladies and Gentlemen.

84
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,600
Today let's go on talking about

85
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,080
the Mr. Qin.

86
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,600
Why him again?

87
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,040
How great can he be?

88
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,400
You just don't understand.

89
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,280
He

90
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,440
not only knows the art of yin and yang
and the Five Elements,

91
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,560
but also has superb martial skills.

92
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,640
Legend has it that
he can fight ten by himself.

93
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,440
Thank you.

94
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,320
I'm entrusting
my precious daughter to you.

95
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,480
You must treat her well.

96
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,200
Shen Rou.

97
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,680
You look so beautiful today.

98
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,640
Priest, we can begin now.

99
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,840
