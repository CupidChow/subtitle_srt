=Detective Qin II=

2
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:38,988
=Episode 14=

3
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,880
Mr. Qin.

4
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,240
Who's there?

5
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,280
I'm Qiqiao.

6
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,920
Mr. Qin.

7
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,800
You better deal with the enemy
in front of you first.

8
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,400
Lu Mo.

9
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,160
I advise you to stop.

10
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,560
It's still not too late.

11
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,160
Mrs. Liu's death has nothing
to do with me.

12
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,520
Mrs. Liu died because of your bad karma.

13
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,040
It has nothing to do with you?

14
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,640
Bad karma?

15
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,120
Yes.

16
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,520
It was bad karma, indeed.

17
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,880
The butler asked me to get close
to Mrs. Liu

18
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,880
to gain her trust.

19
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,240
I didn't expect

20
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,200
that I truly fell in love with her.

21
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,680
So I told her everything

22
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,800
about my plans.

23
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,480
I was thinking of taking her away
after I got the money.

24
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,360
Unexpectedly,

25
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,680
she not only persuaded me to stop,

26
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,480
but also betrayed me.

27
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,080
Mr. Liu locked her in the house.

28
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,800
I was the one

29
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,440
who wanted to show her the scenery
beyond the wall.

30
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,680
Isn't that ridiculous?

31
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,880
She told Mr. Liu everything.

32
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,600
He killed her in a rage.

33
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,600
Do you know that when Mrs. Liu died,

34
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,440
she was already three months pregnant?

35
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,320
That child was yours, right?

36
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,880
That's impossible. She never told me.

37
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,680
Don't deceive me!

38
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,920
She enshrined a Buddha statue.

39
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,960
The butler said she was praying
for Mr. Liu.

40
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,360
Now it seems

41
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,160
she did that for her child.

42
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,440
No wonder

43
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,600
she chanted sutras

44
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,760
and brought me to worship Buddha.

45
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,720
After she learned of your plans,

46
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,520
she tried to persuade you to stop

47
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,800
because she was afraid your bad karma

48
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,280
would affect the child.

49
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,840
Do you still think

50
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,360
she betrayed you?

51
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,760
How could this be?

52
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,680
How could this be?

53
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,360
I can't believe I doubted her.

54
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,280
I can't believe I doubted her.

55
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,440
I'm worse than a beast.

56
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,160
I'm worse than a beast.

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,680
Let me apologize to you
after I meet you.

58
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,760
What are you looking at?

59
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,320
Nothing.

60
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,480
Ouch!

61
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,920
This is like killing the enemy

62
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,880
by injuring yourself.

63
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,680
Don't just rush forward recklessly.

64
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,720
You can run if you can't beat him.

65
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,920
Who says I can't beat him?

66
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,839
If Jingjing hadn't held me back,

67
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,399
I would've captured him long ago.

68
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,680
Why do you rush forward

69
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,720
whenever there's a danger?

70
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,880
Aren't you scared?

71
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,960
So what if I'm scared?

72
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,680
Aren't you the same?

73
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,000
You didn't run from a danger.

74
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
Look at you. Instead of being

75
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,360
just Miss Shen,

76
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,440
why want to be a police officer?

77
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,520
Actually, the reason is quite childish.

78
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,920
Then tell me. Let me know
how childish it is.

79
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,040
I encountered human traffickers
when I was seven.

80
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,480
A little boy risked his life to save me.

81
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,240
He said his dream was to help the weak

82
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,640
and to sweep away the injustices.

83
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,440
To save me,

84
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,800
his shoulder got stabbed through.

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,800
And then?

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,600
After that, I never saw him again

87
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,520
nor ran into him.

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,480
I don't know if he's still alive.

89
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,920
After that incident,

90
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,840
I made up my mind

91
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,320
to become a police officer

92
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,160
and catch all the bad people.

93
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,920
That sounds

94
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,600
like you're even more childish
than Jingjing.

95
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,320
Anyway, someone like you

96
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,080
who only cares about money
can't understand

97
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,840
righteousness.

98
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,920
Right, I can't understand.

99
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,760
Jingjing.

100
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,160
What's with that expression?

101
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,400
Are you upset?

102
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,200
Not at all.

103
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,960
I was just thinking

104
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,760
that the Night God Society was supposed

105
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,040
to come look for Mr. Liu.

106
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,640
But the case has been solved.

107
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,640
Why hasn't any one of them appeared?

108
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,000
Actually, when I was examining the body,

109
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,280
I found something unusual,

110
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,320
right when you reminded me
that Lu Mo knows martial arts.

111
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,320
What's unusual?

112
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,960
I found that Mrs. Liu also had calluses
on her hands,

113
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,480
like those on Lu Mo's hands.

114
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,120
Did she also know martial arts?

115
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,240
But, if she had known martial arts,

116
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,920
how could she have been easily killed
by Mr. Liu?

117
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,680
I also found

118
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,440
Mrs. Liu's hand tendons
had been severed.

119
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,360
It was an old injury.

120
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,600
This is bad.

121
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,080
(It is never too late
to turn your life around)

122
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,880
Do you have a stomach illness?

123
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,760
You're out of your mind.

124
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,720
You're already here

125
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,880
and you're still with this?

126
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,160
If you remember anything, tell me now.

127
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,400
You...

128
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,120
Qiqiao.

129
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,080
Thanks to Mr. Qin,

130
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,680
I could understand the full picture
of the matter.

131
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,360
What are you doing here?

132
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,640
Of course, to get what belongs
to the Night God Society.

133
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,640
The Night God Society?

134
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,280
No wonder Mrs. Liu saw through
that I knew martial arts.

135
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,040
She was from the Night God Society.

136
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,800
She was just a stupid woman

137
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,600
who gave up her martial arts
and betrayed us,

138
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,960
for the sake of love.

139
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,960
The love she wanted

140
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,000
just treated her like a canary
in a cage.

141
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,080
In the end, she died because of love.

142
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,440
That was the fate she brought
upon herself.

143
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,320
Who exactly are you?

144
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,560
Why do you know so much about her?

145
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,080
She took away the Night God Society's
personnel list.

146
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,360
She must have wanted to take revenge.

147
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,440
I guess

148
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,720
she was waiting for an opportunity

149
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,600
to hand that list over to the police.

150
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,800
But you showed up at that moment.

151
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,880
She did it to protect you.

152
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,000
Unfortunately, her lover was so foolish

153
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,720
that he would never discover the secret
before his death.

154
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,600
What are you talking about?

155
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,640
That list was sewn into her sachet

156
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,080
And that sachet

157
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,320
was given to her ill-fated lover.

158
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,720
I don't care about your
Night God Society.

159
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,480
But if you want to take away
what she left,

160
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,400
forget about it!
