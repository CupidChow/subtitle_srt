00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:39,011
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,880
Miss Jingjing.

4
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,160
You know me?

5
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,480
I'm Qiqiao.

6
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,200
I'm a maid from the Liu family.

7
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,240
I heard about you from Mr. Qin.

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,400
He said you are his
most capable assistant.

9
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,480
Did he really say that about me?

10
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,600
Of course.

11
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,640
But why are you here alone?

12
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,640
Is something bothering you?

13
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,120
What could possibly bother me?

14
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,920
Well, in that case,

15
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,440
how about I keep you company for a chat?

16
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,440
What's this?

17
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,000
A ledger.

18
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,120
Since a year ago,

19
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,320
the Liu family has been in deficit.

20
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,360
Their finances have shrunk
by ninety percent within a year.

21
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,800
They lose money in everything they do.

22
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,600
It seems that Lu Mo is quite suspected.

23
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,160
What should we do now?

24
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,600
The case is becoming clear

25
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,040
but we still lack some key evidence.

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,520
A weasel asks for a title.

27
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,760
Killing by the ghost.

28
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,560
The plum garden.

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,120
What clues do we need

30
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,160
to link them together?

31
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,000
Where's Jingjing?

32
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,600
I'll let someone find her.

33
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,040
That's what happened.

34
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,000
I always feel

35
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,600
the detective agency doesn't
need me now.

36
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,960
Miss Jingjing.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,080
You've fallen for Mr. Qin

38
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,960
and are jealous of Miss Shen Rou.

39
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,720
I haven't fallen for him.

40
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,800
Besides, Miss Shen is truly outstanding.

41
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,720
Why would I be jealous of her?

42
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,920
Then why do you always cling to him?

43
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,200
I want him to take me as a disciple.

44
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,640
Since he has already rejected you,

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,960
why are you still pestering him
after three years?

46
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,320
I...

47
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,320
Miss Jingjing.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,240
You can't fake it once you
fall for someone.

49
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,440
If you allow me to give you some advice,

50
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,040
perhaps you can think

51
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,040
about how you can help him.

52
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,560
Qin Yang is bent on solving the case.

53
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,280
But until now, there's nothing I can do.

54
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,040
Take this shadow puppetry for example.

55
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,800
It seems magical,

56
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,600
yet it just uses the projection
of light.

57
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,280
Killing by the ghost

58
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,000
is probably just
like the shadow puppetry.

59
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,560
The Liu family schedules times
to whitewash the walls.

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,160
I've heard that there's a kind

61
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,120
of coating with a refraction feature.

62
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,000
I get it.

63
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,240
Thanks, Qiqiao.

64
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,920
I've been in your place.

65
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,200
I know how hard it is to like someone.

66
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,960
Moreover, the one you like is Mr. Qin,

67
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,800
who probably knows everything.

68
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,200
However, if I can think of it,

69
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,760
it's only a matter of time
before Mr. Qin thinks of it.

70
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,520
Then do you think
I still need to tell him?

71
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,720
Leverage strengths
to remedy shortcomings.

72
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,120
If you want Mr. Qin to like you too,

73
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,040
you need to find his shortcomings

74
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,200
and take the right action.

75
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,200
But he doesn't have any shortcomings.

76
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,640
He only has strengths.

77
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,440
If Mr. Qin has any shortcomings

78
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,560
or things he's afraid of,

79
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,800
you must know best.

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,320
Qin Yang

81
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,560
is tall, handsome,

82
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,520
and smart.

83
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,560
If I have to talk about his flaw,

84
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,640
he has a bad temper.

85
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,720
He always scolds me.

86
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,720
And, he's afraid of rain.

87
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,360
There's nothing else.

88
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,760
Rain?

89
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,600
Sir.

90
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,160
The twelve captured members

91
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,040
have been taken care of.

92
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,120
Very good.

93
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,600
With you as the weapon,

94
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,800
it's a great fortune
for our Night God Society.

95
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,960
Completing our great cause

96
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,680
is my mission.

97
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,200
But now, some people want to obstruct
our great cause.

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,800
Qiqiao.

99
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,200
I have a new task for you.

100
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,720
What's wrong?

101
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,440
Headache.

102
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,080
What are you looking for?

103
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,680
Oh no, I didn't bring the medicine.

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,840
What medicine?
Do I need to buy it for you?

105
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,480
I've brought the medicine.

106
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,560
You went back to the agency?

107
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,080
You left in a hurry to the Liu family.

108
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,240
I observed

109
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,320
that there must be rain.

110
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,000
And I knew

111
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,960
you didn't bring it.

112
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,440
You're actually reliable for once.

113
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,600
That's not true.
I have something else to tell you.

114
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,080
I've thought of the method
of killing by the ghost.

115
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,120
Do I look more like a human
or a god?

116
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,160
I think you look neither like a god
nor a human.

117
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,960
Take a closer look.

118
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,640
Do I look like a human or a god?

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,440
I think you look like a person
wearing a fox mask.

120
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,960
That's impossible.

121
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,440
The mask seller said
this was a weasel's head.

122
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,160
The mask seller fooled you.

123
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,440
A year ago,

124
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,200
the person who pretended
to be a weasel to scare Mr. Liu

125
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,120
was you, right?

126
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,440
Mr. Lu Mo.

127
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,600
More importantly,

128
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,080
the scent on you

129
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,680
matches the scent in Mrs. Liu's room.

130
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,760
I was just bluffing.

131
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,640
I didn't expect you to reveal yourself.

132
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,640
I'm not the only one
who's got a sachet from Mrs. Liu.

133
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,600
Just because of this,
you can't be sure it was me.

134
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,960
I've noticed your stable stance,

135
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,280
the veins on your forehead,

136
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,240
and the calluses on your hands.

137
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,720
Clearly, you practice martial arts.

138
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,760
What else do you know?

139
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,080
You impersonated a relative
to take over the business.

140
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,320
So you wanted to get rid

141
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,680
of their adopted son
who was going to inherit the business.

142
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,400
As for the killing by the ghost,

143
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,760
as long as you paint the wall white

144
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,600
and use a bright light to shine
on someone from a distance,

145
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,320
the wall can project different shadows.

146
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,560
So if someone made specific movements
from a distance,

147
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,920
the wall would display
these weird phenomena.

148
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,760
Nonsense.

149
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,360
Want to run away?

150
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,520
Lu Mo, you still won't admit your guilt?

151
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,440
I'm not guilty. Why should I admit it?

152
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,200
Your purpose in doing this

153
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,360
was to use the ghost to kill people.

154
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,040
First, the adopted son,

155
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,480
then the maid,

156
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,920
and now Mr. and Mrs. Liu.

157
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,080
Step by step, you fabricated the rumors

158
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,720
to ultimately take over the Liu family.

159
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,560
But to do this,

160
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,920
you must need a contact inside.

161
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,480
If I guess right,

162
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,240
that guy should be the butler, Jia.

163
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,120
I really underestimated you.

164
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,920
Hongfeng has already sealed off

165
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,320
all the main roads in the city.

166
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,680
When you meet him at the police station,

167
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,360
you'll find that out.

168
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
Just with you guys,

169
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,880
you want to catch me?

170
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,040
You're overconfident.

171
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,880
Jingjing, stop causing trouble.

172
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,680
Go back and wait.
