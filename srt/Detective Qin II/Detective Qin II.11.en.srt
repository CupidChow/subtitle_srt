1
00:00:33,014 --> 00:00:36,035
=Detective Qin II=

2
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:38,979
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,040
I'm coming.

4
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,280
Young Master Lu Mo.

5
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,960
He doesn't come to condole.

6
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,080
He sees that the Liu family are dead

7
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,800
and wants to seize the jade industry.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,560
Miss Qiqiao, please lead the way.

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,000
Please come this way.

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,320
This way.

11
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,920
The compass needle floats and doesn't
point the north or the south.

12
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,400
The magnetic field
under the Liu Mansion is unstable.

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,120
I see.

14
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,920
What's wrong?

15
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,280
There's sulfur.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,680
Hot springs lie beneath the Liu Mansion.

17
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,640
I have heard a little about it.

18
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,720
How did you know, sir?

19
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,240
In this place, the house is built to
harmonize the Yin with the Yang.

20
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,544
Also known as the Golden Toad
Holding the Carp with White Belly.

21
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,400
The entire Liu Mansion resembles
a toad cradling a carp,

22
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,680
and is nourished by hot springs.

23
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,240
If it's a burial,

24
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,040
it's the Fire method

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,680
of Rolling Mountains.

26
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,040
The people who live here

27
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,240
are supposed to be rich or famous

28
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,440
with a thriving family.

29
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,120
If it's really as you say,

30
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,720
how could such a tragedy

31
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,080
occur at the Liu Mansion?

32
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,920
You're talking nonsense again.

33
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,320
Miss Qiqiao.

34
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,480
That's the direction of the Carp Mouth.

35
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,840
What is there?

36
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,480
Over there is the Liu Mansion's garden.

37
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,199
Everyone, please follow me.

38
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,720
Mind your head.

39
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,000
The Madam's name includes "plum",

40
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,600
and she favorites plum blossoms.

41
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,000
To win the Madam's favor,
the Master spent

42
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,600
numerous money
to plant these plum trees.

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,880
They can blossom twice a year.

44
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,280
So Mr. Liu is deeply
in love with Madame.

45
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,440
How could he have killed her?

46
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,560
I've heard that

47
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,760
since the Madam entered the Liu Mansion,

48
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,440
she was being melancholic.

49
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,200
and only enjoyed plum blossoms there.

50
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,640
Even though she was infertile,

51
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,840
Mr. Liu never blamed her.

52
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,200
What a pity.

53
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,000
Liu's Feng Shui is broken

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,440
because of these plum blossoms.

55
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
What do you mean?

56
00:02:58,816 --> 00:03:01,952
The key to the Feng Shui of the Golden
Toad Holding the Carp with White Belly

57
00:03:01,952 --> 00:03:02,960
lies in the carp's mouth.

58
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,880
These plum blossoms

59
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,760
are exactly planted
on the mouth of the carp,

60
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,640
which is equivalent to a person

61
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,640
with a mouth sore.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,600
They break the Feng Shui
of the balance between yin and yang.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,960
Moreover, planting plum blossoms
in the mansion and selling finances

64
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,000
are two things that

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,880
will cause the Liu Mansion to
suffer from the effects of women's qi.

66
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,920
Therefore, the key to the whole case

67
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,800
must lie with Mrs. Liu.

68
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,160
The room brims with plum blossom scent.

69
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,520
Madam usually cuts
some plum blossoms to brew wine,

70
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,200
or makes sachets.

71
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,880
Plum blossoms wine.

72
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,120
Madam has refined tastes.

73
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,200
Stop.

74
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,880
I've long tolerated you.

75
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,160
You talked about Feng Shui and then wine.

76
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
Are you going to
talk about Buddhism later?

77
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,320
I really want to talk about emotions.

78
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,080
You...

79
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,520
You remind me.

80
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,720
I noticed that on this table,

81
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,320
(Scriptures)
most of the scriptures

82
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,120
that Madam copied
are karmic remedies.

83
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,800
I've heard that

84
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,000
Madam recently
started copying scriptures.

85
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,600
As for the reason...

86
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,600
I ask you to investigate,

87
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,840
not to chat.

88
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,240
I am investigating the case.

89
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,120
If you continue to chat like this,

90
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,520
It would be better to
let the body speak on its own.

91
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,960
And then let's go back and ask the body.

92
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,680
A weasel asking for a title.

93
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,200
Ghost shadows kill people.

94
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,960
The city is full of gossip.

95
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,160
If Mr. Shen hadn't asked you
to help investigate,

96
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,600
I wouldn't bother with you.

97
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,480
This shows that the chief
has better foresight than someone.

98
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,520
Are you trying to pick a fight?

99
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,040
There's something
I'm very curious about.

100
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,880
How is it that all the criminals

101
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,120
of the Night God Society
died on your watch?

102
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,480
What do you mean?

103
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,640
I mean that...

104
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,840
There are clues.

105
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,200
What clues?

106
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,400
When Mrs. Liu died,

107
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,720
she's three months pregnant.

108
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,600
Three months pregnant?

109
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,760
But people in the Liu mansion

110
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,560
said Mrs. Liu couldn't bear children.

111
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,000
Perhaps Mrs. Liu isn't
the one infertile,

112
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,400
it's Mr. Liu.

113
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,800
Jingjing, what's wrong?

114
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,320
Are you pregnant?

115
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,560
What are you saying!

116
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,760
She asked me to teach her anatomy.

117
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,880
But as soon as I started, she vomited.

118
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,720
I wasn't panicking.

119
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,400
I just wasn't ready yet.

120
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,920
Then again.

121
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,000
Mrs. Liu is truly beautiful.

122
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,200
If it were me,

123
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,280
I would also plant her
a garden full of plum blossoms.

124
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,360
It seems we need to take action.

125
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,976
Visiting Liu mansion at night.

126
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,800
Jingjing, are you okay?

127
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,760
Of course... I can't do it anymore.

128
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,360
I'll return the Detective Agency.

129
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,120
Night God Society is still active.

130
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
It's quite dangerous.

131
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,120
I'll drive you back later.

132
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,480
Thank you.

133
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,120
Steward Jia is really something.

134
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,400
Master has already died.

135
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,720
He still has us patrolling.

136
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,920
To be beware of ghosts?

137
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,840
Maybe.

138
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,360
Nowadays, the mansion is abnormal.

139
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,160
Master offended a weasel...

140
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,000
What are you doing?

141
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,080
It's scary.

142
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,280
Hu.

143
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,680
What's up?

144
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,400
Hu.

145
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,680
Stand up.

146
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,760
A ghost!

147
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,040
Do you think the look and figure

148
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,200
of that shadow on the wall just now

149
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,000
is a bit like Mrs. Liu?

150
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,760
Playing tricks. I'm not scared at all.

151
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,920
The wall seems to
have been freshly painted.

152
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,040
And there's another smell.

153
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,880
Why paint the walls?

154
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,560
Do you think He Hongfeng has been

155
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,680
acting strange lately?

156
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,840
Has he?

157
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,520
I suspect he is related with
the deaths of the criminals

158
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,800
from the Night God Society.
