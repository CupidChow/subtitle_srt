2
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,003
=Episode 10=

3
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,760
It's all my fault.

4
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,920
I really regret it.

5
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,200
I am just a merchant.

6
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,640
I'm so lucky to be married to you.

7
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,040
I won't blame you.

8
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,040
Liu,

9
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,480
please let me leave.

10
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,000
Something's wrong.

11
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,520
Recaptured Night God Society members

12
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,320
suddenly died last night.

13
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,680
How could this happen?

14
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,960
I interrogated them once
before they died.

15
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,200
I obtained some clues.

16
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,600
A master from the Night God Society

17
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,560
will come here

18
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,160
to seek Liu Liang, a jade merchant.

19
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,960
When we rushed over,

20
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,840
we found that Liu Liang
had already killed his wife

21
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,880
and himself.

22
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,000
Suicide?

23
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
For what?

24
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,240
It is said that they are very loving.

25
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,920
I don't know

26
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,680
why he would do such a thing.

27
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,240
Since the Night God Society
is specifically seeking out Liu Liang,

28
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,320
we'll start investigating
from his business.

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,360
We will surely uncover the clues
about the Night God Society.

30
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,160
I have checked.

31
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,880
Liu Liang is
in the jade mining business.

32
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,360
Nothing illegal.

33
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,840
However, recently

34
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,560
there are some rumors and gossip.

35
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,520
It is said that Liu Liang
has been unfortunate in recent years.

36
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,280
A few years ago, he dug up and collapsed

37
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,560
a weasel's nest.

38
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,400
Therefore, the weasel got back at him.

39
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,960
Retaliation by the weasel?

40
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,320
I don't believe it. And you?

41
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,240
I don't believe, either.

42
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
However,

43
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,720
why would there be rumors

44
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,800
about Liu Liang's bad luck?

45
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,080
I am very concerned.

46
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,440
Let's investigate his mansion,

47
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,400
and then we will know.

48
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,040
Your thoughts?

49
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,240
I think this matter is...

50
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,640
Mr. Qin, please come in.

51
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,920
I am so sorry.

52
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,560
Madam and Master are both dead.

53
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,240
Strange things
are happening in the house.

54
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,680
Sorry about the lousy welcome.

55
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,040
Qiqiao.

56
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,800
Hurry up and serve tea to the guests.

57
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,200
Yes.

58
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,920
No need.

59
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,720
The new maid is a little rude.

60
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,800
I apologize for amusement.

61
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,000
Mr. Liu was into Buddhism, right?

62
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,640
This was placed here by Madam Liu
before she passed away.

63
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,920
She must have heard that the Master

64
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,440
has provoked the Wong Tai Sin,

65
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,520
and then she was praying here.

66
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,200
Any strange happenings
at the house lately?

67
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,720
Please tell us.

68
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,480
It's not just recently.

69
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,800
Strange events began a year ago.

70
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,640
Liu Liang.
Do I resemble like a human or a deity?

71
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,680
Your cultivation is profound,
much like that of a human.

72
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,000
It seems Mr. Liu encountered
a weasel asking for a title.

73
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,120
What's that?

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,280
It refers to

75
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,040
a weasel asking you

76
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,600
it looks more like human or deity.

77
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,240
If you say it looks like a deity,

78
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,800
it will become immortal immediately.

79
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,760
If you say it looks like a human,

80
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,279
its entire cultivation will be in vain,

81
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,720
and it will bring unrest
to the household.

82
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,880
Therefore, the Master
gave the wrong answer.

83
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,320
Since then,

84
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,680
the Master truly fell ill
and couldn't recover.

85
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,440
It was also since that time,

86
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,320
the strange things began
happening in the house.

87
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,800
Shadows started appearing on the walls.

88
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,640
What kind of shadows?

89
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,240
The Madam couldn't bear children,

90
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,280
and then the Master adopt a son.

91
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,480
One night,

92
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,960
the servants saw the son's shadow

93
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,000
hung by the neck on the wall.

94
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,800
At that time, we didn't care about it.

95
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,480
However, three days later,

96
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,880
the adopted son be found
hanged from the beam.

97
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,080
After he died, the Master

98
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,280
fell seriously ill again.

99
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,400
The jade business

100
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,360
was completely unattended.

101
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,400
Fortunately, at that time,
a distant relative came to seek refuge,

102
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,160
and then took over managing
the many properties for the Master.

103
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,040
The strange things

104
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,680
disappeared for a while.

105
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,040
However, the good times didn't last.

106
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,080
A while ago,

107
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,680
the shadow appeared again.

108
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,000
This time it was
the Madam's personal maid.

109
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,360
She was wet and drenched.

110
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,960
Her eyes were looking straight ahead.

111
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,040
The next day,

112
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,200
her body was found in the well.

113
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,480
She drowned.

114
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,640
After Mr. Liu and Mrs. Liu passed away,

115
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,920
were shadows on the wall?

116
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,200
Yes.

117
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,560
That night the Master's shadow was seen

118
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,520
hanging on the wall by a thin rope.

119
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,720
That was exactly the same as his death.

120
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,560
What about Mrs. Liu's shadow?

121
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,800
I don't know about it.

122
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,880
Now the mansion is in a state of panic.

123
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,080
Most people have resigned.

124
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,280
They all say

125
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,920
that the shadow is caused by the weasel.

126
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,120
He wants to kill everyone

127
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,760
in the Liu mansion one by one.

128
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,440
Mr. Liu, how could you
just die like this?

129
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,000
We have years of friendship.

130
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,920
(Condolence)
My heart is torn with grief.

131
00:06:11,488 --> 00:06:13,117
(Virtuous)

132
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,920
Master Qian, you've arrived.

133
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,880
You are all here to
mourn Mr. Liu, aren't you?

134
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,080
You could say that.

135
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,120
Let's...

136
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,560
You must be Chief Shen's
beloved daughter, right?

137
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,320
I heard you joined
Mr. Qin's Detective Agency.

138
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,120
You are...

139
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,440
I've been friends

140
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,640
with your father for years.

141
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,840
I even held you when you were little.

142
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,200
At that time...

143
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,440
Mr. Qian.

144
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,080
Mr. Qian, you are
the richest man in town.

145
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,360
You are so busy.

146
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,400
You should pay your respects in person.

147
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,160
Such deep sentiment

148
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,360
moves and impress me.

149
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,960
Of course.

150
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,680
Liu Liang has been
my good friend for years.

151
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,520
Steward Jia.

152
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,640
I heard

153
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,280
that Mr. Liu has
a distant relative in his mansion

154
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,000
who is always helping him
manage the jade industry.

155
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,560
Where is this person now?

156
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,880
Young Master Lu Mo

157
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,040
has always regarded
Master Liu as his father.

158
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,600
He's at the funeral home now.

159
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,840
Take me to him.

160
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,240
I must comfort my nephew Lu Mo.

161
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,360
Let's go.

162
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,560
Sorry for my leaving.

163
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,560
Next, Qiqiao will entertain you all.

164
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,560
Please, Mr. Qin.

165
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,720
I'm coming.

166
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,040
Young Master Lu Mo.

167
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,160
He doesn't come to condole.

168
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,280
He sees that the Master Liu is dead

169
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,000
and wants to seize the jade industry.
