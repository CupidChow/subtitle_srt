00:00:33,055 --> 00:00:36,076
=Detective Qin II=

2
00:00:36,076 --> 00:00:39,020
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,240
Master, your facial features...

4
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,480
Eyes like startled swans,
veiled with gauze.

5
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,920
Pupils round with peach blossoms' hint.

6
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,320
Marrying in midlife
to wealth and honor's height.

7
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,040
Bringing family glory,
shining in the ancestral light.

8
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,320
Quite a visage
for attracting prosperity and love.

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,240
Good Luck!

10
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,120
Madam has a high forehead like a liver,

11
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,640
with a prominent nasal bridge
reaching the clouds.

12
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,239
A husband-empowering face.
A match made in heaven.

13
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,720
Congratulations!

14
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,000
Nice! I like it best
when people tell the truth.

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,040
However, she is not my wife.

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,280
She is just a dancing girl.

17
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,920
Mr. Qin, are you wrong about that?

18
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,560
Wrong? Not entirely wrong.

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,600
I guess Master already wants to

20
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,360
take her as your concubine.

21
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,840
Actually, I've already planned

22
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,160
to marry her as my eighteenth concubine.

23
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,120
Incredible!

24
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,600
Come on, let's drink.

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,280
I have not been feeling well recently.

26
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,280
I'm not fit to drink.

27
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,000
I have all the wine and dishes ready.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,240
You are leaving now.

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,840
Do you look down on me?

30
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,120
No, impossible.

31
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,960
What kind of sound is it

32
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,280
that makes me so happy and healthy?

33
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,520
Mr. Li, you are amazing, too.

34
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,600
Come on, I'll have a drink with you.

35
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,480
Come on.

36
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,800
Come on, Madam.

37
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,600
Miss is just learning.

38
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,320
I didn't expect such rapid progress.

39
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,760
You indeed have a natural talent
for embroidery.

40
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,600
You flatter me.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,600
Blood.

42
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,840
Miss, stay calm.
I'm getting a doctor now.

43
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,080
It's fine.

44
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,720
I studied bandaging abroad.

45
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,480
You're bleeding.

46
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,120
Fine wine.

47
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,320
Mr. Qin.

48
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,880
I'll come to your place tonight.

49
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,280
What are you looking at?
Haven't seen a handsome man before?

50
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,400
Here's some money for you.

51
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,280
Thank you very much.

52
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,920
I know you're tired of

53
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,880
the delicacies there.

54
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,120
Let's try something new today.

55
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,080
Miss Shen.

56
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,360
Long time no see.

57
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,920
I'll make you a bowl of noodles.

58
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,720
No need.

59
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,680
You guys chat.

60
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,840
Liu Ping.

61
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,800
How have you and Lanlan been lately?

62
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
She has improved.

63
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,360
When lucid, she recognizes me,

64
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,160
and smiles at me.

65
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,160
Really! That's good.

66
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,080
How about Mr. Qin?

67
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,840
Actually,
I've quit the Detective Agency.

68
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,440
Perhaps I'll make
some noodles for you.

69
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,680
I think this place is average.

70
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,640
Shall we leave?

71
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,160
In life's moments of triumph,
indulge in joy and mirth.

72
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,720
Let not the golden goblet face the moon,
devoid of worth.

73
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,200
Alright.

74
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,240
Stop doing this!

75
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,880
If my men
hadn't run into you on the street,

76
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,960
you'd be freezing to death tonight.

77
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,800
It's been so long.

78
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,120
You're not working on the case,

79
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,480
and not cleaning up the house.

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,560
All you do is drinking.

81
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,600
You'll be ruined if you keep this up.

82
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,640
It doesn't matter.

83
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,880
So what if I know the yin and yang?

84
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,720
I couldn't keep even one
I wanted to stay.

85
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,320
What's the use of all my abilities?

86
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,400
The conspiracy
of the Society has been solved.

87
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,280
But you can't go on like this.

88
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,840
Alright, leave it at there.

89
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,240
How about this?

90
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,080
Our police station still
has some strange cases.

91
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,880
If you want, I'll let you

92
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,600
help with the investigation.

93
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,640
Is that alright?

94
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,000
You are so strange.

95
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,080
When I used to investigate cases,

96
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,800
you would bother me
before I even had the chance.

97
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,560
Now you want me to assist.

98
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,560
I'm wasting my breath talking to you.

99
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,600
Stay here.

100
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,440
Don't go anywhere.

101
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,040
Jingjing, I told you
not to leave the bag...

102
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,600
Little lion.

103
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,160
When I'm not by his side,

104
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,440
you must keep an eye on him.

105
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,200
Jingjing.

106
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,240
You're a fool.

107
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,880
You're a fool.

108
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,720
You're a fool.

109
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,280
Jingjing.

110
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,000
You...

111
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,560
You...

112
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,400
You're Shen Rou, right?

113
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,640
I've only been gone a few days.

114
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,600
What happened to the Detective Agency?

115
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,560
It was like this before you came.

116
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,000
Do you know why I come today?

117
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,440
You are getting married tomorrow.

118
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,720
You've come to give me an invitation.

119
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,160
But I didn't expect

120
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,840
that you would personally

121
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,840
(Invitation)
come to deliver the invitation to me.

122
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,760
Didn't you say you are my master?

123
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,880
I am very busy.

124
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,200
The newly-appointed police chief

125
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,600
wants me to go for a talk tomorrow.

126
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,440
And the next door village...

127
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,760
The police station in the next village

128
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,080
also invites me to go.

129
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,240
Actually, today is also a special day.

130
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,160
Three months ago,

131
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,320
you saved me at the Mass Grave Hill,

132
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,600
and became my master.

133
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,120
It's only been three months.

134
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,080
I even thought it had been three years.

135
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,560
Since I met you,

136
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,240
each day feels like a year.

137
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,440
If you come to my wedding tomorrow,

138
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,520
I'll go with you.

139
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,680
Jingjing.

140
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,000
