1
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,680
Get some water and splash him awake

2
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,720
You’re awake

3
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,920
If you don’t wake up

4
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,320
I’m about to splash urine on you

5
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,080
Hahaha

6
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,080
Xie Jiachang

7
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,880
Your guys grab me without a word

8
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,480
You think I’m easy to push around?

9
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,040
Go, now

10
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,280
If there is a next life

11
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,400
I don’t want to meet you again

12
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,280
Wife

13
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,720
Wife

14
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,320
Wife

15
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,600
Hey

16
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,200
Pull them apart

17
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,520
Are you crazy or just stupid

18
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,040
Sis

19
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,280
Looks like you really got knocked stupid

20
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,480
Ow

21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,840
Even Boss Zhou came in person

22
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,120
Zheng Nanfeng sure has some nerve

23
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,680
Xie Jiachang

24
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,480
You think my Fantasy Dance Hall has no one, huh

25
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,840
You’re pretty cocky

26
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,840
Shut your mouth

27
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,640
Wasn’t I just on the boat

28
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,680
Let me go

29
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,440
Let go of me, you jerk

30
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,440
Brother Feng, Brother Feng

31
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,680
Sister-in-law said you would never come

32
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,280
I said no way

33
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,840
Zheng Nanfeng

34
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
We’re already divorced

35
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,920
What are you doing here

36
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,800
Why are you keeping her tied up

37
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,480
Xie Jiachang, what do you mean

38
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,880
Brother Feng

39
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,920
Do you still not understand what I mean

40
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,800
I’ve put up with it for so many years

41
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,320
Wasn’t it all for today

42
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,000
Be good and sign this Share Transfer Agreement

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,920
We can still be good brothers later

44
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,400
Using her to threaten me won’t work

45
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,520
You heard her too

46
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,360
We are divorced

47
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,160
Zheng Nanfeng

48
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,440
Is this really the time

49
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,320
You’re still putting on an act for me

50
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,840
Fine, I’ll let you act all you want

51
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:30,800
Zhiyi

52
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,200
Oh, drop the act

53
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,800
I already said

54
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,240
As long as you obediently sign this agreement

55
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,840
and get it settled

56
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,040
I’ll definitely send you two back

57
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,480
Fine

58
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,080
I’ll sign

59
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,640
But before signing

60
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,120
Let us say a few words alone

61
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,480
Zhiyi

62
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,680
Listen to me

63
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,600
I wronged you before

64
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,040
But Xie Jiachang’s only target is me

65
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,720
One person dying is better than two

66
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,720
Right

67
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,280
One dying is better than two

68
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,920
Zheng Nanfeng, I will never forgive you

69
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,480
Then you can go die

70
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,760
Xie Jiachang, come here

71
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,280
I’ll just tell you the financial password

72
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,080
That is much more useful than the Share Transfer Agreement

73
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,520
Zheng Nanfeng

74
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,480
If there is a next life

75
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,640
I don’t want to meet you again

76
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,440
Go on, what’s the password

77
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,480
Zhiyi

78
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,800
Zhiyi, Zhiyi

79
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
You dare come to Club A8 and cause trouble

80
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,000
All of you, get lost

81
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:10,960
Club A8

82
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,080
Strange

83
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,000
How am I back in the past

84
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,280
Who are you

85
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,920
Hey, little sister Zhiyi

86
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,200
I’m not bullying you

87
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,240
This punk

88
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,600
He came to our dance hall to steal things

89
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,320
He just beat me without cause

90
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,200
Look how messed up my hair is

91
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,240
Are you missing anything here

92
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,880
We both know it all too well

93
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,600
My fiancé died without a clear cause

94
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,720
I'll be blunt

95
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,840
I sent Xiaofeng to investigate you

96
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,840
Zhou Zhiyi speaks with proof

97
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,600
Your man died—what's that to me?

98
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,640
Xie Jiachang

99
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,800
Heartless bastard

100
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,240
Don't touch my Wife

101
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,480
What are you saying, Zheng Nanfeng?

102
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,800
Zheng Nanfeng, are you fucking beaten stupid?

103
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,480
She's your Wife

104
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,280
Haven't you had enough beatings?

105
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,920
Try touching my people again

106
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,080
Who dares touch my Wife

107
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll kill whoever

108
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,920
Who's your Wife?

109
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,120
You really got beaten stupid

110
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,200
Wife

111
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,600
I'll explain this to you later

112
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,200
Why don't you head back first

113
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,280
Hey, hey

114
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,000
Get him!

115
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,440
Don't move

116
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,280
Don't move—let's see who dares move

117
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,680
Everyone, stop!

118
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,320
Dear viewers

119
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,320
The situation on the court now

120
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,600
is at a breaking point

121
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Team China has two crucial free throws

122
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,520
The player steadies his breath

123
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,680
Shoots

124
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,680
You two have fought for so many years

125
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,320
Has it gotten you anywhere?

126
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,120
Zhiyi,

127
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,240
I don't think so

128
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,320
Just make peace

129
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,320
Making peace is impossible

130
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,320
My fiancé died without a clear cause

131
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,280
I need an answer today

132
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,640
Zhiyi, you're so forceful as a woman

133
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,920
Did you curse Cheng Yadong to death?

134
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,640
How about this

135
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,480
I'll be your husband

136
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,720
I don't fear curses

137
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,520
Xie Jiachang, are you looking for death?

138
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,880
Scared of you?

139
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,800
Enough

140
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,120
Everyone, sit down

141
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,680
Sit

142
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,920
Yadong's death is tied to him

143
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,720
I sent Xiaofeng to check this today

144
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,480
Then show your evidence

145
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,240
Xiaofeng

146
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,120
Xiaofeng

147
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,640
I'm calling you

148
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,600
Come tell everyone what you found

149
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,640
This bastard kidnapped Zhou Zhiyi

150
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,280
Forced me to hand over equity

151
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,800
Then we jumped into the sea and died

152
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,200
What nonsense are you spouting?

153
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,880
Master Qin

154
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,120
I think this kid has a screw loose

155
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,200
Even jumped into the sea

156
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,840
Why don't you just go to heaven?

157
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,280
Hmph

158
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,320
Alright

159
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,480
I don't want to hear your messy feud

160
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,320
Let's call it a day

161
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,280
Let's end it here

162
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,640
Since Master Qin has said as much,

163
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,120
I have to give him face

164
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,920
But I want to bet with Zhou Zhiyi

165
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,320
On what?

166
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,880
Hey

167
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,080
Just Bet on the game

168
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,680
If you win,

169
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,320
You take the person away

170
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,080
Today's ballroom mess, I chalk it up to bad luck

171
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,440
You don't need to compensate

172
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,880
If I win,

173
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,680
Deal?

174
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,800
The person still has to scram

175
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,600
You stay and let me play for forty-nine days

176
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,680
Xie Jiachang, are you courting death?

177
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,840
Believe I'll kill you?

178
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,800
Boss Zhou, see how impulsive your people are

179
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,240
How can you achieve anything big?

180
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,680
I don't think you can even manage them

181
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,240
A Ming

182
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,600
Boss Zhou, do you dare to bet or not?

183
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,720
No man to back you, so you're scared?

184
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,240
Like hell I'd be scared of you.

185
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,440
So that's a yes.

186
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,280
I'll bet you.

187
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,080
If you lose.

188
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
If you lose.

189
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,880
Add 10,000 yuan.

190
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,720
Deal!

191
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,440
So I'm only worth 10,000 yuan?

192
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,280
Zheng Nanfeng, I'm here to save you.

193
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,600
You made me the stake?

194
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,080
I won't let you lose.

195
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,040
How do we bet?

196
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,080
Oh.

197
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,600
I forgot to tell you.

198
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,000
Our Boss Xie has a nickname: Gambling King of Haicheng.

199
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,080
Shut up.

200
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,600
Is this your place to speak?

201
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,600
Did you forget you just came to Haicheng?

202
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,280
Living on trash every day, is that it?

203
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,840
What nonsense are you spouting?

204
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,720
We'll bet on the score.

205
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,880
Get one number wrong and you lose.

206
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,840
Xie Jiachang

207
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,000
You're scamming us.

208
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,040
Who could guess that so accurately?

209
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,680
China wins by two over Spain.

210
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,720
They advance to the quarterfinals.

211
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,480
Relax, I won't let you be shortchanged.

212
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,320
The basketball traces a perfect arc in the air.

213
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,320
Swish, straight through the net.

214
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,840
China launches a fierce offensive.

215
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,520
A player, with superb individual skill,

216
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,520
Breaks through layers of defense.

217
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,600
Leaps high for a beautiful layup.

218
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,840
Nothing but net.

219
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,400
78:76

220
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,760
China wins.

221
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,560
They beat the strong Spanish team.

222
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,840
They made history.

223
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,800
We won!

224
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,800
We won, hahaha!

225
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,480
Zheng Nanfeng, you really are a genius.

226
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,880
We won, we won.

227
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,920
We won, we won.

228
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,520
Zheng Nanfeng

229
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,680
How did you know?

230
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,080
I even know I'm your future husband.

231
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,880
You really got your brain knocked silly.

232
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,920
Boss Xie

233
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,280
Can we leave now?

234
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,040
Impossible.

235
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,800
Absolutely impossible.

236
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,680
How could anyone guess so precisely?

237
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,320
Zheng Nanfeng, you're cheating.

238
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,640
You're cheating.

239
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,160
Enough.

240
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,480
I'm right here.

241
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,880
Have some basic decency when you speak.

242
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,600
Or don't blame me when I turn on you.

243
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,040
Master Qin did not mean that.

244
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,480
They're the ones cheating.

245
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,400
The facts are right before us.

246
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,880
Xie Jiachang, you should accept defeat.

247
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,080
Zhou Zhiyi, I'm tired.

248
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,520
Please take me back.

249
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,880
Let's go, Master Qin.

250
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,920
Hey.

251
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,880
Get the money, 10,000 yuan.

252
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,400
Can't afford to lose, huh?

253
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,000
Give it to him.

254
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,520
Thanks.

255
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,200
Let's go.

256
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,680
You kid are bold beyond belief

257
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,440
You dared to wager Sister-in-law

258
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,800
Have you thought about

259
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,480
what if you lose

260
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,880
how we get through these forty-nine days

261
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,600
You still have the nerve to say that

262
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,040
Aren't you upping the ante

263
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,880
See, we won money

264
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,480
How could I let my wife lose

265
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,840
This kid's really been beaten stupid

266
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,080
Such nonsense

267
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,640
Forget it

268
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,280
Anyway, Zheng Nanfeng won today

269
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,680
Never saw it in him before

270
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,240
He can handle things at crunch time

271
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,080
What's the use of that grit

272
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,680
Xie Jiachang swallowed a loss in silence

273
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,280
He definitely won't let it go

274
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,800
Good thing I invited Master Qin today

275
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,080
Otherwise we'd have lost out

276
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,880
Starting tomorrow, Artsy Ballroom pauses business

277
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,040
Everyone lay low

278
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,400
No

279
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,480
We have to fight him

280
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,520
Don't worry, I'm here

281
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,080
I'll protect you

282
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,480
Don't think that because you guessed the basketball score

283
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,800
you're invincible

284
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,280
Xie Jiachang has a ballroom and a factory

285
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,800
He has dozens of men under him

286
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,280
His power is far greater than ours

287
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,880
With what will you protect Sister Zhiyi

288
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,520
Nanfeng, I know you mean well

289
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,840
But we've fought back and forth for years

290
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,720
I'm tired too

291
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,480
Let's just leave it

292
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,120
A Ming, A Qiang, get ready

293
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,040
Wait a sec

294
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,200
Give me the money

295
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,280
I won it

296
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,480
Give me the money

297
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,520
Hey

298
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,680
Take off your clothes

299
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,320
Ah

300
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,080
Take off your clothes

301
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
I'll apply medicine

302
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,240
Oh

303
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,320
Zhiyi

304
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,720
Let me ask you something

305
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,520
Mm

306
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,200
Do you know who I am

307
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,280
You

308
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,120
Zheng Nanfeng

309
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,120
I'm not just Zheng Nanfeng

310
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,120
I'm also your future husband

311
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,080
From now on, I'll protect you

312
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,520
I won't let you get hurt again

313
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,440
Zheng Nanfeng, you've really been beaten silly

314
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,680
Or is it because I came to save you today

315
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,640
you've hopelessly fallen in love with me

316
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,280
I have a fiancé

317
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,440
His name is Cheng Yadong

318
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,880
You're just my employee

319
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,800
I came to save you today

320
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,600
just to protect a subordinate

321
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,440
Can you act like a subordinate

322
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,320
From now on, call me Sister Zhiyi

323
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,520
Zhiyi

324
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:28,480
Sister

325
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,440
But if nothing unexpected happens

326
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,600
Cheng Yadong won't be coming back

327
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,720
I know

328
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,680
Though there's no evidence

329
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,880
it's most likely Xie Jiachang's doing

330
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,920
Just now you told us all to lay low

331
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,680
But from what I know about you

332
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,640
you intend to dismiss everyone

333
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,120
and stay to confront Xie Jiachang yourself

334
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,280
How did you know

335
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,720
In this world

336
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,800
no one could know you better than I do

337
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,080
No need to close

338
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,280
I'll help you deal with Xie Jiachang

339
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,640
Why do I feel you're not the same as before

340
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,880
Trust me

341
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,480
I can help you defeat him

342
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,680
How do you want to do it

343
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,000
Give me the ballroom for one year

344
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,880
At most one month

345
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,320
I'll make Xie Jiachang's ballroom close down

346
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,080
We're leaving, boss

347
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,720
Take it slow, take it slow, thanks for the hard work

348
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,120
Finally finished

349
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,880
The boys are dead tired

350
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,880
Will this renovation style work?

351
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,280
That's ten thousand I worked so hard to earn

352
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,640
Don't let it all go down the drain

353
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,080
You agree, right, Manager Zheng?

354
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,880
Thanks for the hard work, really

355
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,000
Hard work? Come on

356
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,280
Your foot's injured

357
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,480
Looks pretty serious

358
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,080
You probably can't walk

359
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,440
Hey

360
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,240
Just a little scrape

361
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,800
I'll just have to carry you back

362
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,880
Hey, hey, Zheng Nanfeng

363
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,880
Put me down, hey

364
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,680
No, wait

365
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,720
Let go of me

366
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,520
Hey

367
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,600
Zheng Nanfeng

368
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,120
Put me down

369
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,600
Zheng Nanfeng, are you deaf or what?

370
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,640
What do you mean?

371
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,880
What do you mean, huh?

372
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,400
Hey, hey

373
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,520
Put me down

374
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,720
I can walk by myself

375
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,480
I will never put you down again, for the rest of my life

376
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,200
Zheng Nanfeng, why are you so stubborn?

377
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,920
Put me down

378
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,720
You

379
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,240
Quite a coincidence, man, huh

380
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,120
What do you mean?

381
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,680
Zheng Nanfeng, I've fallen off!

382
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,400
We're here, we're here

383
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,880
No, I'm home too

384
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,480
Get lost

385
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,320
Then where do I go?

386
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,600
I miss you

387
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,520
Whenever dusk falls

388
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,600
The evening breeze rises

389
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,760
I miss you

390
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,440
Life's riddle

391
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,560
Try not to see it clearly

392
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,960
Close your eyes

393
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,160
Don't respond

394
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,200
The night wind blows and blows

395
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,840
Go with the wind

396
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,280
Tonight, child

397
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,440
Don't cry in secret

398
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,280
The night wind blows and blows

399
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,960
Go with the wind

400
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,320
With nightfall and the stars

401
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,440
Drift gently to sleep

402
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,880
Feel the evening breeze
