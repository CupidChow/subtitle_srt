1
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,400
Who said you could kiss me

2
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,400
Who are you

3
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,320
I am your husband

4
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,120
Husband

5
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,080
Husband

6
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,960
Zheng Nanfeng

7
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,680
You are awake

8
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,360
Zheng Nanfeng, why are you in my house

9
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,680
You drank too much last night

10
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,560
I brought you back

11
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,320
You take people home

12
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,560
and put them on the bed

13
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,480
Then I made you sleep on the sofa

14
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,080
Be honest

15
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,720
Did you do anything over the line last night

16
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,160
Over the line

17
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,400
What counts as over the line

18
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,880
What else could it be

19
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,760
Of course, that

20
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,720
Oh

21
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,480
That, well of course it is that

22
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,480
Zheng Nanfeng, do you have a death wish

23
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,120
I am your husband

24
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,960
Murdering your husband is a serious crime

25
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,400
What is wrong

26
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,720
Oh come on, just joking

27
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,600
Last night you held me and would not let me go

28
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,680
And we did not do anything else

29
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,000
Really, you are not lying to me

30
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,320
Am I the kind of man who takes advantage

31
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,960
I like you and I rely on my abilities to win you over

32
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,480
Crazy

33
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay, cut it out

34
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,480
You drank so much and still feel awful

35
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,240
I bought breakfast

36
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,160
I know you cannot drink milk

37
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,920
Lactose intolerance

38
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,840
Soy milk it is

39
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,520
How do you know that

40
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,760
And I also know

41
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,240
You like to hang your pajamas in the bathroom

42
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,840
You get up at two every night for a sip of water

43
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,200
When you sleep, if you do not hold me

44
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,480
you sleep restlessly

45
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,280
How do you know me so well

46
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,360
I know even more

47
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,280
You are a bit hard to figure out

48
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,760
No worries, there will be plenty of time to guess

49
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,560
But I am quite worried Xie Jiachang will target you

50
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,920
Guess I will have to put myself through it again

51
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,400
Hurry and help me get a room ready

52
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,440
I am moving in tonight

53
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,440
Zheng Nanfeng, you really do not see yourself as an outsider

54
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,160
Do not read too much into it

55
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,000
I am purely doing this to protect you

56
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,160
I do not need your protection

57
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,280
Out, I need to change

58
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,240
I can help

59
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,120
No need to go out

60
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,600
I can help

61
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,160
Get out

62
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,040
Hey

63
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,960
Hello

64
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,880
What, got it

65
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,680
I am coming right away

66
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,000
What is wrong

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,920
Something happened at the nightclub

68
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,680
Go downstairs and drive

69
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,600
I will change and come down

70
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,600
Sister Zhiyi, Nanfeng

71
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,680
You finally made it

72
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,320
What’s with you two?

73
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,920
We just ran into each other at the door

74
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,080
What’s going on now?

75
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,320
We came in together this morning

76
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,800
Found the office safe had been pried open

77
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,840
The design blueprints inside

78
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,120
All for the nightclub are gone

79
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,520
It was definitely Xie Jiachang

80
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,720
And our entire business model

81
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,040
They copied that too

82
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,760
If Xie Jiachang starts doing this

83
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,520
we lose our edge

84
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,520
Didn’t expect him to hit back so fast

85
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,760
No, I thought it was no big deal

86
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,600
You didn’t think I could, just with a business model,

87
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,040
make his nightclub shut down, right?

88
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,720
So what?

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,160
What else can we revamp in this nightclub?

90
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
The business model is the foundation

91
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,000
But updates are too slow and too easy to copy

92
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,760
Even if Xie Jiachang doesn’t copy it

93
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,800
someone else will

94
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,960
We should be at the forefront of the industry

95
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,480
What is this long-winded stuff?

96
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,800
Just tell us what else we can do

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,040
A nightclub’s success

98
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,160
is a multi-dimensional business model

99
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,080
The key is whether the software has core competitiveness

100
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,320
For example, we have

101
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,200
the ability to stir up the guests’ emotions

102
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,440
with mind-blowing dances and songs

103
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,240
We have all of that

104
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:25,920
Yeah

105
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,040
Too old, too clichéd

106
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,400
I want something fresher

107
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,800
Where do we find those new things?

108
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,720
Here

109
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,440
Where?

110
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,360
In three days, find a new group of dancers

111
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
Take these materials

112
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,480
Go to the address above and find this person

113
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,880
Thanks, next

114
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
Come on, you, you

115
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,000
Hey, hey

116
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,000
What are you doing?

117
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,360
Hey man, are you hiring dancers here?

118
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes, we only hire female performers

119
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,600
I dance crazy good

120
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,400
I’m telling you

121
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,360
In Kaoshantun

122
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,120
I’m the dance king

123
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,920
Dance king or whatever

124
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,120
We don’t take male performers

125
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,600
Move along

126
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,760
Man, let me show you a bit

127
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,160
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

128
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,800
Miss, you step down

129
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,440
Hi, boss

130
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,360
Music

131
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,520
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop

132
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,120
No, man,

133
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,800
Your style doesn’t suit us

134
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,720
Next time, maybe

135
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,760
I’ve trained for a year

136
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,160
Let me do another one for you

137
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,360
This one works!

138
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,880
We… we don’t need it

139
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,800
I’ll… I’ll go then

140
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,280
One last time

141
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,120
Just once

142
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,720
Hold him back, hard

143
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,800
Dude, I can cross-dress

144
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,200
Go, go

145
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,640
No

146
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,200
Women’s clothes

147
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,880
No

148
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,680
Women’s clothes

149
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,720
Oh mom, what is this?

150
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,680
Don’t underestimate this guy

151
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,360
He might blow up in the future

152
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,360
Are you crazy or is he?

153
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,760
Watch your mouth

154
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,160
He might be your future brother-in-law

155
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,840
Huh?

156
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,600
What do you mean?

157
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,040
Zheng Nanfeng didn’t go back to the dorm that night

158
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,480
He came with Zhou Zhiyi the next day

159
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,280
You forgot

160
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,560
Uh?

161
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
Do we have another one?

162
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,000
Zheng Nanfeng

163
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,600
Hey, hey, hey

164
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,040
Xu Rumeng

165
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,440
You disappeared for months; I couldn't reach you

166
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,400
So you were ghosting me, huh?

167
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
Xu Rumeng

168
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,640
The big star ten years from now

169
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,680
My

170
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,680
ex-girlfriend

171
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,960
Aren't you in Hong Kong, China?

172
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,120
How come you came back to the mainland?

173
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,760
You left me behind and just took off

174
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,440
You jerk

175
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,520
Wait, no,

176
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,040
Who are you to come here and cause a scene?

177
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,320
I'm his girlfriend

178
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,240
ex-girlfriend

179
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,440
Zheng Nanfeng, you're something else

180
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,280
So you found someone to bully me, huh?

181
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,440
When did Zheng Nanfeng

182
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,920
get another girlfriend?

183
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,600
I wondered why you ran off

184
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,280
Turns out you had another woman

185
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,680
I'm here today to get an explanation from you

186
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,200
Zheng Nanfeng, you're pretty fickle

187
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,360
You have a girlfriend yet you still fool around

188
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,280
Yeah, so what?

189
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,640
Stop

190
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,160
Xu Rumeng

191
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,080
Why did you go to the mainland?

192
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,440
Weren't you there to shoot a film?

193
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,960
Showbiz isn't that easy to make it in

194
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,120
If I go alone, I can only play bit parts

195
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,320
And my family doesn't support me doing this

196
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,200
So I want to go back to Haicheng first

197
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,400
Find a job and take it from there

198
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,000
Wait a second

199
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,120
I remember you studied dance, right?

200
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,640
Yeah, what's up?

201
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,040
That's great

202
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,440
You're the one

203
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,960
She's the one

204
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,000
With her dance skills, she'll definitely be up for it

205
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,560
Zheng Nanfeng

206
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,520
I think you want to get back with your ex

207
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,800
It's work time now

208
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,840
If you want romance, take it home

209
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
Why are you jealous?

210
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,040
Jealous my ass

211
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,120
You've only been a manager for a few days

212
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,840
Already abusing power for personal gain, huh?

213
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,200
Let me tell you

214
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,840
Based on what I know about her

215
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,120
She'll definitely be our nightclub's secret weapon

216
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,680
Her

217
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,800
Can she handle it?

218
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,200
If she can't

219
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,680
Then nobody can

220
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,200
Xu Rumeng is really good-looking

221
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,640
Her dancing is gorgeous too

222
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,840
This move pulled in so much buzz

223
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,800
She will have bigger stages in the future

224
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,800
Your little girlfriend is pretty, huh?

225
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,520
If you like her, go get her back

226
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,600
Chase her for what?

227
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,080
I already have a wife

228
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,880
You have a wife?

229
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,680
You

230
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,680
Zheng Nanfeng

231
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,080
You never stop, do you?

232
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,880
How was it?

233
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,600
It was insane

234
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,680
Look, you got the whole place hyped

235
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,320
I have studied dance for years

236
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,040
Never thought dance could be choreographed like this

237
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,520
And clothes can be worn like this too

238
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,040
And I have never even heard this music

239
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,640
Where did you learn all this?

240
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,120
Well, that I cannot tell you

241
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,360
Trade secret

242
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,160
Zheng Nanfeng

243
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,360
I feel you are different from before

244
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,400
I can't put the current you into words

245
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,200
Ah

246
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,440
Oh right, I forgot to tell you

247
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,160
I checked out of the hotel

248
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,360
Does your nightclub have somewhere to stay?

249
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,800
There is no space in the dorm

250
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,920
Why not stay at my place?

251
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,360
You are now the star of our club

252
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,840
It is not safe to live alone

253
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,280
I have to protect you well

254
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,360
Right?

255
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,400
Yes, yes, yes

256
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,920
Our rivals are really nasty

257
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,320
We need to protect you well

258
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,320
From now on the three of us will live together

259
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,960
We can also look out for each other

260
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,200
I only let Xu Rumeng go to my place

261
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,480
What does that have to do with you?

262
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,200
Well, you are women after all

263
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,080
If anything happens

264
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,800
We men have to step up

265
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,960
Moving is a bit of a hassle

266
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,240
No need to be polite with me

267
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,680
I will move over today

268
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,360
Great, I was just going to tell you

269
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,880
I came because I want to live with you

270
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,120
That is not what I meant

271
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,440
Stop, stop, stop

272
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,440
Their dance is mind-blowing

273
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,680
Mind-blowing, do you get it?

274
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,560
What on earth are you dancing?

275
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,280
Manager, this is too hard

276
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,160
Yeah, we have never seen it before

277
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,280
Besides, your recording is no good

278
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,120
It is choppy and not clear to see

279
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,040
You guys practice first

280
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,480
I will think of a way

281
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,040
Not only was the Rip-off exposed

282
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,000
Now we cannot even copy them, right?

283
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,360
Boss, their update speed is too fast

284
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,320
We still have not mastered this business model

285
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,160
They have already moved on to new dances

286
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,480
And we had never even seen that stuff before

287
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,080
Our people really cannot keep up

288
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,720
We cannot solve the problem

289
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,680
Then we deal with the people

290
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,160
Zheng Nanfeng

291
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,200
Hey

292
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,200
I'm not Zheng Nanfeng

293
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,320
He's Zheng Nanfeng

294
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,600
Sit down

295
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,760
You scumbag

296
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,280
I told you to stay away from my sister

297
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,280
And you still let her dance in a place like this

298
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,760
Your sister

299
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,840
Youyou

300
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,240
Sis

301
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,120
Youyou, why are you here?

302
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,280
Uncle told me to come

303
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,880
He said he's not mad at you anymore

304
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:41,640
He wants you to go back to Hong Kong,China?

305
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,040
Let's talk outside

306
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,760
Let's go

307
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,920
Not you two

308
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,000
She hit me

309
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,880
Please enjoy

310
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,720
Thanks

311
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:54,760
Sis

312
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,440
A scumbag is always a scumbag

313
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,600
They'll never change

314
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,520
Don't let him fool you

315
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:01,960
Sis

316
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,080
He's become really impressive now

317
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,600
He composed the music and choreographed the dance for me

318
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,840
I haven't seen that even overseas

319
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,920
I heard he's cozying up to the boss's wife

320
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,680
Watch out, he might be two-timing

321
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,440
I know that Zhou Zhiyi

322
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,640
has a thing for him

323
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,560
But it doesn't matter

324
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,160
Only I can be with him

325
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,520
Fine, this trip was for nothing

326
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,200
Uncle also promised me

327
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,920
if I persuade you to go back

328
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,560
he'll buy me a sports car

329
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,400
Xu Youyou, you little brat

330
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,480
You're conning my dad again

331
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,600
Don't be harsh with me

332
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,440
If you shout at me, I'll go tell your dad

333
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,160
his daughter fell for a good-for-nothing punk

334
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,280
and she's even ditching her family

335
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,400
You...

336
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,280
I told you, Zheng Nanfeng

337
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,760
he's not a punk

338
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,720
He, he used to be a bit cynical

339
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,000
but now he's completely changed

340
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,680
You'll know once you meet him

341
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,720
He's become mature and steady

342
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,560
and charismatic

343
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,960
Mature, steady, and charismatic

344
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,520
Sis

345
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,240
I think you're really bewitched

346
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,200
See that?

347
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,680
The table by the street

348
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,920
Make it quick later

349
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,960
Don't worry, Brother Jie

350
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,200
That damn girl

351
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,600
Ran off without waiting for me

352
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,120
I miss you

353
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,040
Whenever dusk arrives

354
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,920
the evening breeze rises

355
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,760
I miss you

356
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,760
Life's riddle

357
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,880
Try not to see it clearly

358
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,280
Close your eyes

359
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,480
Do not respond

360
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,480
The evening breeze blows and blows

361
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,160
go with the wind

362
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,600
Tonight, children, don't cry in secret

363
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,760
Don't cry in secret

364
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,600
The evening breeze blows and blows

365
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,280
go with the wind

366
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,440
As night falls and stars

367
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,440
gently drift to sleep

368
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,880
Feel the evening breeze
