1
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,160
Pay up!

2
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,840
No, no, brother, calm down.

3
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,320
Zheng Nanfeng, give me back my job!

4
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,240
Yadong.

5
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,160
What do you want with me?

6
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,800
Why did you bring so many people?

7
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,080
What else could it be?

8
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
With such a big show of force...

9
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,800
...he's definitely here to take us down.

10
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,160
Boss Zheng is at the top in Haicheng.

11
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,000
How would I dare?

12
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,520
Boss Cheng.

13
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,640
You deliberately chose the day of my launch event.

14
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,560
You have an ulterior motive.

15
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,440
Speak.

16
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,720
What do you really want?

17
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,400
Boss Zheng.

18
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,760
Let me clarify something first.

19
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,880
These workers all came on their own.

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,280
My people...

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,560
...are also on strike.

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,640
The dance halls, factories, real estate companies—all shut down.

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,160
We can't make a living anymore.

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,000
My brothers here definitely won't stand for it.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,640
Right?

26
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,760
We won't stand for it!

27
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,840
No! We won't!

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,840
Pay us back!

29
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,400
No!

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
Compensate us!

31
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
Boss Zheng.

32
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,240
Don't misunderstand me.

33
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,400
I'm not here to fight you today.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm here to discuss cooperation.

35
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,200
Cooperation?

36
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,960
That's right.

37
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,000
I heard...

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,280
...you've developed an international logistics business.

39
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,840
Today's the signing ceremony, right?

40
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,440
Well, I spent some time abroad.

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,480
I know a fair bit about international logistics and transport.

42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,000
If you hand that work over to me...

43
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,440
...won't my brothers have food on the table?

44
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,840
Alright.

45
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,200
Or not.

46
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
It's up to Boss Zheng.

47
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,200
Alright.

48
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,160
Brother Feng.

49
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,640
You brought so many men...

50
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,800
...I don't dare say no.

51
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,600
It's just...

52
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,000
I have a bit of a headache right now.

53
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,200
My banquet hall...

54
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,600
...didn't prepare that much liquor.

55
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,280
To our future cooperation!

56
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,200
Come on.

57
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,400
A toast to Boss Zheng!

58
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,160
When are you planning to change how you address him?

59
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,680
Bottoms up!

60
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,200
Take it easy on the drinks.

61
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,520
You don't listen.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,600
Don't.

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I told you to drink less.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,280
Don't show off.

65
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,280
You insisted on drinking.

66
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,240
Over here.

67
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,880
Careful.

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,200
Welcome back, boss!

69
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,480
Sis.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,800
Jiachang.

71
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,200
Let A-Jie properly wash away your bad luck.

72
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,880
Come on, boss.

73
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,560
Let's go.

74
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,880
We've arranged a welcome banquet for you today.

75
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,560
At the Waterside Hotel.

76
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,640
Five years.

77
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,600
A full five years.

78
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,000
Brother Xie.

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,800
Sis.

80
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,240
Do you know how I've lived these five years?

81
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,280
It's still more comfortable outside.

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,960
How great it is out here.

83
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,960
Enjoy yourself properly, Jiachang.

84
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,960
Head up to the third floor in a bit.

85
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,680
We've arranged a welcome banquet for you.

86
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,200
These five years...

87
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,920
...I definitely didn't suffer for nothing.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,600
Jiachang, what do you mean by that?

89
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,040
This debt...

90
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,280
...I will definitely settle with Zheng Nanfeng.

91
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,760
I'll pay it back tenfold, a hundredfold.

92
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,800
You still want to fight Zheng Nanfeng, is that it?

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,600
From now on, in Haicheng, it's either him or me.

94
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,400
Either me or him.

95
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,600
Listen to me for a moment.

96
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,800
Neither of us is a match for Zheng Nanfeng.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,960
The harder you fight...

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,080
...the faster it backfires.

99
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,960
Sis.

100
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,080
How is that the same?

101
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,480
I'm out now.

102
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,880
This is us, brother and sister, joining forces.

103
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,960
We must make sure he ends up with nowhere to be buried.

104
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,680
Zheng Nanfeng repaid evil with good.

105
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,760
Not only did he not hold a grudge...

106
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,200
...he helped our company come back from the brink.

107
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,040
I don't want to fight him anymore.

108
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,280
Sis.

109
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,880
Am I hearing you right?

110
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,160
Hearing this from you...

111
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,000
So I'm advising you to back down too.

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,400
Okay?

113
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,760
Impossible.

114
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,560
Jiachang.

115
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,960
Don't you see Cheng Yadong is cooperating with him now too?

116
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,760
Think about it carefully.

117
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,600
I really don't want to see anything happen to you.

118
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,160
What else could possibly happen to me?

119
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,560
Huh?

120
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,800
You think I'm still the same person I was before?

121
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,560
I can take him down without you.

122
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,200
Jiachang, listen to me.

123
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,000
Sis.

124
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I've always looked up to you.

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,040
I never thought you'd be scared out of your wits like this.

126
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,960
My stance remains the same.

127
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,600
From now on, in this world...

128
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,840
...it's either him or me.

129
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,800
Either me or him.

130
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,480
Boss.

131
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,320
Boss.

132
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,960
I want to follow you again.

133
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,000
Boss.

134
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,480
Even though I've been working for Big Sis lately...

135
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,400
...I've been waiting for you to get out.

136
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,600
No matter what...

137
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,280
...I'm with you.

138
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,640
It seems I didn't misjudge you after all.

139
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,520
Boss.

140
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,240
You raised me from the ground up.

141
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,200
I know what needs to be done.

142
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,960
Tell me...

143
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,360
...what's going on with my sister?

144
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,240
How did she become a different person?

145
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,880
It's a long story.

146
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,160
Here's the plan.

147
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,840
I'll take you for a sauna first.

148
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,240
Then I'll tell you everything slowly.

149
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,240
Let's go.

150
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,000
Boss

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,840
How's it going?

152
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,080
We've added more men, everyone's busy.

153
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,480
The client is pushing for the goods.

154
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,080
Tell the brothers to hurry up.

155
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,960
We absolutely cannot delay them.

156
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,160
Don't ruin our reputation.

157
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,600
Yes.

158
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,080
Don't worry, Boss, we won't mess up.

159
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,760
Alright.

160
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,600
There shouldn't be any problems, right?

161
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,640
The whole port is running smoothly.

162
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,200
He handles operations quite skillfully too.

163
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,360
I really didn't expect that.

164
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
So we're really handing the logistics business to him?

165
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,840
I already said it to his face.

166
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,240
And after observing these past few days, there are no issues.

167
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,080
Let's give it to him.

168
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,400
I'll have Aqiang keep an eye on things.

169
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,800
Fine.

170
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,000
Alright.

171
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,640
Let's head back.

172
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,120
The food stall?

173
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,400
What food stall?

174
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:07,960
We're going home.

175
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,200
I'll cook a couple of dishes for you.

176
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:10,760
Okay.

177
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,240
Whatever Sister Zhiyi says.

178
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,200
Drive, Nanfeng.

179
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,760
The boss is gone.

180
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,200
Tell the brothers to pause what they're doing.

181
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
Everyone head to Warehouse Four.

182
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,840
Yes.

183
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,640
Let's go.

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,600
Boss.

185
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,400
These all came from overseas.

186
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,360
Genuine goods.

187
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,600
Top-notch quality.

188
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,080
They're in high demand on the market.

189
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,160
Get the goods loaded.

190
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,800
You two handle the delivery personally.

191
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,640
Don't let anyone at the company know.

192
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,760
Understood.

193
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,040
Mr. Cheng, I've been looking everywhere for you.

194
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,600
You haven't signed for the goods that just arrived.

195
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,000
Mr. Cheng.

196
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,800
This is...

197
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,600
You're not careful at all.

198
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,800
You got the container data wrong.

199
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,520
No, it's correct.

200
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,040
I checked it carefully.

201
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,440
258 containers.

202
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,400
It's clearly 248.

203
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,400
Isn't this it?

204
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,160
This is a last-minute order.

205
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,280
It's not on the master list.

206
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,600
Don't count it.

207
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,240
Okay, I'll have someone open and inspect them right away.

208
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,600
No inspection needed.

209
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,160
I already had them checked.

210
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,240
Time is tight.

211
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,600
Don't delay the transfer.

212
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,400
But this doesn't follow procedure.

213
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,560
Enough nonsense.

214
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,680
Do as Mr. Cheng says.

215
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,400
Hey.

216
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,240
Watch your tone.

217
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,000
You can trust me to handle things.

218
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,840
Yes, Mr. Cheng.

219
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,800
Just create a new order.

220
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,800
Go on.

221
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:05,840
Get back to work.

222
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,400
Alright.

223
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,200
I didn't expect...

224
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,960
...that during my absence...

225
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,640
...so much would happen.

226
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,800
I think...

227
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,800
...Big Sister was just momentarily bewitched by Zheng Nanfeng.

228
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,280
Brother.

229
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,360
Let's try to talk some sense into Big Sister later.

230
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,200
She might just change her mind.

231
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,760
Not necessarily.

232
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,160
What do you mean?

233
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,560
I know my sister's personality.

234
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,760
Once she's set her mind on something...

235
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,440
...she won't change it.

236
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,880
Getting her to change her mind now...

237
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,560
...won't be easy.

238
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,160
No, but...

239
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,040
Even if we can't convince her...

240
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,000
...once we go up against Zheng Nanfeng...

241
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,280
...Big Sister can't possibly not side with you.

242
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,200
After all, you're blood siblings.

243
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,000
We'll see.

244
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,520
But just now, hearing you talk about...

245
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,720
...Cheng Yadong's situation...

246
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,480
...I find it quite interesting.

247
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,640
Speaking of him...

248
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,280
...I'm a bit puzzled too.

249
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,920
You said he was once a big name in Haicheng.

250
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,560
A real somebody.

251
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,080
But now...

252
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,800
...his wife was taken from him.

253
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,200
And he actually has the nerve...

254
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,320
...to go seek cooperation.

255
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,800
He's become a joke among the brothers in the underworld.

256
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,680
I don't think it's that simple.

257
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,440
Here's what we'll do.

258
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,080
You go arrange a meeting with him.

259
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
I'll meet with him.

260
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,600
Is that even necessary now?

261
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,880
Haven't you heard the saying?

262
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,200
The enemy of my enemy...

263
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,080
...is my friend.

264
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,800
I miss you.

265
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,720
Whenever dusk arrives.

266
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,600
The evening breeze rises.

267
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,440
Missing you.

268
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,440
Life's mysteries.

269
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,560
Try not to see them clearly.

270
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,960
Close your eyes.

271
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,160
Don't respond.

272
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,160
The evening breeze blows and blows.

273
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,840
Go with the wind.

274
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,280
Tonight, child, don't cry in secret.

275
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,440
Don't cry in secret.

276
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,280
The evening breeze blows and blows.

277
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,960
Go with the wind.

278
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,120
With the night's curtain of stars.

279
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,120
Gently fall asleep.

280
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,560
Blow, evening breeze.
