1
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,480
Chairman Xu, I’ve made it very clear to you

2
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,640
Forced feelings

3
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,640
Not suitable

4
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,080
I just want to treat Rumeng as my own sister now

5
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,200
Fine then

6
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,560
You all

7
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,040
Just let it happen naturally

8
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,720
Since you did the company a big favor this time

9
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,560
I won’t make it hard for you

10
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,480
But

11
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,040
You have to promise me

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
One more thing

13
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,480
What other thing?

14
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,200
Do the internet project properly

15
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,520
And also

16
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,080
You still have to be my godson

17
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,400
Not be a godson

18
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,640
What’s the reason for that?

19
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,400
You didn’t give me a reason to make you my son-in-law

20
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:35,920
No

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,880
These are two separate things

22
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,680
One thing

23
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,120
You still won’t call me

24
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,280
Godfather

25
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,520
Hey

26
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,360
Hello, President Zheng

27
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,440
Hello, President Zheng

28
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,200
Hello, President Zheng

29
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,960
Looks like you’ve already adapted well

30
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,760
It’s okay

31
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,680
What’s this?

32
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,760
This is the project’s introduction material

33
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,400
There are some documents that need your signature

34
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,920
Okay

35
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,240
Leave it here

36
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,960
You need to pick up the pace

37
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,840
This is just a small portion from before

38
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,080
Later,

39
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,080
Other departments will coordinate with you one by one

40
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,320
There is much more to be processed later

41
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,040
It feels different from what I imagined

42
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,560
Looks like this overbearing CEO

43
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,320
is not that easy to be

44
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,800
Brother-in-law

45
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,640
You can’t back out

46
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,360
So many people throughout the company

47
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,960
are all counting on you

48
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,560
Got it

49
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,680
Oh, right

50
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,800
From now on,

51
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,080
I need to change how I address you

52
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,200
You and my sister don’t have that relationship now

53
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,760
Calling you brother-in-law seems not quite right

54
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,560
That’s not right

55
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,440
Not appropriate

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,800
President Zheng

57
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,960
No, that’s too formal

58
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,560
Fengfeng

59
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,920
Mm

60
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,200
A bit cheesy

61
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,240
Brother Nanfeng

62
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,160
Just call me Nan Feng

63
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,240
Nan Feng

64
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,240
Nan Feng

65
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,200
Nan Feng

66
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,240
Come on, come on, time to eat

67
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,920
So lavish!

68
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,040
I added extra for you

69
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,240
I cooked it myself

70
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,640
Youyou

71
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,440
You’re busy with your own work too

72
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,680
You...

73
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,720
I feel bad

74
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,840
I’m happy to

75
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,480
Go ahead and eat

76
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,480
I just don’t want you overworked

77
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,000
It’s not hard

78
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,560
Go ahead and eat

79
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,880
I’ll come back in a bit

80
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,280
Looks like this won’t work

81
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,360
I just sent off Xu Rumeng

82
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,640
And now Xu Youyou shows up

83
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,840
These two sisters are set on making me miserable

84
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,680
Sir, you can’t go in, you can’t go in

85
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,200
Let me in

86
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
I want to see Brother Nanfeng

87
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,840
Do you know my relationship with Brother Nanfeng?

88
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,880
No matter the relationship, you still can’t go in

89
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,720
Let me in

90
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,160
Brother Nanfeng

91
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,720
A Qiang

92
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,640
Brother Nanfeng

93
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,560
Brother Nanfeng

94
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,920
I finally found you

95
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,560
How did you let yourself get like this

96
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,360
I’ve been in Shengang for over a week

97
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,840
And I didn’t have your contact info

98
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,560
So I asked around everywhere

99
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,840
If I couldn’t find you, I couldn’t go on

100
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:31,960
Uh...

101
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,320
Can I have a bite first

102
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,720
Eat

103
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,360
Get him a new pair of chopsticks

104
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,000
Eat slowly, don’t choke

105
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,880
Here, have some water

106
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,160
Nan Feng, A Qiang

107
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,120
You two eat first

108
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,400
I’ll go handle something

109
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,400
How did you let yourself get like this

110
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,040
I haven’t eaten for three days

111
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,480
I swam here from Haicheng

112
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,480
The little money I had ran out long ago

113
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,600
You were doing fine in Haicheng

114
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,960
Why did you come to Shengang

115
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,120
Boss Cheng kicked me out

116
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,520
What happened

117
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,360
He’s arrogant and overbearing at the company

118
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,440
And he’s narrow-minded

119
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,480
He’s harsh to the old brothers too

120
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,400
I talked back to him a couple of times

121
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,680
Then he told me to get lost

122
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,440
What about Zhiyi

123
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,680
Sister Zhiyi

124
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,560
She hardly goes out now

125
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,840
I think she has a lot on her mind

126
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,320
Seems she doesn’t like to talk much anymore

127
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,680
That Cheng guy hasn’t made things hard for her, right

128
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,640
Mm, no

129
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,200
What about A Ming

130
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,200
A Ming

131
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,400
He still remembers the old ties

132
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,800
He doesn’t want to leave

133
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,760
I figured it’s good if he doesn’t leave

134
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,360
He can look after Sister Zhiyi a bit

135
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,600
True

136
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,320
Brother Nanfeng

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,360
You’ve made it in Shengang

138
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,440
Just starting out

139
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,120
So-so

140
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,440
Then can I stay here

141
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,400
Keep following you

142
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,120
Sure, sure

143
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,920
Just think of it like Haicheng

144
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,840
I can’t just freeload meals, can I

145
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,200
Maybe you could see about giving me

146
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,280
some kind of job

147
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,160
I do have something

148
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,960
It’s just a bit troublesome

149
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,800
It depends on whether you can do it

150
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,120
I’ll go through blades and fire, Brother Nanfeng

151
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,520
Come here, come here

152
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,800
Will this work

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,920
I think it will

154
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,320
I’m not sure

155
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,200
I’ll back you up

156
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,520
I love you

157
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,280
I fancy you

158
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,880
I love you

159
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,040
I really love you

160
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,720
Hey, stop right there

161
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,840
I’ve been really super frustrated lately

162
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,240
You’re in my head every day

163
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,400
Round and round and round

164
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,240
I think about you all day long

165
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,680
I really can’t take it anymore

166
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,000
Will you date me

167
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,440
Please, just give me a chance

168
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,360
I promise you’ll fall in love with me

169
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,760
Will you do me a favor

170
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,000
Let’s watch a movie together

171
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,920
Titanic

172
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,960
You jump, I jump

173
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,600
I don’t care anymore, I don’t care

174
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,080
This is just how I am

175
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,960
What are you doing, A Qiang?

176
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,280
Nothing.

177
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,640
Then why are you sneaking around

178
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,920
at my office door?

179
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,080
I...

180
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,560
Stop right there.

181
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,760
I need to talk to you.

182
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,920
Go ahead.

183
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,800
Well...

184
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,520
What is it?

185
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,720
Why are you hemming and hawing?

186
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,440
That's not like you.

187
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,920
I have things to do.

188
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,800
Spit it out.

189
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,760
Uh, uh...

190
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,160
The cinema next door has a buy-one-get-one deal.

191
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,240
I happen to have two tickets.

192
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,320
I want to give you one.

193
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,280
A movie ticket.

194
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,640
Ah.

195
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,560
Titanic

196
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,800
Um...

197
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,640
I heard it's a pretty good love story.

198
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,680
A love story.

199
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,160
How come I heard it's a disaster film?

200
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,800
A disaster film?

201
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,240
You can't even tell a love story from a disaster film.

202
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,120
Find someone else.

203
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,720
Hey.

204
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,040
A disaster film?

205
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
Isn't it a love story?

206
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,040
How did it go?

207
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,040
She said I can't even tell a love story

208
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,360
from a disaster film.

209
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,600
and just turned me down.

210
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,360
Keep trying.

211
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,920
What else can I do?

212
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,480
Just watching a movie is too dull.

213
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,880
You need to use some tactics.

214
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,720
What tactics?

215
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,560
I miss you.

216
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,480
Whenever dusk falls,

217
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,360
the evening breeze blows.

218
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,200
I miss you.

219
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,200
the riddle of life

220
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,320
try not to see it too clearly.

221
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,720
Close your eyes.

222
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,920
Don't answer.

223
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,920
The evening breeze blows and blows

224
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,600
Go with the wind.

225
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,040
Tonight, children, don't cry in secret.

226
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,200
Don't cry in secret.

227
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,040
The evening breeze blows and blows

228
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,720
Go with the wind.

229
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,880
As night falls with the stars,

230
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,880
fall gently asleep.

231
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,320
Feel the evening breeze.
