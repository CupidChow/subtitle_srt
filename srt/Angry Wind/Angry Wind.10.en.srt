1
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,760
This is Haicheng Television.

2
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,240
Bringing you live coverage.

3
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,400
Of Yida Real Estate's first home delivery.

4
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,840
Although Yida Real Estate is a new company,

5
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,280
it dares to innovate in home layouts.

6
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,720
It has won the people's affection.

7
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,320
Its home prices also set a new high for Haicheng.

8
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,600
It's reported this home

9
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,960
comes with a premium renovation package,

10
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,640
and a full set of furniture and appliances,

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,880
all in luxury specifications.

12
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,920
We'll see it for ourselves shortly.

13
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,920
The decor is quite nice.

14
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,320
Great natural light.

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,040
Feng-ge, Feng-ge!

16
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,040
Look over there!

17
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,440
Master Qian!

18
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,120
Who knew the floor-to-ceiling windows for light

19
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,320
would instead make things easy for thieves.

20
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,480
Even large items like TVs and wardrobes

21
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,600
can be stolen with ease.

22
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,400
Hey, what are you saying?

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,240
What are you talking about?

24
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:39,840
Stop recording!

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
Stop it, stop recording!

26
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,520
As expected, when Brother Ming steps in, it's different.

27
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,480
The whole house is cleaned out.

28
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,400
This Xiao Qian really is an expert under Brother Ming.

29
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,560
Truly impressive.

30
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,480
Good. Let's add more fuel to the fire.

31
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,760
Spread the word.

32
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,920
Say that Zheng Nanfeng's houses

33
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,600
are both conspicuous and insecure,

34
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,760
and also expensive.

35
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,960
They're the easiest target for thieves.

36
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,160
Yes.

37
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,640
Playing with you

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,480
is actually quite interesting.

39
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,640
My apologies, Master Qin.

40
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,360
Give me a little more time to investigate fully.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,480
We will definitely compensate you for your loss.

42
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,760
Nanfeng,

43
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,800
you've really made me lose face this time.

44
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,880
The new home being robbed isn't just my loss.

45
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,080
Now all the buyers are canceling their purchases.

46
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,760
I think

47
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,920
whether your Yida Real Estate can survive

48
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,200
is still a question.

49
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,280
I know the severity of this problem.

50
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,720
I need to think of another way.

51
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,920
Master Qin,

52
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,400
who exactly is this Xiao Qian?

53
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,400
Xiao Qian?

54
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,120
He's Haicheng's King of Thieves.

55
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,240
No matter what kind of lock,

56
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,080
he'll open it within ten minutes.

57
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,520
He once threw the whole city into panic.

58
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,600
I don't know

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
why he's come out of retirement.

60
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,920
All locks opened within ten minutes.

61
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,600
Can open any lock in ten minutes.

62
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,640
This Xiao Qian hasn't been seen for years.

63
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,720
His sudden appearance today

64
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,200
must be on someone's orders.

65
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,680
There's no need to guess.

66
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,560
It's definitely Xie Rong.

67
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,320
She's much more cunning than her brother.

68
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,760
Well, if there's really no other way,

69
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,920
I'll call my dad.

70
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,320
Let my dad

71
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,120
help out a bit.

72
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,840
Distant water can't quench a nearby fire.

73
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,120
Your father is in Shengang.

74
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,160
And didn't you say

75
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,440
he just runs a small business?

76
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,040
He can't suppress Haicheng's local snakes.

77
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,560
Got it!

78
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,080
I've got it!

79
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,560
Who's got it?

80
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,840
What's going on here?

81
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,480
They say it's some kind of bounty.

82
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,880
There's a 500,000 prize!

83
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,120
Neighbors, friends, and family!

84
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,080
With thefts happening frequently lately,

85
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,720
we at Yida Real Estate

86
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,840
have prepared a challenge.

87
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,800
There's 500,000 in here.

88
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,040
Whoever can,

89
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,560
within ten minutes, pick this door lock

90
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,360
and open this cage,

91
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,840
the money inside is theirs.

92
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,640
Is anyone up for the challenge?

93
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,160
I'll do it!

94
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,200
Hey!

95
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,640
Five-minute timer starts now!

96
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,440
Hey, hey!

97
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,240
Alright, alright, alright.

98
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,160
Just causing trouble, huh?

99
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,080
Get down, get down!

100
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,480
Anyone else want to try?

101
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,360
I'll do it! Ouch!

102
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,920
Master Hou! Oh my!

103
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,880
Come on, come on, hurry up!

104
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,080
Stop dawdling! Isn't this Haicheng's locksmith, Master Hou?

105
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,160
Master Hou is famous for lock-picking in Haicheng.

106
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,680
Everyone says he can give Xiao Qian a run for his money.

107
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Timer starts now!

108
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,800
No problem, no problem.

109
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,320
This 500,000 is definitely Master Hou's.

110
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,080
What kind of lock is this?

111
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,120
So intricate.

112
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,080
What lock is this?

113
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,080
Master Hou, time's running out!

114
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,840
What is this lock?

115
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,360
What kind of lock is this?

116
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,320
Master Hou is out of time.

117
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,280
Alright, failed.

118
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,000
Failed, can't open it, right?

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What lock?

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,720
Won't open, won't open.

121
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,480
Get down, hey.

122
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,480
Down, down, hey.

123
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,280
Get down.

124
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,360
What kind of lock is this?

125
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,320
Heh heh.

126
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,280
What lock can't be opened?

127
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,840
Can't open it, fine.

128
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,840
Get down, get down, go on down.

129
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,840
What kind of lock is this?

130
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,520
Oh, get down, get down, oh.

131
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,160
Get down.

132
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,640
What, what, what lock is this?

133
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,760
This is... you get down.

134
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
What lock is this?

135
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,240
What kind of lock is this?

136
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,320
Oh, what lock could it be?

137
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,640
What is this lock?

138
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,840
Dear neighbors,

139
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,480
This lock,

140
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,360
is actually an advanced security lock

141
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,640
meticulously designed by our Yida Real Estate.

142
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,120
Anyone who buys a house from Yida Real Estate

143
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,920
will get a free upgrade

144
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,480
to this level of security lock.

145
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,560
Friends who buy our houses

146
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,360
won't have to worry about thieves breaking in.

147
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,400
It's even safer than a bank vault.

148
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,160
My dad is the richest man.

149
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,400
I can take ten units!

150
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,680
Then how many should I get?

151
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,280
Everyone, quiet please!

152
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,160
Everyone, quiet down.

153
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,920
If you're not satisfied,

154
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,000
we will refund your deposit in full.

155
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,840
We returned deposits before to prevent theft,

156
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,480
but now with security doors installed,

157
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,480
we definitely won't refund.

158
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,640
Who would still return it?

159
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,960
Only a fool would return it now.

160
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,240
Weren't many people returning houses these days?

161
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,360
Hurry up and release those units!

162
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,960
I'll pay the deposit and buy now.

163
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,880
Buy now.

164
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,480
Buy!

165
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,240
Give me ten units.

166
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,160
I want ten units.

167
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,040
It's fine, please line up, okay?

168
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,920
Quite the variety of tricks.

169
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,280
Brother Ming.

170
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,080
Zheng Nanfeng's lock-picking challenge will last three more days.

171
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,400
We'll still have to trouble Xiao Qian to step up

172
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,880
and break his iron cage.

173
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,560
Boss Xie,

174
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,840
as the saying goes, there's honor among thieves.

175
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,880
Jianghu rules.

176
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,280
Since the other side has already broken the setup,

177
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,560
it's not right for us to cause trouble again.

178
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,840
Double the price this time.

179
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,880
Boss Xie, do you want me to break the rules?

180
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
However,

181
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,200
our Xiao Qian sometimes wants a challenge too.

182
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,240
You get down! What are you doing?

183
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,720
Is there anyone else to challenge?

184
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,760
If there are no more challengers,

185
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,800
the event will soon end.

186
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,680
I'll do it, I'll do it.

187
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,400
Heh heh heh.

188
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,880
This friend,

189
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,720
since you opened it,

190
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,520
the 500,000 is yours.

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Go in and get it yourself.

192
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,120
Hold it, hold it.

193
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,600
The lock you just picked

194
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,280
was just an ordinary lock core.

195
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,640
This one now is our real security lock.

196
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,600
You have ten minutes.

197
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,600
Unlock it,

198
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
and we'll let you go.

199
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,600
Xiao Qian.

200
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,960
He is

201
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,760
Thief Number One,

202
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,680
the great thief Xiao Qian.

203
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,680
I really didn't expect

204
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,640
that you recognized me long ago.

205
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,520
Today was to lure me in.

206
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,560
You have ten minutes before the police arrive.

207
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,560
Boss Xie, with just this bit of money,

208
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,040
are you treating me like a beggar?

209
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,120
Xiao Qian fell for Zheng Nanfeng's trap himself.

210
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,920
What does that have to do with me?

211
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,600
No relation?

212
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,240
Now you say it's not related?

213
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,680
Wasn't it you who sent him?

214
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,440
Brother Ming,

215
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,920
let's keep things separate.

216
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,480
I did send him to pick the lock,

217
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,600
but I didn't tell him

218
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,440
to walk into the cage.

219
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,160
You're right.

220
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,320
It really has nothing to do with you.

221
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,120
But this Zheng Nanfeng,

222
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
I am determined to take down.

223
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,040
Since we're taking so many risks from now on,

224
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,160
Boss Xie,

225
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,840
shouldn't you also contribute some effort?

226
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,320
Brother Ming,

227
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,600
I'm a businessperson.

228
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,720
Things like murder and arson,

229
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,080
I don't do.

230
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,920
However,

231
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,120
if someone helps me eliminate a competitor,

232
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,760
I'm willing to pay 2 million

233
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,360
as a thank-you fee.

234
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,520
But,

235
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,760
I do not support anyone

236
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,880
doing anything else to Zheng Nanfeng.

237
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,080
Understood.

238
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,080
Good.

239
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,400
Boss Xie is decisive.

240
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,240
Anything we do from now on

241
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,360
has no relation to Boss Xie whatsoever.

242
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,160
I miss you.

243
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,080
Whenever dusk arrives,

244
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,960
the evening breeze rises.

245
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,800
Missing you.

246
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,800
Life's mysteries.

247
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,920
Try not to see clearly.

248
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,320
Close your eyes.

249
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,520
Don't respond.

250
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,520
The evening breeze blows and blows.

251
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,200
Go with the wind.

252
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,640
Tonight, child, don't cry secretly.

253
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,800
Don't cry secretly.

254
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,640
The evening breeze blows and blows.

255
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,320
Go with the wind.

256
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,480
With the night's curtain and stars,

257
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,480
gently fall asleep.

258
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,920
Blow, evening breeze.
