1
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,840
We can't avoid Xie Jiachang fast enough

2
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,280
Why did you send him an invitation

3
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,040
Even if we don’t invite him

4
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,160
He’ll come on his own

5
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,120
Why not take the initiative

6
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,840
Today is the opening night

7
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,040
What if he causes trouble

8
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,200
He got burned last time

9
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,920
He definitely won’t let it go this time

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,520
Who knows best what Xie Jiachang is thinking

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,640
Is probably me

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,200
I have a plan

13
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,080
Trust me

14
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,120
Zhou Zhiyi, the drinks delivery is here

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,720
Is that the batch from Master Qin’s distillery

16
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,960
Yes, what’s wrong

17
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,440
Come here, I’ll assign you something

18
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,960
Why go to all that trouble

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,960
Even if I explain, you won’t get it

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,880
Just do it

21
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,960
Okay

22
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,920
Why should I take orders from you

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,240
Zheng Nanfeng is now the manager of the New Literati Club

24
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,720
What he says is what I say. Go

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,720
Not me

26
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,720
Out of respect for Zhou Zhiyi

27
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,400
I...

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,600
Hey, hey, hey

29
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,400
Wife, do you know what I’m going to do

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,200
I don’t know

31
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,240
Then why do you trust me so much

32
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:45,960
I already do

33
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,760
What else can I do

34
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,000
At worst, I’ll just sell you

35
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,720
Who are you calling wife

36
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,560
Today I’ll surely give Xie Jiachang a welcome gift

37
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,960
Boss

38
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,360
Zhou Zhiyi’s side is making big moves today

39
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,920
They even made admission free

40
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,240
All free

41
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,400
Just a gimmick

42
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,520
Free for how many days

43
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,920
No time limit, always free

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,520
Always free

45
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,920
That’s pretty novel

46
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,360
Are they turning the ballroom into charity

47
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,320
I told you we were too heavy-handed back then

48
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,320
Boss

49
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,320
This is an invitation from New Fantasy Ballroom

50
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,440
They actually sent us an invitation

51
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,200
Boss, beware of a trap

52
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,520
Who cares what kind of banquet it is

53
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,560
A storm is brewing

54
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,600
I’ve been wanting an excuse to go

55
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,960
He brought it to our door

56
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,360
Tonight I’m going to have a good time

57
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,720
Everyone, everyone

58
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:00,960
Tonight

59
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,400
It's the reopening day of our New Literati Club

60
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,960
To thank all our new and old patrons for coming

61
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,200
We specially prepared the hottest dance tracks

62
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,240
And the best drinks

63
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,920
And most, most, most, most importantly,

64
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,040
As long as you bring our coupons and come

65
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,800
There's no ticket needed at our club

66
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,840
We hope you spread this news quickly

67
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,600
Welcome, welcome, please come inside

68
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,840
Welcome, thank you

69
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,240
Thank you

70
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,760
Welcome to New Literati Club

71
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,400
No tickets needed

72
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,360
Zheng Nanfeng must be crazy

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,360
I really don't know, Sister Zhiyi,

74
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,720
why you handed the club to him to run

75
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,640
Didn't he say

76
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,000
he'd shut Xie Jiachang's ballroom in one month?

77
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,760
Though I don't get his approach

78
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,040
He looks pretty confident to me

79
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,560
He must have his reasons

80
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,920
I think we won't last a few days before we fold

81
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,920
Zheng Nanfeng

82
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,400
I've put all my assets on the line for you

83
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,960
Half the club's revenue comes from tickets

84
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,040
If it's all free, can we hold up?

85
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,600
You need a product manager mindset

86
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,720
Free is the most expensive

87
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,640
Hmph

88
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,720
A club should use traffic to drive sales

89
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,160
Free is the most expensive

90
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,760
Looks like this kid really got beaten badly

91
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,360
No, we need to find him a good doctor

92
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,520
Get his head checked

93
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,840
Welcome, welcome to New Literati Club

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Welcome to New Literati Club

95
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,600
Welcome to New Literati Club

96
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,440
Master Qin is here

97
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,000
Nanfeng,

98
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,560
I heard from the mall folks downstairs

99
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,160
you placed a big order with me

100
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,120
You really know how to get things done

101
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Master Qin, you're too kind

102
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,600
Master Qin

103
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,520
Then tonight you must have a few extra drinks

104
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,800
Of course

105
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,080
Let's go

106
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,320
Zhiyi, this kid is a decent guy

107
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,640
And he handles things well

108
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,800
Yadong has been gone for quite a few years

109
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,920
You should think about your own situation

110
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,840
Master Qin, what are you saying?

111
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm fine on my own

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,960
Relax, Master Qin, I'll definitely take good care of her

113
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,240
Get lost

114
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,520
Hahaha

115
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,920
If you ask me,

116
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,120
the way you two flirt and bicker,

117
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,520
really looks like a couple

118
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,040
Please stop joking about me

119
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,920
Let me help you inside

120
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,440
No need, no need

121
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,240
You mind your work

122
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,960
Take good care of Master Qin; inside, please

123
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,600
Give him a proper welcome

124
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,600
Welcome to New Literati Club

125
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,120
Everyone, relax

126
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,360
Oh!

127
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,200
What are you doing?

128
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,440
Putting in so much money

129
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,960
And tickets are free, too

130
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,600
President Zhou, careful not to get conned by this kid

131
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,720
Mind your own business

132
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,520
Just mind your own business

133
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,520
President Xie

134
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,800
We specially invited you today

135
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,800
to clear up the misunderstanding from the other day

136
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,240
Hope you have fun tonight

137
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,560
Since it's a misunderstanding,

138
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,520
it's not so easy to resolve

139
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,160
I'm afraid if it's resolved, some people won't be happy

140
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,520
Then let's wait and see

141
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,240
Aming

142
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,800
Let them in

143
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,920
Go in

144
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,720
No, where are you going?

145
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,120
Welcome to New Literati Club

146
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,160
Impossible

147
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,400
Where did they find this designer?

148
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,440
I've never seen this kind of design in my life

149
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,840
Boss, I haven't seen it either

150
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,920
And they don't even charge for tickets

151
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,760
What's the use of a crowd?

152
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,200
Most of a ballroom's revenue is tickets

153
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,720
People who came in for a bargain won't even buy drinks

154
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,960
How the hell can he make any money?

155
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,920
He'll lose his shirt

156
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
Master Qin

157
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,840
Whatever you want to drink tonight is on me

158
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,600
Your ballroom opens today

159
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,040
I’ve got to show my support

160
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,160
I’ll top up 5,000 first

161
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,200
Master Qin guarantees you’ll have fun tonight

162
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,120
Come on

163
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:39,920
Boss

164
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,320
Thanks V12 Master Qin for 1288 Grand Flying Dragon set

165
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,640
Wish Master Qin a great time

166
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,560
Drink to your heart’s content

167
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,560
Boss

168
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,560
W-what booze is this

169
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,840
Costs more than flower wine

170
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,440
Why panic

171
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,240
Calm down

172
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,800
Can I not afford even one bottle

173
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,400
You can afford it

174
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,440
Then that’s settled

175
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,760
Come, open a bottle for Master Qin

176
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,280
Okay, okay, okay

177
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,600
Wish Master Qin drinks well and has fun tonight

178
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
Give me another set

179
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,320
Thanks Master Qin for another 1288

180
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,720
Now tops the New Literati Club spending list

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,800
Okay

182
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,000
Owner, get me a set too

183
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,720
Boss, you get a set too

184
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,520
Make it pricier than his

185
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,120
Got it, right away

186
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,040
Enjoy your drink

187
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,840
I’ll go over first

188
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
Come, come, here

189
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Enjoy your drink, Boss

190
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,520
Hey, Boss

191
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,720
Hey, Boss

192
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,800
Don’t get carried away, no, no, no

193
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,320
Don’t forget why we came here

194
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,920
We’ll talk business later

195
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,440
That punk is scheming against me

196
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,960
So many people ordered Grand Flying Dragon

197
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,360
If I don’t order one, do I have any face

198
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,920
Got it, got it, Boss

199
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,520
Give me a Grand Flying Dragon set

200
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,960
Make it two sets

201
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,800
Here, Boss

202
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,160
A toast to you, Boss

203
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
You’re pretty sharp, kid

204
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,760
What did you say

205
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,240
I said tonight’s revenue is over 50,000

206
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,920
That’s more than ten times the usual

207
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,440
All small-time

208
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,720
There’s even bigger coming

209
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,160
Where did you learn all this

210
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,120
Give me a little reward

211
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,920
Let me tell you

212
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,160
Zheng Nanfeng, you have a death wish, huh

213
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,360
Ah

214
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,320
What’s wrong with him, what is it

215
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,480
Someone died from drinking

216
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,120
Quick, see what’s wrong

217
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,600
Someone died from drinking

218
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,400
This booze is bad, someone died from it

219
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,200
Someone, come quick

220
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,520
My buddy only had two drinks

221
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,920
Suddenly this happened, the booze is bad

222
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,560
This booze is bad

223
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,800
My buddy only had two drinks

224
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,760
Then suddenly this happened

225
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,920
Huh

226
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,680
Boss, the taste is off

227
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,720
Taste is off, it’s fake

228
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,760
Xie Jiachang, you making trouble, huh

229
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,840
With a store this big, would I sell you fake booze

230
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,000
A Jie, you’re being really rude

231
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,400
Look how you scared the lady

232
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,400
Sorry

233
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,640
Mr. Zhou, I didn’t mean anything

234
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,400
This booze really has a weird taste

235
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,520
A Jie

236
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,000
You’re falsely accusing us

237
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,240
Does Mr. Zhou sell fake booze

238
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,240
Bro

239
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,920
I drink this booze every day

240
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,320
I’m sure this booze is fake

241
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,640
And they’re charging so much for it

242
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,560
It’s clearly ripping people off

243
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,720
Is this booze really bad

244
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,160
Look, they’re selling fake booze

245
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,720
See, it’s so expensive

246
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,640
So shady

247
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,640
Xie Jiachang

248
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,520
Your low-down tricks are way too crude

249
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,200
I just stocked this booze this morning

250
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,800
The bottles are right here on display

251
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,760
Taste it yourself

252
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,120
Xie Jiachang

253
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,440
Is it fake liquor?

254
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,640
Zhiyi's ballroom opened today

255
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,840
Can't you stop making trouble?

256
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,120
I know Zhou's character

257
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,520
Today I, Master Qin, give my guarantee

258
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,320
She would never sell fake liquor

259
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,440
Master Qin

260
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,240
Zhiyi's character

261
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,440
I believe it two hundred percent

262
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,720
But her crew

263
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,840
Especially that kid, Zheng Nanfeng

264
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,400
Whether he's clean is hard to say

265
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,840
But this liquor,

266
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,360
is definitely a problem

267
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,040
Master Qin doesn't believe

268
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,960
Have a sip

269
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,800
Fine, pour me a glass, I'll try

270
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,960
Master Qin

271
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,560
Since you say this liquor has a problem,

272
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,520
Then I'll down it

273
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,760
See if it poisons me to death

274
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,840
Wait

275
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,840
Let me see

276
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,520
It's fake, no need to look

277
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,640
Zheng Nanfeng, are you insane?

278
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,160
Good, so quick to confess

279
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,960
This kid has some backbone

280
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,560
I haven't finished talking yet

281
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,320
Alright, go on

282
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,240
The liquor is indeed fake

283
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,040
But this isn't liquor from our ballroom

284
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,520
In your ballroom,

285
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,000
The liquor ordered isn't yours,

286
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,200
Is it mine then?

287
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,200
Is that so?

288
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
A Ming

289
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,360
Bare words aren't proof

290
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:21,560
What arrived today,

291
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,560
all the liquor,

292
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,480
labels and codes are all recorded

293
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,240
I looked at your bottle,

294
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,720
it's not on the list

295
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,520
So this is liquor you brought

296
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Nonsense

297
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,600
This liquor was clearly just ordered

298
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,800
You're the one with no proof

299
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,200
You're saying I'm selling fake liquor, right?

300
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,920
Master Qin, I didn't mean you

301
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,520
I mean this kid

302
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,360
We ordered today's goods from Master Qin

303
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,440
You say this liquor isn't something you brought

304
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,120
Then it came from Master Qin's store

305
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,320
You mean Master Qin sells fake liquor?

306
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,360
Xie Jiachang

307
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,400
Are you trying to frame the New Literati Club,

308
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,960
or frame my store?

309
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,800
Master Qin, I wouldn't dare accuse you

310
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,440
Misunderstanding

311
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,960
Misunderstanding

312
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,040
I think it's a misunderstanding

313
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,160
Tell it to the police

314
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,200
Zhiyi, call the police

315
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,120
A Ming

316
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,720
Master Qin, no need to blow it up, right?

317
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,720
Ah, no no no

318
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,120
Bro, my taste buds must've been off just now

319
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,040
I'll check, I... I'll check again

320
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,120
You're destroying evidence

321
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,920
Zheng Nanfeng

322
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,000
Just you wait

323
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,320
Hey, hey, hey

324
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,840
Extorting, huh? Extorting

325
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,240
Hey

326
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,520
Your boss has left, and you're still pretending

327
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,400
You caught me

328
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,400
Wow, I'm so smart!

329
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,800
Boss, wait for me!

330
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,520
Sorry to kill the mood, everyone

331
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,560
Everyone, keep playing, keep drinking

332
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,600
One bottle for each table

333
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,160
Cue the music

334
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,320
I have never been this exhilarated

335
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,400
Zheng Nanfeng, you're something else

336
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,120
You set all of this up, didn't you?

337
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,240
It's our opening day, after all

338
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,200
Xie Jiachang will definitely come make trouble

339
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,840
So what we do is lure him into the trap

340
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,720
Nanfeng

341
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,960
You sent invites and kept the codes recorded

342
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,440
And you even pulled Master Qin in

343
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,120
This combo of moves you pulled...

344
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,920
I'm impressed

345
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,920
I'm thoroughly convinced

346
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,240
I told you bringing Xie Jiachang would cause trouble

347
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,000
Even if you fix it, what can you do to him?

348
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,120
This is just the first step

349
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,360
Didn't I tell you?

350
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,600
One month

351
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,280
I'll make him go out of business

352
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,640
Come on

353
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,000
For our opening today,

354
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,720
A toast to beating Xie Jiachang!

355
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,920
Cheers, cheers, cheers!

356
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,000
Ah!

357
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,520
Another glass

358
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,920
Ah!

359
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,920
Ah!

360
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,720
Okay

361
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,600
You can really hold your liquor

362
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,320
Feels great

363
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,440
Another glass

364
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,920
I'm happy today

365
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,720
Sister Zhiyi, another glass

366
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,920
Come on

367
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,720
I'll down it

368
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,960
Hey

369
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,000
Zheng Nanfeng, you're incredible

370
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,800
I...

371
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,760
Don't move

372
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,440
I feel like it's all in your plan

373
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,120
Let's have another drink

374
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,960
I really can't drink anymore

375
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,640
Rest well

376
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,600
I miss you

377
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,520
Whenever dusk falls

378
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,400
The evening breeze starts to blow

379
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,240
I miss you

380
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,240
Life's riddle

381
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,360
Try not to see it clearly

382
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,760
Close your eyes

383
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,960
Don't respond

384
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,960
The evening wind blows and blows

385
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,640
Go with the wind

386
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,080
Tonight, children, don't cry in secret

387
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,240
Don't cry in secret

388
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,080
The evening wind blows and blows

389
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,760
Go with the wind

390
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,920
As night falls with the stars,

391
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,920
Drift gently to sleep

392
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,360
Feel the evening breeze
