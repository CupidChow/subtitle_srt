1
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,320
Mom, I'm scared

2
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,040
I'm telling you all

3
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,640
We are Yida Real Estate

4
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,520
Our boss is Zheng Nanfeng

5
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,800
If any of you refuse to cooperate with relocation

6
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,440
I'll make you pay dearly

7
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,480
Go

8
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,720
Today's task

9
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,800
All holdouts

10
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,400
Must be won over

11
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,480
Yes

12
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,520
Open up, anyone?

13
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,240
You... you... like this...

14
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,160
Fine

15
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Are you kidding me?

16
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:58,720
Hello, sir

17
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,680
I'm Zheng Nanfeng

18
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,320
You're here for relocation, right?

19
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:02,720
Yes

20
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,880
I represent Yida Real Estate

21
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,920
Here to discuss relocation matters

22
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,440
Go, all of you, go

23
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,720
I won't move even if I die

24
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,720
Hey, hey, hey

25
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,600
Uncle, we're from Yida Real Estate

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,760
Hey, hey

27
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,320
Sorry

28
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,320
Get lost, now!

29
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,120
What are you doing?

30
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,520
Don't, don't

31
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,920
Don't be so aggressive

32
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,640
Nanfeng

33
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,480
As soon as they hear we're Yida Real Estate

34
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,520
They refuse to discuss anything

35
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,600
They just kick us out

36
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,000
We didn't do anything

37
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,680
It is a bit strange

38
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,360
Let's go ask the village chief

39
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,160
Let's go

40
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,720
Forced demolition

41
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,120
It wasn't me

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,000
Village chief

43
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,840
We only arrived today

44
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,400
How could anyone...

45
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
have come yesterday to force a demolition?

46
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,120
Yeah

47
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,320
No matter what you say

48
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,120
It was definitely your people yesterday

49
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,120
who threatened them

50
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,520
Otherwise they wouldn't be

51
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,000
treating you with this attitude

52
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,920
It must be Xie Rong and her people

53
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,800
Village chief

54
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,680
I, Zheng Nanfeng, guarantee this on my honor

55
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,640
The three of us came today

56
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,240
to discuss with everyone

57
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,920
the relocation compensation matter

58
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,600
Forced demolition has nothing to do with us

59
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,320
Of course, you can choose not to believe

60
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,480
But commercial housing construction

61
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,840
is a national development trend

62
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,200
We can't let the village's growth stall

63
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,480
Exactly

64
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,040
Go to the west end of the village and find Uncle Miao

65
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,520
He's the Miao family's patriarch

66
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,680
and the head of these holdouts

67
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,880
If you can persuade him

68
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,400
the others will agree

69
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,000
But I have to warn you first

70
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,840
Uncle Miao has a very odd temper

71
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,240
You should be careful

72
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,120
Feng, this is it

73
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,160
Uncle Miao

74
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,680
Uncle Miao

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,800
Uncle Miao

76
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
Who are you looking for?

77
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,920
Uncle Miao, I'm Zheng Nanfeng from Yida Real Estate

78
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,120
Zheng Nanfeng, right?

79
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,720
Get lost

80
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,240
This old man...

81
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,720
Uncle, we're a legitimate company

82
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,880
Our company's relocation compensation is approved

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,840
It's over 100,000

84
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,240
You little punks

85
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,840
Ganging up to mess with people, huh?

86
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,400
I'll risk my old life; I won't let you succeed

87
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,640
Let alone over 100,000

88
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,280
Even 10,000,000 or 100,000,000, I won't agree

89
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,320
Wait, Uncle

90
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,400
Get lost, or I'll stab you to death

91
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,440
How did it go?

92
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,640
No go, huh?

93
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,080
I knew it wouldn't work.

94
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,480
They'll kick us out for sure.

95
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,840
It's already good we didn't even hit him.

96
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,360
You can't handle such an ordinary holdout.

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,200
You think I came today to negotiate with him?

98
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,880
Take a look.

99
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,520
What do you mean?

100
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,680
Didn't you see?

101
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,720
Are the ornaments here all related to Feng Shui?

102
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,920
What does that tell you?

103
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,880
It means he believes in Feng Shui.

104
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,720
Oh.

105
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,240
So?

106
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,600
Whoa, Master.

107
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,800
Make way, make way.

108
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,840
Master, slow down.

109
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,000
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,800
Watch your step.

111
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,880
Master, slow down, okay.

112
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,440
This spot has an open frontage.

113
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,640
Sacred mountains guard both sides.

114
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,560
Good place.

115
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,840
If you plan to develop this area,

116
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,600
Dig a channel here.

117
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,480
It must have a bend.

118
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,320
The inlet should be big.

119
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,280
The outlet should be small.

120
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,680
Two channels here

121
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,320
converge into a vortex.

122
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,920
This is the Hanging Water Treasure Basin.

123
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Guarantees you'll make money hand over fist.

124
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,880
Well then, Master,

125
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,440
Where should this bend be dug?

126
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,800
Have the two channels form an angle.

127
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,080
That way its sha energy will shoot straight to...

128
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,840
May I ask,

129
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,960
can people live here?

130
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,680
Master.

131
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,120
This is Uncle Miao's house.

132
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,240
And this is my house.

133
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,520
Will the layout you just mentioned affect our home?

134
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,800
Hey, Uncle Miao,

135
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,920
You can't disrupt the Master's work.

136
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,240
Meeting is fate.

137
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,720
I'll also take a look for Uncle Miao.

138
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,520
Ah.

139
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,280
This guy does Feng Shui.

140
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:58,960
Darn it

141
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,760
Master

142
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,520
As for this,

143
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,720
I can't deal with it

144
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,920
Is our home's Feng Shui bad?

145
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,840
Sir, your home's Feng Shui is excellent

146
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,080
It could keep you living to one hundred

147
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,280
But with the demolition around you,

148
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,640
it broke your whole setup

149
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,680
Then what should we do?

150
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,640
Now that it's come to this,

151
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,440
Take my advice,

152
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,440
Move out

153
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,480
Ah, moving means a loss

154
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,720
That's over a hundred thousand

155
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,720
Oh

156
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,680
So you teamed up to scam me

157
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,080
I knew you had bad intentions

158
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,240
Get lost!

159
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,040
Oh, oh, oh!

160
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,040
Master

161
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,680
Uncle Miao doesn't know how to talk

162
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,520
Please don't take it to heart

163
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,040
Act

164
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,920
Keep acting

165
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,600
No problem

166
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,520
It's human nature

167
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,040
Well, with this kind of thing,

168
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,280
It works if you believe

169
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,200
Ah

170
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,120
Sir,

171
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,400
Have you been dizzy and feverish lately?

172
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,080
You often have nightmares at night

173
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,440
Your health is much worse than before

174
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,520
How do you know about that?

175
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,520
This is the Feng Shui around you shifting,

176
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,720
and it shows on you as a result

177
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,840
This can't be solved just by moving out

178
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,440
Master, that's exactly my situation right now

179
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,440
Can you find a way to break it?

180
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,120
Sure, sure

181
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,240
Come, sir

182
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,720
Look at your doorway

183
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,120
Follow me

184
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,720
Oh no

185
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,720
Xie Rong

186
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,720
Xie Rong

187
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,880
Oh no

188
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,120
Uncle Miao is about to sign a contract with Zheng Nanfeng

189
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,240
Impossible

190
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,840
How did he change Uncle Miao's mind so fast?

191
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,920
They seem to have brought in some master

192
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,920
Said there's a problem with the Feng Shui at Uncle Miao's home

193
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,880
Told him to move out right away

194
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,720
Uncle Miao really believes in that

195
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,720
Feng Shui Master

196
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,400
Mm

197
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,320
Checking Feng Shui

198
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,080
This guy has some skills

199
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,640
He thought along the same lines as me

200
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,520
Xie Rong

201
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,520
So what should we do next?

202
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
Sir, you're almost here, right?

203
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,680
Okay

204
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,880
We have been waiting for you for a long time

205
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,840
Xie Rong

206
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,320
You were prepared in advance

207
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,640
Who is impersonating the master?

208
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,240
Warriors, assemble before me!

209
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,840
Burning Cloud

210
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,040
Split Sky-Piercing Assault of the Nine Bends

211
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,280
Five Elements Sha Neutralization

212
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,280
Elder

213
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,360
This blocks your home's nine-bend incoming water

214
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,480
and the Sha energy in the middle

215
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,120
I have broken it for you

216
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,120
This is the Black Dragon King from the port city

217
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,920
Master Ma

218
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,600
What are you waiting for?

219
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,720
Kneel and bow!

220
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,120
You are the Black Dragon King

221
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,240
Thank you, Black Dragon King

222
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:57,720
Thank you, Divine One

223
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,320
Thank you, Divine One

224
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,680
Please save me

225
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,520
Darn it

226
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,080
Xie Rong sent a real Master to wreck the place

227
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,200
But why have I never heard of such a person?

228
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,480
We have not heard of him either

229
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,200
Recently, two con artists came to Haicheng

230
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,640
Posing as Feng Shui experts to swindle people

231
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,040
Everyone, keep your eyes open

232
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:22,760
Scammers!

233
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,640
Do not lightly believe their words

234
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,520
Losing money is minor

235
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,120
If the Feng Shui is ruined, your life will be short

236
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,240
You two scammers

237
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,320
Get out, now

238
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
Go!

239
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,120
So you are the Black Dragon King?

240
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,920
My formation follows Dao and nature

241
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,400
It is granted by Heaven and Earth

242
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,400
Not something you can break just by declaring it

243
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,120
This Black Dragon King's Burning Cloud

244
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,320
will backfire

245
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,920
This miasma is the backlash

246
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,760
This backlash will not only snuff out divine guardians

247
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,720
In the end

248
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,600
it will slowly move onto humans

249
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,720
Darn you

250
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,040
You are lying

251
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,240
Time is pressing

252
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,640
We must remove it at once

253
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,240
Move aside

254
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,640
Break!

255
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,640
Uncle Miao, look again

256
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,280
The miasma the Black Dragon King summoned

257
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,920
I have already removed it for you

258
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,880
You brats dare to spout wild boasts

259
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,120
Do you dare to battle me?

260
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,440
Spare me your petty little tricks

261
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,400
I advise you

262
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,040
Go back where you came from

263
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,960
I miss you

264
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,880
Whenever dusk falls

265
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,760
the night breeze rises

266
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,600
I miss you

267
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,600
the answer to life's riddle

268
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,720
Try not to look too closely

269
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,120
Close your eyes

270
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,320
Do not respond

271
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,320
The night breeze blows and blows

272
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,000
Go with the wind

273
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,440
Tonight, children, do not cry in secret

274
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,600
Do not cry in secret

275
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,440
The night breeze blows and blows

276
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,120
Go with the wind

277
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,280
As night falls with stars

278
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,280
Gently fall asleep

279
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,720
Blow, night breeze
