1
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,280
Just tear it down, just like that

2
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,560
They haven't even said how much compensation

3
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,680
They're trying to rip us off

4
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,440
Yeah, never mind the compensation

5
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,560
Where will I live after it's torn down

6
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,080
No demolition, absolutely no demolition

7
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,680
No demolition, absolutely no demolition

8
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,640
No demolition, no demolition

9
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,560
Absolutely no demolition

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,720
Fellow villagers

11
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,280
I am Zheng Nanfeng from Yida Real Estate

12
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,280
Today, I'll be the one

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,880
to host this relocation mobilization meeting

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,160
We're living just fine

15
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:11,960
Why demolish anything

16
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,720
You suddenly tell us to demolish

17
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,320
Why should we

18
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,720
No demolition, no demolition, no demolition

19
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,240
No demolition

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,360
I fully understand how everyone feels

21
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,120
After all, you've lived here for almost a lifetime

22
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,480
Suddenly you're told to relocate

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,120
It's natural to feel uneasy

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,480
So today's relocation mobilization meeting

25
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,960
is to show everyone

26
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,680
our sincerity at Yida Real Estate

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,080
Wow

28
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,480
That's so much money

29
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,320
Our compensation is the highest in the city

30
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,480
Second to none

31
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,040
Having money makes you so great, huh

32
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,240
That little cash would barely buy off a beggar

33
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,520
Tearing it down isn't out of the question

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,560
The key is, after it's demolished

35
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,840
Where do we live

36
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,680
Cut the crap, this money isn't enough

37
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,280
If the money isn't in place

38
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,240
we can't possibly move

39
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,680
We won't move

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,480
We won't move, we won't move

41
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,760
We won't move, absolutely won't move

42
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,840
Hey, everyone, keep calm

43
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,440
These two spoke very well

44
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,080
Compensation is very important

45
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,880
But where to live after demolition is even more important

46
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,960
Our Yida Group's Phase One model home

47
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,880
I can guarantee

48
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,000
Compared to where you live now

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,800
it's at least a hundred times better

50
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,680
Pfft

51
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,640
Nothing but bragging

52
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,280
Who would say their own stuff is bad

53
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,080
Oh, you don't believe me, huh

54
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,320
No problem

55
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,080
I'll open your eyes

56
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,320
I'll show you what your new home looks like

57
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,640
Follow me

58
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,160
Come on, come, come

59
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,960
Everyone, come in

60
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,200
Take a look at your new home

61
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,880
Folks, this is Yida Group's Modern Residence 2.0

62
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,160
It offers extra-large space

63
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,080
With a well-planned layout

64
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,040
Built for comfort

65
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,720
Every appliance you need is included

66
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,280
So you never have to step outside

67
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,160
To enjoy an easy, pleasant life

68
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,360
The sofa's really comfy

69
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,080
Why is the TV even mounted on the wall

70
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,440
I've seen this AC before

71
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,080
Folks, you think that's it

72
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,920
These are just our basic features

73
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,960
Let me ask you all a question

74
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,160
In the countryside, is it cold to use the toilet at night

75
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,640
Do your legs go numb from the cold

76
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,640
Numb, yeah

77
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,960
See? Numb, exactly

78
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,080
With this smart toilet

79
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,680
You'll never freeze in winter again

80
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,080
You can go right inside the house

81
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,360
The key is:

82
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,680
There's a simple little button

83
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,480
Press once and it flushes automatically

84
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,480
It self-cleans

85
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,920
Clean and hygienic

86
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,160
You think that's it

87
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,640
Look what's over here

88
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,480
Big living room, bright kitchen and bathroom

89
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,520
Folks,

90
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,080
Do you know what this means

91
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,280
You're already top-tier successes

92
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,080
When relatives and friends come to visit

93
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,760
They'll see how grand this mansion is

94
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,560
And how much status it gives you

95
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,840
As long as you want

96
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,320
Each family can move in with bags in hand

97
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,600
Is everything you said true

98
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,080
It's true

99
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,400
We at Yida Real Estate do business

100
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,680
And we lead with integrity

101
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,160
Anyone who agrees to relocation today

102
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,360
Gets special perks

103
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,720
Anyone who signs a contract today

104
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,320
Gets a brand-new big color TV shipped free to your home

105
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,280
Sign

106
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,280
Everyone, stay where you are

107
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,080
Director, do you have any other questions

108
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,960
As the director

109
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:58,880
I'll sign first

110
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,320
Alright, great

111
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
They all signed

112
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,920
Every last one

113
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,280
And many more signed a Booking form

114
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,880
I've never seen anything like this

115
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,280
They're acting like they're crazy

116
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,040
I'm beat

117
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,480
Alright, we've fired our first shot

118
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,440
A great opening

119
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,080
Rumeng, go get things ready

120
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,840
Tonight let's celebrate at Xin Wenqing

121
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,640
Okay

122
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,480
What's wrong? Why the long face

123
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,080
Renovation purchases

124
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,680
Plus the huge upfront outlay

125
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,080
I just did a rough estimate

126
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,360
Our reserves plus the loan Rumeng secured

127
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,440
Are still nowhere near enough to take us to the finish

128
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,920
I'm worried we'll end up with an unfinished building

129
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,640
Unless

130
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,480
We slash the renovation budget

131
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,280
No

132
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,320
The villagers agreed to relocate

133
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,760
Buyers are willing to sign a Booking form

134
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,920
That's because they like our design and quality

135
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,840
If you cut the budget, who'd buy

136
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,080
Then how about I make another trip to Shengang

137
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,280
This time the funding need is enormous

138
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,960
A loan alone won't solve it

139
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,040
What if we don't need that much money at all

140
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,840
Huh

141
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,080
What if before we start building

142
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,480
We sell all the units

143
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,320
Are you kidding

144
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,320
Selling ten percent before breaking ground

145
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,400
Is already great

146
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,880
And our price is so high

147
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,880
It's impossible

148
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,280
Once relocation finishes, we launch sales

149
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,680
We’ll get every TV station in Haicheng

150
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,920
Plus radio and newspapers to come

151
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,120
I'm worried the louder the buzz

152
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,680
Buyers won't be able to come up with the money

153
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,280
Actual closings won't rise

154
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,280
And we'll fail at the last step

155
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,440
Relax

156
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,120
On opening day

157
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,280
Is when we recoup our cash flow

158
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,800
Where is everyone?

159
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,240
Where did everyone from the company go?

160
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,320
Boss Xie, I...

161
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,920
I want customers.

162
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,320
Who wants to see you standing here?

163
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,320
Sister Rong.

164
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,760
Ever since Zheng Nanfeng launched Modern Residence 2.0,

165
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,040
Everyone who could buy a home stopped buying.

166
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,920
They’re all waiting for Yida Real Estate’s homes.

167
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,680
Modern Residence

168
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,480
Let’s go take a look.

169
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,040
You could consider it.

170
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,680
This property definitely has room to appreciate.

171
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,080
And ours are all fully finished.

172
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,680
I’ll take a look.

173
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,760
Look, our place is really great

174
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,520
Sister Rong

175
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,800
Zheng Nanfeng is making quite a splash this time

176
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,280
The design is indeed good

177
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,240
But at this build cost

178
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,280
it is at least 1,500 yuan per square meter

179
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,360
How many people can afford that

180
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,360
Hello, everyone

181
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,560
I am Zheng Nanfeng from Yida Real Estate

182
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,040
I believe everyone

183
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,360
already has some understanding of our homes

184
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,480
Today we will officially announce

185
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,680
what everyone cares about most

186
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,920
the sales price of our Yida Modern Residence 2.0

187
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,720
Our official price is

188
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,840
2,000 yuan per square meter

189
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,680
Mr. Zheng

190
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,720
Your place is 2,000 yuan a square meter

191
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,960
A 100-square-meter unit

192
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,280
comes to a bit over 200,000 yuan

193
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,280
How many people can come up with that much cash

194
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,880
This place is too expensive

195
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,280
I did not expect it to be this pricey

196
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,080
Sister Rong, you really nailed it

197
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,920
I will fan the flames in a bit

198
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,120
The place is nice

199
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,160
but we cannot afford it

200
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,080
We will just window-shop

201
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,880
Let us just go

202
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,360
I heard

203
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,160
Yida Real Estate has a cash flow shortage

204
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,080
and is about to go bankrupt

205
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,160
Be careful, everyone

206
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,560
Do not end up with an unfinished building

207
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
Nonsense

208
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,560
Everyone, do not listen to this guy

209
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,000
Ajie

210
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,440
You came to make trouble on purpose, huh

211
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,840
You two, get out

212
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,720
You are not welcome here

213
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,920
Mr. Zheng

214
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,960
Did I hit a sore spot

215
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,280
and now you are desperate

216
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,080
Boss Xie, what do you mean by that

217
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,920
With Yida Real Estate's build standards

218
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,040
this project needs at least

219
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,600
50 million yuan in construction funds

220
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,240
But as far as I know

221
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,120
Yida Group's assets

222
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,120
are only 5 million yuan

223
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,320
Using 5 million yuan to leverage a 50 million yuan deal—

224
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,440
if the units do not sell

225
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
aside from becoming an unfinished building

226
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,480
what other outcome is there

227
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,360
Boss Xie makes a very good point

228
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,840
Let me ask everyone a question

229
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,320
Our homes

230
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,120
at 2,000 yuan per square meter

231
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,480
are they worth it

232
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,120
They are good

233
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,000
but where do we get that much money

234
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,160
And besides, we fear an unfinished building

235
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,680
What if someone lends you the money

236
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,760
Our company has teamed up with Haicheng Bank

237
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,520
and starting today

238
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,600
we officially launch mortgage loan home buying

239
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,040
You only need to pay ten percent

240
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,920
that is, 20,000 yuan to move into your new home

241
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,960
The rest is repaid to the bank over 30 years

242
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,560
Sister Rong, is this not what you said before—

243
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,640
that popular overseas mortgage model

244
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,880
This guy actually beat us to it

245
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,080
Pay it back slowly over 30 years

246
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,480
20,000 and you can get such a nice place

247
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,880
That is the down payment

248
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,280
There is a deal this good

249
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,440
Where would you find such a good deal

250
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,120
Better be cautious

251
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,360
This way, please

252
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,080
What is a mortgage

253
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,040
Hello, everyone

254
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,640
I am Director Zhang from Haicheng Bank's credit department

255
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,680
Yida Plaza

256
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,280
is our bank's

257
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,640
first real estate loan project

258
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,640
Please rest assured

259
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,720
our bank will oversee Yida Real Estate throughout

260
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,480
striving to do it in the shortest time

261
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,480
to get everyone into the best homes

262
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,440
Okay

263
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,680
Master Qin

264
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
More people again

265
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,480
Master Qin is here

266
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,960
Your place is really lively

267
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,040
Today, I

268
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,280
came to catch up with this mortgage trend

269
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,280
Nanfeng

270
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,680
This idea of yours is good

271
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,240
Partner with the bank for mortgage loans to buy homes

272
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,080
The profit is more than tenfold, right?

273
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,720
You're too kind

274
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,040
Today I came to show my support

275
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,080
Full payment

276
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,880
Two units

277
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,360
This way in, Master Qin

278
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,160
Two units, two units

279
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,080
A Ming, A Qiang

280
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,920
Isn't that Master Qin?

281
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,480
Even the Land King of Haicheng came to buy

282
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,160
Definitely no problem

283
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,920
You can keep watching

284
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,320
I'm going to pay now

285
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,480
Paying now

286
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,280
I'll pay first

287
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,480
Line up, line up

288
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,920
Boss Zheng, going pretty smoothly, huh

289
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,480
Many thanks to Boss Xie for the support

290
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,360
Don't rush

291
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,280
Who will win is still unknown

292
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,720
Just wait and see

293
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,360
Aren't you buying one?

294
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,160
With this mortgage loan scheme of theirs,

295
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,480
they not only solved the funding shortage,

296
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,160
they also completely won over Master Qin

297
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,040
And Zheng Nanfeng also announced

298
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,040
the first unit in their development

299
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,960
will be delivered to Master Qin

300
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,680
This Zheng Nanfeng is ahead of me at every step

301
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,160
Could he also be back from overseas?

302
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,760
Sis

303
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,320
We need to come up with a plan

304
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,480
It seems

305
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,200
we need to hit him harder

306
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,600
Boss Xie

307
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,480
You're in real estate development

308
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,920
I'm in the shady business

309
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,480
Between us, one black and one white,

310
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,280
there is still room to cooperate

311
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,520
Brother Ming's strength is known to all in Haicheng

312
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,520
Little sister has a favor to ask today

313
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,880
I wonder if Brother Ming has heard of

314
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,080
Zheng Nanfeng

315
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
Knowing him now

316
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,560
is still not too late

317
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,080
I miss you

318
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,000
Whenever dusk falls,

319
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,880
the evening breeze rises,

320
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,720
I miss you

321
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,720
life's riddle,

322
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,840
try not to see it clearly

323
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,240
Close your eyes,

324
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,440
Don't respond

325
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,440
The night wind blows and blows,

326
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,120
go with the wind

327
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,560
Tonight, children, don't cry in secret

328
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,720
Don't cry in secret

329
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,560
The night wind blows and blows,

330
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,240
go with the wind

331
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,400
As night falls with stars,

332
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,400
drift gently to sleep

333
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,840
Feel the evening breeze
