1
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,000
Easy, easy

2
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,280
Ow, ow, ow

3
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,160
Bear it a bit

4
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
I'll do it myself

5
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,400
Don't move

6
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,600
This little injury is nothing

7
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,120
For those two sisters

8
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,760
You'll even risk your life, huh?

9
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,200
Mainly to defeat Xie Jiachang

10
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,280
What's second then?

11
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,560
Serves you right to hurt like hell

12
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,160
Hey, I almost got beaten to death

13
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,360
No one even cared about me

14
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,760
You two are still there...

15
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,760
Ah!

16
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,920
Brother Feng, hurry out

17
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,960
Outside is packed; they're all here for you

18
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,200
A Qiang

19
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,400
I'm badly hurt too

20
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,160
Could you wipe me down too?

21
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,080
Okay, okay, come here

22
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,200
I'll wipe it for you properly

23
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,680
Ow, ow, it hurts, hurts, hurts!

24
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,720
Mr. Zheng, please take care of us

25
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,560
Here's my business card

26
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,200
Enjoy yourselves, have some drinks

27
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,120
Thank you, Mr. Zheng

28
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,600
Ms. Zhou

29
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,920
Is this Manager Zheng?

30
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,400
Mm

31
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,000
As expected, a promising young talent

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,400
We must definitely work together

33
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,880
Absolutely, absolutely

34
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,400
Mr. Zheng, Mr. Zheng

35
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,720
Hey, hey

36
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,360
Ah!

37
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,080
Sister Zhiyi

38
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,080
It's just over half an hour

39
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,040
We're already on the 13th wave of people

40
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,280
Doing toasts and handing cards

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,880
Is Brother Feng raising his banner?

42
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,480
Raise a banner, my ass

43
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,280
You think he's a gangster legend?

44
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,800
He got truly famous from that dance hall fight

45
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,320
Remember the night Xie Jiachang's club closed

46
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,560
What did Master Qin say?

47
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,120
One word from Master Qin makes a huge stir

48
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,400
What's his background, anyway?

49
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,200
How do you think he became

50
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,800
the president of the Haicheng Chamber of Commerce?

51
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,520
He's nicknamed the Land King of Haicheng

52
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,400
In Haicheng, no one dares contradict him

53
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,800
More importantly, he reads people perfectly

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,520
But saying stuff like 'change Haicheng's fate'

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,200
He was the first

56
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,600
Then he really misjudged, huh

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,360
I don't care at all

58
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,720
Then what do you care about?

59
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,120
Xie Jiachang is already in prison

60
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,200
The only thing I care about now

61
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,320
is to live peacefully with you

62
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,560
for the rest of my life

63
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,480
Boss Zheng

64
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,480
Come down for a drink

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,760
I can't handle it

66
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,560
Can you cover me for a bit?

67
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,320
Uh...

68
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,800
I'm going to the restroom

69
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,080
I can't cover

70
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,520
My injury isn't healed

71
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,600
Mm

72
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,720
A business card, right?

73
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,000
I can't take it right now

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,800
Just put it there

75
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,120
Our boss would like to invite you for tea

76
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,560
Please come with us

77
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,200
Huh?

78
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,200
So it's not a business card

79
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,360
Okay

80
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,680
I'll come over myself later

81
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,000
Master Qin

82
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,000
How come you don't recognize me?

83
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
You made quite a show inviting me over

84
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,400
If I hadn't seen you

85
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,720
I'd have thought I was kidnapped

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,960
Didn't I tell you to invite him over?

87
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,920
Isn't this how we always do it?

88
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,200
Go down

89
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,680
My men were a bit rash

90
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,560
Please don't take offense

91
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,400
Come, sit, sit, sit

92
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,800
In your early twenties

93
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,400
No people

94
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,680
No money

95
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,480
In less than a month

96
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,920
you brought down Xie Jiachang's dance hall

97
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,880
The young are formidable

98
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,320
Master Qin, you flatter me

99
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,120
Just luck

100
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,680
You don't need to be modest

101
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,160
Young people are full of fire

102
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,200
You should have some drive

103
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,000
And a bit of pride

104
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,960
Master Qin, you called me here today

105
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,800
Is there something you want to advise me on?

106
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,760
Then I'll keep it brief

107
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,360
Please, go ahead

108
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,320
You have ability

109
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,560
Brave and resourceful

110
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,920
I have high hopes for you

111
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,520
So I want to bring you

112
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,360
to do bigger business

113
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,520
Business

114
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
What business?

115
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,360
Do you know, in Haicheng,

116
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,760
I have a title?

117
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,680
You are the Land King of Haicheng

118
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,800
You aren't trying to rope me into real estate, are you?

119
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,360
Yes

120
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,280
To do real estate

121
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,880
You have ability

122
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,160
Brave and resourceful

123
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,160
So partnering with you

124
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,880
puts me at ease

125
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,480
Master Qin

126
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,400
You actually want to use me

127
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,480
to counterbalance the forces in Haicheng, right?

128
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,000
You're very smart

129
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,280
As the chairman of the Haicheng Chamber of Commerce

130
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,800
I must balance relations in Haicheng's business world

131
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,160
I can't let one group dominate

132
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,960
Master Qin

133
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,040
I forgot to tell you something

134
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,520
I'm with Zhou Zhiyi now

135
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,280
Oh, that's great

136
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,360
Xie Jiachang is already in jail

137
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,200
I just want to live a good life with Zhou Zhiyi now

138
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,360
Maybe we should just call this off

139
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,320
Master Qin

140
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,720
Xie Rong

141
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,600
Long time no see

142
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,280
How's your health?

143
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,800
Pretty good, pretty good

144
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,600
Have a seat

145
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,440
Let me introduce you

146
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,520
This is...

147
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,840
the general manager of the New Literati Club, Zheng Nanfeng

148
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,920
And this is...

149
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,920
is Xie Jiachang's biological older sister

150
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,760
Xie Rong

151
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,480
She has been doing business overseas for years

152
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,600
What, are you surprised?

153
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,320
I heard a real talent has emerged in Haicheng

154
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,680
In less than a month

155
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,680
and wrecked my brother's dance hall

156
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,400
and even sent him to prison

157
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,600
Oh

158
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,920
He brought that on himself

159
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,080
You're not here to seek revenge on me, are you?

160
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,040
My little brother...

161
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,680
was spoiled by us since childhood

162
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,280
He does behave rather wildly

163
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,680
He lost to you

164
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,200
because his skills were inferior

165
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,080
He has no one else to blame

166
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,680
Master Qin, I heard you're getting into real estate

167
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,160
I came back this time to work with you

168
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,600
Sure

169
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,960
As long as you have the talent and ability,

170
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,040
my door for cooperation is always open

171
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,680
By the way, I'd like to compete with GM Zheng

172
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,560
Oh

173
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,760
Don't overthink it

174
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,640
It has nothing to do with revenge

175
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,280
I'm just simply curious about you

176
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,240
Mm

177
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,840
I've already told Master Qin

178
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,840
I'm not interested in real estate; I won't take part

179
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,640
Ah

180
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,040
That's a pity

181
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,880
A pity to lose such a good opponent

182
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,760
But if you won't spar

183
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,880
I'll have to make my move at Zhou Zhiyi

184
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,960
See if she's interested

185
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,280
Zhou Zhiyi is my wife

186
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,360
If you dare go after her,

187
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,480
I don't care whether you're a woman or not,

188
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,360
I'm talking about business

189
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,560
Why are you getting worked up?

190
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,720
Master Qin

191
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,800
There are four areas in Haicheng awaiting development now

192
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,440
The best is Dongyang Xincun

193
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,600
It's close to the hospital and school

194
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,480
It's a sure-profit piece of land

195
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,000
The worst is Xiliu Tang

196
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,040
Demolition costs are high in the old city

197
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,480
The location is also poor

198
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,560
It has already scared off four waves of big firms

199
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,880
Near Dongyang Xincun,

200
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,840
a mysterious investor has appeared lately

201
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,880
Moves fast, precise, and ruthless

202
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,960
If I'm not mistaken,

203
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,880
it's you, right?

204
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,840
Master Qin

205
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,960
Since we're already rivals,

206
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,440
then I have to spar with Ms. Xie here

207
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,440
Good

208
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,560
Competition brings motivation

209
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,680
As it happens, I have a problem over at Dongyang Xincun

210
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,400
A few holdout households aren't resolved in demolition

211
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,640
Which of you can handle him?

212
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,440
the Dongyang Xincun plot goes to whoever does

213
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,360
Are you sure you want to go in?

214
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,680
I can't even afford underwear in this shop.

215
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,280
This is the priciest store in all Haicheng.

216
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,920
We’re about to switch camps.

217
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,280
There’s a tough battle to fight.

218
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,800
Before that, let’s spruce ourselves up.

219
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,840
Brother Feng has already spoken.

220
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,200
What are you dawdling for? Get in.

221
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,680
Hey, do we need to wear a tie to go in?

222
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,880
Are you guys wearing ties?

223
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,600
Sir, you can only try if you’re going to buy.

224
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,640
I’m here to buy clothes.

225
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,160
Our suits start at 1,999 yuan each.

226
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,280
So cheap.

227
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,440
We don’t buy ones that cheap.

228
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,680
Oh my, listen to you.

229
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,760
I didn’t mean that.

230
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,640
Which one caught your eye?

231
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,440
I’ll get it for you.

232
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,280
Today it’s on me, pick whatever you like.

233
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,800
Brother Feng.

234
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,760
You said it.

235
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,880
Then I won’t hold back.

236
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,200
Assistant.

237
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,640
Bring out all the smallest sizes, I’ll try them all.

238
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,440
Okay, okay.

239
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,360
Wrap them all up.

240
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,080
Scan the code.

241
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,000
Sir.

242
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,880
Scan what code?

243
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,880
No.

244
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,720
I forgot this era has no codes.

245
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,680
Um, uh.

246
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,400
Brother Feng.

247
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,080
Don’t tell me you didn’t bring money.

248
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,480
Ha, you guessed right.

249
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,640
How about this, you two pay first.

250
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,560
I’ll pay you back later.

251
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,600
See, I told you.

252
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,200
He can’t even afford underwear here, and you doubted me.

253
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,360
How much is it in total?

254
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,880
9,400.

255
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,280
Pay up.

256
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,280
Pay up.

257
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,120
I...

258
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,480
Socks, socks.

259
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,840
This is all I’ve got.

260
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,800
A total of 164 yuan and 3 jiao.

261
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,880
You lot.

262
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,640
I knew you were off the moment you walked in.

263
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,080
No money, yet you pretend to be big shots?

264
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,000
We’re not broke.

265
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,640
We just didn’t bring it.

266
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,200
Ah.

267
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
Alright then, leave the clothes here.

268
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,240
I’ll go back and get the money.

269
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,400
We’ll come back later to pick them up.

270
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,840
Are you just here to mess with me?

271
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,040
If you don’t have money, don’t try them.

272
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,480
These are brand-name clothes.

273
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,880
You keep lifting and handling them.

274
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,480
If they get dirty, how do we sell them?

275
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,040
Hey, how can you talk like that?

276
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,360
Are your clothes so precious?

277
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,280
They get dirty from just trying?

278
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,160
You’re trying to scam us, right?

279
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,400
Hey, how can you be so uncivil?

280
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,480
The poorer you are, the more shameless.

281
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,600
Hey!

282
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,880
He called me shameless!

283
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,480
Who has no manners?

284
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,400
I’ll show you what no manners looks like.

285
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,200
Do you want to see?

286
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,200
Hey, hey, sorry, sorry.

287
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,200
Sorry about that.

288
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,080
No, no.

289
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,600
This won’t do, this won’t do.

290
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,200
Yo.

291
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,240
Sis, you’re here.

292
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,640
It’s quite lively today.

293
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,280
Sis, let’s stay away from those poor wretches.

294
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,200
They try but can’t afford it, honestly.

295
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,560
Ah.

296
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,280
Mm, yes.

297
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,560
The one in front really...

298
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,880
looks sneaky and shifty.

299
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,080
If you’re going to talk, just talk.

300
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,240
Why make it personal?

301
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,880
You should just hurry up and leave.

302
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,080
Don’t be an eyesore to my sis.

303
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,680
It’s fine.

304
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,600
We’ll do our own shopping.

305
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,200
Come, sis, over here.

306
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,200
Nanfeng

307
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,360
What's Zhiyi trying to do?

308
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,560
Don't rush

309
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,000
Let's see what she plans to do

310
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,680
Sis, you look great in all of these

311
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,240
Alright, I'll buy these today

312
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,000
Alright

313
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,400
Please get your manager over here

314
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,960
I'm buying a lot today

315
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Ask him to give me a discount

316
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,760
Alright

317
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,560
Ma'am, we'll give you five percent off

318
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,880
Thank you

319
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,360
Please wrap these and those up

320
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,480
Ma'am, these are those beggars' clothes

321
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,640
Please don't take the wrong ones

322
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,480
Why are you all still not leaving?

323
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,920
Do you have to wait till I call the police?

324
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,080
I didn't take the wrong ones

325
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,200
They're all mine

326
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,400
Why are you standing there? Go

327
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,200
Oh, okay

328
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,000
Darling, remember to bring your wallet when you go out

329
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,040
Oh, my brother-in-law picked it

330
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,440
I knew it

331
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,080
Such good taste, haha

332
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,280
Hey, who just said he was a stinking beggar?

333
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,480
How come now he has good taste?

334
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,280
Brother, I did not recognize your greatness

335
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,880
Please don't blame your little sister

336
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,080
Okay, enough

337
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,200
Ring it up

338
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,680
Alright

339
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,680
All packed

340
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,440
After five percent off

341
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,880
The total is 16,500

342
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,520
Buying so much at once, and the priciest too

343
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,680
My commission this month will top 1,000

344
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,960
No need for a discount

345
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,400
Ma'am

346
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,360
The manager already said

347
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,480
We can give five percent off

348
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,640
I said no need

349
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,560
But I have one request

350
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,920
Please go ahead, ma'am

351
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,080
Fire her

352
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,840
Ma'am, you must be joking, right?

353
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,880
You sell in a high-end place like this

354
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,440
You must get a lot of commission

355
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,840
But someone like you who snubs the poor and fawns over the rich

356
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,640
Does not deserve to earn my money

357
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,880
You think you can fire me just like that?

358
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,880
Manager, I think she is just here to cause trouble

359
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,680
Shut up

360
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,600
Xiao Xian

361
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,760
Lately I have received many

362
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,680
Complaints that you snub the poor and fawn over the rich

363
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,560
Our store does not need someone like you

364
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,240
Starting tomorrow, do not come to work

365
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,760
Ma'am, are you satisfied with this?

366
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,280
Wrap them up and let's go

367
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,800
Wow, you guys have totally changed

368
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,600
What will the company be called from now on?

369
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,480
From now on we are Yida Real Estate

370
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,000
I miss you

371
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,920
Whenever dusk arrives

372
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,800
The evening breeze rises

373
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,640
Miss you

374
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,640
The riddle of life

375
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,760
Try not to see it clearly

376
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,160
Close your eyes

377
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,360
Do not respond

378
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,360
Night wind blows and blows

379
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,040
Go with the wind

380
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,480
Tonight, children, do not cry in secret

381
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,640
Do not cry in secret

382
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,480
Night wind blows and blows

383
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,160
Go with the wind

384
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,320
With nightfall and stars

385
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,320
Gently fall asleep

386
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,760
Let the evening wind blow
