1
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,560
You could have just called to let me know

2
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,040
I can just hold my birthday banquet elsewhere

3
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,240
No need to come in person to pick me up

4
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,600
Master Qin

5
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,840
You coming to Xin Wenqing for your birthday

6
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,920
gives us face

7
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,360
It’s just that today is really not ideal

8
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,800
Our lead dancer isn’t here

9
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,320
But your birthday plans are all set

10
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,120
Yeah

11
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,920
We’ve already reserved a place at A8

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,000
We not only have to take you there

13
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,640
I still have to toast you a few glasses

14
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,200
Hahaha

15
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,320
Zhiyi

16
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,640
I like what I’m hearing

17
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,880
Music Psychology, play in order

18
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,880
Daughter

19
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,760
Does it look good

20
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,720
Boss

21
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,760
Master Qin is here

22
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,640
What

23
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,680
Master Qin

24
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,000
Master Qin is here

25
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,600
Master Qin

26
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,400
Yeah

27
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,280
Why did he show up all of a sudden

28
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,480
He’s at the A1 booth

29
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,120
He says he came to hold his birthday banquet here

30
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,200
It must be the power of this dance and this tune

31
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,160
Even Master Qin has come here to hold his birthday

32
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,080
But

33
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,920
Zheng Nanfeng and Zhou Zhiyi also came

34
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,400
They came too

35
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,320
Yeah

36
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,040
They’re not there

37
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,840
What are people from Xin Wenqing doing here

38
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,120
Could they be here to snatch Xu Rumeng

39
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,600
We need to be careful

40
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,360
That’s impossible

41
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,640
She’s dancing here of her own free will

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,440
Unless she doesn’t want to see her sister

43
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,360
It’s fine

44
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,520
Let’s go take a look

45
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,360
Hi, Master Qin

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,560
A warm welcome

47
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,080
Ajie

48
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,640
Go fetch the most expensive bottle we have

49
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,640
and bring it to Master Qin

50
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,440
Okay

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,920
Here you go, Master Qin

52
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,400
Master Qin

53
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,360
At Xin Wenqing’s opening last time

54
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,760
I was out of line

55
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,600
What I did was wrong

56
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,840
I upset you

57
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,720
So today I must make amends and apologize

58
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,000
You shouldn’t have

59
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,560
Not at all, we’re family

60
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,040
Boss Xie

61
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,640
Shall we have a word

62
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,280
Go ahead

63
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,440
How did our lead dancer end up working here

64
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,080
She came of her own free will

65
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,080
Freelancer

66
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,320
What, you want to lock her down

67
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,240
Is that so

68
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,320
Then please call her over so I can ask her

69
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,360
Zheng Nanfeng

70
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,920
Are you hell-bent on making trouble

71
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,440
Today is Master Qin’s birthday

72
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,320
Do you want to spoil his fun

73
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,400
Don’t be nervous

74
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,120
Just joking with you

75
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,880
Zheng Nanfeng

76
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,760
Master Qin, we toast you

77
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,680
Master Qin

78
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,160
Master Qin

79
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,440
I’ve got something urgent, need to step out

80
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,520
If you’ve got business, go take care of it

81
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,040
Let Zhiyi keep me company

82
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,480
All this used to be our business

83
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,520
After Boss Cheng disappeared

84
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,360
Xie Jiachang took over this dock

85
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,120
He uses this dock

86
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,800
to control all sea transport

87
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,440
This whole stretch

88
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,920
Used to be all ours

89
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,400
Xie Jiachang

90
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,320
New grudges and old

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,120
Tonight we’ll settle accounts with you

92
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,080
Ah

93
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,080
I

94
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,280
I’m hungry

95
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,400
Haha

96
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,160
Little beauty

97
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,440
Want a bite?

98
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,680
If you want it, make big bro happy

99
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,240
Relax

100
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,720
I'll be very gentle

101
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,720
Hey

102
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,840
Get lost

103
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,440
Little witch, I guess you'll stay hungry

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,680
Zheng Nanfeng

105
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,400
Don't be afraid

106
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,560
I'm getting you out now

107
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,480
Wait

108
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,400
Get him!

109
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,120
Boss Zheng Nanfeng went to Haiyuan Wharf to save someone

110
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,160
Master Qin

111
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,120
Let Zhou Zhiyi stay here with you for now

112
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,640
I have business; I'll step out for a bit

113
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,080
Mr. Xie

114
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,320
You just up and leave?

115
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,880
Master Qin isn't done drinking yet

116
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,880
If you have business, go take care of it

117
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,000
Zhou Zhiyi can stay here with me

118
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,240
Okay, sure

119
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,680
Zhou Zhiyi, cheers

120
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,480
Zheng Nanfeng

121
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,600
It's okay now

122
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,040
All good now

123
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,720
Let's go

124
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,720
Head back

125
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,120
Go find your sister

126
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,920
Move

127
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,880
Go that way

128
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,720
Zheng Nanfeng, Zheng Nanfeng!

129
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,360
So kind to give me the cassette tape

130
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,840
Do you think I'm stupid?

131
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,440
And dragged Master Qin to hold the birthday feast here

132
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,040
Aren't you just trying to stall me?

133
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,360
Naive

134
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,520
Move

135
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,080
Well, well

136
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,520
Still want a last-ditch fight?

137
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,520
Hide

138
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,160
Boys

139
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,680
Go!

140
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,440
Stay hidden

141
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,440
Nanfeng

142
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,480
A Qiang, you stay and back us up

143
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,160
Yes

144
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,680
Zheng Nanfeng

145
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,480
Perfect timing

146
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,800
Don't let a single one slip

147
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,840
A bunch of losers to deal with two people—

148
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,840
and it takes this long?

149
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,080
Nanfeng

150
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,080
Nanfeng

151
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,680
You holding up?

152
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,960
Not gonna die

153
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
A Ming

154
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,640
Hold for two more minutes

155
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
Two minutes

156
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,880
I'll give you two hours to hold out

157
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,000
Even gods can't save you

158
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,200
A Ming

159
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,840
There, that should do it

160
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,000
Boss, our nightclub got trashed

161
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,640
What?

162
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,680
The nightclub was trashed

163
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,720
Retreat

164
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,840
Master Qin

165
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,560
What's wrong?

166
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,120
Xie Jiachang

167
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,480
Are you hoping my dad dies soon?

168
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,120
So you can lord it over Haicheng?

169
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,520
Even if my dad dies

170
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,040
His seat wouldn't go to you

171
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,080
Young Miss

172
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,000
What kind of talk is that?

173
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,520
My respect for Master Qin

174
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,560
is clear to everyone

175
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,080
Master Qin

176
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,760
What has made you so angry?

177
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,400
Xie Jiachang

178
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,440
Are you here to celebrate my birthday?

179
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,720
Or are you trying to get rid of me?

180
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,840
Ah

181
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,400
There was an accident just now

182
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,480
Xie Jiachang, get out here

183
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,680
Xie Jiachang, get the hell out here

184
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,480
Impossible

185
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,720
Why are they playing funeral music?

186
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,600
These dance tunes are new ones arranged by Zheng Nanfeng

187
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,000
Take it to ransom them

188
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,960
Use it

189
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,040
This

190
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,160
Zheng Nanfeng

191
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,760
Master Qin

192
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,160
It’s all Zheng Nanfeng’s doing

193
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,600
He set me up

194
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,200
Come at me!

195
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,280
Sister

196
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,000
Master Qin

197
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,920
Zhou Zhiyi, what is this?

198
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,200
Master Qin

199
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,840
We just found out too

200
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,840
Our lead dancer and her sister

201
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,720
were both kidnapped by Xie Jiachang

202
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,200
Zheng Nanfeng and I went to rescue them

203
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,320
But we also...

204
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,720
Master Qin

205
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,640
Xie Jiachang kidnapped my sister

206
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,480
And forced me to dance here

207
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,160
Master Qin, please stand up for me

208
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,560
Damn you, Xie Jiachang

209
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,000
Just a few days and you’ve taken up kidnapping

210
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,480
As the President of the Haicheng Chamber of Commerce

211
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,760
I will never allow a scourge like you to wreak havoc

212
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,760
Master Qin, I didn’t

213
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,160
Please let me explain

214
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,400
Go tell it to the police

215
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,240
Zhou Zhiyi, call the police

216
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,880
Call the police

217
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,600
Mr. Xie

218
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,640
What Music Psychology?

219
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,080
I composed it

220
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,480
Isn’t it amazing?

221
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,720
You thought to have her steal the cassette tape

222
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,680
Why didn’t you think

223
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,680
I’d beat you at your own game

224
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,200
This isn’t enough here

225
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,520
Mr. Xie

226
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,960
Kidnapping

227
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,760
Felony

228
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,520
Zheng Nanfeng

229
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,280
You must wait for me to come out alive

230
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,000
Heroes have always emerged from the young

231
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,400
Haicheng’s sky is about to change

232
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,720
Big Sister

233
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,760
How did it go?

234
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,120
It shouldn’t be too harsh a sentence

235
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:23,920
Big Sister

236
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,160
Please, you must avenge us

237
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,840
What was his name again?

238
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,800
Zheng Nanfeng

239
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,280
Zheng Nanfeng

240
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,360
I miss you

241
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,280
Whenever dusk falls

242
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,160
The evening breeze starts to blow

243
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,000
I miss you

244
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,000
Life’s riddle

245
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,120
Try not to see it clearly

246
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,520
Close your eyes

247
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,720
Don’t respond

248
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,720
The evening breeze blows and blows

249
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,400
Go with the wind

250
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,840
Tonight, children, don’t cry in secret

251
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,000
Don’t cry in secret

252
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,840
The evening breeze blows and blows

253
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,520
Go with the wind

254
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,680
With nightfall and stars

255
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,680
Gently drift to sleep

256
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,120
Feel the evening breeze
