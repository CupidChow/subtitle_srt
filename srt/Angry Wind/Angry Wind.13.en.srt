1
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,480
You are alive

2
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,160
Sorry I made you worry for so long

3
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,080
Do you miss me?

4
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,320
I

5
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,200
I have missed you

6
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,800
Where have you been all these years?

7
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,760
We all thought you were dead

8
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,520
It is a long story

9
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,720
The crash back then

10
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,120
was orchestrated by Xie Jiachang

11
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,200
The one burned in the car was not me

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,800
It was Xiao Tian

13
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,360
To help me, Lao Qin

14
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,800
secretly sent me to Thailand

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,200
I have been in Thailand all this time

16
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,320
First, to heal

17
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,000
Second, to prepare for revenge

18
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,200
Only a few days ago I heard

19
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,400
that Xie Jiachang was arrested and jailed

20
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,200
Then I asked Lao Qin to arrange my return

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
All these years

22
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,480
You never even called

23
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,800
Zhiyi

24
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,360
Lao Qin told me

25
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,000
Back then

26
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,000
Xiao Tian

27
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,800
was burned beyond recognition

28
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,800
Everyone thought it was me

29
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,200
But Xie Jiachang was not certain

30
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,280
He kept secretly investigating me

31
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,400
To keep it secret

32
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,800
I could only cut off all ties and contact

33
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
I hope you can understand

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,640
Sorry

35
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
This is

36
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
He

37
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,240
He, he is

38
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,040
I am Zheng Nanfeng

39
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,760
Zheng Nanfeng

40
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,000
I have heard of you

41
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,120
You defeated Xie Jiachang

42
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,160
and sent him to prison, right?

43
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,600
Young and promising indeed

44
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,160
Thank you, while I was away,

45
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,160
for helping manage my company

46
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,160
I will definitely promote you

47
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,480
Yadong

48
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,400
Wife

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,160
I am a bit hungry

50
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,680
Let us eat

51
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,400
Why not join us?

52
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,640
Um, I

53
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,800
have something else to do

54
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,120
I will head out first

55
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,040
Okay

56
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,360
I happen to need to talk with your sister-in-law

57
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,920
Have you heard?

58
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,480
Mr. Cheng didn’t die

59
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
He’s back now

60
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,400
Not dead

61
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,600
This is way too sudden

62
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,880
I heard too

63
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,000
Now the question is...

64
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,200
Boss Cheng is back

65
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,200
What about Brother Nanfeng?

66
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,520
I’ll definitely go with Boss Cheng

67
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,840
He’s our real boss

68
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,080
Brother Nanfeng treats us so well

69
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,720
How can we abandon Brother Nanfeng?

70
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,480
Yeah, yeah, I think so too

71
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,880
We just don’t know, behind Brother Nanfeng...

72
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,320
what gossip they’re spreading

73
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,560
Hurry up, get to work

74
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,280
Go, go, go, get to work

75
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:45,920
Get to work

76
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,800
This is really unbelievable, isn’t it?

77
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,000
How did he suddenly come back?

78
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,160
A Qiang

79
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
What nonsense are you talking?

80
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,800
If Boss Cheng hears this

81
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,880
what will he think?

82
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,520
So you mean

83
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,800
we should go back to Boss Cheng?

84
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,480
Brother Nanfeng is loyal

85
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,600
He’s good to us too

86
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,000
He gets things done cleanly

87
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,000
I respect him from the bottom of my heart

88
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,000
But after all, Boss Cheng brought us up

89
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,040
Now that he’s back

90
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,360
we won’t acknowledge him?

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,760
If that gets out, how can we still get by?

92
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,640
That’s true, but...

93
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,960
How about

94
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,240
we go ask Sister Zhiyi what she thinks?

95
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,800
Okay

96
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,000
Let’s go

97
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,880
Xiao Yue

98
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:34,960
Mr. Zheng

99
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,480
The document

100
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,080
Thanks

101
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,000
Wasn’t she supposed to

102
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,480
come today?

103
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,280
Come sit over here

104
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,040
Have a taste

105
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,040
See if it suits your taste

106
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,280
What’s wrong?

107
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,520
Is this...

108
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,200
konjac?

109
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes, it’s Konjac Beer Duck

110
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,600
I’m allergic to konjac

111
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,760
Didn’t you know that?

112
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,800
Ah, I forgot about that

113
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,760
I’ll swap it for you, hold on

114
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,160
Zhiyi

115
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,320
Where are you going at this hour?

116
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,520
I left my bag at the company

117
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,560
I’ll go pick it up

118
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,000
Is it that purple bag?

119
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,880
Ah

120
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,920
I brought it for you

121
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,960
I put it in the cloakroom

122
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,560
Ah, thank you

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,360
Zhiyi

124
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,720
From now on, let me handle things like this

125
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,080
Leave the company matters to me too

126
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,120
You’ve worked hard up to now

127
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,920
From now on, just enjoy life

128
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,600
You’re still so beautiful

129
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,040
These years...

130
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,160
I’ve thought of you every moment

131
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
I know

132
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,480
Zhiyi

133
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
I really miss you

134
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,760
Yadong

135
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,400
I...

136
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,120
These years...

137
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,080
I’ve gotten used to being alone

138
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,400
I understand

139
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,520
Then...

140
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
I’ll sleep outside

141
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,320
Sweet dreams

142
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,600
Good night

143
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,040
Good night

144
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,880
What would Brother Nanfeng like to drink?

145
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,800
Same as before

146
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,600
Okay

147
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,960
Brother Nanfeng

148
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,320
I’ll sit by myself

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,760
Thanks

150
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,040
Cheng Yadong in this world isn’t dead after all

151
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,720
He came back for Zhiyi

152
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
Oh heavens

153
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,920
You really like to mess with me

154
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,600
It's fine

155
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,320
I can get it myself

156
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,320
You carry on with your work

157
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
What's wrong

158
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,880
Brother Nanfeng

159
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,280
You need to pay for this first

160
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,400
Pay the bill

161
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,880
You're making me pay

162
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,440
Brother Nanfeng

163
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,800
Boss Cheng has instructed us

164
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,120
Starting today

165
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,920
all internal staff must pay

166
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,400
to make accounting easier

167
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,400
unified management

168
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,800
Boss Cheng

169
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,120
Since when do you work for Boss Cheng

170
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,400
What are you doing

171
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,160
Get lost

172
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,320
That's too much

173
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,280
Without you, Brother Nanfeng,

174
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,600
where would Xin Wenqing come from

175
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,400
And you two

176
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:22,800
Brother Nanfeng

177
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,800
I...

178
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,360
Okay

179
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,800
Sure

180
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,880
Work hard, okay

181
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,840
Work hard

182
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,440
Work hard

183
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,000
Brother Nanfeng

184
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,120
Brother Nanfeng

185
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
Why did you change all the company names

186
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,160
What's wrong with that

187
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,760
the real estate firm and the anti-theft door-window plant

188
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,440
were both founded by Zheng Nanfeng

189
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,480
Now you take them over,

190
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,560
what will people think

191
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,000
If not for my nightclub

192
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
as the launch platform

193
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:33,960
he, Zheng Nanfeng,

194
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,680
from a henchman

195
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,960
could he have risen to this point

196
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,640
The nightclub also thrives under Zheng Nanfeng's operation

197
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,800
that's why it is what it is today

198
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,760
Otherwise Xie Jiachang would have ruined it long ago

199
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,680
We must not burn the bridge

200
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,560
Burn the bridge

201
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,560
The plant and the company

202
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,720
and the nightclub

203
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,400
all have Zheng Nanfeng's shares

204
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,600
How is that burning the bridge

205
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,000
I just changed the names

206
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,080
simply for easier management

207
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,440
Doing this

208
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,760
is unfair to him

209
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,920
Those brothers have always followed me

210
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,400
They did before

211
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,400
they do now

212
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,560
and will even more so in the future

213
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,160
So what

214
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,600
The moment I return,

215
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,200
should I make Zheng Nanfeng the big brother

216
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,960
Sorry, I overreacted

217
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,600
But think about it from my side too

218
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,600
You need to know

219
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,560
you are my wife

220
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,560
Brother Nanfeng

221
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,040
Do you really have to leave

222
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,000
Brother Nanfeng

223
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,000
The brothers all don't want you to go

224
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Our days drinking and roaming the streets together

225
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,760
weren't they great

226
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
Why not just stay

227
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,080
Well, uh...

228
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,000
When I'm not around later,

229
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,240
please look after Zhiyi for me

230
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,800
I'm off

231
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,120
Brother Nanfeng

232
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,440
Nanfeng

233
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,280
What are you doing

234
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,760
I heard them say you're leaving

235
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,000
Nanfeng

236
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,880
The company just got on track

237
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,400
I arrive and you leave

238
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,800
what will everyone think

239
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,400
People might think I pushed you out

240
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,000
Be good, stay

241
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,440
Be nicer to Zhiyi

242
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,800
A Ming, A Qiang

243
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,360
Stay

244
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,320
I miss you

245
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,240
Whenever dusk comes

246
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,120
The evening breeze picks up

247
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,960
I miss you

248
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,960
The riddle of life

249
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,080
Try not to see it clearly

250
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,480
Close your eyes

251
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,680
Don't answer

252
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,680
The evening breeze blows and blows

253
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,360
Go with the wind

254
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,800
Tonight, children, don't cry in secret

255
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,960
Don't cry in secret

256
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,800
The evening breeze blows and blows

257
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,480
Go with the wind

258
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,640
With nightfall and myriad stars

259
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,640
Gently fall asleep

260
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,080
Feel the evening breeze
