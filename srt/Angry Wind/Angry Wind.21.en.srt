1
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,400
Boss

2
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,880
inside

3
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,880
Xie

4
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,120
Didn't expect it; I didn't come looking for you

5
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,280
yet you came knocking yourself

6
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,960
Boss Cheng wouldn't, about the past,

7
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,960
still hold a grudge, right?

8
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,520
If it weren't for you

9
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,720
I wouldn't have stayed abroad that long

10
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,840
A Shan

11
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,400
Cut off his hand for me

12
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,080
Don't move

13
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,760
Wait

14
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,120
Don't you want to hear why I came today?

15
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,000
Back then, in Haicheng,

16
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,680
you were quite a big name

17
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,240
you got the wind when you asked,

18
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,280
and the rain when you asked

19
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,080
Now you're content just guarding a warehouse here?

20
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,760
Your woman was snatched

21
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,120
You're willing to let it slide like that?

22
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,080
What Zheng Nanfeng is holding in his arms now

23
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,280
is your wife

24
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,480
the seat he's sitting on

25
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,960
was supposed to be yours

26
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,200
Now he's taken everything

27
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,280
Are you willing to accept that?

28
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,880
What on earth are you trying to say?

29
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,520
Don't be snide with me

30
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,200
We're on the same boat now

31
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,000
We have a common goal

32
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,160
It's Zheng Nanfeng

33
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,480
Boss Xie, do you know

34
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,400
I'm currently working with Zheng Nanfeng

35
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,240
That's bullshit cooperation

36
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,720
Just an errand-boy gig

37
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,680
Say that again

38
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,400
Easy, Boss Cheng

39
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,000
I said we're on the same boat

40
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,920
I can take back everything you lost

41
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
all of it

42
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,040
You alone?

43
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,480
Don't get yourself tossed back inside

44
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,000
On my own is not enough

45
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,440
But I wonder

46
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,160
Is Master Hong enough?

47
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,080
You know Master Hong?

48
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,920
Oh

49
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,800
I was inside with him

50
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,680
But now his network is in my hands

51
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,880
If you join forces with me

52
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,600
taking on Zheng Nanfeng won't be a problem

53
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,320
So what's your plan now?

54
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,400
No

55
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,720
Absolutely not

56
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,080
What?

57
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,600
Scared?

58
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,560
I, Cheng Yadong,

59
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,760
have hustled for years,

60
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,880
what have I ever feared?

61
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,200
No reason to refuse me

62
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,360
I have my own way of doing things

63
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,280
I know Boss Cheng is someone

64
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,440
who won't settle for second place

65
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,720
I hope you'll think it over

66
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,720
I don't need to think it over

67
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,520
Thanks

68
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,160
Please

69
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,000
So absolute, huh?

70
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,640
I'm afraid I might change my mind

71
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,280
Boss Xie won't even get out this door

72
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,680
Fine

73
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,440
We'll meet again

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,800
Boss

75
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,600
It seems this Cheng Yadong

76
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,120
really doesn't want to work with us

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,040
At some moment

78
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,760
he was already tempted

79
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,440
It's just that people like him

80
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,640
are a bit hesitant

81
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,280
Looks like we need to add fuel to the fire

82
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,640
and heat him up from behind

83
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,360
I don't think he's that capable

84
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,800
to deal with Zheng Nanfeng

85
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,320
We can do it without him just the same

86
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,000
Zheng Nanfeng is on the rise now

87
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,400
with Deep Harbor Group backing him

88
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,160
To take down someone like that

89
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,200
we must win over

90
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
people we can use

91
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,080
Then this fire

92
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,840
how do we plan to burn it?

93
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,560
Doesn't he make milk powder?

94
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,640
We'll work that angle

95
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,720
Got it

96
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,200
For anyone who won't get on board

97
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,360
we'll tie him onto the boat

98
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,160
Nanfeng

99
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,800
This is the order Youyou transferred from the mall

100
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,360
What?

101
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,200
It's infant formula again

102
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,560
A well-known overseas brand

103
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,040
I heard it's a nationally distributed product

104
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,840
The distribution volume is high

105
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,040
So demand is high

106
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,080
The merchant wants our logistics channel to speed shipping

107
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,240
No problem

108
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,480
I'll have A Ming and A Qiang handle it personally

109
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,280
Okay

110
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,080
Remember to drink water

111
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,200
Why did you two come in person?

112
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,240
Brother Nanfeng told us to

113
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:53,960
Get to work

114
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,440
Fine

115
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,800
Do a good job

116
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,040
Stay sharp in a bit

117
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,160
Stick to the plan

118
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,960
Okay

119
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,440
Go ahead

120
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:13,840
What's wrong?

121
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,320
You seem a bit distracted today

122
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,200
It's nothing, it's nothing

123
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,360
We can't be careless about things at the dock

124
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,680
If anything comes up, remember to tell me

125
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,480
Understood

126
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
Is the handover done?

127
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,640
It's all taken care of

128
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,360
Then get back to work

129
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,680
I'll talk with A Qiang alone for a bit

130
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,560
Okay

131
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,480
Still mad at me?

132
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,120
It's all in the past

133
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,440
Let's go

134
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,760
It's all in the past

135
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,560
Don't be mad

136
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,040
I'll arrange drinks tonight

137
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,480
A Qiang

138
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,320
Put it away properly

139
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,000
Bring that over here

140
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,120
All loaded up, right?

141
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,560
Loaded up

142
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,120
Get in the truck

143
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,880
Brother Nanfeng

144
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,640
Something's wrong

145
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,720
We have a big problem

146
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,400
Some babies who drank our formula

147
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,240
are all poisoned

148
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,520
They're in emergency treatment at the hospital now

149
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,360
It's infant formula—how could it go wrong?

150
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,640
Isn't it a genuine big-brand product?

151
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,720
Could there be some misunderstanding?

152
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,880
Or some slip-up occurred

153
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,680
I went to verify the batch number of the goods

154
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,160
I even checked the can code

155
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,560
It was indeed the batch we transported

156
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,240
Are you sure you

157
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,440
checked the can code for that batch

158
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,240
is this batch

159
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,720
I didn't look into that in detail

160
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,240
But it's definitely that batch

161
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,600
There's definitely a problem here

162
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,920
A Ming

163
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,920
Pass the word down

164
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,520
Pull this problematic batch from shelves

165
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,160
Okay

166
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,000
A Qiang

167
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,560
Whatever it takes,

168
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,080
get me the cans of the formula involved

169
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,880
Check again

170
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,720
Okay

171
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,000
Zhiyi

172
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,880
Please make a trip to the formula factory

173
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,160
Bring their quality inspection director

174
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,560
and the outbound supervisor to come over

175
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,840
I need to investigate this from the start

176
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:20,720
Okay

177
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,840
I'll contact them now

178
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,840
Don't panic

179
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,680
Okay

180
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,880
Great

181
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,920
Brother

182
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,880
The public outcry is huge right now

183
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,080
And many families

184
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,720
have started coming out to demand answers

185
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,600
Not enough

186
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:41,960
Far from enough

187
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,560
Here is the plan

188
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,960
Go to the TV station

189
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,640
Find Reporter Jiang

190
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,880
He is my friend

191
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,840
Have him back you up

192
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,400
I want all Haicheng news media

193
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,960
to report this

194
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,240
Once it gets big enough,

195
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,560
he, Zheng Nanfeng,

196
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,040
even with three heads and six arms, will not escape

197
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,800
Okay, I'll go now

198
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,600
Wait

199
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,960
Then go arrange some people

200
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,360
Find those moms

201
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,880
Have them call the Bureau of Market Regulation

202
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,800
and the Administration for Industry and Commerce to complain

203
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,640
and write complaint letters

204
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,440
Okay

205
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,520
Brother Nanfeng

206
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,480
People from the Administration for Industry and Commerce are here

207
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,400
You are Mr. Zheng Nanfeng, right?

208
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,680
That is me

209
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,120
We are with the Administration for Industry and Commerce

210
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,840
We received a complaint

211
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,880
There is a batch of tainted milk powder

212
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,800
was transported in through your company's dock

213
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,120
We will now, by law, investigate and sanction your company

214
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,840
and ask you to cooperate with our next steps

215
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,200
Okay

216
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,920
I miss you

217
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,840
Whenever dusk comes

218
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,720
the evening wind blows

219
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,560
I miss you

220
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,560
The riddle of life

221
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,680
Try not to see it clearly

222
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,080
Close your eyes

223
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,280
Do not respond

224
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,280
The evening wind blows and blows

225
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,960
Go with the wind

226
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,400
Tonight, children, do not cry in secret

227
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,560
Do not cry in secret

228
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,400
The evening wind blows and blows

229
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,080
Go with the wind

230
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,240
With nightfall and stars,

231
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,240
drift gently to sleep

232
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,680
Let the evening wind blow
