1
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,480
Nan Feng

2
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,480
Nan Feng

3
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,080
Nan Feng

4
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,880
Zhiyi

5
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,400
You in this world

6
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,280
Never belonged to me

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,360
I was too selfish

8
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,680
I was delusional, trying to change all this

9
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,320
I'm sorry

10
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,240
I intruded on your lives

11
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,080
Goodbye

12
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,520
If you dare touch my man,

13
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,880
I'll kill you

14
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,760
Ah!

15
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,840
Cut

16
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,400
Sis

17
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,920
It's just an audition, right?

18
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,520
Do you have to be this serious?

19
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,480
Sorry, sorry

20
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,320
I got into character

21
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,800
Sorry, sorry

22
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,000
How was it, okay?

23
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,200
Did I pass?

24
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,320
Not bad

25
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,800
You got it

26
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,200
Sixth Female Role

27
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,360
Come to set the day after tomorrow

28
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,440
Thanks

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,080
Director, I was selected

30
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,440
Thank you, Director

31
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,640
I...

32
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,480
Next, next

33
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,240
Nan Feng

34
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,000
What are you doing here?

35
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,240
I was bored, came to see you

36
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,120
How's it going?

37
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,520
Did you get the part?

38
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,600
I got it

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,560
Sixth Female Role

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,320
No way, sis

41
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,400
Sixth Female Role

42
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,080
What's wrong with that?

43
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,000
I did the math

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,480
This Sixth Female Role has nine lines in total

45
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,640
She appears on screen for 39 seconds

46
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,920
I'm already very satisfied

47
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,520
Didn't I tell you already?

48
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,760
You're a big star

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,280
Alright, let me do the math for you

50
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,040
Seven months left

51
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,200
In seven months you'll be an overnight sensation

52
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,400
You'll be hot across the whole country

53
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,440
Seriously, can you stop joking about this?

54
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,360
Can't you come up with something new?

55
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,520
Fine

56
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,800
Then see you in seven months

57
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,400
Oh, right

58
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,320
How come you're here?

59
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,080
Things at the company eased up

60
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,720
I...

61
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
I left the company

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,560
What?

63
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
What happened?

64
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,320
Let's go first

65
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,160
We'll talk it through later, let's go

66
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,960
Zhiyi

67
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,360
Zhiyi

68
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,400
Zhiyi

69
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,320
Let me explain, okay?

70
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,200
He insisted on leaving

71
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,320
I couldn't make him stay

72
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,640
Zhiyi

73
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,360
Please enjoy your coffee

74
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,680
Thank you

75
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,520
Zhiyi doesn't want you anymore

76
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,200
I'll take you instead

77
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,280
Don't joke with me in a situation like this

78
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,320
Cheng Yadong is way too despicable

79
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,800
Aren't you just letting him profit?

80
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,280
I don't want Zhiyi

81
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,640
to be stuck between us and feel torn

82
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,560
Before, you swore up and down

83
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,560
she was your wife

84
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,720
And now?

85
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,880
Whose wife is she?

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,360
She's Cheng Yadong's wife

87
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,280
But maybe this is for the best

88
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,480
Then you can come back to me

89
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,480
Hey

90
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,480
It means we're destined to be a pair

91
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,160
What's that look?

92
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,840
I'm just kidding

93
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,360
How about you be my manager?

94
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,800
I'm about to join the production

95
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,320
Come with me

96
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,080
Didn't you say I could become a big star?

97
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,040
So it's just talk?

98
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,120
Tonight you'll sleep in my room

99
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,920
I'll go sleep with Youyou

100
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:20,840
Sis

101
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,600
Is that what you really think?

102
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,720
I don't want to sleep with you

103
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,400
Shut up

104
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:27,800
Uh

105
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,480
Maybe I should just sleep on the sofa

106
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,400
Why would you sleep on the sofa?

107
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,160
Listen to me

108
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,000
Just sleep here

109
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,160
If it were someone else

110
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,360
I wouldn't let him sleep here

111
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,720
I've prepared a toothbrush and towel for you

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,680
Oh, and slippers, hold on

113
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,920
No, stop fussing

114
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,720
Get some rest early

115
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,840
I've never seen my sis this hardworking

116
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,160
Nan Feng

117
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,200
Are you going to turn Shengang upside down too?

118
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
What are you talking about?

119
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,360
From now on Zheng Nanfeng is my manager

120
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,000
Be more respectful to him

121
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,600
I did not disrespect him

122
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,960
After all, he's also my former brother-in-law

123
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,080
You...

124
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,280
All right, then get some rest early

125
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,280
See you tomorrow

126
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,200
Okay, see you tomorrow

127
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,280
Sis

128
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,840
Hurry

129
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
Get up, it's eight o'clock

130
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,040
Hurry up, hurry up

131
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,840
Hurry up

132
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,120
Xu Rumeng, you put on my shoes

133
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,800
Are you ready?

134
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,600
What?

135
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,440
I bet you're not ready to be a big star

136
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,680
I'm ready

137
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,000
Can't hear you

138
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,280
I can't hear either

139
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,160
I...

140
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,240
Xu Rumeng

141
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,400
Ready to be a top star

142
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,280
This is it

143
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,080
Look how excited you are

144
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,600
Okay, Youyou

145
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,120
Let's go check in first

146
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,200
Hi there

147
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,720
We're with the A Dream's Prime crew

148
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,640
Actor Xu Rumeng

149
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,560
Mm, okay

150
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,480
But the crew only booked you one room

151
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,680
Oh, that's fine

152
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,080
We'll pay for two more rooms ourselves

153
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,600
Okay

154
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,080
You are Xu Rumeng?

155
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,880
Yeah, I am

156
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,720
And you are?

157
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,200
I'm the Assistant Director of A Dream's Prime, Wang

158
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,600
Director Wang, Director Wang, hello

159
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,160
I looked over your profile before

160
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,480
Pretty good

161
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,000
You left quite a strong impression on me

162
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,520
So I recognized you at a glance

163
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,720
Thank you, Director, thank you

164
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,560
Oh, right

165
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,840
What are you playing again?

166
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,080
The male lead's sister-in-law, Sixth Female Role

167
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,800
Sister-in-law, huh

168
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,960
Not many lines, right?

169
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,320
Uh

170
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,680
With your qualities

171
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,840
And such outstanding looks

172
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,400
At least she should be Second Female Lead

173
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,880
Sixth Female Role is a waste of talent

174
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,360
Second Female Lead

175
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,920
Director, can I play the Second Female Lead?

176
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,720
You can

177
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,440
Second Female Lead is conservative already

178
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,760
Secure #2 and compete for #1, no problem

179
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,920
Director

180
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,120
If you give me this chance

181
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,200
I will definitely act well

182
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,360
I will never make you look bad

183
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,400
Oh, how about this

184
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,560
I'm upstairs in room 415

185
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,920
Later, you...

186
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,240
Come up to my room

187
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,160
I'll take another look at your acting

188
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,440
And by the way, I'll adjust your performance

189
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,080
Okay, thank you, Director

190
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,960
Then it's settled

191
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,280
Mm, see you tonight

192
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,200
See you tonight

193
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,400
Bye bye, bye bye

194
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,200
Bye

195
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,520
What are you doing?

196
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,840
What you said could really be right.

197
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,840
What's right?

198
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,400
Didn't you say I'm a superstar?

199
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,600
I could become famous across the country overnight.

200
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,320
It might really come true now.

201
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,680
I just ran into the Assistant Director.

202
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,520
He told me

203
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,600
I can Secure #2 and compete for #1 as the female lead.

204
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,280
This happiness came out of nowhere.

205
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:45,760
Sis

206
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,280
Be careful not to run into a scammer.

207
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,840
You're the scammer.

208
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,920
The timeline has been moved up.

209
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,800
That doesn't seem right either.

210
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,040
Oh.

211
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,480
Mengmeng

212
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,360
Come in, come in!

213
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,840
Director

214
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,960
About that role you mentioned just now.

215
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,080
Don't rush.

216
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,960
Let's run the lines together first.

217
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
Sit here, quick, sit here.

218
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,320
Sit here and look at the script.

219
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,960
Look at the Second Female Lead's scenes first.

220
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,600
Get familiar with the lines.

221
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,600
Come on, come on.

222
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,000
In our team,

223
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,640
I call the shots.

224
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,160
Loosen up.

225
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
You're too stiff.

226
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,640
Can you act well being this stiff?

227
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
How about

228
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,080
I teach you?

229
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,520
What are you doing?

230
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,920
Pervert

231
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,200
Ah!

232
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,280
Wow

233
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,040
Pretty thrilling.

234
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,000
Let me give you something thrilling.

235
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,400
I miss you.

236
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,320
Whenever dusk falls,

237
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,200
The evening breeze blows,

238
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,040
I miss you.

239
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,040
The riddle of life.

240
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,160
Try not to see it too clearly.

241
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,560
Close your eyes.

242
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,760
Don't respond.

243
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,760
The evening breeze blows and blows.

244
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,440
Go with the wind.

245
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,880
Tonight, children, don't cry in secret.

246
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,040
Don't cry in secret.

247
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,880
The evening breeze blows and blows.

248
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,560
Go with the wind.

249
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,720
As night falls with stars,

250
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,720
Drift gently to sleep.

251
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,160
Blow, evening wind
