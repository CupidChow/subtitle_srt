1
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,200
Rumeng, where did you run off to?

2
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,520
My dad put me under house arrest at home.

3
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,320
Your dad put you under house arrest?

4
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:04,720
Mm.

5
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,120
Hurry and come save me.

6
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,800
Where should I go to save you?

7
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,560
Baixia Road 09-02

8
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,560
Get here fast.

9
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,440
Youyou, I have an outfit—see if it fits you.

10
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,320
Clothes?

11
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:52,840
Mm.

12
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,760
What clothes?

13
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,880
Come in and try it.

14
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,000
Come in and try.

15
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,760
Sis.

16
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,280
Open the door.

17
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,000
Xu Rumeng, open the door!

18
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,760
Quick!

19
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,320
Shh.

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,360
We'll talk outside.

21
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:12,560
Go.

22
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:13,920
Go.

23
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,800
Go, quickly.

24
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,000
Nanfeng.

25
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,360
I don't want to go to the set anymore.

26
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,360
Why?

27
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,360
Director Du already agreed to make you the Female lead.

28
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,000
What a great opportunity.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,560
Haven't you always wanted to take this path?

30
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,440
Nanfeng.

31
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,840
Can we leave Shengang

32
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,960
and not go back to Haicheng

33
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,200
We'll find a

34
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,400
place where no one knows us

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,080
and start over, okay?

36
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,080
You're being too willful.

37
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,120
Nanfeng.

38
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,480
I...

39
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,160
Nanfeng.

40
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,360
Rumeng.

41
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,440
I owe Zhiyi too much.

42
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,360
I originally thought

43
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,200
it was heaven giving me a chance to start over

44
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,000
But

45
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,440
no matter what,

46
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,360
I don't want to hurt you

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,960
or deceive you

48
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
The two of us

49
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,640
let's leave it at that.

50
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
I hope you can understand me.

51
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,880
I won't.

52
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,560
Alright.

53
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,760
We've been out too long.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,840
It'll be dark by the time we get back.

55
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,800
Let me take you back.

56
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,080
We're home.

57
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,360
Go on in.

58
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,480
Mm.

59
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,640
Umbrella.

60
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,720
Rumeng.

61
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,240
Dad knows

62
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,640
this is really shameful,

63
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,480
but for your happiness,

64
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,960
don't blame Dad.

65
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,000
I've arranged everything you instructed.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,280
Uncle, something's wrong!

67
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,360
My sister is missing.

68
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,360
She's gone.

69
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,840
Didn't I tell you to watch her?

70
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,480
I...

71
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,480
didn't keep an eye on her.

72
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,000
Have you looked?

73
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,600
We did.

74
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
We couldn't find her.

75
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,400
Go find her, now!

76
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,480
What is going on?

77
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,640
I...

78
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,960
What's wrong?

79
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
Chairman Xu.

80
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,600
You really have some nerve, Zheng Nanfeng!

81
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,560
You dare bully my daughter?

82
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,000
I...

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,360
Why am I here?

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,600
Sis.

85
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,960
So you two made up?

86
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,640
No.

87
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,960
What's going on?

88
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
This is outrageous!

89
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,400
You are outrageous!

90
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,960
Hurry up and put some clothes on.

91
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,200
I originally thought

92
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,120
you were a promising young man

93
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,320
I never imagined you would do something like this

94
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,560
No, Chairman Xu

95
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,000
I was just bringing Rumeng back

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,240
Then I was going to

97
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,840
Then

98
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,440
Then you took her to the bed

99
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,440
No

100
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,640
There may be a misunderstanding

101
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,440
What misunderstanding

102
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,360
So many people are here

103
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,360
We saw it with our own eyes

104
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,680
How could that be false

105
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,200
Boss

106
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,240
On the CCTV, it has already

107
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,480
recorded him climbing into the villa

108
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,560
You snuck over the wall into my home

109
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,560
What were you after

110
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,200
What else do you have to say

111
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,280
By doing this

112
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,160
you've ruined my Rumeng's reputation

113
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,800
You must take responsibility

114
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,160
Dad, don't force him

115
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,040
Stay out of this

116
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,160
Dad will handle it for you

117
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,880
If you do not give an explanation today

118
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,760
I will not let you off

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,800
Zheng Nanfeng

120
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,560
Why one story in the morning and another at night

121
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,640
What are you really thinking

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,720
Rumeng, I truly do not know

123
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,840
what is going on

124
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,840
It is a fact you climbed over the wall

125
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,680
Stop quibbling

126
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,160
Keep a close eye on him

127
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,360
If there is no explanation

128
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,560
do not even think of leaving my house

129
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,560
Yes

130
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,080
Dad, you cannot do this

131
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,640
You go back to your room too

132
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,360
Do not come out without my orders

133
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,640
Youyou, take your sister back to her room

134
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,800
If she runs off again

135
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,440
do not come to see me anymore

136
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,200
Uncle

137
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,800
Uncle, bad news

138
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,040
What happened

139
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,360
Rumeng ran off again

140
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,880
It is not about my sister

141
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,880
The company's E-commerce Project was halted

142
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,400
Halted

143
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,760
How was it halted

144
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,680
This project

145
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,040
Half the board voted against

146
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,840
In Silicon Valley

147
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,920
are there not already success stories

148
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,400
The E-commerce Project

149
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,760
will surely replace physical merchants

150
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,960
We should be the first to take the plunge

151
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,440
This is a key strategic project

152
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,440
It has tremendous prospects

153
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,280
We should push it forward

154
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,160
Why would they vote against

155
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,080
They said they did a risk assessment

156
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,560
They said the project's risk is too high

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,640
Let me see

158
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,920
E-commerce

159
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
Online shopping

160
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,200
They are already building an online shopping platform

161
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Nonsense

162
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,960
It is utter nonsense

163
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,560
Uncle

164
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,280
So what should we do now

165
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,120
Go

166
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,480
Convene the board and reassess

167
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,000
What if they gang up at the meeting

168
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,360
We need a contingency plan in advance

169
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,680
Chairman Xu

170
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,600
Maybe I can help with this

171
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,120
This is the latest from America

172
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,280
E-commerce Project

173
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,160
There is no domestic precedent

174
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,840
You

175
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,160
do not meddle

176
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,560
How is that meddling blindly

177
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,200
E-commerce can solve many

178
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,480
problems in remote transactions

179
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,280
Think long term

180
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,200
Just imagine

181
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,360
You place an order at home on a mobile phone today

182
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,560
and it is delivered to your door the next day

183
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,360
Isn't that convenient

184
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,280
What is a mobile phone

185
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,480
It is like the brick phone we use now

186
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,160
just with a few more features

187
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
I did not expect you knew about this

188
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,160
This is just the start

189
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,400
Well

190
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,680
I will take a look at the project proposal first

191
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,280
I know where your project’s risk points are

192
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,080
I can help optimize your project workflow

193
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,200
and reduce the risk level

194
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,240
Youyou

195
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,240
Notify them

196
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,040
Hold an emergency board meeting this afternoon

197
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,040
Okay, Uncle

198
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:32,840
Rumeng

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,600
Dad

200
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,640
Dad

201
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,360
How did your meeting go?

202
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,440
The board approved it unanimously

203
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,960
The E-commerce Project officially launched

204
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,640
Initial funding of 100 million

205
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,960
Zheng Nanfeng will serve as CEO

206
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,480
Youyou will be Director of the R&D Department

207
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,360
He will be CEO

208
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,640
The business model proposed by Zheng Nanfeng

209
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,360
breaks old barriers

210
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,160
Truly a business genius!

211
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,560
I used to think you were just a screenwriter

212
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,160
I did not expect that

213
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,560
you are also so skilled with the internet

214
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,440
This cross-over of yours

215
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,720
is a bit too reckless

216
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,280
Well, I only proposed a broad concept

217
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,800
As for how the project will operate in detail,

218
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,120
that is up to our chief engineer

219
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,120
Where is Xu Youyou?

220
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,680
Sis

221
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,040
From now on, my brother-in-law and I

222
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,320
will be a Dynamic Duo

223
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
Anyway,

224
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,200
you made a big contribution to the company this time

225
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,000
Go ahead,

226
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,480
what reward do you want?

227
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,560
Actually, it is nothing, Chairman Xu

228
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,160
Just…

229
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,960
From now on, could you stop having these two big guys

230
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,400
follow me wherever I go?

231
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,560
Hahaha

232
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,200
I will just be frank with you

233
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,360
This is also my personal wish

234
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,560
I see Rumeng likes you so much

235
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,600
and I think highly of you

236
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,560
so

237
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,440
I want

238
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,680
you to be my son-in-law

239
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,640
I miss you

240
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,560
Whenever dusk falls

241
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,440
the evening breeze blows

242
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,280
I miss you

243
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,280
Life’s riddle

244
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,400
Try not to see it clearly

245
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,800
Close your eyes

246
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,000
Do not respond

247
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,000
The evening wind blows and blows

248
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,680
Go with the wind

249
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,120
Tonight, kids, do not cry in secret

250
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,280
Do not cry in secret

251
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,120
The evening wind blows and blows

252
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,800
Go with the wind

253
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,960
As the starry night falls

254
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,960
Gently fall asleep

255
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,400
Feel the evening breeze
