1
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,560
Don't push, don't push, don't push

2
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,200
One at a time

3
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,920
One at a time

4
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,480
The stolen furniture and items

5
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,520
We got them all back

6
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,520
Not a single piece is missing

7
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,720
All items are at their original spots

8
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,760
back in place

9
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,440
Understood

10
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,600
I just ran the numbers

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,960
Our company's real estate losses

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,320
are almost recouped

13
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,880
With the anti-theft doors and windows in production

14
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,200
the company is about to turn a profit

15
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,280
Speaking of the anti-theft doors and windows,

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,160
the factory is going crazy

17
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,440
We can't keep up at all

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,480
Then hire more staff

19
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,400
Hire more staff

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,440
Oh, right

21
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,680
We botched the last celebration banquet

22
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,440
Tonight at New Literati Club

23
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,680
Everyone must be there

24
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,800
Hahaha, okay, okay, okay

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,080
A Qiang is treating us

26
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,200
A Qiang is treating

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,000
Okay, okay, go, go, go

28
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,080
Cheers

29
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,280
Ru Meng, have you seen Nanfeng?

30
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,160
No, I haven't

31
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,360
I'm looking for him too

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,440
He's the crowd favorite

33
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,160
Yet he's the one who didn't come

34
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,400
Maybe something held him up

35
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,240
You carry on and have fun

36
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,360
I'll go take a look outside

37
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,960
Go ahead

38
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,400
Nanfeng always has to discuss things in private

39
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,600
So secretive

40
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,000
Is our door-and-window plant under pressure?

41
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,600
It's okay for now

42
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,960
We have quite a lot of staff

43
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,000
which is a hassle

44
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,040
Look,

45
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,360
You and A Qiang

46
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,600
haven't studied professional management

47
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,560
So I'm planning to hire

48
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,000
a highly educated outsider

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,440
professional management talent

50
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,960
to run our plant

51
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,320
What?

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,800
Why bring in an outsider to meddle?

53
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:29,960
Nanfeng

54
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,720
Everyone knows what I can do

55
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,560
I'm so capable I even scare myself

56
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,360
We don't need outsiders meddling

57
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,760
I think you misunderstood me

58
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,640
Give me and A Qiang a bit more time

59
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,880
We can definitely manage the plant well

60
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,680
Let me finish first

61
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,680
What I mean is,

62
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,040
this management hire

63
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,880
is for internal management

64
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,560
You and A Qiang are Manager and Deputy Manager

65
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,240
mainly in charge of external business

66
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,000
And I've already told Zhou Zhiyi

67
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,680
to give both of you

68
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,320
ten percent shares each

69
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,160
Really?

70
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,040
Ah, Brother Nanfeng, you scared me

71
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,120
I love you

72
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:22,840
Back up

73
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,960
Grab the weapons

74
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,000
Boss, we brought him

75
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,520
Wake him up

76
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,480
Hey, hey, Boss, Boss, Boss

77
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,200
Don't untie it

78
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:18,960
I'll do it myself

79
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,760
What are you thinking?

80
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,560
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

81
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,160
Zheng

82
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,720
Save your strength

83
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,360
Who are you people

84
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,000
Why did you kidnap us

85
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,400
Who I am does not matter

86
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,480
But my apprentice Xiao Qian, you got him locked up, right

87
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,200
You are Brother Ming

88
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,680
You know me

89
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,600
Tell me, after such a big mess

90
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,400
Should I take your life

91
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,000
Or do I take your life

92
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,800
Brother Ming

93
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,440
There is no grudge between us

94
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,480
Xiao Qian stole Master Qin’s stuff first

95
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,880
That is why he ended up like this

96
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,000
Even if you finish me here today

97
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,880
It will not change anything

98
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,920
Okay, still tough, huh

99
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,840
Boss

100
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,960
Mr. Xie’s money has arrived

101
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,080
When do we act

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,120
No rush

103
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,280
This Zheng Nanfeng is so rich

104
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,040
How could I let this chance slip

105
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,120
Boss, you mean

106
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,320
Does not he have a company too

107
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,440
How is it going

108
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,240
No news yet

109
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,120
We have searched many places

110
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,920
Could not find them

111
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,440
Where could two living people have gone

112
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,640
Guess how much Zhou Zhiyi

113
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,240
would pay to ransom you

114
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,000
Hello

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,440
Nanfeng

116
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,720
Zheng Nanfeng

117
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,840
Zhiyi, do not worry, I am fine

118
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,000
Hello

119
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,960
Zheng Nanfeng is in my hands now

120
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,720
You know the code of the underworld; do not call the police

121
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,120
I know, I know

122
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,440
What do you want

123
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,400
You tell me

124
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,480
As for me

125
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,400
I only kidnap, I do not kill

126
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,040
I will give you half a day

127
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
Prepare 5 million

128
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,360
5 million

129
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,320
Where am I supposed to find that much money

130
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,880
I had an Appraiser evaluate you

131
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,240
Your company

132
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,960
is now worth at least 10 million

133
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,640
I will give you a discount

134
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,680
5 million in cash, non-sequential notes

135
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
Hurry up and get it done

136
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,560
Remember, do not call the police

137
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,560
Otherwise you know the consequences

138
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,000
Time is too tight

139
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,240
Give me a bit more time

140
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,800
Hello

141
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,440
He wants 5 million

142
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,400
He even got an Appraiser to evaluate our company

143
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,240
Looks like it is deeply premeditated

144
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,080
But in such a short time

145
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,560
Where can we get that much money

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,680
Who is it

147
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,520
Is it Xie Rong

148
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,040
Maybe we should call the police

149
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,560
If we call the police now

150
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,200
It will be bad for Nanfeng and A Ming

151
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,040
Then what do we do

152
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,920
Nothing can happen to Nanfeng

153
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,960
We have to go save him

154
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,840
They told us to wait for the call

155
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,920
That means the two of them are safe for now

156
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,240
Then we cannot just sit here now, right

157
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,040
A Qiang, Xiao Li

158
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,120
Youyou, you stay here and start raising money

159
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,760
We will go find Master Qin

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,600
Xie Rong is a businesswoman

161
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,720
Such rough tactics

162
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,240
I don't think she did it

163
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,240
If you say Xie Jiachang did it,

164
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,560
I could believe it

165
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,320
But Xie Jiachang is still locked up in prison

166
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,880
If not Xie Rong, who else could it be?

167
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,320
Master Qin

168
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,320
No matter what,

169
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,120
You must help us this time

170
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,480
We can't let Nanfeng get hurt

171
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,560
In Haicheng,

172
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,320
Someone with these methods

173
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,080
There is indeed one more person

174
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,440
Who?

175
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,560
Brother Ming of Dragon Tiger Hall

176
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,360
Brother Ming

177
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,160
We have no feud with him

178
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,880
No feud?

179
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,680
A few days ago, Zheng Nanfeng schemed

180
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,880
and got Xiao Qian arrested

181
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,760
That is a feud

182
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,000
You still don't know, do you?

183
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,360
That Xiao Qian is Brother Ming's underling

184
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,640
Zhiyi

185
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,440
By rights,

186
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,440
this is a private matter between your two sides

187
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,440
I have already tipped you off

188
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,800
This already violates the code of the underworld

189
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,080
This is as far as I can help you

190
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,800
Whether you can rescue Zheng Nanfeng

191
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,320
depends on your luck

192
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,360
Got it, Master Qin

193
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,320
Qin Qin

194
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,600
Take this with you

195
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,240
Thank you, Master Qin

196
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,720
Remember to pay it back

197
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,720
Okay

198
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,960
Sister Zhiyi

199
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,920
Where is Dragon Tiger Hall?

200
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,240
Let's go straight there to save him

201
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,680
I only heard about it

202
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,160
I don't know exactly where it is either

203
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,560
What's Brother Ming's background?

204
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,920
I heard underworld brothers talk about him before

205
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,600
They said he came from Shengang

206
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,440
In Shengang, he offended the Big Sister of Shen-Gang

207
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,080
Someone put an Underworld Kill Order on him

208
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,840
So he fled to Haicheng

209
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,920
Big Sister of Shen-Gang

210
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,280
Hello?

211
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,360
Ms. Zhou

212
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,760
How is it?

213
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,160
Is the money ready?

214
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,240
Almost

215
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,280
What about Zheng Nanfeng?

216
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,480
I want to hear his voice

217
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,040
Don't worry, he won't die

218
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,720
Zhiyi, don't listen to him

219
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,520
Don't fall for it

220
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,280
Nanfeng

221
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,520
4 p.m.

222
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,840
Xigang Warehouse

223
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,920
Remember, if you call the police, we kill the hostage

224
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,160
Hello?

225
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,000
No, we need to bring more people

226
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,720
This Brother Ming definitely doesn't follow the code

227
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,240
Sister Zhiyi

228
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,520
I have an idea

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,240
Sister Zhiyi, is this the place?

230
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,720
I miss you

231
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,640
Whenever dusk falls

232
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,520
The evening breeze blows

233
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,360
Missing you

234
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,360
The riddle of life

235
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,480
Try not to see it clearly

236
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,880
Close your eyes

237
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,080
Don't respond

238
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,080
The evening wind blows and blows

239
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,760
Go with the wind

240
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,200
Tonight, children, don't cry in secret

241
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,360
Don't cry in secret

242
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,200
The evening wind blows and blows

243
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,880
Go with the wind

244
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,040
With nightfall and the stars

245
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,040
Gently fall asleep

246
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,480
Feel the evening breeze
