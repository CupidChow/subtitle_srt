1
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,200
Nanfeng

2
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,120
Bad news

3
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,520
What's wrong?

4
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,160
The families of the victims

5
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,680
have all gathered downstairs.

6
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,760
They're clamoring for compensation.

7
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,520
The investigation isn't clear yet.

8
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,560
The families making a scene won't help.

9
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,320
Then...

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,080
How about...

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,040
I call the police.

12
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,840
Wait a minute.

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:06,920
With something like this...

14
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,960
the families being emotional...

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,880
is understandable.

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,040
No...

17
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,440
Can we let this situation...

18
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,920
continue to escalate like this?

19
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,320
Go see the finance department.

20
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,200
Pay whatever needs to be paid.

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,320
Alright.

22
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:20,760
Pay?

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,000
This compensation amount isn't small.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,320
Our company has no cash flow right now.

25
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,520
If we start paying compensation...

26
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,120
we'll be in a dilemma.

27
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,200
Why not wait until the investigation is clear?

28
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,880
We can wait, but the law won't.

29
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,360
The priority now is to solve the problem.

30
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,520
As for the money...

31
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,840
I've made up my mind.

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,960
Return the internet company to Godfather.

33
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,840
The logistics company...

34
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,360
Liquidate it.

35
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,000
Wait...

36
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,880
You want to close the company?

37
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,360
This is your life's work.

38
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,760
You can't just close it like that.

39
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,360
Zhiyi.

40
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,760
Fate gave me a chance to start over.

41
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,760
It wanted me to live a good life with you.

42
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,680
After all these ups and downs in Haicheng...

43
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,360
perhaps...

44
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,160
this is destiny.

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,720
It's better to close the company.

46
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's go to Shengang together.

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,920
And spend the rest of our lives happily.

48
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,920
Okay?

49
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,520
Have you thought it through?

50
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,960
Are you willing?

51
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,600
As long as it's your decision...

52
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,640
whatever the choice...

53
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,120
I'm willing.

54
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,760
Why are you crying?

55
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,240
Mr. Cheng.

56
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,000
How is it?

57
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,600
This one deal of mine is worth ten or a hundred of yours, right?

58
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,400
How did you do it?

59
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,800
I told you.

60
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,680
There's nothing I can't do.

61
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,920
You've expanded so much...

62
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,800
Aren't you afraid of Customs checking?

63
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,520
Don't worry.

64
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,920
It's a streamlined operation.

65
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,000
Every link in the chain is unobstructed.

66
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,920
You have sales channels.

67
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,600
Supply falls short of demand.

68
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,200
I promised you.

69
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,600
We'll split it fifty-fifty.

70
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,400
Half for you.

71
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,920
Mr. Xie, you really have connections everywhere.

72
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,840
I've really learned something today.

73
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,920
This is nothing.

74
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,120
There will be even bigger deals in the future.

75
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,960
By then, you'll have everything.

76
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,720
Are you still afraid Zhou Zhiyi won't come back?

77
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,600
Let's go, Mr. Cheng.

78
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,600
Let's check the goods over there.

79
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,440
Xiaoli.

80
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,120
Brother Qiang.

81
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,920
I bought some drinks for everyone.

82
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,040
Call everyone over to have some.

83
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,120
Okay.

84
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,400
Brothers, come over here.

85
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,960
Brother Qiang brought drinks for everyone.

86
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,760
Thanks, Brother Qiang.

87
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,680
Xiaoli.

88
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,600
How long have you been at the pier?

89
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,520
Almost a year.

90
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,960
I transferred from our dance hall...

91
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,280
over there.

92
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,320
All together, it's been five or six years.

93
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,240
That's indeed quite a long time.

94
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,440
Brother Qiang.

95
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,960
I know why you came to find me.

96
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,560
I didn't dare to say it before.

97
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,560
But if I don't say this...

98
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,720
I can't live with myself.

99
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,200
Go on.

100
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,920
Last time, Mr. Cheng... from the order...

101
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,440
removed 10 containers.

102
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,120
I didn't follow the procedure either.

103
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,720
I thought doing this...

104
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,600
really didn't fit company regulations.

105
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,640
Why didn't you follow the procedure?

106
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,720
Mr. Cheng said I...

107
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,440
made a mistake with the warehousing.

108
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,240
And he tore up the original forms.

109
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,680
But I checked repeatedly.

110
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,520
There was no mistake.

111
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,520
Do you know where the removed containers went?

112
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,440
Yes.

113
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,320
Take me there.

114
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,000
Go this way.

115
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,080
It's the innermost warehouse.

116
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:16,920
Brother Qiang.

117
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,920
You really don't want me to go in with you?

118
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,680
Telling me about this...

119
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,560
is already good enough.

120
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,960
No need to get dragged in further.

121
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,720
Go back.

122
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,080
Pair of threes, want it?

123
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
Pair of twos. Bomb!

124
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,080
Bomb!

125
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,120
Want it?

126
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,480
Yeah, I've already lost.

127
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
Want it?

128
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Move these away for me.

129
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,520
Brother Qiang.

130
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,800
What are you doing here?

131
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,040
Cheng Yadong.

132
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,000
You dare to smuggle?

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,240
Brother Nanfeng won't let you get away with this.

134
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,520
Zheng Nanfeng liquidated the company.

135
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
He can't do anything to me.

136
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
Can't do anything to you?

137
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,920
Come with me to see Brother Nanfeng.

138
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,520
Brother Qiang.

139
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,480
You can't stay here.

140
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,320
Get out of here, now.

141
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,320
Zhao Ziqiang.

142
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,400
Get out of here, listen to me, hurry!

143
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,600
Xie Jiachang.

144
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,600
I never thought you two would collude.

145
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,560
If I had known today...

146
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,200
Brother Nanfeng shouldn't have let you go back then.

147
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,920
Don't mention Zheng Nanfeng to me.

148
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,920
He's a dead man sooner or later.

149
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,320
Today, I'll send you on your way first.

150
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,120
Then I'll finish off Zheng Nanfeng.

151
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,680
Zhou Zhiyi, Xu Youyou.

152
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,120
None of them will escape.

153
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,680
Forty-nine days.

154
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,600
I'll toy with them to death, one by one.

155
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,720
I'll kill you!

156
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,440
Boss Zheng, these are all the data and accounts...

157
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,920
...after our company's liquidation.

158
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,960
Please take a look.

159
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,800
It's fine, I trust your work.

160
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,240
Prioritize settling...

161
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,080
...the compensation and employee salaries.

162
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,520
Okay.

163
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
Where is Brother Qiang?

164
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,760
Boss Xie.

165
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,200
Maybe we should lock Brother Qiang up.

166
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,200
Come on.

167
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,520
Boss Cheng.

168
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,720
It's your turn to act.

169
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,920
Boss Xie.

170
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,240
Didn't you eat?

171
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,640
Brother Qiang.

172
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,320
Only the dead...

173
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,040
...are the safest.

174
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,680
Brother Qiang.

175
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,600
It wasn't me!

176
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,760
Brother Qiang.

177
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,880
Brother Qiang.

178
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's go.

179
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,760
Brother Qiang.

180
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,400
Brother Qiang.

181
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,960
Brother Qiang, wake up.

182
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,120
Brother Qiang.

183
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,480
Xie Jiachang, you jerk!

184
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,520
The cinema next door has a promotion.

185
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,320
Buy one, get one free.

186
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,400
I happen to have two tickets.

187
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,200
I want to give you one.

188
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,120
Are you stupid?

189
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,040
The twenty-sixth.

190
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,040
We've already returned to Haicheng.

191
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,160
Since we came back from investigating the tainted milk powder...

192
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,640
...I haven't seen him either.

193
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,160
Why don't you try calling him?

194
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,120
Then I'll try.

195
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,200
Can't get through.

196
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,960
Boss Cheng.

197
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,520
Where are you planning to go?

198
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,400
Not planning to go anywhere.

199
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,640
Boss Xie.

200
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,360
Brother Qiang is dead.

201
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,320
Zheng Nanfeng definitely won't let this go.

202
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,920
Sooner or later, he'll find his way here.

203
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,320
Let's go out and lay low for a while.

204
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,120
After things calm down in a bit...

205
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
...we can come back. How about it?

206
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,360
That won't do.

207
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,280
If you run now...

208
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,760
...it's practically a confession of guilt.

209
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,320
Where can you even escape to?

210
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,320
Thailand.

211
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,240
I'm quite familiar with Thailand.

212
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,600
How can that be?

213
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,440
I haven't killed Zheng Nanfeng yet.

214
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,040
And I haven't had my fun with Zhou Zhiyi.

215
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,720
Boss Xie.

216
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,920
I don't want the shares anymore.

217
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,040
Just let me go.

218
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,720
Ah Jie.

219
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,560
You're so rude.

220
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,520
How dare you get rough with Boss Cheng?

221
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,200
Come here.

222
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,880
Boss Cheng.

223
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,920
Get Zhou Zhiyi to come here.

224
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,440
What are you going to do to her?

225
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,640
What do you think?

226
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,240
If she's tied up...

227
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,000
...wouldn't Zheng Nanfeng come?

228
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,600
Don't worry.

229
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,880
After it's done...

230
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,280
...I'll let you both go.

231
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,600
Let you fly away together.

232
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,960
Just say you know Brother Qiang's whereabouts.

233
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,120
She'll definitely come.

234
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,520
Hurry up.

235
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,360
Fine.

236
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,640
Hello?

237
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,680
Zhiyi.

238
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,320
Zhiyi, I've found a lead on the tainted milk powder.

239
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,720
Are you telling the truth?

240
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,560
Zhiyi.

241
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
You'll know when you get here.

242
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,240
Make sure you come alone.

243
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,720
Where's Cheng Yadong?

244
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,120
Have him come see me.

245
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,720
Ah Jie.

246
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,400
Zhou Zhiyi.

247
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,120
Long time no see.

248
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,240
Xie Jiachang.

249
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:50,960
What?

250
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,200
Didn't expect it?

251
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,920
So you were the one behind everything.

252
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,040
A bit late to realize now, isn't it?

253
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,200
What do you want?

254
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,760
What do I want?

255
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,920
Tie her up.

256
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,920
I miss you.

257
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,840
Whenever dusk arrives.

258
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,720
The evening breeze rises.

259
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,560
Missing you.

260
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,560
Life's mysteries.

261
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,680
Try not to see clearly.

262
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,080
Close your eyes.

263
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,280
Don't respond.

264
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,280
The evening breeze blows and blows.

265
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,960
Go with the wind.

266
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,400
Tonight, child, don't cry in secret.

267
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,560
Don't cry in secret.

268
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,400
The evening breeze blows and blows.

269
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,080
Go with the wind.

270
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,240
With the night's curtain and stars.

271
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,240
Gently fall asleep.

272
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,680
Blowing evening wind.
