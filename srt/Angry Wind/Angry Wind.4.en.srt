1
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,920
Nanfeng

2
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,000
The room is a bit dark

3
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,760
I want to sleep with you

4
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,440
Hey, Xu Rumeng, you...

5
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,200
Nanfeng, what's wrong?

6
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,600
Did I hurt you?

7
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,560
Let me rub it for you

8
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,480
No, no, no, Xu Rumeng

9
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,080
We’ve been apart for quite a long time

10
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,800
We can’t go back

11
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,200
The one I love now is Zhou Zhiyi

12
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,640
I know feelings can be rebuilt

13
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,760
I’ll give you time

14
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,680
Is one hour enough?

15
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,200
Hey

16
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,440
No, Xu Rumeng

17
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,000
If Zhou Zhiyi finds out you came this late,

18
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,680
will she throw you out?

19
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,040
Why would she kick me out?

20
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,200
You’re not her husband

21
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,680
Zheng Nanfeng

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,800
I just...

23
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,680
You, you...

24
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,800
What are you doing?

25
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,240
Come here

26
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,240
Come here

27
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:05,960
Come here

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,600
What’s that sound?

29
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Are you okay?

30
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,800
I’m fine. Hold on a sec

31
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,480
Don’t move

32
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,480
Shh

33
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,280
Hi

34
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,000
Uh, oh, well...

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I was just watching TV

36
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,400
Did I bother you?

37
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,800
Oh, not at all

38
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,360
It’s just too much happened these past two days

39
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,560
I’m having trouble sleeping

40
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,480
Came to have a drink with you

41
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,480
Have a drink

42
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,000
Right, we should have a drink

43
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,600
Uh, let’s drink in the living room

44
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,480
Then we have it, don’t we?

45
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,280
Ah

46
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,480
Zheng Nanfeng

47
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,880
Xu Rumeng is a good person

48
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,840
You can tell she really likes you

49
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,600
If you’re together, communicate well

50
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,680
Act like a proper boyfriend

51
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,080
No, the two of us aren’t dating

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,840
What’s that noise?

53
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,280
Oh, um...

54
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,000
Your cat is catching mice

55
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,360
I don’t have a cat

56
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,200
You’re talking nonsense

57
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,000
Zheng Nanfeng

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,760
Why are you different from others?

59
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,960
Am I?

60
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
The way you think about things

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,480
always surprises me

62
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,680
And

63
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,320
your understanding of me

64
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,240
seems deeper than others’

65
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,560
I...

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,360
know far more than you

67
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,640
You’ve only known me for a few days

68
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,440
I’ve known you for a long time

69
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,600
A very long time

70
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,840
Stop

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,520
You say you went into his room

72
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,520
because you couldn’t sleep at midnight,

73
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,960
to have a drink with him, right?

74
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,760
You say you went into his room

75
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,680
also to look for a drink

76
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,560
Then you drink too

77
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,600
Hey, hey, let’s not drink like this, okay?

78
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,600
I don’t buy that you hid in the curtains

79
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,440
just like that

80
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,000
Since I don’t believe it, have another drink

81
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,600
You just said he’s different because of his work

82
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,040
I don’t believe that either

83
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,800
Then you deserve a penalty drink too

84
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,360
What, you two think I’m invisible?

85
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,240
Then you drink

86
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,360
Bottoms up

87
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,840
Drink

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,960
Xu Rumeng

89
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,360
You're good at singing and dancing

90
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,760
I'm telling you

91
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,640
In less than five years you'll be an A-list star

92
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,760
A-list star

93
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,200
What's an A-list star?

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,800
An A-list star is a top-tier celebrity

95
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,360
When did you switch to being a fortune-teller?

96
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,440
Zhou Zhiyi, you too

97
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Five years

98
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
We...

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,080
We...

100
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,000
Hey

101
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,840
Don't fall asleep, you two

102
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,440
Keep drinking

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,880
Zheng Nanfeng

104
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,120
Sister Zhiyi

105
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,600
I'm sorry

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,560
You really guessed right

107
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,200
She really had a motive

108
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,880
Ever since you came back from seeing your sister today,

109
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,200
I felt something was off with you

110
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,000
Tell me, who made you do this?

111
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,360
You stole the song

112
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,000
Are you going to hand it to Xie Jiachang?

113
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,480
Xu Rumeng, tell me the truth

114
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,200
Is your stealing the cassette tape related to Xie Jiachang?

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,600
Fine, if we tied the wrong person, then so be it

116
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,680
Call Xu Rumeng

117
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,840
Tell her to go steal the cassette tape back for me

118
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,400
If she doesn't agree,

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,360
don't blame me if I torture her for 49 days

120
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,880
So right now you...

121
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,160
still don't know where Youyou is?

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,560
I was saying, Xie Jiachang

123
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,160
has been so quiet these days

124
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,880
I'll call now to get her

125
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,840
Snatch her back

126
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,600
Don't worry

127
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,800
No, doing that will tip off the enemy

128
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,840
Given his nature, he'll likely kill the hostage

129
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,880
Then what do you think we should do?

130
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,000
You have to bait the hook to catch the fish

131
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,920
Take it to ransom her

132
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,000
Go back and sleep

133
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,600
Um

134
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,160
Which side do I sleep on?

135
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,040
You sleep outside

136
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,080
Hey, hey

137
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,760
Where's my sister?

138
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,640
Wait a minute

139
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,080
That's enough

140
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,000
Got the stuff

141
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,720
As agreed,

142
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,560
You get the goods

143
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,520
Release my sister

144
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,840
Boss

145
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,400
What does Track Sequence mean?

146
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,440
This is Zheng Nanfeng

147
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,400
based on Music Psychology

148
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,000
a researched music playback order

149
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,560
It says to play in sequence

150
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,080
It better stimulates customers' emotions

151
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,400
Brother Jie, go try it

152
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,040
Okay

153
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,600
That's the vibe

154
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Where is my sister?

155
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,160
I did say I'd release your sister,

156
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,800
but now isn't the time

157
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,360
Xie Jiachang, you don't keep your word

158
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,200
What do you want?

159
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,200
What do I want?

160
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,080
Just having the songs isn't enough

161
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,800
You have to be my lead dancer

162
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,880
I'm not going

163
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,800
If you want to save your sister, do as I say

164
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,480
Otherwise, you know the consequences

165
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,920
Xie Jiachang, release my sister!

166
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,000
You jerk

167
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,000
Louder

168
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,040
Get hyped

169
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,440
Sister Zhiyi

170
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,120
Zheng Nanfeng

171
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,000
After Xu Rumeng went over

172
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
She was detained by the people there

173
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,360
I have already sent someone to follow them

174
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,400
I told you Xie Jiachang is unpredictable

175
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,840
Even with the cassette tape, he might not release her

176
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,640
Right?

177
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,800
Given Xie Jiachang's character,

178
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,600
If he let her go,

179
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
I would find that strange

180
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,600
Ah

181
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,240
Then you still sent Xu Rumeng to deliver the cassette tape?

182
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,640
It is dangerous for the girl being held

183
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,600
Don't worry

184
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,440
Xu Rumeng is the club's Top performer

185
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,160
Xie Jiachang will not lay a hand on her

186
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,200
If you do not let Xie Jiachang get a taste,

187
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,440
How will he lower his guard?

188
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,640
He lowers his guard, and then what?

189
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,200
One day later, Club A8 closes

190
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,560
Make him close down

191
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,040
He is deeply entrenched in Haicheng

192
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,080
Easier said than done

193
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,400
It really is not easy

194
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,280
Otherwise, why would you need me?

195
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,800
You mean,

196
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,880
you have already arranged everything

197
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:57,880
A Ming

198
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,400
Yeah?

199
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,760
Go check where he is holding Youyou

200
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,840
Get the exact location

201
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,200
Tell me at once if there is any news

202
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,000
Go right now

203
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,800
Yeah, okay

204
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,800
If I remember correctly

205
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,640
Tomorrow night, Master Qin

206
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,800
is coming to our club for his birthday banquet

207
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,600
Right?

208
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,440
Mm-hmm

209
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,800
I miss you

210
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,720
Whenever dusk falls

211
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,600
The night breeze rises

212
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,440
I miss you

213
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,440
The riddle of life

214
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,560
Try not to see it clearly

215
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,960
Close your eyes

216
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,160
Do not respond

217
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,160
The night wind blows and blows

218
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,840
Go with the wind

219
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,280
Tonight, children, do not secretly cry

220
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,440
Do not secretly cry

221
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,280
The night wind blows and blows

222
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,960
Go with the wind

223
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,120
With the starry nightfall

224
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,120
Gently fall asleep

225
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,560
Breathe the night wind
