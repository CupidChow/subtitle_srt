1
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,800
Zheng Nanfeng

2
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,720
Why is it you again

3
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,440
If you’re here to attend our wedding

4
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,120
You’re welcome to

5
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,920
If you’re here to make trouble

6
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,520
I believe everyone here

7
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,520
won’t stand for it

8
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,920
Wouldn’t have guessed

9
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,720
I came today

10
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,920
just to cause trouble

11
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,920
Open your eyes and take a good look

12
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,600
With just you few

13
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,000
Mr. Cheng

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,760
Today is a good day

15
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,320
And in this kind of setting

16
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,400
It’s not the time for brawling

17
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,040
State your business

18
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,840
Isn’t there a reason for everything

19
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,400
Master Qin is right

20
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,560
With so many of us watching

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,040
and you still want to start a fight

22
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,920
That would really make us lose face

23
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,960
Zheng Nanfeng

24
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,520
What do you want

25
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,560
I came today

26
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,920
to take back everything that is mine

27
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,840
I’ve long seen through your little schemes

28
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,320
You acted magnanimous, saying you wanted nothing

29
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,160
and just walked away

30
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,600
Now you regret it, huh

31
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,240
Rest assured

32
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,360
I’ll give you your shares in the company in full

33
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,200
I’ll even give you extra

34
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,800
This is what I promised Zhou Zhiyi

35
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,080
Are you misunderstanding something

36
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,920
The factory

37
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,560
The dance hall

38
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,320
The company

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,760
I’ll give them all to you

40
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,640
I don’t want any of them

41
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,720
I came today

42
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
I only want Zhou Zhiyi

43
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,320
Zhou Zhiyi

44
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,160
Zhou Zhiyi is my everything

45
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
What’s going on

46
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,320
This is so strange, what’s happening

47
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,520
You come here to make a scene

48
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,000
Don’t forget, I’m the groom today

49
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,560
Let me tell you

50
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,320
No matter what

51
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,920
She is my wife

52
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,320
If I’d had his guts back then

53
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,320
I wouldn’t have been left with this regret

54
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,440
Zheng Nanfeng

55
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,160
You’re courting death

56
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,440
Don’t move

57
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,000
All of you, stop

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,840
Don’t move, get down

59
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,320
Yadong

60
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,920
Nanfeng

61
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,040
Even if you go for mutual destruction today

62
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,840
it still won’t end well

63
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,760
As I see it, what you should do today

64
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,200
is hear Zhou Zhiyi’s true feelings

65
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,160
Who she truly wants to choose

66
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,200
That’s what matters most

67
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,920
Choose what

68
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
Zhou Zhiyi is my wife

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,240
He’s just here to stir things up

70
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,920
Yadong

71
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,440
I remember how good you’ve been to me

72
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,160
But I don’t want to string you along anymore

73
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,920
This is unfair to both you and me

74
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,360
I’m sorry

75
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,720
Starting today

76
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,000
I won’t let you suffer

77
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,480
even the slightest wrong

78
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,040
I’ll never let you down again in this lifetime

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,800
I love you

80
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,160
I love you too

81
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,520
Come back

82
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Let’s go

83
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
We’re leaving

84
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,160
Cheng Yadong never became

85
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,440
my husband in the eyes of the law

86
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,240
The engagement back then

87
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,520
has long become the past

88
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,680
I once waited obsessively

89
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,280
It was Zheng Nanfeng who pulled me out of that fixation

90
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,200
This time

91
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,960
I finally dare to run toward

92
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,240
my own future

93
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,120
What’s wrong?

94
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,400
You gave him the dance hall, the site, and the company

95
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,800
I don’t even want to go back to the villa

96
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,200
Then we can say now that

97
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,280
we have nothing at all

98
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,000
Who said we have nothing?

99
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,400
I’ll take you somewhere

100
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,520
Where?

101
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,000
You’ll know once we get there

102
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,120
Hold me

103
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,000
Let’s go!

104
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,720
Hey

105
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,720
Welcome to Soaring Network

106
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,800
What is this place?

107
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,160
Our new company

108
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,080
Soaring Network

109
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,120
We just landed in Haicheng

110
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,840
All of this?

111
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,600
The whole building is ours

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,040
For real?

113
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,720
This is way over the top

114
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,000
Come on, I’ll show you around

115
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
Hello, Boss Zheng

116
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,720
Hello, Boss Zheng

117
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,600
Hello, Boss Zheng

118
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Sit

119
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,120
Hey

120
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,440
How did you pull this off?

121
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,400
Half of this credit is yours

122
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,200
I don’t have any credit

123
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,840
Without you, I’d have no drive

124
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,320
Where do you pick up these lines every day?

125
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,840
Hello, Sister-in-law

126
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,120
Hello, Sister-in-law

127
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,040
You work at this company too?

128
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,160
Sister Zhiyi

129
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,600
Your office is over there

130
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,720
Come, let me show you

131
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,880
My office?

132
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,880
That’s right

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,680
What are they doing?

134
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,080
No idea; don’t ask me

135
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,080
The surprises today just keep coming

136
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,400
You’ve made my head spin

137
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,040
Come on, come on, let’s see the office

138
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,920
I quit

139
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,080
Since Boss Zheng left

140
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,000
the treatment has changed

141
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,120
It’s a rip-off

142
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,040
Now even the boss is gone

143
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,880
They won’t even pay our wages

144
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,800
That Cheng guy treats us like dirt

145
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,040
We’re going on strike

146
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,520
Let’s go

147
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,640
Hey, did you hear?

148
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,120
Boss Zheng came back to Haicheng

149
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,400
Yeah, he did

150
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,240
I heard

151
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,640
I heard not only did he come back,

152
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,800
he even opened some kind of

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,240
internet company

154
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,600
And it’s not small in scale

155
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,560
Really?

156
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,280
We can’t stay here anymore

157
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,600
Let’s go find Boss Zheng

158
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,240
I agree

159
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,640
I haven’t wanted to work here for a long time

160
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,600
Let’s go, hurry

161
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,400
Meeting is starting

162
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,080
You all think you’ve got nerve now, huh?

163
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,200
You don’t want to work anymore, huh?

164
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,040
Fine

165
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,000
All of you, get out

166
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,000
What are you talking about?

167
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,800
The event over there is about to start

168
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,520
Hey

169
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,600
Are you hiding something from me?

170
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,680
No

171
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,200
When did you start lying to me?

172
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,720
Brother Nanfeng will not let me tell you

173
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,000
He was afraid you would worry

174
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,880
What is it? Hurry up and say

175
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,160
At Cheng Yadong’s side,

176
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,840
Almost everyone went on strike

177
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,040
The dance hall, factory, real estate company

178
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,840
are almost crippled

179
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,200
And then?

180
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,600
Then everyone went on strike

181
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,080
All aiming at Brother Nanfeng

182
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,960
Cheng Yadong will surely pin this

183
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,880
on Brother Nanfeng

184
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,880
I heard from the guys on the street

185
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,000
Cheng Yadong has already gathered people

186
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,000
I am afraid this is bad for Brother Nanfeng

187
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,440
Got it. Head to the venue first

188
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,800
Zheng Nanfeng’s company name

189
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,560
is really well chosen

190
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,240
Soaring Network

191
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,880
It has truly sent him sky high

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,600
The business has expanded overseas

193
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,000
Yeah

194
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,480
His growth is truly rocket fast

195
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,720
If we do not keep up

196
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,800
we will miss the ride

197
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,280
Sorry to keep you waiting

198
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,440
Just in time

199
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,320
We were waiting for you to be the finale

200
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,800
Then let us begin

201
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,680
Hello, Mr. Zheng

202
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,600
I am a reporter from Seaside City Daily

203
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,600
May I ask,

204
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,840
this International Logistics Project

205
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,240
covers how many overseas countries?

206
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,680
What is the economic scale of its operations?

207
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,600
Our entire overseas logistics channels

208
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,200
are planned to build up step by step

209
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,600
First, we will reach Europe

210
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,600
Second, we will reach the Middle East

211
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,560
Third will be returning to

212
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,800
the Asian region around us

213
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,400
As for our overall business layout,

214
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,840
will be more like a

215
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,040
Hello?

216
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,240
Okay

217
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,480
Got it

218
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,120
the Asian region around us

219
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,640
Our entire business sector plan

220
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,280
is like a boomerang

221
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,320
Any other questions, everyone?

222
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,640
Is this true?

223
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,800
Absolutely true

224
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,280
I did as you said

225
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,280
I had two brothers check it out

226
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,440
Cheng Yadong has gathered a group of people

227
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,000
They have all set off now

228
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,400
Sister Zhiyi

229
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,800
Shall we cancel the press conference?

230
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,280
No

231
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,680
So many reporters and businesspeople are here

232
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,200
Canceling now will surely have a negative impact

233
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,120
It will hurt the project

234
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,400
If Cheng Yadong brings that many people here,

235
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,440
and surrounds the venue,

236
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,640
what do we do with these people?

237
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,240
Should we inform Zheng Nanfeng?

238
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,600
We cannot let him get distracted now

239
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,880
Do this: take the rest of our people

240
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,000
and gather at the venue entrance

241
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,400
Will we make it in time?

242
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,680
Do it as soon as possible

243
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,680
I will figure out the rest

244
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,640
Okay

245
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,120
I miss you

246
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,040
Whenever dusk falls

247
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,920
the evening breeze starts to blow

248
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,760
I miss you

249
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,760
The riddle of life

250
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,880
Try not to see it clearly

251
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,280
Close your eyes

252
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,480
Do not respond

253
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,480
The night wind blows and blows

254
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,160
Go with the wind

255
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,600
Tonight, children, do not cry in secret

256
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,760
Do not cry in secret

257
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,600
The night wind blows and blows

258
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,280
Go with the wind

259
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,440
As night falls with the stars,

260
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,440
fall gently asleep

261
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,880
Feel the evening breeze
