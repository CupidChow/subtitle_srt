1
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,080
Zhiyi, are you okay

2
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,080
Cheng Yadong

3
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,240
I really did not expect it

4
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,440
you could do something like this

5
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,080
I was forced

6
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,960
Xie Jiachang has gone crazy

7
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,080
Where is A Qiang

8
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,960
I am asking you, where is A Qiang

9
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,280
I do not know where A Qiang is

10
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,000
Tell me honestly

11
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,640
Locked up by that Xie

12
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,760
No matter what

13
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,080
whatever it costs today

14
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,320
I will get you out safely

15
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,120
Trust me

16
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,600
Go

17
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,680
Go

18
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,080
A Shan, A-Quan

19
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,880
Boss

20
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,720
Where are the other brothers

21
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,840
The brothers are busy at Warehouse No. 4

22
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,480
Xie Jiachang is mad

23
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,480
We cannot stay at the dock

24
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,640
Call the brothers and pull out fast

25
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,480
Yes

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,680
Boss, I will lead the way

27
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,200
Go

28
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,800
Go

29
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,840
Well, well

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,960
That cigar of yours is not bad

31
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,480
You dare betray me

32
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,200
Why split you and me

33
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,600
We are all brothers

34
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,840
Boss Xie

35
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,480
This woman tried to run

36
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,200
I dragged her back

37
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,120
Really

38
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,000
Then sorry to trouble you, Boss Cheng

39
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,600
Then do me a favor and tie her back up

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,040
Cheng Yadong

41
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,840
What am I supposed to say to you

42
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,120
After all these years

43
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,640
Haven't you done enough lousy things

44
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,560
Ah

45
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,520
Why grow a conscience now

46
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,640
Too late

47
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,480
Boss Xie

48
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,080
I owe Zhou Zhiyi too much

49
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,240
Let her go

50
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,640
I will stay with you

51
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,040
Is it okay to go after Zheng Nanfeng

52
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,680
Touched

53
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,120
So touched

54
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,640
Fine

55
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,720
For your devotion

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I promise you

57
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,560
You

58
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,720
call Zheng Nanfeng

59
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,680
Tell him to come

60
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,920
As long as he comes

61
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,360
I will let Zhou Zhiyi go

62
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,840
The two of us brothers will stay to take on Zheng Nanfeng

63
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,600
How about it

64
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,960
Okay

65
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,520
Cheng Yadong, don't

66
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,080
Come here

67
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,880
Don't

68
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,960
This is Zheng Nanfeng

69
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,800
Zheng Nanfeng

70
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,880
Zhou Zhiyi is at the dock warehouse

71
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,800
Don't listen to him

72
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,880
If you want to save her

73
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,440
Brother Chang is here waiting for you

74
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,080
Brother Chang

75
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,400
I want you, Brother Chang

76
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,360
to betray me

77
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,880
Zhou Zhiyi

78
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,240
I will step out to handle something

79
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,320
You know me

80
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,800
There is no way I will not go

81
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,720
This time is not like usual

82
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,640
I do not want to drag the brothers down

83
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,640
Drag down what

84
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,520
You are ditching me on purpose now

85
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,600
Are you trying to tear down my

86
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,840
Loyal and Righteous banner

87
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,040
If I do not come back this time

88
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,840
do not blame me

89
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,440
If I cannot, you carry me back

90
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,120
Why has he not come yet

91
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,920
Does he not want you anymore

92
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,640
Xie Jiachang

93
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,320
I am here

94
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,240
He really came

95
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,280
Your Brother Nanfeng came to save you

96
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,520
Open your eyes wide and watch closely

97
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,760
how I kill him

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,880
Let her go

99
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,200
Let go

100
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,440
Kill him

101
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,920
Nanfeng

102
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,920
I'm here

103
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,400
Nanfeng, hurry, go!

104
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,280
A Ming, go

105
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,120
Go

106
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,120
Don't let him get away, chase!

107
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,840
A Ming

108
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,800
A Ming

109
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,200
A Ming

110
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,560
Go!

111
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,400
A Ming

112
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,080
Go

113
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,320
A Ming

114
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,680
Nanfeng

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,840
Hurry, go!

116
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,560
A Ming

117
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,880
Hurry, go!

118
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,320
A Ming

119
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,200
Go

120
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,120
Go

121
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,280
Do we really have to go?

122
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,000
Are you really ditching me now on purpose?

123
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,720
Are you trying to ruin my loyal and righteous reputation?

124
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,720
I

125
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,480
Du Wenming

126
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,560
Loyal

127
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,400
and

128
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,080
righ-

129
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,920
teous

130
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,240
Are you okay?

131
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,320
I'm fine

132
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,840
Go

133
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,640
Hurry, go!

134
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,600
Nanfeng

135
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,880
Go

136
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,720
Out of the way!

137
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,960
Nanfeng

138
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,200
Nanfeng

139
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
Get out!

140
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,160
Nanfeng

141
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,280
Nanfeng

142
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,120
Get out

143
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,120
Nanfeng

144
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,480
Let go of me

145
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,760
Let go of me

146
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,520
Run

147
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,320
Let go of me

148
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,080
Run!

149
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,560
Think you can run?

150
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,040
You're all dead

151
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,280
Xie Jiachang, let go of me

152
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,680
Xie Jiachang

153
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,520
Don't move

154
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,240
Take one more step and I'll kill her

155
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,200
Let my wife go

156
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,480
What you want is my life

157
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,840
I'll give you my life

158
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,160
Fine

159
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,400
You piece of trash

160
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
Jump off!

161
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,360
Nanfeng, don't!

162
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,880
Even if you jump, he won't let us go

163
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,560
Do you remember what I told you

164
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,760
The story of another world?

165
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,400
Maybe this is my fate

166
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,840
Jump for me

167
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,360
I said jump!

168
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,360
Nanfeng, don't!

169
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,640
If you don't jump, I'll kill her

170
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,080
No!

171
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,040
Xie Jiachang

172
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,360
Remember what you said

173
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,440
Or even as a ghost, I'll kill you

174
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,400
Zheng Nanfeng

175
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,440
If there is a next life,

176
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,600
I don't want to meet you again

177
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
Zhiyi

178
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,640
No!

179
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,760
Nanfeng, don't jump

180
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,040
Zheng Nanfeng, don't!

181
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,560
No!

182
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,000
Don't jump

183
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,360
I love you

184
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,640
Nanfeng

185
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,560
Don't jump

186
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,120
No!

187
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,880
Zheng Nanfeng

188
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,720
Starting today,

189
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,440
I won't let you suffer even the slightest grievance

190
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,040
I'll never let you down again in this life

191
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,280
I love you

192
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,120
Me too

193
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,000
Nanfeng

194
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,320
You two have been cold with each other for 49 days

195
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,200
Is this ever going to end or what?

196
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,960
Hey

197
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,600
Yanhong

198
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,000
Your technique is not what it used to be

199
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,200
What is up with you?

200
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,480
Tomorrow is Master Qin's 66th birthday banquet

201
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,640
The cafe owner across the street

202
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,560
Liu Shijie and A-Chang will both come

203
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,960
They are our arch-enemies

204
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,840
Do not let them laugh at us again

205
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,640
Eat well and drink well

206
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,560
Still mad?

207
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,960
Come on, you two are an old married couple

208
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,800
Wife

209
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,320
Watch what you say

210
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,560
Who are you calling your wife?

211
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:22,560
No

212
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,720
You slept with me

213
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,600
And you will not take responsibility?

214
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,720
You, let me tell you—

215
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,920
Do you know you were wrong?

216
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,240
I...

217
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,720
Xie Jiachang

218
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,200
I was wrong

219
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,120
I...

220
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,320
I should love you a little more than I do now

221
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,760
You had better

222
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,400
I know

223
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:54,960
No

224
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,720
You—

225
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,080
Youyou

226
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,400
Give me a kiss

227
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,480
Come on, give me a kiss

228
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,640
I miss you

229
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,560
Whenever dusk falls

230
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,440
The evening breeze rises

231
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,280
I miss you

232
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,280
Life's answer

233
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,400
Try not to see it clearly

234
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,800
Close your eyes

235
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,000
Do not answer

236
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,000
The evening breeze blows and blows

237
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,680
Go with the wind

238
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,120
Tonight, children, do not cry in secret

239
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,280
Do not cry in secret

240
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,120
The evening breeze blows and blows

241
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,800
Go with the wind

242
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,960
With the nightfall and the stars

243
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,960
Drift gently to sleep

244
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,400
Feel the evening breeze
