1
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,920
Get up

2
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,600
You pervert! Ouch!

3
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,240
Feisty.

4
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:54,760
Pervert!

5
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,560
I like 'em feisty.

6
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,440
Pervert!

7
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,760
Who are you?

8
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,320
Get lost!

9
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,560
Let's go, Zheng Nanfeng.

10
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,600
Go.

11
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,840
Ugh!

12
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,920
You dare hit me?

13
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,360
I...

14
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,360
I'll make sure you never work in showbiz again!

15
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,840
I'll blacklist you!

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,680
Sis.

17
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,400
Should we call the police?

18
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,800
Charge him with harassment and assault.

19
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,240
Make him rot in jail.

20
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,880
Then the whole crew will know.

21
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,880
I'm not humiliated enough already?

22
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,480
I should've never gone to his room today.

23
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
Who knew he'd be such a creep?

24
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,640
Alright, alright.

25
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,280
Stop crying.

26
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,400
Something about this feels off to me.

27
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,000
Well, luckily I got there early.

28
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,480
Nothing major happened.

29
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,800
You don't understand.

30
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,880
Now I've lost my Sixth Female Role.

31
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,240
That's what I'm upset about!

32
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,600
It's just a Sixth Female Role.

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,080
What's the big deal?

34
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,000
What's the name of your show?

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,800
*A Dream's Prime*.

36
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,000
Never even heard of it.

37
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,680
It's ninety-nine percent a crap film.

38
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,000
So you're not acting in it, so what?

39
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,120
I can't even get a role in a crap film.

40
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,480
Where am I supposed to find one?

41
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,600
Just waiting for me?

42
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,120
Zheng Nanfeng.

43
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,400
Didn't you say my sister would be a star soon?

44
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,240
Think of something!

45
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,920
Rumeng, what's the name of your show's director again?

46
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,400
Du Xuefeng.

47
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,080
Rumeng.

48
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,200
I'll write a script for you.

49
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,040
Tailor-made.

50
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,400
Guaranteed to make you a sensation.

51
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,640
Since when...

52
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,120
...could you write scripts?

53
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,200
Esteemed teachers.

54
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,920
This...

55
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,680
...can't be considered plagiarism, right?

56
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,640
It cannot.

57
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,000
So, this Fan Shan...

58
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,240
Did he ever find out who killed his mother?

59
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,080
We'll have to wait until season eight to find out.

60
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,840
A prodigious talent!

61
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,720
A prodigious talent!

62
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,000
This is the best script I've ever read.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,920
Bar none.

64
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,200
Not a single word needs changing.

65
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,120
Start filming immediately!

66
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,480
Director...

67
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,200
We're not filming *A Dream's Prime* anymore.

68
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,280
What *A Dream's Prime*?

69
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,440
Or *Eight Dreams' Prime*?

70
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,240
Now that we have *The Year of Celebration*,

71
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,280
why film *A Dream's Prime*?

72
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,120
Notify everyone.

73
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,280
The *A Dream's Prime* crew

74
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,200
is disbanded effective immediately.

75
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,400
Reassemble a crew for *The Year of Celebration*.

76
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,440
Hey, hey, hey!

77
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,800
I just showed it to you for feedback.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,400
I didn't say you could film it!

79
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,600
Whatever your demands are,

80
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,240
I agree to them all.

81
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,320
Huh?

82
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,360
Well...

83
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,920
Conditions...

84
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,000
Let me think carefully.

85
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,200
Lock down the hotel.

86
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,400
Keep an eye on him.

87
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,720
I'll go consult the boss.

88
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,800
We must secure this script.

89
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,520
A prodigious talent!

90
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,080
A prodigious talent!

91
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,400
A prodigious talent!

92
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,040
A prodigious talent!

93
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,440
Is that so?

94
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,480
Absolutely true.

95
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,400
This *The Year of Celebration* script

96
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,600
is a once-in-a-century find.

97
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,720
I firmly believe once it's released,

98
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,240
it will become a cinematic classic.

99
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,880
Therefore,

100
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,240
the company must find a way to buy it.

101
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
Director Du.

102
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
You know,

103
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,400
I actually...

104
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,400
...don't care if the project makes money.

105
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,280
What I value more

106
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,760
is the other resources

107
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,440
the film can bring me.

108
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,440
You know what I mean?

109
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,080
I understand perfectly.

110
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,440
Once this project enters the preparation phase,

111
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,520
everything you want can be realized.

112
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,400
Chairman Xu

113
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,080
This is the screenwriter, Zheng Nanfeng.

114
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,040
Chairman Xu.

115
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,000
Truly a man of impressive appearance.

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,800
Please, have a seat.

117
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,840
I've read your script.

118
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,640
It's truly a rare and excellent script.

119
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,120
The concept of a modern person
traveling back to ancient times

120
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,920
is portrayed to perfection.

121
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,400
Hahaha, I like it very much.

122
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,400
Our Chairman Xu

123
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,800
is praising someone for the first time.

124
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,880
You're very lucky.

125
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,520
Thank you for your approval, Chairman Xu.

126
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,320
As for me,

127
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,520
I've just entered the film industry.

128
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,720
It's precisely when I need talented people.

129
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,400
I'd like to hear your thoughts.

130
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,080
If there's an opportunity,

131
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,800
we could collaborate long-term.

132
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,600
I can offer you

133
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,240
an annual salary of one million.

134
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,920
How about it?

135
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,080
Chairman Xu,

136
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,200
I'm very grateful you appreciate my script.

137
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,080
But I actually wrote it

138
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
on a whim.

139
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,040
I didn't consider it a long-term endeavor.

140
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,800
So, let's forget about long-term cooperation.

141
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,920
Young Zheng,

142
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,280
think this through carefully.

143
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,000
I've never seen anyone refuse a million.

144
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,480
And it brings both fame and fortune.

145
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,880
Since you've come to me,

146
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,880
it means you want something.

147
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,640
I'm also curious.

148
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,800
If you seek neither fame nor profit,

149
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,280
then what

150
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,520
are you after?

151
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,280
I can give you the script for "The Year of Celebration"

152
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,200
free of charge.

153
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,520
Let the company film it for free.

154
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,800
But I have only one condition.

155
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,320
The female lead for this drama

156
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,640
must be chosen by me.

157
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,600
You already have a first choice?

158
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,200
Yes, she's right outside.

159
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,880
Rumeng.

160
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,320
Everything else can be agreed to,

161
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,080
but not this condition.

162
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,520
Since Chairman Xu is already here,

163
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,400
let's take a look first.

164
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,120
Chairman Xu, this is the actress Xu Rumeng.

165
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,600
This script of mine

166
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
was written specifically for her.

167
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,400
I was wondering for a long time

168
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,680
who this leading lady was.

169
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,000
Hahaha.

170
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,560
Seeing is better than hearing the name.

171
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,000
Isn't this the famous Chairman Xu?

172
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,440
What brings you to investing in film and TV now?

173
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,120
You must have some other purpose, right?

174
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,040
Rumeng, you know Chairman Xu?

175
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,880
In Shengang,

176
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,120
Chairman Xu is a famous entrepreneur.

177
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,600
He's practically a household name.

178
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
Who doesn't know him?

179
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,280
Um, Chairman Xu, Director,

180
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,720
As for Rumeng,

181
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,040
she has acting skills,

182
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,400
she has solid foundation,

183
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,760
and she's excellent at understanding a character's heart.

184
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,800
I think she's the only choice for our female lead.

185
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,840
No rush.

186
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,640
Everyone,

187
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,320
let's have a drink first.

188
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,880
Alright.

189
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,680
Thank you.

190
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,600
What's wrong?

191
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,000
Nanfeng,

192
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
let's not work with him.

193
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,000
I don't like this Chairman Xu.

194
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,880
Xu Rumeng!

195
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,040
What kind of attitude is that?

196
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,680
How dare you speak to Chairman Xu like that!

197
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,000
Is there some history between you two?

198
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,400
Yes, he's bullied me more than once.

199
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,560
Chairman Xu,

200
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Well, since

201
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,440
you and Rumeng have some unpleasantness,

202
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,640
then we

203
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
should just not cooperate.

204
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,000
Let's go.

205
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,120
Whether we cooperate or not

206
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,520
is another matter.

207
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,320
I'd like to ask a question.

208
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,120
Miss Xu,

209
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,040
as an actress,

210
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,240
how do you view the relationship

211
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,680
between Fan Shan and his father in the script?

212
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,800
Although Fan Shan is not his biological son,

213
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,680
Father Fan deeply cares for Fan Shan.

214
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,600
Fan Shan naturally is filial to his parents.

215
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,400
In contrast, some fathers,

216
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,960
even with their own biological child,

217
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,120
don't let them feel a trace of familial warmth.

218
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,280
In this world, what parent

219
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,760
doesn't care for their own child?

220
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,600
You're being a bit extreme.

221
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,000
I've heard

222
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Chairman Xu is someone whose heart is only for work,

223
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,320
with no room for family, right?

224
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
Xu Rumeng!

225
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,920
What is your attitude!

226
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,720
How are you speaking to the Chairman!

227
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,400
Get out!

228
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,200
Director Du,

229
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
this topic was brought up by Chairman Xu.

230
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
What grievances they have between them,

231
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,240
I don't know, but as outsiders, the two of us

232
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,520
shouldn't we refrain from interrupting?

233
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,800
Zheng Nanfeng,

234
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,800
I admire you as a talent,

235
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,080
but don't forget,

236
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,040
no matter how good the script is,

237
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,280
you're still just Party B.

238
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,040
You don't even have the basic sense to respect Party A.

239
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,640
You no longer have the right to choose.

240
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,880
Stop arguing.

241
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,120
The director says I have no right to choose.

242
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,560
So, do I have it or not?

243
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,480
Dad, you tell me.

244
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,440
Dad.

245
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,360
Rumeng.

246
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,360
Your dad

247
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,600
does owe you.

248
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,160
But

249
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,440
I've been wanting to make it up to you.

250
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,600
Don't you know

251
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,120
I invested in movies precisely for you?

252
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,400
To pave the way for you.

253
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,240
Nanfeng, let's go.

254
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,200
Rumeng.

255
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,640
Your dad hasn't finished speaking.

256
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,480
Rumeng.

257
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,200
Uncle

258
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,880
Could you please stop pacing back and forth?

259
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,280
It's making me dizzy.

260
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,240
Youyou, your sister...

261
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,880
Is she still unwilling to come home?

262
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,600
I've already called her.

263
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,720
She'll come.

264
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,520
She's definitely brushing me off again.

265
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,200
Call her again.

266
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,920
No need to call.

267
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,800
Rumeng, you're finally back.

268
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,280
Come, come, come.

269
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,280
Oh, you're not mad at Dad anymore, are you?

270
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,800
You were in such a hurry to see me.

271
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
What brings you back?

272
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,480
You came back to Shengang and didn't even think to come home.

273
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,320
How long has it been since you were home?

274
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,920
Isn't that just following your example?

275
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,280
Focusing on my career.

276
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Let's not bring up today's unpleasantness.

277
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,720
I just want to ask...

278
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,880
What's going on between you and that Zheng Nanfeng?

279
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,600
We're friends.

280
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,880
Friends?

281
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,120
Mm-hmm.

282
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,680
He gave up a huge writing fee.

283
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,600
Wanted nothing.

284
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,000
His only condition was for you to be the lead actress.

285
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
He cares that much?

286
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,800
Is that really just a simple friendship?

287
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,120
He's her boyfriend.

288
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,520
Boyfriend?

289
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,280
Ha ha ha!

290
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,280
Rumeng, oh Rumeng...

291
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,480
All these years...

292
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,080
This is the only thing you've done that pleases me.

293
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,720
Mm, this Zheng Nanfeng...

294
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,320
He's truly one of a kind.

295
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,120
This son-in-law...

296
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,760
I accept him.

297
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,120
What son-in-law?

298
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,280
He's not my boyfriend now.

299
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,400
He can only be considered an ex-boyfriend.

300
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,560
How did he become an ex-boyfriend?

301
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,480
He has feelings for another woman in his heart.

302
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,480
But that woman has a husband.

303
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,320
At first, her...

304
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,520
husband went missing.

305
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,360
Later, her husband reappeared.

306
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,520
He was forced to break up and only then came to Shengang.

307
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,960
What a mess!

308
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,280
Anyway, the point is...

309
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,520
He doesn't like me now.

310
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,520
There's another woman in his heart now.

311
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,720
That can't be right.

312
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,680
He cares so much about your affairs.

313
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,600
That's a level of care money can't buy.

314
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,680
You wouldn't believe me even if I told you.

315
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,920
This Zheng Nanfeng...

316
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,920
is talented,

317
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,800
and not driven by fame or fortune.

318
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,760
Among the younger generation,

319
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,120
he's absolutely outstanding.

320
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,200
I don't care what kind of woman he likes.

321
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,080
This son-in-law of his...

322
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,280
I've decided on him.

323
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,520
Dad, don't get involved.

324
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,120
I'll handle my own affairs.

325
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,000
If you could handle it, you would have already.

326
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,520
This matter requires my personal intervention.

327
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,360
Dad!

328
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,400
Don't you leave the house again.

329
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,000
If you run off once more,

330
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,720
where am I supposed to find you?

331
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,120
Youyou, keep an eye on your sister.

332
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,960
Yes, Uncle.

333
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,520
Hey, Dad!

334
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,800
Dad, what do you mean?

335
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,760
Stop following me.

336
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,560
Sis...

337
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,480
How dare I disobey Uncle's orders?

338
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,600
If he gets angry,

339
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,160
I'll lose my salary.

340
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,640
For the next few days,

341
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,480
just settle down, okay?

342
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,960
Rumeng, where did you run off to?

343
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,280
My dad has me under house arrest.

344
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,080
Your dad has you under house arrest?

345
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,480
Yeah.

346
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,880
Come save me, quick!

347
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,160
I miss you.

348
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,080
Whenever dusk arrives,

349
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,960
and the evening breeze rises,

350
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,800
I miss you.

351
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,800
Life's mysteries,

352
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,920
try not to see them clearly.

353
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,320
Close your eyes,

354
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,520
don't respond.

355
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,520
The evening breeze blows and blows,

356
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,200
go with the wind.

357
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,640
Tonight, child, don't cry in secret.

358
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,800
Don't cry in secret.

359
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,640
The evening breeze blows and blows,

360
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,320
go with the wind.

361
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,480
With the night's curtain and stars,

362
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,480
gently fall asleep.

363
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,920
Blow, evening breeze.
