1
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,200
Wife

2
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,000
I love you so much

3
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,240
Please don't leave me, okay?

4
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,280
Don't leave me

5
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,320
Yadong, Yadong

6
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,400
Yadong, calm down

7
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,680
Yadong, let go of me

8
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,040
Cheng Yadong, don't do this

9
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,320
Cheng Yadong, calm down

10
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,080
Don't

11
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,320
Don't do this

12
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,120
Cheng Yadong, let go of me

13
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,280
You are my wife

14
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,200
You still have Zheng Nanfeng on your mind

15
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,000
Right?

16
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,480
Ah

17
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,200
Zhiyi

18
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,680
Zhiyi

19
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I was wrong

20
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,120
I apologize

21
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,120
I got a bit impatient just now

22
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,920
I didn't consider your feelings

23
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,720
While I was away these years, I was anxious and insecure

24
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,440
I'm really afraid of losing you

25
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,520
I hope you can understand me

26
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,920
If I didn't understand you

27
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,040
I would've left long ago

28
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,680
What hurts me isn't how you treat me

29
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,040
It's how you treat everyone else

30
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,120
Do you know what the old brothers

31
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,320
say about you behind your back?

32
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,440
They say you changed

33
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,120
Even A Qiang was pushed out by you

34
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,400
It's my fault

35
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,720
But please think about me too

36
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,920
Ever since that Zheng Nanfeng stirred things up

37
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,280
Everyone takes his side

38
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,880
What am I supposed to do?

39
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
That's no excuse for doing that

40
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,720
Fine

41
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,600
I'll reflect

42
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,840
I will change

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,120
Please trust me, okay?

44
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,800
Think about how we made it back then

45
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,280
We fought hard together

46
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,040
We fought with our brothers against

47
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,840
Xie Jiachang

48
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,000
You haven't forgotten, have you?

49
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,360
These years I was on the run

50
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,440
I really wronged you

51
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,560
But now I'm also

52
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,280
working desperately to make it up to you

53
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,600
Do you still remember what

54
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
I told you back then

55
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,040
When I make it

56
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,920
I will give you a grand wedding

57
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,680
I think I can make it happen now

58
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,000
Zhiyi

59
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,840
If you don't speak, I'll take it as you agreed

60
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,640
I'll go arrange it right now

61
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,240
Come back with me, okay?

62
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,120
I'm begging you

63
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,600
You're so far away

64
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:47,960
What's wrong?

65
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,560
Mm

66
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,520
It's nothing

67
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,480
Just a bit tired

68
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,040
Don't deny it

69
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,640
I know what's on your mind

70
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,640
You miss Zhiyi, right?

71
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,720
Since you can't let her go

72
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,320
Then go back to Haicheng

73
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,400
I support you

74
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,320
I support you too

75
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,120
Didn't you say

76
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,040
you wanted to build offline channels

77
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,200
and develop the logistics business?

78
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,200
Shengang's base is too small

79
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,880
To develop logistics

80
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,040
you still need to go back to the mainland

81
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,840
It's a good chance to go back

82
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,840
Mm

83
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,440
Okay

84
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,920
Then let's move the company back to Haicheng

85
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,840
Okay

86
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,080
This one looks good

87
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,320
I think that one is good too

88
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,480
How about trying that one?

89
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,200
I feel they're all about the same

90
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,120
Try it, Zhiyi

91
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,880
What do you think?

92
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
Not bad

93
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,600
I think it looks good too

94
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,240
I'll go answer a call

95
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,840
Have you figured it all out?

96
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,920
Figured what out?

97
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,640
Ever since Zheng Nanfeng left,

98
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,920
you seem like a different person.

99
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,520
Listless all day long.

100
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,920
Don't talk nonsense.

101
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,120
You can't fool me.

102
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,400
I know in your heart

103
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,880
you've always liked Zheng Nanfeng.

104
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,080
He has always loved you too.

105
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
Otherwise he wouldn't have dropped

106
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,600
everything here to go to Shengang.

107
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,400
I admit it.

108
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,520
I do like Zheng Nanfeng.

109
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,120
Then why are you still messing around with Boss Cheng?

110
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,600
And still planning a make-up wedding?

111
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,200
Things have come this far.

112
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
I have no choice.

113
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,800
Zheng Nanfeng has gone to Shengang too.

114
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,480
He won't come back again.

115
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,680
What do you mean no choice?

116
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,200
If you can't let him go,

117
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,440
I can help you go find Zheng Nanfeng.

118
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,200
Let it be.

119
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,600
I accept my fate too.

120
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,720
I'll just live like this.

121
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,440
No.

122
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,680
Why do you have to be like that?

123
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,560
Alright, A Ming has decided.

124
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,520
Zhiyi.

125
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,400
How about this one?

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,240
Looks good, let's go with this one.

127
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,720
Okay, then this one.

128
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,480
A Ming, what do you think?

129
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,640
Looks good.

130
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,000
Right? I think it looks good too.

131
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,320
Let's settle on this one.

132
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,320
Who are you?

133
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,520
Beat him up!

134
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,840
Punk.

135
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,520
If you ever again try to manipulate Madam behind our backs,

136
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,080
Careful, or we'll end your life.

137
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:33,600
Go.

138
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,480
I, Du Wenming, consider myself loyal and righteous.

139
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,320
We have been Brothers for so many years.

140
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,320
Yet you treat me like this.

141
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,040
Starting today,

142
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,080
I will sever all ties with you.

143
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,520
Ah.

144
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,040
Ah.

145
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,800
A Qiang is here.

146
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,720
Kid, you came late, drink.

147
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,800
Wow.

148
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,600
A Qiang, what are you doing?

149
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,000
Uh,

150
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,800
Youyou.

151
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,000
Last time you asked if it was a romance or a disaster film.

152
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,520
I really don't get it.

153
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,120
So I bought tickets for all the movies.

154
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,120
As long as you want to watch,

155
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,920
any one is fine.

156
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,800
Wow, so romantic.

157
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,800
Who did you learn this from?

158
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,840
I thought of it myself.

159
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,400
These few movie tickets

160
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
and you want to woo me with them?

161
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,120
And

162
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,000
are you dumb?

163
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,520
The 26th.

164
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,240
We are all heading back to Haicheng.

165
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,440
I forgot.

166
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,520
Anyway,

167
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,240
Being late means a penalty of three drinks.

168
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Three drinks?

169
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,040
Yeah.

170
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,240
I'll take the penalty.

171
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,320
Three drinks.

172
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,320
For the third, let's drink together.

173
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,680
Come on.

174
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,240
Listen,

175
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,840
In a few days A Qiang and I will go back to Haicheng.

176
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,400
Youyou is getting ready to come with us.

177
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,280
What are your plans here?

178
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,120
I am starting a new film soon.

179
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,400
When I finish, I'll come to Haicheng to hang out with you.

180
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,800
Okay, big star.

181
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,120
Ah.

182
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,520
Ah.

183
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,520
Punk.

184
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,320
If you ever again try to manipulate Madam behind our backs,

185
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,720
Careful, or we'll end your life.

186
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,760
Go.

187
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,640
Hello?

188
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,120
A Ming,

189
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,840
Why do you sound so weak?

190
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,680
Did something happen?

191
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,520
What's wrong with Brother Feng?

192
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,080
A Qiang, go book it.

193
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,600
The earliest flight tomorrow morning.

194
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,520
Back to Haicheng.

195
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,640
Okay.

196
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,880
Why don't I see A Ming?

197
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,280
Oh.

198
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,320
Maybe he's busy with something today.

199
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,520
No problem.

200
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,920
I'll call later and ask.

201
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,200
But...

202
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,600
Zhiyi.

203
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,720
You're the bride today.

204
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,640
Put everything else aside, okay?

205
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,720
Dear guests and friends,

206
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,800
Next, let's welcome

207
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,720
the groom and bride to make a dazzling entrance

208
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,200
I once said

209
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,840
Zheng Nanfeng and Zhiyi are made for each other.

210
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,240
I can be mistaken too.

211
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,920
May I ask our groom,

212
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,640
do you take the bride

213
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,160
as your wife?

214
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,400
But...

215
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,600
Fate plays tricks.

216
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,280
And right now Cheng Yadong has come back.

217
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,160
I wonder lately

218
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,480
how Zheng Nanfeng has been.

219
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,680
I watched Zhiyi grow up.

220
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,400
I truly hope she is happy.

221
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,120
I don't want her to feel wronged.

222
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Let's not talk about it, let's not talk about it.

223
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,280
Whether joy or sorrow,

224
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,320
you will love her without reservation.

225
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,520
forever?

226
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,280
I do.

227
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,600
May I ask our bride,

228
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,520
do you

229
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,800
marry the groom as his wife?

230
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,200
I don't.

231
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,720
I miss you.

232
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,640
Whenever dusk falls

233
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,520
the evening breeze rises

234
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,360
I miss you

235
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,360
the riddle of life

236
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,480
try not to see it clearly

237
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,880
close your eyes

238
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,080
do not respond

239
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,080
The night wind blows and blows

240
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,760
go with the wind

241
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,200
Tonight, children, don't cry in secret

242
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,360
Don't cry in secret

243
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,200
The night wind blows and blows

244
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,880
go with the wind

245
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,040
with the nightfall and the stars

246
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,040
drift gently to sleep

247
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,480
the evening breeze blows
