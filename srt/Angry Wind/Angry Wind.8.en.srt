1
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,240
Brazen thug

2
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,680
Talking nonsense

3
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,240
I am a Descendant of the Ma family

4
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,280
a True Celestial Master

5
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,520
I... you, you, you, you, you - what are you?

6
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,920
Li Ergou

7
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,760
from Li Family Village in Hong Kong, China.

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,560
How many times were you arrested for feudal superstition?

9
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,480
Do you still want to be arrested?

10
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,560
Y-you... what are you saying?

11
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,560
I don't understand

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,840
You won't listen to reason

13
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,680
A Qiang, call the police

14
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,920
He is a fiend

15
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,920
Find someone more capable

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,120
Hey, Master, Master!

17
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,480
No, sir

18
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,320
Can't you tell he's a fraud?

19
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,760
You guys aren't scammers, right?

20
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,320
Of course we're not

21
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,080
Sir

22
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,120
I am Zheng Nanfeng, a manager at Yida Real Estate

23
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,560
Ah, right

24
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,360
Also a swindler

25
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,680
You...

26
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,960
Sir, we came today

27
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,160
to ask you to consent to the relocation

28
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,760
But we didn't expect

29
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,520
our competitors also sent people

30
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,720
I will pay for anything broken today

31
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,960
You really are all scammers

32
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,200
Get out

33
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,240
All of you, scram

34
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,280
Let's go

35
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,880
Oh, right, sir

36
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,360
You look pretty robust to me

37
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,040
You are destined to live to a hundred

38
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,320
It's just that you're overworked

39
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,160
Try not to overthink from now on

40
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,920
To be honest with you

41
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,360
My son works away from home all year

42
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,160
He doesn't come back even once a year to see me

43
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,960
I am just a lonely old man

44
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,120
With no one to talk to

45
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,160
Sir

46
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,160
Young people, you know

47
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,920
all want to go out into the world and make their way

48
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,560
I believe

49
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,000
your son is waiting till he earns enough money

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,120
then come back to take good care of you

51
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,560
Alright

52
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,720
Then we won't sign

53
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,120
We are leaving

54
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,040
Take care of your health, sir

55
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,560
Take care of yourself

56
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,640
Wait

57
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,360
I will sign

58
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,080
As for this contract

59
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,960
I have read it all

60
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,960
There is no issue

61
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,160
Manager Zheng is a good man

62
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,160
Entrust the village to him

63
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,440
This old man is reassured

64
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,560
You all should sign as well

65
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,520
Oh

66
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,080
Mr. Zheng is really impressive

67
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,200
The master I hired

68
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,320
You dealt with him so fast

69
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,680
But I think this contract

70
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,720
still cannot be signed

71
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,280
Xie Xun

72
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,560
It has come to a critical point

73
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,760
and you are still picking a fight

74
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,680
Rong

75
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,560
Rong

76
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,080
Uncle Miao

77
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,920
I heard your wife's grave

78
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,040
is in the neighboring Liu Cun

79
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,120
Ah

80
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,480
I have already bought that land in Liu Cun

81
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,160
If you sign this

82
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,560
later I might “accidentally” move her grave

83
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,840
So do not blame me then

84
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,840
Ah

85
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,840
My wife

86
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,240
Sigh, sigh, sigh

87
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,000
Please, please do not touch my wife's grave

88
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,960
Please, sir, I beg you

89
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,960
Calm down, calm down

90
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,840
Calm down

91
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,520
Calm down, calm down

92
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,320
Calm down, calm down

93
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,280
Calm down, calm down

94
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,600
I am not signing

95
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,040
Hey, hey, sir

96
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,040
Do not get worked up, do not get worked up

97
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,840
I am not signing

98
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,360
Uncle Miao

99
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,280
My wife suffered with me her whole life

100
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,840
Only at the end we found this Auspicious Feng Shui Land

101
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,720
If you dig up her grave

102
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,960
then she will never rest in peace

103
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,080
I am not signing, not signing

104
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,960
A bet is a bet

105
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,120
The Dongyang Xincun lot is Xie Rong's now

106
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,280
Many thanks, Master Qin

107
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,760
I did not expect a woman to be this vicious

108
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,320
Even worse than your brother

109
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,120
Zheng Nanfeng

110
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,120
You are no different, acting like a fake mystic

111
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,960
Luckily, I, a mere woman,

112
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,960
have thought up a countermeasure

113
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,320
or your fake-master scheme would have worked

114
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,520
Alright, that is how it is

115
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,160
Since the Dongyang Xincun plot

116
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,240
has been given to Xie Rong

117
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,720
then the Xiliu Tang lot goes to you

118
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,160
Thank you, Master Qin

119
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,560
Businessmen are profit-driven by nature

120
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,080
So, Business is business

121
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,160
No matter which of you develops these two lots

122
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,240
the price

123
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,440
must be doubled

124
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,160
No problem, Master Qin

125
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,240
Master Qin, the Dongyang Xincun plot is good

126
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,760
Even doubling it is fine

127
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,960
Xiliu Tang has no village or shops around

128
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,480
There are no supporting facilities

129
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,160
And you still want it doubled

130
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,080
How can we do this

131
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,520
Whatever Master Qin says, that is the price

132
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,960
Looks like to enter real estate

133
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,480
there is no other way left

134
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,960
I say it will not work

135
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,680
No matter how you calculate it

136
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,560
cost per square meter is at least 1,300 to 1,400

137
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,960
if we do not cut corners

138
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,720
The Xiliu Tang project is destined to lose heavily

139
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,760
If we want to make money

140
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,640
we must set the price at 1,500 or above per sq m

141
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,560
What are you thinking

142
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,560
Haicheng's priciest is only 1,200 per sq m

143
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,520
Ordinary flats are just eight or nine hundred

144
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,440
Nanfeng, what do you think

145
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,760
You cannot come in

146
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,560
You cannot come in

147
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,280
Oh

148
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
You are all here

149
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,520
You must be worried, right

150
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,160
Mr. Zheng and his people forced their way in

151
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,360
I could not stop them

152
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,640
What are you here for

153
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,280
We have known each other so long

154
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,200
I have never paid your company a visit

155
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,960
Your company has just opened

156
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,160
I should at least bring you a gift

157
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,600
Giving a clock

158
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,440
Do you want us to die early or what?

159
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,360
Hey

160
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,720
It's not what I want

161
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,360
That's just the reality

162
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,760
Land in Xiliu Tang has doubled in price

163
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,320
Your cost to build

164
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,360
Is higher than Haicheng's priciest homes

165
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,640
No profit, of course you'll send a clock

166
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,720
How do you know we won't make money?

167
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,960
How will you make money?

168
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,760
With my mouth

169
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,480
At 1,500 per square meter, I profit

170
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,880
The priciest home in Haicheng is 1,200 now

171
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,160
You can sell for 1,500?

172
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,760
Mr. Xie

173
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,240
I made a bet with your brother

174
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,680
Today I want to make a bet with you

175
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,080
We at Yida Real Estate won't just make money,

176
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,920
We'll make enough to bankrupt you

177
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,480
Do you believe that?

178
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,240
Zheng Nanfeng, sometimes I really admire you

179
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,160
Admire your blind confidence

180
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,440
They say confident people have good luck

181
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,040
Leave this clock here for now

182
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,360
When you go under, I'll deliver it to you

183
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,280
Okay

184
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,760
Let's see who this clock ends up with

185
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,960
Let's go

186
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,640
Why stare like that? Is there something on my face?

187
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,640
Why do I feel

188
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,240
The way Xie Rong looks at you

189
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,320
is a bit weird

190
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,560
Is it?

191
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,360
We were just fretting about building

192
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,760
Then you turned and bragged hard to Xie Rong

193
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,360
What on earth are you thinking?

194
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,760
Why are you so nervous?

195
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,880
Have my words ever failed to come true?

196
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,960
What trick do you have now?

197
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,520
Still keeping us in suspense

198
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,760
Top price is a little over one thousand

199
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,720
Then I say I'll sell at 1,500

200
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,520
Doesn't that mean profit?

201
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,480
Layouts then had no Bright living room and bathroom

202
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,120
There was no such concept

203
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,240
We'll make it residential housing

204
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,040
Then flip it around

205
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,960
Next-generation homes

206
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,960
Turnkey delivery

207
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,160
Even I feel tempted hearing this

208
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,960
Though I can't tell what he's saying,

209
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,480
I still think it can work

210
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,120
When we hand over the homes,

211
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,280
as employee benefits,

212
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,120
everyone gets one unit

213
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
Really, really

214
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,160
Really

215
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,520
Thanks, Brother Feng

216
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,160
Okay, okay, okay

217
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,160
Come, come, come, come, come

218
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,360
Next Monday,

219
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,680
Xiliu Tang village holds a relocation meeting

220
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,240
Relocation

221
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,120
Meeting

222
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,440
Still not asleep this late?

223
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,480
Got something on your mind?

224
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,760
Nanfeng, let me ask you

225
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,040
Your plan is good, sure,

226
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,680
but there's a key problem

227
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,160
How do you plan to solve it?

228
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,760
Funding, right?

229
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,720
Given the scale of our plot,

230
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,280
Banks won't release full loans

231
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,160
for relocation

232
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,280
I've considered that

233
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,760
I'll find another way

234
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,240
What do you mean?

235
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,280
These are the title deeds for the villa and dance hall

236
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,840
I plan to pledge the houses to fund the company

237
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,760
No

238
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,760
The hall and the house are your safeguard

239
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,040
The company can go under

240
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,960
The house you keep in reserve can't be touched

241
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,360
If the company goes under,

242
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,080
A Ming, A Qiang, and so many in the company

243
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,760
would all lose their jobs

244
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,960
What would they do?

245
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,040
Besides,

246
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,920
Are you willing to lose to Xie Rong?

247
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,560
Give me a bit more time

248
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,560
I'll think of a way

249
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,200
Alright,

250
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,680
You hold the title deed for now

251
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,680
Use it or not, how to use it—your call

252
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,520
Sis Zhiyi, Xu Rumeng's been absent five days

253
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,280
I called Shengang, no one picks up

254
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,760
Could Xie Rong and his guys have taken her?

255
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,040
That woman is playing dirty again

256
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,480
Come on, let's go find her

257
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,360
Sis

258
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,760
Where have you been these days?

259
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,720
It’s not Rumeng

260
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,920
Where have you been these past few days?

261
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,320
We were just about to go out to find you

262
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,680
We all thought Xie Rong kidnapped you again

263
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,760
Asking around everywhere

264
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,560
So you were all this worried about me

265
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,760
Looks like this trip wasn’t for nothing

266
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,240
You still have the nerve to laugh

267
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,120
Look how you had the three of us panicking

268
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,960
Since you were so anxious,

269
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,560
I’ll give you a reward

270
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,160
This is one million

271
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,160
Not you

272
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,160
Where did you get so much money?

273
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,960
Don’t worry about that

274
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,920
Just take it and use it for the company

275
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,160
If you won’t tell me where this money came from,

276
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,760
I refuse to use it

277
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,920
I took it out as a bank loan

278
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,760
For the loan, what did you use as collateral?

279
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,880
Banks over in Hong Kong, China are more developed

280
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,560
I told them about our project

281
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,360
They readily gave me the loan

282
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,320
That simple?

283
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,760
Just that simple

284
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,160
We didn’t say it was from the family

285
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,320
Otherwise they would never accept it

286
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,880
Then for the loan you should also

287
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,880
discuss it with us

288
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,680
Alright, Rumeng did it for everyone

289
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,960
Let’s leave it at that for now

290
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,000
We’re all one family

291
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,480
It’s only right we shoulder things together

292
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,560
Alright, alright

293
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,560
Next time there’s something,

294
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,720
I’ll definitely tell you in advance

295
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,640
Okay?

296
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,600
Okay

297
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,440
The funds are in place

298
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,960
Next, it’s your home turf

299
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,480
Have you decided how to spend it?

300
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,560
Ah

301
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,280
This money,

302
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,440
we need to spend it in parts

303
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,560
I miss you

304
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,480
Whenever dusk arrives

305
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,360
The evening breeze rises

306
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,200
I miss you

307
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,200
Life’s answer

308
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,320
Try not to see it clearly

309
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,720
Close your eyes

310
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,920
Don’t respond

311
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,920
The evening wind blows and blows

312
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,600
Go with the wind

313
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,040
Tonight, children, don’t cry in secret

314
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,200
Don’t cry in secret

315
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,040
The evening wind blows and blows

316
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,720
Go with the wind

317
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,880
As night falls with stars

318
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,880
Gently drift to sleep

319
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,320
Catch the evening breeze
