1
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,966
DESTINED WITH YOU

2
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,695
In this life…

3
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:14,783
and in the past life…

4
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:19,954
I love you.

5
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:30,840
Don't cry.

6
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,843
We got to meet again like this.

7
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,933
We had a very hard time.

8
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,438
Right?

9
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,368
Sorry to interrupt…

10
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,622
but the police are here.

11
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,714
We've been on a stakeout around here,
but Na didn't appear.

12
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,675
I think he just tried to lure you out.

13
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,802
It might be dangerous,
so you should go home.

14
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,011
I understand.

15
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:20,098
-Please focus more on the investigation.
-We will.

16
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,548
Is it okay for you to drive?

17
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,885
I've been living
with my parents these days.

18
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:01,347
I've been eating well
and am recovering well, so don't worry.

19
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,810
You can drop me off here.
I'll take a bus back.

20
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,145
You don't need to.

21
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,484
We're going to stay together,
just the two of us.

22
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:18,364
Doors opening.

23
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,492
Hold on.

24
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,600
Doors closing.

25
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,609
Have a seat here.

26
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,069
I'll reapply the ointment.

27
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,240
It still hurts a lot, right?

28
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,410
If you're so worried about me,
why did you leave me alone?

29
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,831
I did it for you.

30
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,585
Promise me
you will never disappear from my sight.

31
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,588
I promise.

32
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,384
Words are not enough.

33
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,064
Once isn't enough either.

34
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,233
Seriously…

35
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,710
Wait, I…

36
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,962
My hands.

37
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,089
Hands.

38
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:02,427
I should wash my hands
before disinfecting your wound.

39
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,722
Right. You should wash your hands
before disinfecting the wound.

40
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,933
I should go drink water then.

41
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,691
Sleep now.

42
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,401
I can't sleep.

43
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,446
I'll sing a lullaby.

44
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:31,289
Sleep, my baby

45
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,375
I'm not a baby.

46
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:35,960
That's why I can't sleep.

47
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,095
We can't sleep like this.

48
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,638
I think so too.

49
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,641
I'll sleep outside.

50
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,727
No. I'll sleep outside.

51
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,312
Stay here, you're sick.

52
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,147
I can't make you sleep on the sofa.

53
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,523
No, I'm fine.

54
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,643
Who is it?

55
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,649
Well…

56
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,736
My parents.

57
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,489
What?

58
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,450
What should we do?

59
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,202
Where do I hide?

60
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,621
Men normally hide in such cases.
Where? The closet?

61
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,498
Why would you hide? You live here.

62
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,666
You're right.

63
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,545
Wait, why are we hiding? Let's not hide.

64
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,215
But I didn't even wash my face.

65
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:06,050
You look fine.

66
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,094
You're always pretty.

67
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:10,763
You're lying.

68
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,098
I mean it.

69
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,438
So where do I hide? Where should I go?

70
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,522
Hold on.

71
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:30,199
I was too out of it
in the hospital last time.

72
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,493
Let me introduce myself officially.

73
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,495
I'm Lee Hong-jo.

74
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,041
Have a seat. Sit down.

75
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,251
Come on.

76
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,051
Hong-jo.

77
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,721
Why are you so selfish?

78
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,266
He was sick.

79
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,226
He was even stabbed.

80
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,854
Why are you clinging
to someone who almost died?

81
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,649
She didn't cling to me.

82
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,485
You haven't called the whole day

83
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,653
and you didn't pick up the whole night.

84
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,114
Do you have any idea
how much we were worried?

85
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,994
-I'm sorry.
-Why are you apologizing?

86
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,038
Lower your vocal cord.

87
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,458
Voice, not vocal cord.

88
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:29,091
You just started dating and you're
hanging out in your boyfriend's place.

89
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,384
Do your parents know this?

90
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,264
Why would you bring up her parents now?

91
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,266
He's right.

92
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,269
Do you really have to be
so old-fashioned here?

93
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,147
This is about basic manners
and common sense.

94
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,527
How could you act like that
knowing that he's sick?

95
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,738
And this all happened
because of your stalker.

96
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:55,535
If you have any conscience,
you should feel guilty to meet Sin-yu.

97
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,078
Father.

98
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,037
I'm sorry.

99
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,375
I stayed away from him
because I felt guilty

100
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,461
and I even thought of breaking up,

101
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,256
but I can't.

102
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:12,218
I like Sin-yu very much.

103
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,183
I can't approve this.

104
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,938
Let's go. We'll talk without her.

105
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,566
I think that's better.

106
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,693
Hong-jo, it was nice meeting you.

107
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,153
Let's meet again next time.

108
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,823
Why meet her again next time?

109
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,367
Your son almost died because of her.

110
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,077
How can you--

111
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,787
Let's have a talk.

112
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:41,872
Be gentle.

113
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,457
-Let me go--
-Get back safely.

114
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,042
Hong-jo.

115
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,669
Don't come here again.

116
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:57,680
I'm sorry.

117
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,641
Don't take what Father said to heart.

118
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:02,643
It's okay.

119
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,562
I'm the one that should be sorry.

120
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,980
No matter what he says,

121
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,399
I won't give up on you.

122
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,861
I'll drive you home.

123
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,780
No, I can go myself.

124
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,240
Stay with your parents.

125
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,914
Get back safely. Text me.

126
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,292
I will.

127
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:31,547
Just because she's not your own child,
how can you be so mean?

128
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,468
Because my child is more precious
than someone else's child, obviously.

129
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,721
She even seduced the sick boy into bed.

130
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,640
When he was with Na-yeon,

131
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,517
you even told him
to get her pregnant before marriage.

132
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,602
Why did you change?

133
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,854
Because she's obviously a lowlife.

134
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,356
So was I.

135
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:50,816
Both my education and family.

136
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,279
That's why we're in this state now.

137
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:00,618
So we're in an unhappy marriage
because I'm a lowlife?

138
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,787
Fine, then.

139
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,206
Let's just get a divorce.

140
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,541
Sure. Let's do it!

141
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,504
You speak of divorce every time,
but I know you can't do it.

142
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:12,463
Go on and do it.

143
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,157
I came back for good.

144
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:41,659
I know.

145
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,789
Ma'am.

146
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,458
She was worried about you.

147
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,926
You went there because he called you out?
Weren't you scared?

148
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,556
I had my smartwatch
and self-defense weapons.

149
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,226
If it happens again, never go alone.

150
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:08,936
I'm too worried.

151
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,021
Let's go back to my place.

152
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,650
I need to go to work after the weekend.

153
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,110
I used up all my leave.

154
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:22,867
Don't worry too much.
At least I'll be commuting with her.

155
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,204
I knew you were reliable
the moment we signed the contract.

156
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,582
Take good care of Hong-jo.

157
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,543
Why would you ask him that?

158
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,088
Why are you here?

159
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,799
I am Hong-jo's boyfriend.

160
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,469
So from now on,
you can ask me for such things.

161
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,680
You said you'd never see him.

162
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,849
Did you come back to meet your boyfriend?

163
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,185
Not exactly.

164
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,479
Well…

165
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,272
This is my landlady.

166
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,648
This is Jang Sin-yu.

167
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:02,156
A man too tall and handsome
isn't good as a boyfriend.

168
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,574
I agree.

169
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,293
Excuse me.

170
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:23,177
Who is Ms. Ma?

171
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,557
That's me. Who are you?

172
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,230
I am… Cha Seung-yeon.

173
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,159
Seo-gu.

174
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,453
Isn't this too much?

175
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,622
You dumped me to be with someone like her?

176
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,040
What? No, it's not…

177
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,711
I can't believe this.

178
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,129
Seung-yeon.

179
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:00,756
What did you say?

180
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,841
"Someone like her"?

181
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,385
What's wrong about me?

182
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,053
Let's go out and talk.

183
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,722
Go out where? Why would I go out?

184
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,726
All right.

185
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,479
Let's just talk here then.

186
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,654
Wait, where is she?

187
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,992
Gosh, you're here.

188
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,704
She looks so shameless,

189
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,163
what does he see in her?

190
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,915
I…

191
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,501
Are you shaming me for my looks?

192
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,711
No, of course not.

193
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,131
Hey.

194
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,466
Are you done speaking?

195
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,343
No.

196
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,512
I'm not done speaking.

197
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,851
You look very good in these clothes.
They suit you perfectly.

198
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,770
Stop it, Seung-yeon.

199
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,150
How dare you slap him?

200
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,987
Let me go. I said, let me go!

201
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,781
Let me go.

202
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,658
How dare you, you crazy…

203
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,204
What is… happening?

204
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:18,000
Are they fighting over Mr. Gong?

205
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,168
No way.

206
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,921
Are they fighting not to date him?

207
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,590
Don't fight because of me.

208
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:35,935
Let me go!

209
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,107
I mean,

210
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,819
how can she not like me
for being too tall and handsome?

211
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:50,616
I told you many times
that you're too much in everything.

212
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,745
Is this about okay?

213
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,166
This is perfect.

214
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,794
Then I'll try to look ugly too.

215
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,425
You look so ugly.

216
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,513
No way I would've actually looked ugly.

217
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,931
I must have looked cute.

218
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,101
Walk slowly, Hong-jo.

219
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,727
You might get hurt.

220
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,857
Standing here reminds me

221
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,194
of our first kiss in the sunset.

222
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,405
Do you remember?

223
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,948
I don't.

224
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,618
You have no idea what will happen to you.

225
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,038
You don't know either.

226
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,249
I know

227
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,668
because I'm going to do it.

228
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,673
Someone's calling.

229
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:55,597
Welcome back.

230
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,142
Did you rest well without any problems?

231
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,769
Yes. It's all thanks to you.

232
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,148
-Good. Take care.
-Okay.

233
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,359
Welcome back.

234
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,948
We were very worried
about Jung-beom appearing again

235
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:13,949
and making a mess.

236
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,541
I couldn't even sleep.

237
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,711
Go home with us for the time being.

238
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,672
Ms. Yoo is so oblivious.

239
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,799
She has Mr. Jang.

240
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:32,593
Right.

241
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,970
Did Mr. Jang come to work?

242
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,597
Were you with him until now?

243
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,766
No, I wasn't.

244
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,559
He did come to work today.

245
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,524
I'm so jealous.
I want an office romance too.

246
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,234
I know, right?

247
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:53,113
Is dating at work a thing these days?

248
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,491
Let's get to work.

249
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,410
The quintet is finally complete.

250
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,913
That sounds so old-fashioned.

251
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,540
Go away.

252
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,719
A big event happened when you were away.

253
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:19,098
Ms. Ma and Mr. Gong are dating.

254
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:20,808
No way!

255
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,143
Guess what's more shocking.

256
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,938
Seung-yeon grabbed Ms. Ma by her hair.

257
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,440
Why grab her hair?

258
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,985
Seung-yeon's beauty is on another level.

259
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,155
But despite that beauty,
Mr. Gong chose Ms. Ma.

260
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,698
She must've been very upset.

261
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,619
She's like, "How could you do this to me?"
and slapped him like this.

262
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,579
Goodness.

263
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,831
It was such chaos.

264
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,416
I can't believe I missed
such an interesting event.

265
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,543
-I know.
-I know.

266
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,253
At first,

267
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,005
when I heard you were dating Mr. Jang,

268
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,424
I thought, "My gosh, that's unbelievable."

269
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:57,553
Then when I found out
Ms. Ma was dating Mr. Gong,

270
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,472
I thought, "Nothing is impossible."

271
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,057
So I will never give up.

272
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,102
On what?

273
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,854
Mr. Kwon.

274
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,316
Speaking of which…

275
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:13,944
Hong-jo.

276
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,904
How about another party?

277
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,415
Gi-dong?

278
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,668
Do you know
that I'm feeling very uncomfortable?

279
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,588
It's because I missed you.
I'm just so happy.

280
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,964
Don't you know I'm injured?

281
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:36,967
I'm sorry.

282
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,680
When you weren't around,

283
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,558
this place felt so empty

284
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,518
and I realized something.

285
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,981
I realized that I loved you very much.

286
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,357
Please don't love me.

287
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:08,457
Mayor wants you to submit
a resignation letter right now and quit.

288
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,418
I don't want to quit.

289
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,590
Try to put yourself in his shoes.

290
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,884
He wouldn't want to keep employing someone

291
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,053
who broke up with his daughter

292
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,638
and is dating another woman.

293
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:29,895
Mayor's daughter didn't only date me.

294
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,439
What do you mean?

295
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,067
Local Public Officials Act, Article 60.

296
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,903
"No public official shall be
laid off, demoted, or dismissed

297
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,197
in opposition to his or her intention

298
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:45,535
unless he or she falls under any
of the grounds prescribed by this act."

299
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,038
"Unfortunately,
even if I am a contract worker,

300
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,290
you cannot fire me until I'm disciplined

301
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,084
or the contract ends."

302
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,087
Relay this to the mayor.

303
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,674
You could go to any good law firms.

304
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,467
Why are you trying to stay here?

305
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,303
Why are you trying to side with the mayor?

306
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,014
You know it is unfair
to persuade me to resign.

307
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,856
I'm always on the mayor's side.

308
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,736
I'm his advisor, not yours.

309
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,618
Think about it once again.

310
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,462
-Hey.
-What's with the shirt?

311
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,547
It's so ugly.

312
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,673
Let me go.

313
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,050
Those rascals.

314
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,844
Get lost, you loser!

315
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,137
-Hey!
-You little…

316
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,723
How dare you?

317
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,391
U-ram, are you okay?

318
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,520
Did you guys hit U-ram?

319
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,022
Big sis.

320
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,815
You don't have a sister.

321
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,567
Stay out of this, old lady.

322
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,987
I'm not an old lady, but let me say this.

323
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,740
Hitting U-ram just now
was school bullying.

324
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,199
This isn't a school.

325
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,784
So it isn't a school bullying.

326
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,162
You guys--

327
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,830
What you did was a crime.

328
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,183
Criminal Act, Article 257.

329
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:35,645
Inflicting a bodily injury upon another is
punishable by a fine of ten million won,

330
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,981
suspension of qualifications
for ten years,

331
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,858
or seven years of imprisonment.

332
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,069
And since there are three of you,

333
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,322
it's aggravated assault,
which means greater penalties.

334
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,659
This is juvenile delinquency.

335
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,579
Kids aged ten or older
can be punished by the Juvenile Act.

336
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:53,580
Didn't you know?

337
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,999
Still, we won't go to prison.

338
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,375
How dare you talk back--

339
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,961
Okay, then let me explain it this way.

340
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,547
If what happened today
becomes known to the world,

341
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:03,632
you can't become

342
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:07,469
celebrities, politicians, NewTubers,
and more. You can't do a lot of things.

343
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,221
Your future will become bleak.

344
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,472
Are you okay with that?

345
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,140
There's no evidence.

346
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,975
Right, there's no evidence.

347
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,685
Why is there no evidence?

348
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:18,438
It's here.

349
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:21,858
Jeez.

350
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,485
Hey, let's go.

351
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,278
Don't forget your bikes.

352
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,488
Your moms will worry.

353
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,125
You're pretty cool.

354
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,295
I know, right? I always forget

355
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,089
that you're a lawyer too, Sin-yu.

356
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,049
Today, you really look like one.

357
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,260
I'm not just a lawyer.

358
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,470
I'm a very competent one.

359
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:54,683
Is he the guy
you talked about all the time?

360
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:56,977
Yes.

361
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,020
I give you a pass.

362
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,481
You're a good judge of character.

363
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,442
By the way,
aren't you supposed to be working?

364
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,445
I am working.

365
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,699
I'm here to prevent bullying
and solve the park's safety issue.

366
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,034
You're lying. You came to see her.

367
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,037
You sure are very smart.

368
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,998
You're one promising kid.

369
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,834
You have a very high chance
of becoming like me.

370
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,337
U-ram, please understand.

371
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,381
He isn't normal.

372
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:27,299
He's conceited.

373
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,509
No, I've made up my mind.

374
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,679
I will become a cool lawyer like him.

375
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,681
I give you a pass too.

376
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,266
What do you like?

377
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,935
You must eat everything well
to grow tall like me.

378
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,604
What do you want?

379
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,692
I hope you don't become too much like him.

380
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,449
I am sorry to pass this to you.

381
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:56,661
Your wife, Song Yun-ju,
wishes for an uncontested divorce.

382
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,915
APPLICATION FOR DIVORCE ARBITRATION

383
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,837
What's with the divorce out of nowhere?

384
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,299
She must have lost her mind.

385
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,718
You better not call her.

386
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,472
If this goes to court,

387
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:18,516
calling her and yelling at her
can work against you.

388
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,478
There's no reason to get a divorce.

389
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:22,854
Also,

390
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:28,109
if we were to, I should be the one
requesting it. Who is she to do it?

391
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,071
I'm sure she took those expressions
as verbal abuse.

392
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,115
I'll read out some evidence.

393
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,162
"May 17, 2022."

394
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,706
"Why do you have your head for?"

395
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,542
"June 2, 2022."

396
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:48,421
"A pigeon on the street
would be smarter than you."

397
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,589
"You're so dumb."

398
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,591
"Coo."

399
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,553
Should I… read out more?

400
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,493
SIN-YU'S MOM

401
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,078
SIN-YU

402
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,503
Is your mom there?

403
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,715
She's not. What is it?

404
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,174
Your mom…

405
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,388
She wasn't home.

406
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:42,642
Is everything okay?

407
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,769
Why wouldn't it be? Everything's fine.

408
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,229
Anyway, I'm hanging up.

409
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,822
Shouldn't you
at least tell him where you are?

410
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,282
He'll be worried.

411
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,284
He better be.

412
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,537
He doesn't appreciate me.

413
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,707
Are you really going for a divorce?

414
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,504
I'd made up my mind a long time ago.

415
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,049
But whenever I wanted to do it,
something came up.

416
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,426
You got sick

417
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:18,636
and injured.

418
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,976
Am I being too selfish in this situation?

419
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,356
No.

420
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,858
Don't think about me.

421
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,737
I want you to live the life you want.

422
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,620
Thank you, Sin-yu.

423
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:45,747
It's nothing.

424
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,804
GROUNDS FOR DIVORCE: VERBAL ABUSE

425
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:06,935
WHY DO YOU HAVE YOUR HEAD FOR?

426
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:10,355
A PIGEON ON THE STREET
WOULD BE SMARTER THAN YOU.

427
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,773
YOU'RE SO DUMB.

428
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,572
I'm sorry,

429
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,409
but can you go home alone today?

430
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,411
Is it Tae-ho again?

431
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,496
No, today, I'm meeting

432
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,415
-my military buddies.
-I see.

433
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,584
-Call them.
-What?

434
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,838
Call your buddies
you are going to meet today.

435
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,631
Well…

436
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:38,633
My phone stopped working since noon.

437
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:40,760
Maybe I should change
the cellular carrier.

438
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:46,182
Where do you go every night
after lying to me?

439
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,561
I can't really tell you.

440
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,982
One thing I hate the most is lying.

441
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,609
Just get out of my house.

442
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,987
-What?
-You're out.

443
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,490
Wait, stop there.

444
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,616
No!

445
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:20,425
Goodness, I'm so glad
I learned the falling techniques.

446
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,342
Are you okay?

447
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,264
This won't make me
go back on kicking you out.

448
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:27,348
What?

449
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,025
This is bad.

450
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:44,908
Now.

451
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:47,160
He's the star of the day today.

452
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,661
Serve him well.

453
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:49,579
Go.

454
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:50,580
Hey.

455
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,582
Since you stood up, you can just leave.

456
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,876
I don't like beating around the bush.

457
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:58,588
Is that so?

458
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,549
Leave.

459
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,186
There's no reason for me to accept this.

460
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,356
I just followed the mayor's orders.

461
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,484
I hear you're Jang's senior.
You could tattle.

462
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:23,154
I am his senior,
but we're totally different.

463
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:24,989
As you may know,

464
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,492
I wasn't born with a silver spoon.

465
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:29,619
Look here.

466
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,707
If you accept this,
we're in this together.

467
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:38,586
Then the spoon won't matter. Right?

468
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,467
Is this for illegality?

469
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:46,094
It's for competence.

470
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:50,014
I can't trust Mayor Yoon
because he's a bit dumb.

471
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,183
Join me.

472
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,234
LEGAL ADVISOR

473
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:08,825
Long time no see.

474
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:13,204
Your office looks better than I thought.

475
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,665
Let's have coffee.

476
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:16,833
Iced.

477
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,628
The office looks rather fine,
but there's no coffee machine.

478
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:24,924
Well, should I give you one as a gift?

479
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,596
I prefer instant coffee these days.

480
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,389
Your class has dropped.

481
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:34,100
You became very humble
after dating that poor girl.

482
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,477
Hey.

483
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,563
Mayor Yoon told me that you got stabbed

484
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,982
because of a civil servant.

485
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,067
Did it hurt bad?

486
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,281
It's none of your business.

487
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,745
I see you can sound aggressive too.

488
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,706
-Interesting.
-I can punch aggressively also.

489
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,380
So scared. I better leave now.

490
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,466
I wet my pants.

491
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,426
I'll get going.

492
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,597
I'm busy with
the development of Mount Onju.

493
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,265
Don't bother.

494
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,684
You won't be able to do it anyway.

495
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,523
That won't happen.

496
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:27,320
I got a very competent person on my side.

497
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,213
ONJU DEVELOPMENT CALLED OFF

498
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,049
It's rare for you to call me.
What is it about?

499
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,134
I read the news.

500
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,052
Are you okay?

501
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,513
We're father and son.
There should be more reasons

502
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,431
for you to call me.

503
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,267
Are you okay?

504
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:01,062
My company isn't that weak.
This barely affects us.

505
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,146
I've got to go.

506
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,481
I'm playing golf.

507
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:07,193
So you're saying…

508
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:14,117
Sangsaeng Savings Bank wants to
recover funds immediately?

509
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:15,952
Yes.

510
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:30,925
What are you doing?

511
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,805
Just checking
if there are secret documents.

512
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,100
Was it you?

513
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:44,480
Did you transfer the ownership of my land
to Haum after I handed it over to Onju?

514
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:47,567
You handed it over to Onju,
so it wasn't your land anymore.

515
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,527
Whom I sold it to doesn't matter.

516
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,612
You know it's illegal.

517
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:55,074
It isn't if I make it legal.

518
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,785
That was your job in the law firm

519
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,662
and that is my job here.

520
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,249
I didn't expect you to be this bad.

521
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:06,461
It's always fun when things go
beyond your expectation.

522
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,380
Can you leave now? I'm busy.

523
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,237
By the way, where did Mr. Gong go?

524
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,698
Ms. Ma, where is Mr. Gong?

525
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,909
Why are you asking me?

526
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,119
Well, because

527
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,830
you two are dating.

528
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,209
It's over for us.

529
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,618
I think he is going to propose.

530
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:24,372
Is this the public proposal

531
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,624
that women loathe?

532
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:32,672
Oh, my God.

533
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,761
Please don't come here.

534
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:48,604
Ma Eun-yeong.

535
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,399
Please don't kneel.

536
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,239
Please don't propose.

537
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,282
Will you marry me?

538
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:02,034
There's a ring in this bouquet.

539
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,245
I went around all night looking for this.

540
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,417
You're mad. Go away.

541
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,253
-I won't.
-Go away, please.

542
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,881
I won't leave.
I'll stay by your side forever.

543
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:21,554
-Say yes.
-Say yes.

544
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:28,936
-Say yes.
-Say yes.

545
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,105
Say yes.

546
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:36,527
Say yes.

547
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:43,075
Say yes.

548
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:46,162
Say yes.

549
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,079
Say…

550
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,666
This is so embarrassing.

551
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,543
Too embarrassing!

552
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,178
She's just happy, right?

553
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,181
I don't think so.

554
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,699
Here it is.

555
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,701
BANKBOOK

556
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,124
I'm so glad I didn't terminate it halfway.

557
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:36,712
Back then, I thought
terminating the savings was the only way.

558
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,340
Well, I'm glad that you're glad.

559
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,385
There are other options we can recommend

560
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,096
instead of terminating
the long-term savings.

561
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:48,266
I'm glad my detailed advice
helped you opt for the best option.

562
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,185
Thanks to you,
I overcame the hardship back then

563
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,771
and could get all the interest.
I feel reassured.

564
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,898
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

565
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,652
What a coincidence.

566
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:01,988
You startled me.

567
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,700
Are you here for me again?

568
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,078
No, I came to the bank
to do something important.

569
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,705
Do what?

570
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,873
Seeing you in the bank.

571
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,001
How absurd.

572
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,920
You're slacking off.

573
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,464
No, I'm working hard 24 hours a day.

574
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,883
Following my heart's command to meet you.

575
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,469
Did you eat something strange for lunch?

576
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,471
Well, I ate soft tofu.

577
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:30,308
I wanted salmon,
but I didn't want to swim against fate.

578
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,018
I don't want us to drift apart.

579
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,186
I'm never going to eat salmon.

580
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:37,690
That's too bad.
Salmon is my favorite food.

581
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,321
Really?

582
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,157
Come here.

583
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,296
Did something happen?

584
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,132
How did you know?

585
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:09,430
I can just tell.
Probably because you're my boyfriend now.

586
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,226
Your boyfriend's mom
invited you to dinner.

587
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,271
Why are you telling me this now?

588
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,773
I should've dressed better.

589
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,483
You look good in anything.

590
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,693
You even looked pretty
in that bear jacket.

591
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,236
I know that, but…

592
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,321
What's wrong then?

593
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:26,822
This won't do.

594
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,074
What won't do?

595
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,910
You must've expected this,

596
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,661
but he doesn't want a divorce.

597
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,875
Bringing this to court means
they'll pry into your personal life.

598
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,627
Then things will get messy.

599
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,546
Why don't you meet him and persuade him?

600
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,465
Gosh.

601
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,426
I don't want to
because I know what he's going to say.

602
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,512
He'll go, "Are you mad?"

603
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,890
Have you told Sin-yu about this?

604
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,601
Yes.

605
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,270
For both the divorce

606
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,398
and filming a drama,

607
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,484
no matter what I do, he's on my side.

608
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,612
My husband is not on my side,

609
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:09,782
but my son is. I'm so grateful.

610
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,660
I'm on your side too.

611
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:17,581
Oh, we're having dinner later.

612
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,333
You should join us too.

613
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,293
With whom?

614
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,340
Here.

615
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,553
What is this?

616
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:37,768
I heard you liked pretty and cute things.

617
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:40,980
Gosh.

618
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:56,662
Gosh.

619
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,914
It's so beautiful.

620
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:07,006
I wanted to become
a ballerina when I was young.

621
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:11,093
That's why
your first role was a ballerina.

622
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,012
You already looked that up?

623
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,890
Yes. The Nutcreaker, right?

624
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,602
The Nutcracker.

625
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,856
You're similar to me.

626
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,567
You're sweet.

627
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,872
Aren't they so lovely?

628
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,499
Yes.

629
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:44,710
What's wrong?

630
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,588
Sin-yu is in love

631
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,548
and you'll go back to being an actress.

632
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,134
Everyone is heading somewhere,

633
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,553
and I'm the only one stuck here.

634
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,767
You're a lawyer, you have a cool job.
Cheer up.

635
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,936
That's the issue.

636
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,480
I'm not cut out for it,

637
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:07,816
but it's a job too good for me to quit.

638
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,945
Then don't quit.

639
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:13,656
You can do some moonlighting.

640
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,199
One main job and a side gig.

641
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,285
You're a genius.

642
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,705
By the way,

643
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,626
will you be okay
to get a divorce in this situation?

644
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,129
What situation?

645
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:01,787
Honey.

646
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,665
Don't you have any class
as a company's CEO?

647
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,875
Why are you drinking soju with kimchi?

648
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:11,505
You won't divorce me.

649
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,425
That's why you're back, right?

650
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:20,806
I'm sorry, honey,

651
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,851
for saying your head was for decoration

652
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,186
and you were dumb.

653
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,232
It's no use apologizing.

654
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,403
I'm only postponing the divorce for now.

655
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,620
Only until you overcome this crisis.

656
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:48,417
The company

657
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:50,919
will be fine.

658
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,921
Don't worry too much.

659
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,719
Even if things get better
with the company,

660
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,721
if I don't have you,

661
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,057
what's the point?

662
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,736
Gosh, I hate you.

663
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,207
-Thank you.
-Have a nice day.

664
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,291
You too.

665
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,054
When are you done?

666
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:44,932
I'm sorry. I have to go somewhere today.

667
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,645
No. I'll be very late. Don't wait for me.

668
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:52,064
It doesn't matter how late it finishes.

669
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,190
Come to my house.

670
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:55,526
I told you not to wait.

671
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:58,445
I didn't say I wasn't going
to go to your house today.

672
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:09,039
You changed your number and quit work.

673
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,040
What's going on?

674
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:11,708
For the wedding.

675
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,378
What? Didn't you break up with the lawyer?

676
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,505
Did you get back together?

677
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:17,714
No.

678
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,134
Not him. Someone much better.

679
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:23,220
What? You have a new boyfriend already?

680
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,434
I can't believe you actually came.

681
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:31,520
Were you expecting to see Hong-jo here?

682
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,606
If you miss her so much,
why don't you go meet her?

683
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,108
She works at Onju City Hall.

684
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,611
Long time no see, guys.

685
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,532
Where should I sit?

686
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,245
Can you move over?

687
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:00,716
I told you.

688
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:03,302
She's the girl that stole my boyfriend.

689
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,262
You were pretty bad too.

690
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:08,390
You pestered your father
to change the development business,

691
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,602
just like how you avoided
punishment in high school.

692
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:13,812
You really never change.

693
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,355
You haven't changed either,

694
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,399
hitting on and stealing my boyfriend.

695
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,276
And you're a nobody.

696
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:23,405
If I'm a nobody, does that mean

697
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,866
you got your boyfriend
stolen by a nobody?

698
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:28,952
Are you here for this?

699
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,037
Yes.

700
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,831
Do you think I'm here to build friendship?

701
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:39,087
You became braver.

702
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:42,591
Stop harassing Sin-yu through the mayor.

703
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,053
How dare you order me around?

704
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,559
I want you to apologize

705
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:56,897
for slapping me the other day
and everything you did to me.

706
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:00,817
Why would I apologize to you?

707
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,611
I didn't do anything wrong to you.

708
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:08,450
Don't you remember
what happened in high school?

709
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,330
When I was in the library,

710
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:17,876
you made Min-ho kiss me forcefully.

711
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:21,588
And you hid and took a video of it.

712
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,054
Hong-jo.

713
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,977
I have something to tell you.

714
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,563
Yes?

715
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:43,735
Min-ho.

716
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,416
Sit down.

717
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,085
Then I'll keep you by my side.

718
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:05,841
Sorry. I can't forgive someone who flirts
to steal her friend's boyfriend.

719
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,510
I told you. He wanted to talk--

720
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,887
Min-ho doesn't talk to poor people.

721
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,768
Clean the tray for me.

722
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,020
Clean mine too.

723
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,771
Thank you.

724
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,028
The library video.

725
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,405
You staged it.

726
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:30,907
And you spread the rumor
saying I hit on him.

727
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,285
Well, too bad.

728
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,037
There's no evidence.

729
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:38,332
There's a witness,

730
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,584
but since he won't speak up,

731
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,294
I guess there's none.

732
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,844
It seems he has nothing to say.

733
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,016
This is the only chance.

734
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,185
Stop the fuss and get lost.

735
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:03,065
Or I'll tear apart both Sin-yu and Bawoo.

736
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,194
If you do that,

737
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,363
I won't sit back either.

738
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,410
What can you do?

739
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,581
It's my treat, guys.

740
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,583
You bitch.

741
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:28,006
The seat I couldn't sit on in high school.

742
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:30,550
I can sit there anytime now.

743
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,719
For Sin-yu, I can.

744
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,851
Someone like you will never understand.

745
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:46,274
I'll get going.

746
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,985
My boyfriend is waiting for me.

747
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,081
Stop the fuss and get lost.

748
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:03,959
Or I'll tear apart both Sin-yu and Bawoo.

749
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,431
Is it that good?

750
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:18,557
Yes.

751
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,016
I'll buy it for you again.

752
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,899
U-ram, can you go home first?

753
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,443
I'll join you soon.

754
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,527
Okay.

755
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,082
Right, I have no watch.

756
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,474
Why are you waiting outside?

757
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:03,018
I couldn't wait to see you
even for a second.

758
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,520
Is a flower receiving flowers?

759
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,233
Is a flower giving me flowers?

760
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,694
What happened to your clothes?

761
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,155
Well…

762
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:18,742
I went to a gathering
and fought with Na-yeon.

763
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,286
So did you win?

764
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,830
I feel relieved.

765
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,957
At least I wasn't bullied this time.

766
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:30,212
I'm proud of you, Hong-jo.

767
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:32,380
I've got to go home now.

768
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,841
Okay, let's go to my home.

769
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,647
This bracelet looks the prettiest here.

770
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,692
I'll never take it off again.

771
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,366
You can get changed now. Take your time.

772
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:21,847
Gosh.

773
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,767
The shirt is too big.

774
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:12,564
Wait.

775
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,232
Just a moment.

776
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,371
EUN-WOL

777
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:29,140
Hello?

778
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,308
It's a daughter.

779
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:32,769
Sorry?

780
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:34,688
I had a conception dream.

781
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,189
I picked a peach.

782
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:39,484
What?

783
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,027
Put Hong-jo on the line.

784
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,241
No, I'm alone.

785
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:49,452
Goodness. Enjoy your morning.

786
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,663
Don't push yourself too much.

787
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:54,499
What…

788
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,631
What?

789
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:04,175
Well…

790
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:08,722
Eun-wol said something strange.

791
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,017
What strange thing?

792
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:51,723
MY BELOVED GROOT

793
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:01,566
What is it?

794
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:03,526
Where are you?

795
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:05,862
I'm working outside.

796
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:08,031
I was checking the site to plant trees

797
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,407
for Arbor Day.

798
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,286
How can I wait until the evening?

799
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,581
I'll stop by later for a consultation.

800
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:19,000
Okay.

801
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:29,177
Ms. Lee.

802
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:32,222
Hello, sir.

803
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:36,059
I know him. It's okay.

804
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:40,814
Well,

805
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,732
it's about U-ram.

806
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,275
Do you have time to spare?

807
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:46,653
Of course.

808
00:56:52,283 --> 00:56:54,035
What happened to U-ram?

809
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,832
Who are those people?

810
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,709
Don't mind them.

811
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,552
You can go and have lunch.

812
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:12,762
I'll be talking with him.

813
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:22,522
It's okay. I'm close with him.

814
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,731
It's really okay.

815
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:35,618
What is it about?

816
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:38,788
Well…

817
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,668
Mr. Jang.

818
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:45,378
I checked the mayor's office…

819
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,880
BODYGUARD LEE SEUNG-WOO

820
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,340
Just a moment.

821
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:57,599
-Hello?
-Hong-jo is gone.

822
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,186
Search the park thoroughly.

823
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,396
Okay.

824
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:12,447
Hong-jo disappeared in the park.

825
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,866
Sam-sik reported it.

826
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:17,160
She's probably headed to Mount Onju.

827
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:20,121
Okay, I'll head that way. Bye.

828
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:26,878
Could this be Na Jung-beom again?

829
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,964
DESTINED WITH YOU

830
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:56,968
There was something I wanted
to say since 300 years ago.

831
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:59,887
I don't believe in them. I just know them.

832
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:02,307
We were too late.

833
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:03,558
Come to think of it,

834
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:06,352
I think I click better with you
than Sin-yu.

835
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:09,188
Strictly speaking, you are an accomplice.

836
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,566
I didn't know he was such a terrible man.

837
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:13,443
Hong-jo.

838
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,653
Hong-jo.

839
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,532
Hong-jo, wake up.

840
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,455
