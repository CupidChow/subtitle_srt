1
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,966
DESTINED WITH YOU

2
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:56,139
I didn't want to go this far either.

3
00:00:57,515 --> 00:00:59,726
Why did you have to date another guy?

4
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,732
GROOT

5
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,236
-Mr. Gong.
-Yes.

6
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,821
I can't reach Hong-jo.

7
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,406
Please check where she is.

8
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,491
Okay.

9
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,118
EPISODE 12

10
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,873
Yes, Mr. Gong.

11
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,124
Mr. Jang.

12
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,585
She went to Mount Onju
to deal with a complaint.

13
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:26,920
All right.

14
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:30,590
LEE HONG-JO

15
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,437
NA JUNG-BEOM

16
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:10,839
JANG SIN-YU

17
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,472
Hello. What's up, Mr. Jang?

18
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,391
Where are you now?

19
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,101
In the garden.

20
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,271
I'm on my way there now.

21
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:30,567
Well, something urgent came up,
so I need to go out now.

22
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,610
You know what?

23
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,363
Human bones were found in Nuri Park.

24
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,702
Is that so?

25
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,705
Anyway,

26
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,457
there's no use coming here now.

27
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,294
Okay.

28
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,385
Too bad.

29
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,237
Will you not tell me your name?

30
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,947
I don't have a name.

31
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,657
Who doesn't have a name?

32
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,705
The one who had a name…

33
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,626
is dead.

34
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,004
Are you saying you're reincarnated?

35
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,218
Even all my servants have names.

36
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,679
I can't call you "No-name."

37
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,973
I'll name you.

38
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,519
What about Aeng-cho?

39
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,521
You're tiny and ugly

40
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,314
just like aengcho, a primrose.

41
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,692
-I don't like it.
-Aeng-cho.

42
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,943
It's perfect for you.

43
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,987
My name is Mu-jin.

44
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,154
Jang Mu-jin.

45
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:44,075
Anyway, it isn't a name someone
as lowly as you can call…

46
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,996
Your superior is speaking.

47
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,873
Wait for me, Aeng-cho!

48
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,834
Aeng-cho!

49
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,151
Hong…

50
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,945
Hong-jo?

51
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,158
Hong-jo!

52
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,827
Do you hear me?

53
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,922
Hello? Is anybody there?

54
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,425
Somebody help.

55
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,135
Hello?

56
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,219
Hong-jo!

57
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,472
Hong-jo?

58
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,186
My phone.

59
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,449
Hello?

60
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,077
Hong-jo? What happened?

61
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,163
I fell in a pit.

62
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,832
Where are you? Calm down and explain.

63
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,129
From the signpost that says "Saeteogol,"

64
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,423
walk about 100 meters to the left--

65
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,467
Hong…

66
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:27,220
Hong-jo.

67
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,387
Hello?

68
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,015
Hello? Sin-yu.

69
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,187
The phone is turned off. Please leave…

70
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,397
Saeteogol signpost.

71
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,859
Saeteogol signpost. Saeteogol…

72
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,585
Hong-jo!

73
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,598
Hong-jo?

74
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,152
Answer me, Hong-jo.

75
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,157
Hong-jo!

76
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,580
Sin-yu?

77
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,914
Sin-yu!

78
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,127
Hong-jo?

79
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,170
Sin-yu.

80
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,963
I'm here, Sin-yu.

81
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,216
Hong-jo.

82
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,593
Sin-yu.

83
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,928
Here. This way.

84
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,222
I'm here.

85
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,140
Sin-yu.

86
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,351
-Hong-jo.
-Sin-yu.

87
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,564
Grab my hand.

88
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,337
What are you doing? Hurry up.

89
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,953
I saw this face.

90
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,456
I've never met you before,
but I saw this face.

91
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,420
Are we

92
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,257
having the same dream?

93
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:20,518
Are you feeling less cold?

94
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,688
I feel better after soaking in the bath.

95
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,704
Did you really trip and fall?

96
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:42,790
Yes.

97
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:47,003
I got distracted while taking pictures
and I didn't watch my step.

98
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,922
Don't go and deal
with complaints on your own.

99
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,508
Don't work outdoors for a while.

100
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:56,762
Then how will I get my salary?

101
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,477
Don't worry.

102
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:05,563
I was very shocked earlier,

103
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,106
but I'm perfectly fine now.

104
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,274
I'm not that hurt.

105
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,693
To me, you're hurt a lot.

106
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:19,577
I now understand what you said.

107
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,537
What did I say?

108
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,707
You said you saw me in your dreams.

109
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,043
I saw you too.

110
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,213
What did you see?

111
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,386
You were crushing on me
and chasing me around even then.

112
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,847
It's probably a form of avoidance

113
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,892
your brain developed
in a very anxious situation.

114
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:44,685
Is that so?

115
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,397
Anyway, it was so vivid
that it almost felt real.

116
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,983
I even had this thought for a while.

117
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,236
Just like what Eun-wol said,

118
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,198
our destinies must be inseverable.

119
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,825
You can tell that even without dreaming.

120
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,953
Still, I want to know

121
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,456
about the dream you had.

122
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,793
If we really had the same dream,

123
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,586
that's fascinating, right?

124
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:19,970
What?

125
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,788
Let me do this until you fall asleep.

126
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,917
I'm really fine.

127
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,920
You don't have to
act strong in front of me.

128
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,884
Actually…

129
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,721
I was very scared.

130
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,772
I was scared too, actually.

131
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,943
from the moment you didn't pick up.

132
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,198
I was worried
something bad happened to you.

133
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:31,083
It is nice to have someone
who always worries about me.

134
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,760
Everyone read this news
about human bones being found, right?

135
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,513
I was there at the site.

136
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,806
My heart was about to burst out.

137
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,933
Exactly.

138
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,727
I walked there every night
unaware of the buried body.

139
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,522
The thought gives me chills.

140
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,148
This gives me more chills.

141
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,484
"The body was skeletonized,
except for the hands,

142
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,361
as if they were left to help us

143
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:43,113
identify the body and catch the culprit."

144
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,993
And I saw this myself at the site.
I got chills all over.

145
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,371
I couldn't sleep a wink at night.

146
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,748
This is why you shouldn't live alone.

147
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,001
I hope the murderer is caught soon.

148
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,212
I'm so scared to get off work.

149
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,588
Me too.

150
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,052
Shouldn't you be relieved?

151
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,973
A bigger issue covered your scandal.

152
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,475
That's not important now.

153
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,018
Gather around.

154
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,731
Mr. Jang suspects

155
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,359
Mr. Na of Green Landscape Garden.

156
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,777
What?

157
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,155
Listen. His wife has been
missing for five years,

158
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,449
and the park was built five years ago.

159
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,494
And Mr. Na took part in that construction.

160
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,246
Everything falls into place.

161
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,915
It is reasonable
to have suspicions about it.

162
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,460
I'm so glad we removed him
from our partners and cut ties with him.

163
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,545
Exactly.

164
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,797
You're being too rash.

165
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,259
We don't know yet
if the remains are his wife's.

166
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,386
Since it still has fingerprints,

167
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,221
they will identify the body soon.

168
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,764
We can cut ties after that.

169
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,350
Now, get to work.

170
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,268
Ms. Ma.

171
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:57,438
I'll go out to fill in the pit
on Mount Onju.

172
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,648
Be careful.

173
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,944
The New Year has just started,
and it's restless already.

174
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,529
How did it go yesterday?

175
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,031
Mr. Jang was very worried.

176
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,782
What happened?

177
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,411
I know, right?

178
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,663
I wonder why.

179
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:19,877
I'll have a quick lunch,
and head out to the site.

180
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,262
What?

181
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,722
You startled me.

182
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,099
I'm sorry.

183
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,351
What did you do?

184
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,318
It can't be Mr. Na who…

185
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:05,965
Hello, Mr. Kwon.

186
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:07,925
Why don't we lunch together?

187
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,347
Would that be okay for you?

188
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,521
Why not?

189
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,409
Aren't you having a hard time
because of the post?

190
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,119
Look who's worrying.

191
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,789
I'm fine.

192
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,125
You're fine, but eating alone?

193
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,460
I'm used to eating alone.

194
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,588
I was bullied for a while in high school.

195
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,888
You don't get used to suffering.

196
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,896
Actually, I find working outside
more comfortable.

197
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,653
Did you get hurt?

198
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,367
Yes. There was an incident.

199
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,912
Can you tell me what happened?

200
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,665
I mean,

201
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,251
Sin-yu asked me to protect you,

202
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,754
but I don't know from what.

203
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,841
Sin-yu is strange.

204
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:34,219
He should protect me himself.
Why would he ask someone else?

205
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,763
Don't mind him.

206
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:38,223
The sandwich tastes good. Try it.

207
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,393
Jae-gyeong, try it.

208
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,454
Why do so many people want
to see the CCTV footage today?

209
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,748
Was there someone else besides me?

210
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:03,832
Yes.

211
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,211
A very good-looking man came

212
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,129
at dawn.

213
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,925
By any chance, was that man tall too?

214
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,052
Yes. How did you know?

215
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,805
Hong-jo--

216
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:48,770
Are you hurt?

217
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,274
Nobody will get hurt from those punches.

218
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:53,984
Why are you here?

219
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,321
I checked the CCTV footage.

220
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,241
Aren't you here with the same reason?

221
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,037
That's right.

222
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,289
But why did you lie to me?

223
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,918
You said you tripped and fell.
But that's not true.

224
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,503
You think he might've pushed you.

225
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,006
That's why you checked
the CCTV and came here.

226
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:19,134
You should've told me
before coming here alone!

227
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,305
Didn't you hear the news
about the dead body?

228
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,183
What if Mr. Na is related to that case?

229
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,645
Why are you so angry?

230
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,188
He might be a murderer.

231
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:35,609
You could've run into
this dangerous man alone.

232
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,236
Who else would I come with?

233
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,737
With me.

234
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,906
At least tell me about it.

235
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,326
-Why should I?
-Because that's what couples do.

236
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,962
I understand why you were worried.

237
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,674
See? It's your fault.

238
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,425
Don't lie to me from now on.

239
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,720
I didn't want to worry you.

240
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,347
I want to worry about you.

241
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,182
No, I don't want to.

242
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,642
What I mean is,

243
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,936
I don't want
something worrisome to happen.

244
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,397
Even if nothing worrisome
happens, I worry…

245
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:17,150
Forget it.
Anyway, don't lie to me ever again.

246
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,780
I'll never lie to you again.

247
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,536
Go now.

248
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,997
I looked around. He's not here.

249
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,750
You shouldn't come here alone either.

250
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,043
It's dangerous.

251
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,297
All right.

252
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,882
Shall we go?

253
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:58,608
Not that way.

254
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,405
Not that way either.

255
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,076
Stick to me.

256
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,081
I'm not joking.

257
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,042
Don't go about alone from now on.

258
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,587
Don't ever miss my calls, okay?

259
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,603
I'm so glad they
came to an agreement without a lawsuit.

260
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,396
If they hadn't,

261
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,148
we wouldn't be able to air it.

262
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,817
Gosh, it's not thanks to me.

263
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:44,154
It isn't good for
the pharma company to file a lawsuit,

264
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,906
so they just glossed it over.

265
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:48,950
She must be here.

266
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,044
Did you ride a scooter?

267
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,463
Your helmet.

268
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,799
Gosh, look at me.

269
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,643
Hello.

270
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,562
Hello.

271
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,566
You're exactly the type I was looking for.

272
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,992
Just let them date at work.

273
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,662
I don't get why they're so hard on her.

274
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,580
It's not because of dating at work.

275
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,375
It's because the men
are Mr. Jang and Mr. Kwon.

276
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,877
-They're both GL.
-What's GL?

277
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:42,671
Good-looking.

278
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,714
GL for good-looking.

279
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,801
You're BL because you're bad-looking.

280
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,010
Goodness.

281
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,429
Nobody will be jealous of us dating then.

282
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,722
Who's dating you?

283
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,432
Then let's not.

284
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,809
Let's just eat dinner then.

285
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,103
I'm meeting my ex.

286
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,065
Why are you meeting that piece of trash?

287
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,235
He broke up with his girlfriend.

288
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,820
He wants to come back to me.

289
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,489
So?

290
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,367
I'll get going.

291
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:25,213
LEE HONG-JO

292
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:34,806
When do you finish?

293
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,982
I'm working overtime.

294
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,358
I think I'll finish late.

295
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,277
You don't have to wait for me.

296
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,737
Why are you working alone?

297
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,198
How did you know that?

298
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,949
That's probably why you called.

299
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,746
What is it now? Are you being bullied?

300
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,581
No.

301
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,958
It's what junior employees do.

302
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,336
That means nobody is there, right?

303
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,921
Wait there. I'll come help.

304
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,172
Don't come.

305
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,425
Ms. Ma forbade dating at work.

306
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,719
Ms. Ma isn't there.

307
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,138
That's true, but…

308
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,641
Hello?

309
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,519
Goodness.

310
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,320
Seventh floor. Doors closing.

311
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,383
Why isn't he coming?

312
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,241
He's not picking up.

313
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,289
Sin-yu.

314
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,374
Sin-yu!

315
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,127
Sin-yu.

316
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,920
Sin-yu, wake up.

317
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,673
Sin-yu.

318
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,589
Don't worry.

319
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,133
Because you drove me here,

320
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,010
I'm not sick anymore.

321
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:00,845
You should lie down.

322
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,138
You better go.

323
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,556
I'll lie down after you leave.

324
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,600
How can I leave?

325
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,352
I'll call my parents.

326
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,312
You're lying.

327
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,688
You're not going to.

328
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,152
I'll be honest.

329
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,950
I don't want you to see me in this state.

330
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:32,710
Still…

331
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:40,093
Fine.

332
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,762
I really don't want to go.

333
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,099
But I'll leave.

334
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,317
Don't worry too much.

335
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,799
I have to do something for him.

336
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,780
"Pregnancy Spell." No.

337
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:43,823
"Pass the Exam Spell."

338
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,743
"Good Fortune Spell."

339
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,496
"Anti-aging Spell."

340
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,209
"Mind-Body Cleanse Spell."

341
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,973
According to the MRI,
there's nothing wrong.

342
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,478
I think you should take
psychological consultations as well.

343
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,776
Why is he here?

344
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,240
What is it? What now?

345
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,243
I edited the document. Read it again.

346
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,120
Must I read it now?

347
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,956
Did you have to come
at this hour for that?

348
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,958
I couldn't sleep a wink.

349
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,668
Can't you see my sunken eyes?

350
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,211
What did your ex-husband say?

351
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,631
You're not getting back together
with him, are you?

352
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,594
Get back together?

353
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,137
I want to.

354
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,474
But before that, he wanted my kimchi
because he couldn't eat well.

355
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,312
Gosh. So?

356
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,148
I wanted to slap him with kimchi,

357
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,191
but I just slapped him.

358
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,321
Good job.

359
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,158
Check my presentation slides.

360
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,119
ADVANTAGES OF LIVING WITH SEO-GU

361
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,084
PRELIMINARY CHECKLIST

362
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,836
What's with this survey?

363
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,464
"Are you willing to live with me?"

364
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,803
There are only "sure"
and "yes" for answers.

365
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,597
There's no "no" between us.

366
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,516
"I'm moved."

367
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,394
Did you think I would say that?

368
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,313
Don't fool around with documents.

369
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:23,358
How are you not serious about anything?

370
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,818
But I'm sure I'm pretty cute.

371
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,198
Want to see my other charms?

372
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,241
Take this.

373
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,037
Why are you so perverted?

374
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,121
What?

375
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,748
-I'm late.
-Hey.

376
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,459
-Read it. I spent the whole night on it.
-We're late.

377
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,718
Yes. I called in case
you were worried about me.

378
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,971
I came to work just fine, so don't worry.

379
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,764
I didn't worry about you.

380
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,976
Why didn't you worry about me?

381
00:32:58,685 --> 00:32:59,894
You told me not to.

382
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,689
Still, you should worry--

383
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:03,690
Hello?

384
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:04,774
What?

385
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,486
Well, that's upsetting.

386
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,372
Consultation?

387
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,250
No.

388
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,212
I missed you.

389
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,216
I almost went crazy yesterday.

390
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,885
This is the office.

391
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,514
That's why I locked the door.

392
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,308
Why did you lock the door?

393
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,437
I thought about it,

394
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,814
and I think
the office is the safest place.

395
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,568
Safe for what?

396
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,323
Come have a seat here.

397
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,747
I gave it a thought.

398
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:05,001
I cast the Fair Skin Spell
and cured my blushing.

399
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:07,879
But the Cure Disease Spell
didn't work on you.

400
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,798
I think I cast the wrong spell.

401
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,051
You're not just sick.

402
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,094
You said it was because of a curse.

403
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,054
So?

404
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,184
Cursed Frog Prince.

405
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:22,310
Take my kiss.

406
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,282
One kiss isn't enough.

407
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,248
Mr. Jang, I knocked--

408
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,721
I dealt with the complaint well,
thanks to you.

409
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,934
Don't come and ask
such trivial things again.

410
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,393
I'm very busy.

411
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,647
Thank you always
for your kind consultation.

412
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,748
What brings you here?

413
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,670
Mayor wants to have lunch with you.

414
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,046
I understand.

415
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,717
I think you can stop acting.

416
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,822
What is this meeting for?

417
00:35:58,823 --> 00:35:59,824
Have a seat.

418
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,675
We finished discussing.

419
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,888
If it was up to me,
I would've called off this wedding.

420
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,682
But he asked me not to

421
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,810
and Na-yeon still seems to like you a lot.

422
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,354
What can I do? I'll just let it slide.

423
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,148
Just get married.

424
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,274
I apologize.

425
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:38,404
I wouldn't have pushed
for Mount Onju's development.

426
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,865
Na-yeon still likes you

427
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,951
and wants to marry you.
Then that's the end of the story.

428
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,329
What will you do with her?

429
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,754
I couldn't decide what to do with her,

430
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,964
but my head has cleared now.

431
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,928
Yes. You've come to your senses.

432
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,347
What took you so long?

433
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,140
Shall we order now?

434
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,850
You guys go ahead with the meal.

435
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,603
I'll go and sort things out.

436
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:21,906
You're here.

437
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,492
Did you wait for long?

438
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,370
I did, but it's not so bad.

439
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,705
I didn't expect to eat here.

440
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,208
You don't like places like this.

441
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,418
But you do.

442
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,381
Why am I getting nervous?

443
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,092
It's like the day of our first date.

444
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,178
Shall we eat first?

445
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,057
I don't know what's good here.

446
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,517
You don't need to choose.

447
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,477
I ordered our food already.

448
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,021
Let me serve the dishes.

449
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,365
Here's herb-crusted French rack of lamb

450
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,951
and Pinot Haut Brion 1982 vintage.

451
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,494
I'll open it.

452
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,997
We'll drink the wine a bit later.

453
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,332
I understand. Enjoy your meal, sir.

454
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,878
Why order wine when you don't drink?

455
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,798
I came here after meeting the mayor.

456
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,925
He brought up our marriage.

457
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:29,223
After I broke up with you,
I cried a bit in front of Dad.

458
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,518
Don't cry from now on.

459
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:40,192
Are we… getting back together?

460
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,569
Hold on.

461
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,196
Hi. This way.

462
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,372
I thought you called for work.

463
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,665
But it was for dinner.

464
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,875
Am I supposed to join?

465
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,169
Sit here, Mr. Lee.

466
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,305
Mr. Jang, I've always wondered

467
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,307
what kind of woman you would date.

468
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,683
This is how we meet.

469
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,104
Who is he?

470
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,522
You know who he is.

471
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,028
November 15th.

472
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:26,697
That's when you two met at this table.

473
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,532
Don't you remember?

474
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,454
It was 7:52 p.m.

475
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:37,750
You probably didn't know
that Mr. Lee appeared in your selfie.

476
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,086
That's why you showed me your photos.

477
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,215
What selfie?

478
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,674
See it for yourself.

479
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:49,303
Lee Hyeon-seo's face reflected
on the glass in your selfie.

480
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,681
What were you doing with Hong-jo?

481
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,738
We met for work. The interior--

482
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,615
Don't cover it up. He's Mr. Jang.

483
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,784
He's doing this because he knows it all.

484
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,084
Yes, we met.

485
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,460
We met.

486
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,587
So what?

487
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,423
Want to hit me?

488
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,134
Why would I?

489
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,387
I'm going to treat you
to a very nice dinner

490
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,180
to congratulate you.

491
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,350
I wish things work out for you.

492
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,105
You look great together.

493
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:51,157
Why does he always get on my nerves?

494
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,326
Should I take revenge for you?

495
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,458
Forget it. Whatever it is, I'll do it.

496
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,418
Hey.

497
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,307
I turned on the lights for you.

498
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,184
The street lamps
aren't the only ones lit up.

499
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:20,186
My heart lit up too.

500
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,271
It's twinkling.

501
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:33,824
Is there no one inside?

502
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,827
He should be home.

503
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:51,884
Who are you?

504
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:53,886
You startled me.

505
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:05,397
I raised him hard
and sent him to Hankook University,

506
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,690
but he won't pick up.

507
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,610
It's useless raising children.

508
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,447
It must be hard to pick up calls
when he's serving the mayor.

509
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,869
Do you have a boyfriend, Miss?

510
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,039
Yes, I do.

511
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,458
Goodness.

512
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:28,295
I like you because you're sociable
and nice. What a pity.

513
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,881
Pour me a drink.

514
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:31,966
Okay.

515
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:33,884
What's happening?

516
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,137
You're back.

517
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,518
Why are you two drinking together?

518
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:45,229
I was coming back from grocery shopping.

519
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,981
He was waiting for you out front.

520
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,691
So I was keeping him company.

521
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,361
Hong-jo, go upstairs.

522
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,446
You can go in with him first.

523
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,115
-I'll clean--
-I said, go upstairs.

524
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,370
Okay.

525
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:16,010
I don't know how you found out,
but you should leave.

526
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,054
You disrespectful brat.

527
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:22,016
You think you're so great, huh?

528
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,267
Leave, I said.

529
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,686
I'm leaving now.

530
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,937
I was going to anyway.

531
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:32,735
Stop bothering me.

532
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,698
I told my company
to change the person in charge.

533
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,450
I'm too embarrassed to come here.

534
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,495
Even after telling him that,

535
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,539
he still won't change his mind?

536
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,709
Sin-yu and I really broke up for good.

537
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,920
So I want to give him a parting gift.

538
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,350
I need 30 million won.

539
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:06,852
Then I'll never come to you.

540
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,280
Yes, Mayor.

541
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,161
About Mount Onju's development…

542
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,664
Change it from Bawoo to Haum.

543
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:31,377
Is it because of Mr. Jang?

544
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:34,630
Why?

545
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,382
Does that matter?

546
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:41,887
It was a competitive tender,
and the business plan is confirmed.

547
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,223
There are enough reasons
for issues to rise.

548
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,143
I told you many times that it was your job

549
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,229
to make it work regardless.

550
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:56,235
If we side with Haum,
we'll get 30 billion won.

551
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,319
Do you think

552
00:44:58,445 --> 00:44:59,905
you won't get any of it?

553
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:07,704
BONES IDENTIFIED, HUSBAND CAUGHT

554
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:10,416
Anyway, I'm glad Mr. Jang cut him off.

555
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,836
That owner used to hit on Hong-jo too.

556
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:16,213
-He did?
-Yes.

557
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:19,466
So that's when he fell for Hong-jo.

558
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,093
That's impossible.

559
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,346
Since we're at it, let's ask.

560
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,473
What happened with Mr. Jang?

561
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,602
You guys are not dating, are you?

562
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,564
Of course not.

563
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,316
Goodness.

564
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,277
No, right?

565
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:41,822
What's wrong?

566
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:42,906
Well…

567
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,076
I should've told you this beforehand.

568
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,829
We are dating.

569
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,499
I'm sorry I told you late.

570
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,211
-What?
-My gosh.

571
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,213
-You're dating him?
-No way.

572
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,007
My gosh!

573
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,468
Ms. Ma.

574
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,969
You said no dating at work.

575
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,429
Won't you stop her?

576
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:07,389
Ms. Ma.

577
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:13,228
The gathering
that didn't happen last time,

578
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,771
we're having it today.

579
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,316
Don't tell me you've got plans.

580
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,026
I won't.

581
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:20,736
-That's not--
-Okay.

582
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:21,737
No.

583
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,198
No!

584
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:28,619
Sticking together
doesn't mean you're dating?

585
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,329
Like this?

586
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,749
If you do this,
does it mean you're dating?

587
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:36,710
I mean…

588
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,545
You guys are dating?

589
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:42,049
I'm going to get some air.

590
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:46,094
See you.

591
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,061
Have you read the news?

592
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,233
Yes.

593
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,151
I'm so relieved.

594
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:04,279
What shall we do tonight?

595
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,118
We have team dinner.

596
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,456
Why does your team always have gatherings?

597
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,043
I'm sad.

598
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,005
Call me when you're done. I'll wait.

599
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:27,135
OBONGJIP

600
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,849
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

601
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:36,311
-Let's work hard.
-Yes!

602
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,689
They serve a lot of side dishes. How nice.

603
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,983
The octopus tastes and smells good.

604
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,818
If it's about smell,

605
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:45,279
you smell good too.

606
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:50,075
Doesn't Ms. Ma look prettier nowadays?

607
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,451
Ms. Ma became prettier…

608
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,789
and Mr. Gong became neater.

609
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,376
Try this pork, it tastes good.

610
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:01,169
It's suspicious.

611
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,629
Is something going on?

612
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,089
-Nothing--
-How did you know?

613
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,596
Why are you flustered?

614
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:11,722
-Are we?
-We're not.

615
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:17,686
Excuse me.

616
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,149
Can't you treat me well too?

617
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:28,238
Mr. Kwon and I live

618
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,823
in the same house.

619
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:31,658
What?

620
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,870
I've been living
in that house for six years.

621
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:37,914
One day, Mr. Kwon suddenly moved in.

622
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,626
So Mr. Kwon and I

623
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:43,462
are really nothing more than neighbors.

624
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:45,964
What about Mr. Jang?

625
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:48,508
Well…

626
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:55,015
What happened was,

627
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:58,727
we met when I went
to demolish the shrine on Mount Onju.

628
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,812
But that spell…

629
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:04,816
The Love Spell was cast wrong.

630
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,110
What spell?

631
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,114
Love Spell. It's a spell.

632
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:16,912
She's too drunk. She can't think straight.

633
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,830
I'm serious.

634
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,874
I'm very serious.

635
00:49:20,957 --> 00:49:24,795
While demolishing the shrine,
he found the spell book.

636
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:28,298
It was written by someone called Aeng-cho.

637
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,843
That's so ridiculous. So?

638
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:36,807
That love something spell. Did it work?

639
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,893
If it did, let me try too.

640
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:44,648
I can only cast the spell once.

641
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,402
Then should I cast the spell

642
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:50,904
to make you rich?

643
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:52,030
What a joke.

644
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,449
Can you cast that spell on me?

645
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,743
Come on, she wants to cast it on me.

646
00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:00,747
Then play rock paper scissors to be fair.

647
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,250
Ready or not, rock paper scissors.

648
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,045
Get rich.

649
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,384
Why isn't she answering me?

650
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,848
Even if she drank a lot,
she could send a dot.

651
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:20,892
Is it because I didn't send an emoji?

652
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:26,356
Why isn't she answering…

653
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,406
What happened?

654
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:39,953
Oh, it's Jang Sin-yu.

655
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,914
You should've called when it was over.

656
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,499
I got it.

657
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,917
That's not what I mean.

658
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:51,256
Mr. Na was caught.

659
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:55,969
How did you come here?

660
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,222
I came here to stick by your side.

661
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,892
You told me to stick to you.

662
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,188
By the way,

663
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,483
why didn't you change the password?

664
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,403
What do you think?

665
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:19,117
In case I come here?

666
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,871
I didn't expect you
to come here drunk like this.

667
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:26,875
I even ate octopus.

668
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,503
You ate good stuff.

669
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,505
Stand up. Let's get you sober.

670
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,465
Goodness.

671
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:37,177
I'm here to stick to you.

672
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,595
Why won't I stick?

673
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:41,223
I need to stick to you.

674
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:43,642
Why do I keep moving away from you?

675
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:46,603
You are sticking to me.

676
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:47,604
-Hong-jo.
-No.

677
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:50,398
-I need to stick to you.
-You are sticking to me.

678
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:52,859
I'll stick to you.

679
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,486
Hong-jo.

680
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:57,447
How many octopuses did you eat
that you became one?

681
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:58,365
One thousand.

682
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,699
You ate 1,000 octopuses?

683
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:14,548
My heart is so light now.

684
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:19,761
Mr. Kwon is my neighbor,

685
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:23,306
and I'm dating you.

686
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,684
I told them everything.

687
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:31,147
Wait.

688
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:33,608
Where am I?

689
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,781
Don't you know where you are?

690
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,619
I know. It's your house.

691
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,205
Stay here for a while.

692
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:48,623
I'll go buy hangover drinks.

693
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:51,543
Who are you?

694
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:54,421
Stop fooling around.

695
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:02,262
Don't go.

696
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,148
Come here.

697
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:18,069
If you won't, I'll come to you.

698
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:24,993
Won't you regret it once you're sober?

699
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:30,290
No, I won't regret it.

700
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,297
I want to seize you.

701
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:42,167
MOTHER

702
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:44,752
Yes, Mom.

703
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,381
I don't trust Father.

704
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:49,799
I'm serious.

705
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:52,469
He told me to call you
because you didn't pick up.

706
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:55,388
On his birthday, come with her.

707
00:57:58,308 --> 00:57:59,934
Okay. See you on that day.

708
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:10,653
ONJU, THE CITY OF HEALING AND HARMONY!
ONJU POLICE IS WITH YOU!

709
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,771
LEE HONG-JO

710
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:46,898
What happened?

711
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:48,399
You didn't answer.

712
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:49,776
I was so worried.

713
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,821
Can you come pick me up?

714
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,199
Where are you?

715
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:13,508
Did you meet Eun-wol?

716
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,593
But why didn't you answer?

717
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,515
I was unaware of the time passing
while listening to her.

718
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,978
How can you just leave after seizing me?

719
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,480
Then you shouldn't have
in the first place.

720
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:31,985
I'm sorry.

721
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:41,828
Don't ever do that again.

722
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:43,663
I was worried about you.

723
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:52,130
Do you… want to go see snow with me?

724
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,475
Why did you suddenly want to see snow?

725
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,774
I have something important to tell you.

726
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:14,944
I have something to tell you too.

727
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,239
You go first.

728
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,368
It's Father's birthday soon.

729
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:23,953
He wants you to come with me.

730
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:27,957
Don't feel too pressured.

731
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,667
We'll just have a meal together.

732
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:33,046
Father and I don't speak
the same language,

733
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:35,048
but Mom is cute.

734
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,134
You're slightly cuter, though.

735
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:43,556
I don't think

736
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:46,601
I can go.

737
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:50,772
Why?

738
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:52,398
Is it uncomfortable?

739
01:00:57,487 --> 01:00:59,113
I'll be honest with you.

740
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:02,367
I saw something

741
01:01:04,243 --> 01:01:06,663
I didn't want to see.

742
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:19,926
Is it the dream again?

743
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,971
Is that why you met Eun-wol?

744
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,102
Yes.

745
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:35,650
I don't know what she told you,

746
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:39,195
but you said it didn't matter.

747
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,533
You said what matters is the present.

748
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:44,617
Don't you remember?

749
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:04,512
The bloody hand.

750
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:11,477
Did you know…

751
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,523
that it was me?

752
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,125
Whoever kills me…

753
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:22,799
would be cursed.

754
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:20,731
DESTINED WITH YOU

755
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:23,025
I'm the one who put the curse on you.

756
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:24,610
That was the past.

757
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,237
It was ill-fated,

758
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,614
and it will stay
as an ill-fated relationship.

759
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,658
You already know.

760
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:33,369
Before your life ends,

761
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:35,121
nothing ends.

762
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:36,038
So what?

763
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:39,292
I can't see your face anymore.

764
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:43,170
Can you live without seeing me?

765
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:45,882
Yes.

766
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:54,557
