1
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,966
DESTINED WITH YOU

2
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,094
EPISODE 4

3
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,388
There's no way the Love Spell worked.

4
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:57,807
How can you be so sure?

5
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,310
-Do you think I got dumped again?
-No.

6
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,897
Jae-gyeong does like you.

7
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,734
And I

8
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,736
like you too.

9
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,678
Like me?

10
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:39,724
Mr. Kwon does?

11
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,605
How do you know that? Did he tell you?

12
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,982
Did you selectively
not hear what I said next?

13
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:49,567
What?

14
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,445
Well, that's impossible.

15
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,405
And that impossible thing happened.

16
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,865
Very unfortunately,

17
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,660
the person that drank
the love potion you made

18
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,370
by mixing this and that

19
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:01,913
was me.

20
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,253
Why would you drink it?

21
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:10,755
I'm sure I put it on Mr. Kwon's desk.

22
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,674
I checked the CCTV.

23
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,676
See for yourself.

24
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,179
No way.

25
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,473
Why did you drink that?

26
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,268
You're left-handed too. Don't you get it?

27
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:24,978
Are you left-handed?

28
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,980
My left hand looks nicer, but I'm not.

29
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,190
So why did you use
your left hand to drink?

30
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,819
The left side of my brain has an issue,
so my right hand hurts sometimes.

31
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,238
So I started using my left hand often.

32
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,240
That's what happened back then.

33
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:41,828
I unwittingly reached out
with my left hand and drank that water.

34
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,872
Why that water of all things?

35
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,499
I worked so hard to make it.

36
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,626
I can only use the spell once too.

37
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,422
You should've made him drink
the love potion surely and discreetly.

38
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:56,259
I suffered because of your poor plan.

39
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,218
Do something.

40
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,095
Why should I?

41
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,638
Causing bodily harm.

42
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:05,810
Article 257, paragraph 1, assault.
That's the crime you've committed.

43
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,063
Others might think
I shot you or something.

44
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,191
You did shoot me… with a love bullet.

45
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,570
When I'm shot, my heart races.

46
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,865
But I don't want my heart
to race looking at you.

47
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,241
But

48
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,660
it races.

49
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,496
-Then don't make it race.
-I can't control it.

50
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,249
-I'm under a spell.
-You said you don't believe in spells.

51
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,628
I asked you to go on a trip with me
after I left the meeting.

52
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,880
Why did I do that off the cuff?

53
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,300
When you confidently said
that you wouldn't sleep in the car

54
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,552
but then fell into a deep sleep,

55
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,930
I put down the sun visor for you to sleep.

56
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,140
Why did I suddenly become so nice?

57
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:48,061
When you turned around in your
white dress for the Cure Disease Spell,

58
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,354
I found you pretty.

59
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,773
On top of that,
when you were with Jae-gyeong,

60
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,816
I got jealous.

61
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,819
I would never do that
unless I was under the Love Spell,

62
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,196
would I?

63
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,416
Don't make that face.

64
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,085
My heart flutters.

65
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:15,755
Darn it.

66
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,592
I don't have time to have a crush on you.

67
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,095
I'm supposed to be in pain
and keep a low profile

68
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,930
due to a very personal issue.

69
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,682
So break the spell now.

70
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,267
How can I do that?

71
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,269
Do you really think I'm a witch?

72
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,771
You better find a way by any means.

73
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,108
Since I drank the love potion,
I might get jealous

74
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,610
and come between you and Jae-gyeong.

75
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,780
Gosh, what should I do?

76
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,783
This is driving me crazy.

77
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,411
What should I do?

78
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,498
Right.

79
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,750
What about you? Are you feeling better?

80
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,420
I don't know.

81
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,630
Think about it.

82
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,048
I only cast two spells.

83
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,968
The Love Spell worked
but the Cure Disease Spell didn't.

84
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,886
-Does that make sense?
-Use your brain.

85
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,223
You cast the Love Spell first.
Cure Disease Spell was next.

86
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,058
That was the order of spells.

87
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,395
Okay. Then let's talk again
once you're cured.

88
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,772
If you can prove
the Cure Disease Spell worked,

89
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,192
I'll believe that
the Love Spell worked too.

90
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,238
You're avoiding responsibility?

91
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,451
Fine.

92
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,453
If that's what you think.

93
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:29,871
Yes.

94
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,924
What is it now?

95
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,510
Look.

96
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,346
My feet won't move.

97
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,681
Because I miss you.

98
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,977
How can you explain this?

99
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,730
Goodness.

100
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,315
Don't go…

101
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,567
Go away.

102
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,156
Let's go, Jang Sin-yu.

103
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:06,991
Gosh.

104
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:11,370
I should've realized
when he called himself a puppy.

105
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,831
He really is a dog.

106
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,084
He speaks nonsense.

107
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:37,563
LIFE

108
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,529
What am I going to do

109
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,948
with this ticklish feeling?

110
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,668
Jae-gyeong does like you.

111
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,258
Is it because he likes me?

112
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,678
I wanted to meet you

113
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,639
because I had a question.

114
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,019
Why do you like me?

115
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,737
When I worked in the Onju Dong-gu Office,

116
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:30,741
I once went to inspect a dog shelter.

117
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,328
There was a complaint
about dogs barking loudly.

118
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,498
I saw you there.

119
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,377
The project manager told me

120
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,005
that you've been
volunteering for a long time.

121
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,675
You got fooled by the prejudice

122
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:50,470
that those who like animals
are always good people.

123
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,097
But you know what?

124
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,267
Animals are abandoned
by those who like animals as well.

125
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,394
I often wish…

126
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,195
that I didn't have a family.

127
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,239
I'm kind to abandoned dogs,

128
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,408
but I'm very cold to my family.

129
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,911
I may look fine on the outside,

130
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,288
but I'm not on the inside.

131
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:23,419
If I weren't who I was,

132
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,839
when you confessed your feelings for me,

133
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,799
I would've been happy.

134
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,762
But I wasn't, because that's how I am.

135
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:36,641
So meet someone better than me.

136
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,094
Meet someone better than me.

137
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,266
I thought you were perfect.

138
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,727
But you are a lonely person.

139
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,410
Gi-dong.

140
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,329
Do I look lonely to you too?

141
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,248
Yes.

142
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:47,253
You have that lonely autumn blues vibe.
Something like that.

143
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,256
That happens when you
don't date for a long time.

144
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,801
You should've dated Hong-jo.

145
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,262
She was cute. You lost a catch.

146
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,354
FATHER

147
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,775
Do we have the date
for the Onjeong-dong fieldwork?

148
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,572
-Not yet.
-Please do it quick.

149
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,169
FATHER: I'M HEADING CITY HALL
IF YOU DON'T PICK UP

150
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,469
LAWYER JANG SIN-YU

151
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:40,431
I knew I'd end up loving you

152
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,477
On the day we first met

153
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:46,771
Who?

154
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,866
Why do people around me have bad manners?

155
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,244
Are you saying I have bad manners?

156
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,871
I said that because of how

157
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,832
you don't knock.

158
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,460
Why don't you knock before coming in?

159
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,213
Please knock before you come in.

160
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,339
I don't want to.

161
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,927
The coupons I received yesterday in return
for telling you where Mr. Kwon went,

162
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,637
I'll use one of them.

163
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,223
No-knocking coupon.

164
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,934
You want to waste that on this?

165
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,435
I decide when to use it.

166
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,897
I'll think carefully
about when to use the other two.

167
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,901
About the date
for the Onjeong-dong fieldwork…

168
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:34,985
When are you free?

169
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,070
Any date is fine.

170
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,241
How is

171
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,868
Mr. Kwon?

172
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,871
Did he look happy today?

173
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:48,624
No.

174
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:51,877
He asked a strange question
on whether he looked lonely.

175
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,840
So I told him to date Hong-jo--

176
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,843
That's none of your business!
And? Did he say he would?

177
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,307
I don't think he'll date her.

178
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,228
He continued to look lonely.

179
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,483
So nothing happened.

180
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,032
Where are you going?

181
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,702
To make a confession.

182
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,499
Su-jeong and Sae-byeol
are managing the forest together.

183
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,251
Yes.

184
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:37,256
The business covers a huge area,
and it involves a big budget.

185
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,924
What about you?

186
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,970
I need to change the tree labels
on Mount Onju by this week.

187
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,431
And by next week,
I should check play facilities

188
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,766
and prepare a firework festival. And--

189
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,310
You're doing a lot on your own.

190
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,690
When I wasn't around,

191
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,942
did Mr. Gong bully you?

192
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:57,860
I didn't.

193
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,904
I didn't ask you, Mr. Gong.

194
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,363
I asked Hong-jo.

195
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,286
No, nothing happened.

196
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,709
I'll be joining the task force
directly under the mayor.

197
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,420
Mr. Gong, be more attentive
with work distribution.

198
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,380
And the final announcement.

199
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,591
There's no outcast in my department.

200
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,761
Cherish, love, and help each other.

201
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,346
That's all.

202
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,639
Thank you.

203
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,432
I'm Jang Sin-yu, legal advisor.

204
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,352
These are for you.

205
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,816
Why did you bring them here?

206
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,610
To make a confession.

207
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:44,615
I wrecked the hanging baskets
set up by your team.

208
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,410
-You were the one who did that?
-Yes.

209
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,205
It was an unintended car accident,

210
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,499
but I made you work twice.

211
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,668
So I apologize.

212
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,213
You didn't have to buy these.

213
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,422
Thank you.

214
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,717
It looked like Hong-jo
was getting bullied in the team.

215
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:06,845
I was worried

216
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,432
that she might be bullied
even more because of my mistake.

217
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,353
It was totally my fault.

218
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,480
It wasn't Hong-jo's fault.

219
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,399
Let's make that clear.

220
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,651
I understand.

221
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,737
Hong-jo, you may leave now.

222
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,406
The rest, stay.

223
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,908
Okay.

224
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,935
What's going on?

225
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,818
How could you say that there?
I'm in a tougher spot now.

226
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,777
So am I.

227
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,446
I hate disposables,

228
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:09,116
but I bought lots of coffee to go
and even heart-shaped cookies.

229
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,494
I never brown-nose anyone,
but I bowed slightly.

230
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,663
Why did I embarrass myself like that?

231
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,664
Because of you.

232
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,459
Do you think I want this?

233
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:21,211
I can't control my feelings
because of the spell.

234
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,049
Wait. Why are you suddenly
speaking so openly?

235
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,468
I want to get closer to you.
No, I feel I already am.

236
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,636
Get a grip, Sin-yu.

237
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,846
You're Yoon Na-yeon's boyfriend.

238
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,349
-We broke up.
-What?

239
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,309
That's why it's painful. As I said,

240
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,020
I was supposed to be in pain
and keep a low profile.

241
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,356
In the emotions control center in my head,

242
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,399
sadness should be working actively.

243
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,694
But Joy is having fun cluelessly.
Why? Because of you.

244
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,239
-This is crazy.
-I'm the one going crazy.

245
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,493
It's a norepinephrine,
serotonin and dopamine rush.

246
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,286
They're released because of you.

247
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,747
You're not the only person.

248
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,749
Mr. Gong might have drunk it too.

249
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,626
Then he must like me too.

250
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,503
He probably drank a little.

251
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,297
I drank one whole cup.
A fatal amount if it was poison.

252
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,299
Is that why your love is fatal?

253
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,718
-Stop joking.
-You think I'm joking?

254
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:17,059
What do I do?

255
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,859
Don't blame yourself.
It hurts my heart too.

256
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,368
Let go of my hand.

257
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,414
I didn't do it to hold your hand.

258
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,665
No.

259
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,501
I think I did it on purpose
to hold your hand.

260
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,422
See? I hate myself doing this.
What are you going to do?

261
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,465
Break the spell by all means. Please.

262
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:50,884
I have a good idea.

263
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,720
Drink a lot of water.

264
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,972
When the love potion is urinated,

265
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,265
you'll return to normal.

266
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,600
I didn't think of that. Are you a genius?

267
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,310
I'll do my best.

268
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,604
Okay. Then do your best.

269
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,522
I'll be off.

270
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,029
Drink with me.

271
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,531
Can you drink with me?

272
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,951
You wanted to go to a teahouse with me.

273
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,498
Get a grip, Sin-yu.

274
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:25,919
Sin-yu

275
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,130
is sick.

276
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:34,928
I'm sure he didn't mean it
when he said he wanted to break up.

277
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,264
I had a hunch.

278
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,434
I've heard of the rumor

279
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,103
about the hereditary disease.

280
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,190
Sin-yu said

281
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,987
that I was
the most selfish person in the world.

282
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,324
He must be right.

283
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:59,161
I'll shamelessly ask you for a favor.

284
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,706
I want you

285
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,376
to stay by Sin-yu's side.

286
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,652
I'm supposed to
deliver it tomorrow. I'm sorry.

287
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,446
It's okay. Now I can
check for the typos beforehand.

288
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,364
You should hurry.

289
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,074
Thank you for understanding.

290
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,368
-I'll carry them.
-I'll do it.

291
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,204
Go now. You don't want to
miss your baby's birth.

292
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,206
-Okay. Thank you.
-No worries.

293
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,220
What are you doing?

294
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,805
Helping you carry them.

295
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,307
Where to? The lobby?
Greenway Building Division?

296
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,145
-Give me that.
-I'll carry them for you.

297
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:10,941
My gosh.

298
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,401
I'll help.

299
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,781
You did that to mess with me, didn't you?

300
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:21,118
Yes, I think I did it
on purpose to be with you.

301
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,879
You really don't have to help.

302
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,339
What will others think when they see us?

303
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:38,177
They'll think I'm a kind,
nice, and considerate lawyer.

304
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,513
But I don't want that. I want to be
that kind of lawyer only to you.

305
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,101
How much did you drink?

306
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,478
I don't think you urinated
the love potion out.

307
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,607
I had five cups of coffee
and five liters of water.

308
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,693
Going to the bathroom 32 times,
I reached a conclusion.

309
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,111
I am under a spell,

310
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,572
and this spell
cannot be urinated out of me.

311
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:02,367
And I think
the Cure Disease Spell worked too.

312
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,120
Look. My hand is fine too.

313
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,748
I think the disease got worse.

314
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,042
It moved to your head.

315
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,793
I'm worried. Go to the hospital.

316
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,587
I was actually on my way

317
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,339
to the hospital.

318
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,390
Before that,

319
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,726
let me go to the bathroom first.

320
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,395
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

321
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,743
What is it?

322
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,536
My feet won't move,

323
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,665
even now when nature's calling.

324
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,375
I want to see you longer.

325
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,378
What's with your eyes?

326
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:57,631
What about them?

327
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,759
Are they shooting hearts?

328
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:16,733
Ma'am!

329
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,070
You're back.

330
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,950
I missed you so much.

331
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,995
I was so lonely
because you weren't around.

332
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,583
Then are you going to sell this house?

333
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,044
No.

334
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,046
I'm going to rent it out.

335
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,215
Don't worry about it.

336
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,134
Since you live on the second floor,

337
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,721
I told them clearly
I want a trustworthy tenant only.

338
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:50,976
Are you feeling down?

339
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,438
I hope you get a boyfriend soon.

340
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,648
Isn't there anyone nice at City Hall?

341
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,821
There is.

342
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,576
But I can't tell
what the nice guy is thinking.

343
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:11,121
And the not-so-nice guy
chases me around making it too obvious.

344
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,083
As a woman,

345
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,211
it's best to date a man who likes you.

346
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,342
And I like you too.

347
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,718
Don't make that face.

348
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:25,886
My heart flutters.

349
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,804
My feet won't move.

350
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:28,889
Because I miss you.

351
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,308
Are they shooting hearts?

352
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,311
It gives me chills.

353
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,699
Aren't you tired?

354
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,787
This Korean mountain magnolia
is called Siebold's magnolia too.

355
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,873
It's very aromatic
when you drink it as tea.

356
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,460
Do you know the names
of all the plants here?

357
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,003
Let's see.

358
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,256
Japanese cornel, sawtooth oak,

359
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:47,843
Korean dogwood, crape myrtle, and beech.

360
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:49,803
Sir.

361
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,429
That isn't beech.

362
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,681
That's Meliosma.

363
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,100
I see.

364
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,062
Beech or Meliosma.

365
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,189
They look similar.

366
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,400
Why is he so picky?

367
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,443
Sir.

368
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,533
Looking for this?

369
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,121
This is yours, right?

370
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,124
Yes. Where was it?

371
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,125
Over there.

372
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,085
You always leave something behind.

373
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:40,437
By any chance,

374
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:44,691
did he drink the love potion too?

375
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,152
Actually,

376
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:51,740
you look a lot like my wife.

377
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:57,495
We started a flower garden
because she liked flowers.

378
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,874
But she passed away.

379
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,127
Gosh.

380
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,838
I must have made you feel uncomfortable.

381
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,801
It's okay.

382
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:16,973
I know very well how painful it is
when you miss someone so much,

383
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,518
but you have nobody with whom
you can talk about them.

384
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:25,440
The heavier the story is,
the lighter it gets when you share it.

385
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:29,444
So when you want to talk about it,
talk to me anytime.

386
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,904
I'll listen to you.

387
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,994
Just hearing that makes me feel lifted.

388
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,249
-Eat up.
-Okay.

389
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,709
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

390
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,104
Who is it?

391
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:09,150
You're the worst.

392
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:13,947
You didn't get a promotion
not because of Hong-jo.

393
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,449
You wouldn't have been promoted anyway.

394
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,827
You're lazy and you avoid problems.

395
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:22,122
If you put all the traits
of a civil servant I hate in one place,

396
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:24,833
that would be you, Mr. Gong.

397
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,507
Why aren't you getting off work?

398
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:38,430
Both you and Mr. Gong are working.

399
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,974
Get off work if you want to.
Don't mind us.

400
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,477
You can go home when you're done.

401
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,855
-Okay.
-Yes.

402
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,149
Thank you.

403
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,525
Thank you.

404
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,656
I'm telling you this because
Ms. Ma said there were no outcasts.

405
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,159
Ms. Ma's nickname is Ms. Malicious.

406
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:02,829
Don't do that.
Using names to make nicknames.

407
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:06,624
If Ms. Ma is Ms. Malicious,
is Mr. Ha "Mr. Happy"?

408
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,001
I'm Mr. Gong,

409
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,295
so I should be Gong Yoo then.

410
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:15,508
I don't want to be Gong Yoo,
but you can call me that if you want.

411
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,387
-See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

412
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,141
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

413
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:34,402
Would you like a drink?

414
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,862
See you tomorrow.

415
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,038
They act like I pooped or something.

416
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,584
SHINMOK CREDIT UNION

417
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:50,543
Hello, Hong-jo.

418
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,045
Hello.

419
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,004
I got a tenant.

420
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,255
He's very trustworthy.

421
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,217
Even the owner was fine with him.

422
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,885
He's very tall and handsome.

423
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,513
He looks like a nice guy too.

424
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,516
If you end up dating him,
you should thank me.

425
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,684
I don't think that will happen.

426
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,561
This is troubling.

427
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,484
I'm sorry.

428
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,652
Someone was following me.

429
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,656
Stay here for a while.

430
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,718
Someone was definitely following me.

431
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,222
Well, he shouldn't have.

432
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:11,810
Don't use this path from now.

433
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,399
I lost my phone.

434
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,985
Can you come with me?

435
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,073
Of course.

436
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,960
I think it was around here.

437
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,548
What happened?

438
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:49,013
I turned on the lights for you.

439
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,558
Why don't we change the order?

440
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,684
The order?

441
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:53,643
Yes.

442
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,272
It's better to work
on high-crime areas first.

443
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,609
That's a great idea.

444
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,821
My son-in-law never disappoints.

445
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,157
You've become a true City Hall lawyer.

446
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,079
I abused my power to light up your alley.

447
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:16,416
The problem is, the street lamps
aren't the only ones lit up.

448
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,251
My heart lit up too.

449
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:19,794
It's twinkling.

450
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:24,924
Oh, there it is!

451
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,555
Thank goodness. The screen is fine.

452
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,432
The screen may be fine,

453
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,100
but my heart isn't…

454
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,733
What are you doing?

455
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,903
Give it back.

456
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:47,864
What are you looking at?

457
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,333
Why do you look like this?

458
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,628
I had to. It was a school play.

459
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,087
I saw this face.

460
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,591
I've never met you before,
but I saw this face.

461
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,303
What do you mean?
We met in the haunted house.

462
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,513
We're meeting now too.

463
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,437
Now I get why my dream felt so refreshing.

464
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,773
I liked it because it was that face.

465
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,652
The clothes were from late Joseon.

466
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,403
I had a high status even then.

467
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,739
You looked like you had a very low status.

468
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:32,575
I never saw you when you were young.

469
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,161
But you appeared
in my dream with that face.

470
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,664
-Take responsibility for it.
-For what?

471
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,124
I want to be in pain
and keep a low profile.

472
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,417
But I can't.

473
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,878
I should be
in tremendous pain from the breakup,

474
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,422
but I feel butterflies because of you.

475
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,675
When I'm awake, I think about this alley.

476
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,094
When I'm asleep, I meet your younger self.

477
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,637
So you're responsible for it.

478
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:00,603
Let's go together.

479
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,982
Where? At this late hour?

480
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,943
Hong-jo, that is a terribly

481
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,027
good idea. Where?

482
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,322
To find out how to break the spell.

483
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,573
I see.

484
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:15,702
Right. We should
break the spell. Of course.

485
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:20,581
But I don't want to break it.
It's not that way…

486
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,251
But let's walk together anyway.

487
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,259
You're so early.

488
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:34,012
It's past 9:00 p.m. We're not early.

489
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,681
I should've come
when I got the wooden box. Sorry.

490
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,266
I have a question.

491
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,227
Is the spell book
in the box really effective?

492
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,648
Can't you tell from looking at me?

493
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,275
Of course it's effective.

494
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,487
Did you get me anything?

495
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,656
No. She was in a hurry.

496
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,783
Would you like this instead?

497
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:01,497
This.

498
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,250
You're better than him.

499
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,461
He's tactless.

500
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,840
I don't do group fortune-telling.

501
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,300
Sin-yu, you first.

502
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,302
Hong-jo, after him.

503
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:20,308
She made the love potion
to cast the Love Spell on another guy.

504
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:22,977
But I drank it.

505
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,563
That's bad.

506
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:29,067
I don't want to feel butterflies
around that woman outside, but I do.

507
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,986
I don't want to do this.
But I can't control my body.

508
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,530
And maybe even my mind.

509
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,909
Anyway, this is urgent.

510
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,788
Teach me how to break the spell.

511
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,416
I don't know that either.

512
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,335
I'm not the owner of the wooden box.

513
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,506
The woman you said was the owner
of the wooden box doesn't know either.

514
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,132
Is that so?

515
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,636
Then it can't be helped.

516
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,014
That's a relief.

517
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,600
I don't want to break the spell at all.

518
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,728
Look at this. What are you going to do?

519
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,105
I have no time.

520
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,483
What if I end up

521
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:11,984
really loving her?

522
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,995
You have no power in this.

523
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,832
Everything is up to her.

524
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:35,049
-What did she say?
-She won't budge.

525
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,552
She says everything
is up to you, so do your best.

526
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,304
You must find out how to break the spell.

527
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,056
Grill her if you have to.

528
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,351
I'll tell her you told me to grill her.

529
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:49,605
No, that's not what I meant.

530
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,945
She's cute when she talks.

531
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,698
She's cuter when she runs.

532
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,826
Get a grip, Jang Sin-yu.

533
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,920
It's so nice.

534
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,922
My first time drinking in two years.

535
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,550
Take this with you.
I don't want to get scolded.

536
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,636
Next time, bring soju.

537
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,596
Okay.

538
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:25,224
I'll bring it in a big tumbler
so they can't find out.

539
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:31,022
Don't bring it to the river this time.

540
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,065
Your dad isn't there.

541
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,070
Can you see all that?

542
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,865
He saved two lives, so he'll be blessed.

543
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,034
Don't feel so heartbroken.

544
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,620
Okay.

545
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:50,958
Right. Why did you give me the wooden box?

546
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,670
Because you're the chosen one.

547
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,798
Then what about Jang Sin-yu?

548
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,051
It's hard to believe,

549
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,887
but he surely became strange
after drinking the love potion.

550
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,681
He says he likes me and his heart races.

551
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,017
He even broke up with his girlfriend.

552
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,978
It's weighing on my mind.
The spell might've caused it.

553
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,273
Is there any way?

554
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,699
There's only one way.

555
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,205
What is it?

556
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,217
Did you find out?

557
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,260
I don't know.

558
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,053
What do you not know? The method?

559
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,304
I don't want to say it.

560
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,974
You heard how,
but don't want to say it? Why?

561
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:51,477
I can't dare say it myself.

562
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,479
I knew it.

563
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,022
The way to break the spell.

564
00:37:58,985 --> 00:37:59,902
A kiss.

565
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,031
The Frog Prince, Beauty and the Beast,

566
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,783
Snow White, and Shrek.

567
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,828
All curses can be lifted with a kiss.

568
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,163
That's not it.

569
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,873
NURI NURSING HOSPITAL

570
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,210
If it's not a kiss,
but you can't say it, could it be--

571
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,422
I don't know what you're thinking,
but it's not that type of thing.

572
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,007
Go home and sleep.

573
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:24,218
-Where are you going?
-To take a bus.

574
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,680
How can you leave alone
when we came together?

575
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,390
I want to be alone.

576
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,517
I don't want to be with you.

577
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,854
Do you think I'm doing this
because I want to be with you?

578
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:37,398
Yes. I'm doing this
because I want to be with you.

579
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,443
Can you please get in my car with me?

580
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:46,949
Don't look at me with those starry eyes.

581
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,413
Don't look at me

582
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,498
with the prettiest face in the world.

583
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,796
I'm not that pretty.

584
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,341
I know. But you are to me.

585
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,395
You said you only blushed
in front of someone you liked.

586
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,359
This isn't because I like you.

587
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:25,363
What you're feeling now
is exactly what I'm feeling.

588
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,031
Your mind separate from your body,

589
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,533
and the hemispheres
of your brain out of sync.

590
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,370
It's like singing an opera song
on Show Me The Money.

591
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,919
If you have a conscience

592
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,630
and a sense of responsibility,

593
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,925
let me give you a ride home at least.

594
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,191
Let me ask you a favor.

595
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,151
Please don't appear in my dreams.

596
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,403
No.

597
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,029
Please appear.

598
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,614
So I can see you in my dreams.

599
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,574
Please.

600
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,787
Appear, please don't appear.

601
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,664
Appear. Don't.

602
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,750
Get a grip, Jang Sin-yu.

603
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:30,678
AENG-CHO, A SHAMAN OF JOSEON,
WAS DISMEMBERED.

604
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,348
The first person
to write the book was Aeng-cho.

605
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,183
Aeng-cho was a real person.

606
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,448
COMMANDMENTS

607
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,992
"You cannot reverse the spell easily."

608
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,202
"If you reverse it,

609
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,746
a disaster will befall you."

610
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:10,259
Why won't she tell me what it was?

611
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:15,973
What's something she can't say
that is not a kiss?

612
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:23,105
EUN-WOL

613
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,324
What did you tell Hong-jo?

614
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,368
I can't remember.

615
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,912
Don't play dumb.

616
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,914
Only a few hours have passed.

617
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:44,376
When the spirits possess me to speak,
I often can't remember what I said.

618
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:45,961
You're lying.

619
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,714
Have you ever served a god?

620
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:51,634
You haven't.

621
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,053
Don't bother an old lady.

622
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,305
If you're so curious, ask Hong-jo.

623
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,307
Can I do that?

624
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,935
Not right now though.

625
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:04,438
Okay.

626
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,661
I'm sorry you got hurt,
but it's not our fault

627
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,496
that the stairs were wet--

628
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,748
Fuck, are you deaf?

629
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:25,167
The stairs were wet!

630
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,086
So I fell. What nonsense is this?

631
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:30,005
I don't know
why the stairs were wet, but--

632
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:30,965
You bitch.

633
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,425
How dare you talk back?

634
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,886
I would appreciate it
if you stopped swearing--

635
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,972
How can I not swear in this situation?

636
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,390
What's your position?

637
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,851
How dare you swear?

638
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,937
This is why you fell at the park.

639
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,939
Who are you? What's your name?

640
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,691
My name?

641
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:51,443
Manager Ma Eun-yeong
of Greenway Building Division.

642
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:52,820
Aka Ms. Malicious.

643
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,238
What? Malicious?

644
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,657
Let me see that freaking face of yours.

645
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,326
You want to see my face?

646
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,079
That's great. I want to see your face too.

647
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:03,956
What? That's great.

648
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:06,458
-I'll go fight you now.
-I won't.

649
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,752
I don't fight with someone who's drunk.

650
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,337
And you know what?

651
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,257
This phone call is being recorded.

652
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:16,802
He hung up.

653
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,848
He's called three times now.

654
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,809
When he calls again, don't talk to him

655
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,394
and connect him to me.

656
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,271
Okay.

657
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:33,902
Gong.

658
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,572
Let's have a talk.

659
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:49,043
If your juniors are getting cussed at,

660
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,253
you should be on standby and protect them.

661
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,005
You roam around during the morning,

662
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,757
doze off all day,

663
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,009
check your phone, then go home.

664
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,470
Are you serious?

665
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,764
I had something to do.

666
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:04,933
There are more than
2,000 people working in City Hall.

667
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:06,977
All of them have something to do.

668
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:10,272
Instead of complaining
about not being promoted,

669
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,358
reflect on yourself

670
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,734
and figure out why.

671
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,861
Or you'll be sent somewhere far.

672
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,988
-I'm sorry, but--
-You should be.

673
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,615
No. I have a phone call.

674
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,243
Gong Seo-gu speaking.

675
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,037
Yes.

676
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,499
I understand.

677
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,378
Come with me somewhere.

678
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:34,963
We're still working. Let me go.

679
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,007
Stop. Where are you going?

680
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,468
Are you going to a restaurant again?

681
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:43,847
-He filed a lawsuit against hate comments?
-Yes.

682
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,141
A third party filed a lawsuit,

683
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:49,269
so I called you for a fact-check.

684
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,565
He collected a lot of evidence.

685
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:55,734
There won't be an issue.

686
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:56,944
The ones who wrote--

687
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,362
I won't sue them.

688
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,073
I don't want to punish them.

689
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,755
One thousand pages of hate comments?

690
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:19,967
You didn't get to sleep

691
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,053
-because of this?
-Yes.

692
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,056
Why would you do something so useless?

693
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,057
"Useless"?

694
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:31,145
They said he cheated

695
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,522
because you were ugly.

696
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:37,985
They also said you got pregnant
and forced him to marry you.

697
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:39,862
I see stuff like that every day.

698
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:42,322
-How can I stay still?
-Let them be.

699
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,200
Why do you care about me?

700
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:47,369
Am I a stranger to you?

701
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,829
You are.

702
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,123
Even my husband
that I lived with for 20 years is.

703
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:52,332
You're nothing.

704
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,793
I've been your colleague for 21 years.

705
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:55,961
Am I still nothing?

706
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:56,879
Yes.

707
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:30,204
Lee Hong-jo
of Park Maintenance Team speaking.

708
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,084
Now?

709
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:37,961
Okay.

710
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,300
What is it? Is he the same guy?

711
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:45,177
No, a different person.

712
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,012
He said the flowers

713
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,681
in the park were withered,
so I should go check now.

714
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,016
Or he'll report it

715
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:53,352
to National Civil Service
for wasting taxes.

716
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:56,480
There are days
when you get tons of complaints.

717
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:59,316
The day you hit the jackpot.

718
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:00,400
How scary.

719
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,658
They're not withered.

720
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,201
They're very fresh.

721
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:16,458
This?

722
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:19,962
This is just starting to bloom.

723
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,340
That's not the flower.

724
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:30,681
Are you the one that made the complaint?

725
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,395
Look.

726
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,188
The flower over here is withering

727
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,107
because it couldn't see you.

728
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,483
Withered, my foot.

729
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,651
It looks cooler.

730
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:46,905
Are you saying you find me cool too?

731
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:48,740
That's a relief.

732
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,993
I did my best to look good in your eyes.

733
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:52,953
Usually, I shower for ten minutes.

734
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,788
But today, it took longer than 20.

735
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:57,374
I spent more than 30 minutes
to choose my clothes.

736
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:59,042
I even put on some perfume.

737
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,044
I didn't know what perfume you'd like,

738
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:02,504
so woody on the left

739
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,673
and citrus on the right.

740
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:06,174
Which side do you like?

741
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,637
I had tons of complaint calls.

742
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,180
Do you have to go this far?

743
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,974
I don't want to do this either.

744
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:17,728
I just broke up with my girlfriend
I've been dating for two years.

745
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,146
Falling for you is wrong.

746
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:22,691
It's like I'm the only one wearing
a Hawaiian shirt at a funeral.

747
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:25,235
Tell me what Eun-wol said.

748
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,029
How can I break the spell?

749
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,908
She didn't tell me how to break the spell.

750
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:33,285
Then what was it?

751
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,038
I won't tell you.

752
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:37,831
-I'm off. I'm busy.
-I'm busy too.

753
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:39,875
Don't you see the document in my hands?

754
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:42,753
They need my advice
on paying the standing committee.

755
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:46,381
What ordinance we should follow
to pay the standing committee.

756
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:47,966
They have varied opinions.

757
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,552
I don't know how much
a normal civil servant gets.

758
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,012
I need to learn everything.

759
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,263
But I can't study.

760
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,348
Why?

761
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:56,183
Because of you.

762
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:59,269
Because I want to study you.

763
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,566
-I'll report you to the Audit Team.
-Then I'll tell them the truth.

764
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,861
You liked Jae-gyeong,
so you used the Love Spell.

765
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:11,239
But I, who happened to sit next to him,
took the brunt of it.

766
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,034
You shouldn't hit anyone,
even with flowers.

767
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,827
And you hit me with the spell.

768
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:18,830
I'm a victim.

769
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:21,124
Do you really want me to hit you?

770
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,960
There are a lot of fresh
and pretty flowers here.

771
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,629
Really?

772
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:28,674
Don't follow me.

773
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:32,928
Where are you going?

774
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,847
You hit my right side. Hit my left too.

775
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:37,432
Where are you going?

776
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,523
I cooked dried yellow croaker.
You don't want it?

777
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,484
Is it

778
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:49,903
because of Na-yeon?

779
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,823
Did something happen between you two?

780
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:54,825
It's not about that.

781
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,952
Tell me.

782
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:58,370
What happened?

783
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:00,414
It's just…

784
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:04,584
there's something I want to know,
but she wouldn't tell me.

785
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,920
If she doesn't tell you,

786
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:08,463
play charades.

787
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,173
Don't you watch TV?

788
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,050
Charades.

789
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:22,519
"I can't stand living with your dad"?

790
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:24,938
TC.

791
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:26,064
That's correct?

792
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:27,983
See?

793
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:30,235
You can understand without speaking.

794
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,195
Ask her to give you hints.

795
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,114
Are you kidding?

796
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,658
He's very serious.

797
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:39,035
You can't read the room.

798
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,550
"I moved in downstairs."

799
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,926
"Nice to meet you."

800
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,431
"I want to grow plants."

801
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:02,684
"Tell me if there's any plant you like."

802
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,188
He's a nice person.

803
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,606
Sirutteok tastes good too.

804
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,741
GROOT

805
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,916
-What now?
-What else?

806
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,043
I missed you so much I video called--

807
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:30,086
-Get to the point.
-Charades.

808
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:31,296
What?

809
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:32,756
You didn't want to say it.

810
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:34,424
So tell me with your gestures.

811
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:35,759
Give me a hint.

812
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,346
She didn't say much.

813
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,264
I'll decide that.

814
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,351
If you don't give me a hint,

815
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:47,687
I might come to your house right now.

816
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,648
Fine. I'll give you a hint.

817
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,613
You and I

818
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,324
won't work out. It's an X.

819
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,202
-Are those fingers from E.T.?
-Wrong.

820
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,959
You and I, two of us.

821
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,129
We pray and say thank you.

822
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,214
Wrong.

823
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,425
Third time is your last chance.

824
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:21,680
Then no more charades.
Give me the first letters of each word.

825
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:27,853
Fine. But if you're wrong again,
don't bother me again.

826
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,896
I won't. I mean, got it.

827
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,523
Got it.

828
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:51,293
YDCBSAI

829
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:14,941
What are you two doing?

830
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,651
Sin-yu asked for my help

831
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:17,986
to solve an initial puzzle.

832
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:20,864
YDCBSAI

833
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:22,699
Isn't this too difficult?

834
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:23,909
How do you solve this?

835
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,413
What's the prize

836
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:30,540
for solving this?

837
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,252
I can break a curse?

838
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:35,170
What?

839
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,218
Guess it now.

840
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:46,014
I'm good at stuff like this.

841
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,935
You don't care,

842
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:52,270
big son ate ice?

843
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:55,982
Big son ate icing.

844
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,652
Big son ate Italian.

845
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:01,112
Bald snowman's aching ice.

846
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:03,573
What could it be?

847
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,827
"I'll get the flowers."

848
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,121
"I'm close with a flower garden owner."

849
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,957
"Thanks for the sirutteok."

850
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,792
We have nothing more to talk about.

851
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:22,008
I gave you my house deposit.

852
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,552
That was my final present for you.

853
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:27,097
No.

854
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,765
I can't do this longer.

855
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,559
I'm going to change my number.

856
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,036
Darn it.

857
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,374
Hong-jo?

858
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,465
Hello.

859
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,592
I'm Hong-jo, I live on the second floor.

860
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:08,513
Congratulations on moving in
on the first floor.

861
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:32,245
Is this what they call destiny?

862
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,272
I'LL GET THE FLOWERS.
THANKS FOR THE SIRUTTEOK.

863
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:01,107
YDCBSAI

864
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,321
There's no such Japanese.

865
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,114
Do you know Japanese?

866
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:10,158
I'm sure you do.

867
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:12,869
Give me three more days.

868
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:14,704
You won't solve it in 30 days.

869
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:17,332
This.

870
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:19,667
Your girlfriend's friend left it behind.

871
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,341
I'm sorry.

872
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:29,052
I can't pass it on to her now.

873
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:32,806
I understand.

874
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,059
What do you mean?
Why can't you pass it on to her?

875
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,479
We broke up.

876
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:44,651
She used to hit on you so much.
Is she breaking up because you're sick?

877
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,653
I thought she was better than this.

878
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:47,737
I didn't tell her.

879
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:50,406
Are you mad?

880
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:54,244
During hard times,
you need someone beside you.

881
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:55,954
It'll only make it hard for her.

882
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,457
Are you seriously trying to look cool now?

883
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,708
That's not being cool.

884
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,544
That's just bravado.

885
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:42,352
What brings you here in the morning?

886
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:44,395
You came to me last night.

887
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:48,066
Appearing in my dream
every night is very rude.

888
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:50,818
Timothée Chalamet appears in my dreams.

889
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,904
"You're rude." Should I DM him that?

890
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:54,155
Don't joke around.

891
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:55,823
I'm dead serious.

892
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:57,325
A personal issue came up.

893
00:58:57,408 --> 00:58:58,701
I must break the spell.

894
00:58:58,785 --> 00:58:59,911
If not,

895
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:02,705
I might end up
becoming an asshole who dates others

896
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:05,333
while I care about you.

897
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,505
If you solve the puzzle,
you won't want to come here.

898
00:59:10,588 --> 00:59:12,423
Just tell me the answer.

899
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,927
You said you would solve it yourself.

900
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:18,596
You also promised
not to bother me if you couldn't.

901
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,598
Don't go back on your word now.

902
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:22,267
Where are you going?

903
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,602
-I'm going on a date.
-With whom? Jae-gyeong?

904
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:29,357
There's no need
to go on a date with him now.

905
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:31,943
Why?

906
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,946
What do you mean?

907
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:38,449
Tell me what you mean by that.

908
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,119
Breaking the spell…

909
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:46,207
-Hello.
-How are you?

910
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:07,854
It didn't read your card.

911
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:13,234
Why wasn't it read? It's a very good card.

912
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:17,864
The card cannot be used.

913
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,532
-Let's go quickly.
-Hong-jo.

914
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:21,618
Tap it and sit down.

915
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,369
We need to leave.

916
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:24,495
Hong-jo.

917
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:26,497
Can we go now?

918
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:32,920
I'm sorry.

919
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,676
Did you follow me?

920
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,594
No.

921
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,221
Yes. Actually, I did follow you.

922
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:45,725
And you made me pay for you too.

923
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,101
Don't misunderstand.

924
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,311
Mine's a black card.

925
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,955
Did you see the river just now?

926
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:10,124
It looked very pretty.

927
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,419
Be quiet.

928
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,548
Where are we going now?

929
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,010
I told you to be quiet.

930
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:23,137
What's wrong?

931
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,765
Is it because of the bus fare just now?

932
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,160
Who's your date?

933
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:47,286
Seagulls?

934
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:51,082
Stop following me.

935
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,086
Don't you think I'm better than seagulls?

936
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:56,629
We can talk at least.

937
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,299
Does Na-yeon know you're doing this?

938
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:19,068
What?

939
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:21,529
You came all the way here to drink?

940
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:53,436
All this time,

941
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,482
I've never properly commemorated
your death, Dad.

942
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,864
I always went to that river

943
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:08,117
because I didn't know you were here.

944
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,873
But the lady told me you're here.

945
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:18,878
Are you really here?

946
01:03:31,766 --> 01:03:32,934
You must be cold.

947
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:35,436
Dad.

948
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:38,666
I found out…

949
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:42,253
the answer.

950
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:07,653
-Your destinies…
-Your destinies…

951
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:12,366
-…cannot be severed.
-…cannot be severed.

952
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,246
-Accept it.
-Accept it.

953
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:53,866
DESTINED WITH YOU

954
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:57,536
Inseverable destinies normally mean love.

955
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:00,039
But none of these apply to us,

956
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:02,333
so we decided to go against our destinies.

957
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:04,835
I don't know what true love is.

958
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:07,338
My mind and body work separately.

959
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:09,298
Were you in Changdeokgung?

960
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:13,219
Please, stay out of my sight.

961
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:15,137
Why are you doing this to me?

962
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:17,556
Don't worry so much.

963
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,309
Because these feelings aren't real.

964
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:26,565
