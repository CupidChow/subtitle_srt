1
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,966
DESTINED WITH YOU

2
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:14,657
POLICE LINE - DO NOT CROSS

3
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:47,083
Dramas reflected the truth well.

4
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,797
The Grim Reaper is

5
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,133
handsome.

6
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,177
But it's so unfair

7
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:03,349
to die like this
without getting to date someone properly.

8
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,147
No, wait.

9
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:11,900
Still,

10
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,695
I'm lucky to meet
a handsome Grim Reaper like him…

11
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,532
aren't I?

12
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:38,718
You'll accompany me
to the afterlife, right?

13
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,722
Or are we going to a teahouse first?

14
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,644
I'd like to go to a teahouse with you.

15
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,110
Stop him!

16
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,528
Let me go first!

17
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,113
SIX MONTHS AGO

18
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:03,493
I checked from 9:00 p.m. yesterday
to 8:00 a.m. today.

19
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:07,038
As the complaint said,
they were really working until dawn.

20
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,458
Exactly. They were drilling
throughout the night again last night.

21
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,168
How can we live like this?

22
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,504
You can stop the construction, right?

23
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,840
Well, it is very noisy.

24
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,219
But they don't exceed the limit set
by the Noise Control Act,

25
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,012
so I don't think we can stop them.

26
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:23,972
Forget it.

27
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,308
We have no choice
but to solve it ourselves.

28
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,186
Everyone, let's go in!

29
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,896
-Let's go!
-Come out!

30
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,023
Gosh.

31
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,484
What's wrong with you people?

32
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,902
You too, Ms. Lee.

33
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,322
Why do you have to respond to
every malicious complaint like this?

34
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,907
I know what you're doing here.

35
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,910
You're just throwing a tantrum

36
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,538
to get compensation!

37
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,293
You rude punk!

38
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,963
Don't do this.

39
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,381
It hurts!

40
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,968
Let me go.

41
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,177
Don't grab me.

42
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,013
Everyone, please calm down.

43
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,015
Come here.

44
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,850
Someone fell!

45
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,729
Project Manager!

46
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,190
PRESENT

47
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,571
A death with a lot of stories.

48
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,239
What a headache.

49
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,649
Don't do this today.

50
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,318
I have a trial in the morning.

51
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,531
I'll be in trouble if you touch me.

52
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,370
Red Hand.

53
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,580
I asked you

54
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,999
not to do this when I'm busy.

55
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,129
Who are you talking to?

56
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,472
To someone that likes me.

57
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,184
Are you having an affair?

58
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,228
We haven't gone that far.

59
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,272
I haven't seen her face yet.

60
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,693
This is how scary sleep deprivation is.

61
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,070
It's three o'clock. Get some sleep.

62
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,697
You'll lose anyway.

63
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,739
What if I don't?

64
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:32,326
Haum has way too many records
of accidental deaths.

65
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,455
And the owner is an atrocious person.

66
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,374
And the judge is an extremely strict one.

67
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,333
I have a question.

68
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:43,004
-Do you have a woman in your room too?
-What woman?

69
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,256
Who do you think
I was talking to just now?

70
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,302
What do you think about Lawyer Kim?

71
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,554
He's sweeter than he looks.

72
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,975
His room is next to mine.
Stop coming to my room and…

73
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,059
Shut it!

74
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:06,777
Your Honor.

75
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,197
Based on our research,

76
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,867
the total number of deaths
at Haum's construction site

77
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,076
were 31.

78
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,205
This proves that this death happened

79
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,917
due to Haum Construction
not fully adhering

80
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,544
to the safety rules
on the construction site.

81
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,132
This is at least ten years.

82
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,968
Darn it.

83
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,763
Counsel, you may give
your final testimony.

84
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,556
DEFENDANT, LAWYER

85
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:47,193
Your Honor. Before the final testimony,

86
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:52,281
I would like to request the wife
of the deceased Park Dae-ho

87
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,033
to be a witness.

88
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,166
Before coming to the court today,

89
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,502
you refused
the settlement offered by Haum.

90
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,379
Were you unhappy with it?

91
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,631
You can't just
hush someone with 100 million

92
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,133
because he does simple labor. It's absurd.

93
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:15,096
Too bad
100 million won couldn't satisfy you.

94
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:19,392
-What did you say?
-Poor onsite management.

95
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:23,396
Lack of safety facilities. Do you think
the fall happened due to these factors?

96
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,772
Yes.

97
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:28,943
He had a hard time working on the site
because of poor working conditions.

98
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,153
I'm sure he had.

99
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,948
Though it must've been hard
mentally, not physically.

100
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,118
Because his wife
forced him to fall and die.

101
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,958
-What nonsense are you--
-No.

102
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,626
I'll correct myself.

103
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,379
You forced him to fall accidentally.

104
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,590
Are you saying he died on purpose?

105
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,050
Your son was diagnosed
with blood cancer, right?

106
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,220
It was a rare type,
so you needed big bucks.

107
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,060
Mrs. Woo Yeong-hui here came up
with an idea to get the money.

108
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:07,064
"Let's get into an accident
and file a lawsuit against Haum.

109
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:11,068
They will get suspicious
if you suddenly take out insurance,

110
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,112
so let's fall and get the settlement.

111
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:17,158
But I should not leave
any evidence on the phone."

112
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:20,661
But Park Dae-ho
must've been a curious person.

113
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,706
So he often borrowed
his co-worker Kim Sang-min's phone.

114
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,875
He deleted the search history,

115
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,170
but here's the forensic data
of the search terms left

116
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,964
from when he borrowed
Kim Sang-min's phone.

117
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,384
He was planning to fall,
so he worked on the fourth floor.

118
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,846
"I wore thick clothes and a safety helmet,

119
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,058
so I won't die even if I fall."

120
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,852
With that thought in mind,
he unclipped the rope clip.

121
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,775
But there happened
to be a hydraulic rebar cutter

122
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,569
and a severed rebar

123
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,863
next to where Park Dae-ho's head landed.

124
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,240
Which penetrated his safety helmet,

125
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,617
and it caused

126
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,744
a very unlucky death.

127
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,539
I rest my case.

128
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:09,669
Witness.

129
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,714
Do you have anything to admit
from what the counsel said?

130
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:17,885
Good job.

131
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,438
Let's keep a lid on it.

132
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,607
Nothing happened yesterday.

133
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,568
I went to the ER
and got a three-week diagnosis.

134
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,239
I can't let it slide.

135
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,741
I think we should take action this time.

136
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,285
Verbal, sexual, and even physical abuse--

137
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,455
That's why
you should not have let that happen.

138
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,167
Entertaining clients is part of your work.

139
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:54,338
You should forget that you're lawyers
if you want to brown-nose them.

140
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,012
Come here.

141
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:05,683
Why?

142
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,643
Is this too much?

143
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,729
Sir.

144
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:11,981
I'll pour you a drink.

145
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,659
You.

146
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,036
How dare you…

147
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:29,582
Let me go.

148
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,542
There are four CCTVs in here.

149
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,794
You'll be charged with assault.

150
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,425
Keep this in mind.

151
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,552
No law firm files a lawsuit against

152
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,888
their biggest client
and a major shareholder.

153
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,017
Let's add a condition.

154
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,356
We can't just keep a lid
on something that stinks.

155
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,949
You think that's due to water pollution?

156
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,494
Call Sanitation Division immediately.

157
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,704
Let's just take them out.

158
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,500
If we leave them be,
we'll get a lot of complaints.

159
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,588
This is…

160
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,007
There are a lot of ways to go crazy.

161
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,511
Were they trying
to cook spicy catfish stew in the lake?

162
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,181
I think they did a ritual of a sort.

163
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,725
Catfish represents wealth,

164
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,270
and the neck is cut off very neatly.

165
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,814
Gosh, put it away.

166
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,526
Put that in here already.
I'm about to throw up.

167
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,531
We should check the CCTV
and find who did this, right?

168
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,200
Stop it.

169
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,369
I've had enough of having it rough

170
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,371
because of you.

171
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:53,541
Do you think handling
all these complaints will get you promoted

172
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,876
to a high position quickly?

173
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,336
Not at all.

174
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,799
You're just a foolish, stubborn,

175
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,969
and tactless ninth-grade civil servant.

176
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,472
Seniors don't like tactless juniors.

177
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,640
We like foxy juniors.

178
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,559
Darn it.

179
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,896
ONJU DONG-GU OFFICE

180
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,897
Sir.

181
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:22,987
I do not want to work with Hong-jo
on a complaint ever again. No way.

182
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,321
GREENWAY BUILDING DIVISION

183
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,073
Dreams indeed come true.

184
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,950
Jeong-min, your dream came true.

185
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,619
Hong-jo's transferred to City Hall.

186
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,957
Why is she transferred?

187
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,916
PERSONNEL APPOINTMENT

188
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,167
What good did she do?

189
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,377
GREENWAY BUILDING DIVISION

190
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,088
Is going to City Hall
exactly a good thing?

191
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,760
You'll definitely see me again
before you quit as a civil servant.

192
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,888
Gosh.

193
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,848
I'm doomed.

194
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,441
What should I do?

195
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,903
Why does it have to be City Hall?

196
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,315
I'm so scared

197
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,151
of meeting Mr. Gong.

198
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:49,740
Don't get scared.

199
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,909
It might not be his team.

200
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,287
Lee Hong-jo. You can do it, right?

201
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,049
Right?

202
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,926
It's a needless fear.

203
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:14,098
Please don't let me join Mr. Gong's team.

204
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,694
How ominous.

205
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,739
The moon is blood red.

206
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,077
The man who goes to hell.

207
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,787
I'm Hello.

208
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,705
Today,

209
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,790
I'm on Mount Onju.

210
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:43,127
When you diverge a bit
from the hiking trail,

211
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,338
you can find this haunted house.

212
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,883
A very skilled shaman used to live here.

213
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,386
I'll go in.

214
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,431
Excuse me.

215
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,359
A cutter blade.

216
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,362
Now,

217
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,157
I'll get going.

218
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,248
Okay.

219
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,670
Look at the talismans.

220
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,506
There's a painting.

221
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,924
Is she the shaman--

222
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,594
What's that?

223
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:34,511
Gosh.

224
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,514
Something's very strange.

225
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,640
It feels…

226
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,269
Something…

227
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,563
Something passed by just now.

228
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,913
I went into that room just now.

229
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,372
Something really came out.

230
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,999
This place has a bad vibe.

231
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,401
I'm scared.

232
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,281
You can do it, Lee Hong-jo.

233
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,661
ONJU CITY

234
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,350
Thank you.

235
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,604
Hello. I'm Lee Hong-jo.

236
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,857
I got transferred
to Park Maintenance Team.

237
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,275
Welcome.

238
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,028
Would you like a welcome drink?

239
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,989
-It's okay.
-I'm sure it is.

240
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:21,493
Did you drink on the first day
of your transfer? Your face…

241
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,328
Oh, my face…

242
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,582
It flushes when I'm stressed.

243
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,251
Are you stressed because you had to join

244
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,712
Park Maintenance Team
of Greenway Building Division,

245
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,964
out of all the departments here,

246
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,465
where I am the team leader?

247
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,176
That's not it. I always--

248
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,094
Life is always fair.

249
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:43,599
Thanks to you, I had surgery
for my stress-induced hemorrhoid.

250
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,268
I'm sorry.

251
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,936
It's all in the past.

252
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,855
It has healed well now.

253
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,232
I don't hold grudges for long.

254
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:53,525
Say hello to the others.

255
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,403
I'm Yoo Su-jeong.

256
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:58,071
I'm Son Sae-byeol.

257
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,407
Nice to meet you.

258
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,119
Where did Manager go?

259
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,704
She's on vacation.

260
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,540
If it weren't for you,
that desk would've been mine.

261
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,086
Don't just stand there. Get to work.

262
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,183
PARK MAINTENANCE TEAM
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

263
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,272
Excuse me.

264
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,107
Are these all my responsibilities?

265
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,610
Mr. Gong.

266
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,404
Hong-jo seems to be unhappy
with the division of work.

267
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,656
-That's not it.
-Really?

268
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,741
I wrote it out in detail for you.

269
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,409
But you must want a summary.

270
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,162
In two words, complete management.

271
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,247
Understood?

272
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,583
Let's have a meeting
about the artificial fountain.

273
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,002
-Okay.
-Okay.

274
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,008
You're dumber than I thought.

275
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,010
Who'll answer the phone if we're all gone?

276
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,181
Right.

277
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,066
ONJU CITY

278
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,110
Ms. Lee, have you decided what to eat?

279
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,487
That's the most important task
of a newcomer.

280
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,574
Yes, I looked up
30 famous nearby restaurants.

281
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,493
One, "Sister's Hot Pot."

282
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,245
Two, "Iseowon Chadol Jjamppong."

283
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,497
Three, "50 Years Hamheung Naengmyeon."

284
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,374
Four, "Spicy Rose Tteokbokki."

285
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,793
What would you like?

286
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,379
What do you want to eat?

287
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,548
Well,

288
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,759
what about hamheung naengmyeon?
It has 50 years of history.

289
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,470
Sure, go with it.

290
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,347
-Okay.
-Enjoy.

291
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,224
We'll go to the cafeteria.

292
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,686
I like a balanced diet that changes daily.

293
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,730
I'll go to the cafeteria too.

294
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,856
That won't do.

295
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:59,318
Only boomers bring
someone who wants to eat naengmyeon

296
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,694
to the cafeteria.

297
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,237
Young ones like to eat alone.

298
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,365
They want to be alone
during the lunch break at least.

299
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:09,202
I have a young mindset. I want to secure
the freedom of young generations.

300
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,207
50 YEARS HAMHEUNG NAENGMYEON

301
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,667
Welcome.

302
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,336
I'm so hungry.

303
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,503
I'll eat it all.

304
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:20,881
It's PV.

305
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,090
Gosh.

306
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,885
He looks great in his suit today too.

307
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:31,141
Why is he called PV, though?

308
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,686
The person in charge
of visuals in Onju City Hall.

309
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,605
Nobody else looks that handsome.

310
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,648
He's so handsome.

311
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:43,320
Kwon Jae-gyeong's existence alone
makes our welfare decent.

312
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,990
I'm glad I became a civil servant.

313
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,034
I'll stay as one until the end.

314
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,833
-I'm sure he has a girlfriend.
-Does it matter?

315
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,461
-Why are you asking that?
-I'm just curious.

316
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,213
It's not your turn.

317
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,506
Whose turn is it?

318
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,465
Mine.

319
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:06,968
Welcome.

320
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:17,020
Is being a lawyer supposed to be boring?

321
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,524
Or did my mind change?

322
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,435
I do need comfort right now.

323
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,314
But could you go wash your hands?

324
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:07,571
Isn't the scent of soap
better than the smell of blood?

325
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:56,203
What are you going to do
about my son?

326
00:24:56,286 --> 00:25:00,415
I made dozens of complaints
to demolish that haunted house.

327
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,334
But you guys turned a deaf ear.

328
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:07,005
We were very shocked
when we read the news too.

329
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,257
My deepest condolences.

330
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,383
Condolences?

331
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,011
How dare you say that?

332
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:18,141
Do you know how scared we were
whenever we hiked because of that house?

333
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:21,394
Demolish it right away!

334
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,814
I'm sorry,

335
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,025
but we're not in charge of demolishing.

336
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,568
It's under Construction.

337
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,153
You should go there.

338
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,071
Look here.

339
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,615
We just went there.

340
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:35,367
And guess what.

341
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,745
They told us to come here
because they weren't in charge of it!

342
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,956
You're just trying to push us aside.

343
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:44,292
We came straight from there.
What nonsense are you saying?

344
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,919
Is this how you work?

345
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,590
Call the mayor here!

346
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,928
Hey, wait.

347
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,430
-Hey.
-Somebody stop him.

348
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,807
I'll handle it.

349
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,187
It's on the Mount Onju Trail.

350
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,147
The trail is a part of the park,

351
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,316
and I'm in charge of the park.

352
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,486
Yes.

353
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:14,531
Ms. Lee over here does her work very well.

354
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:18,076
She was well-known in the office
as the Queen of Complaints.

355
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,870
You can handle this too, right?

356
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,748
Yes.

357
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,215
The video is deleted.

358
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,926
Of course. Someone died.

359
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,638
You really can't read the room.
Why did you say you would do it?

360
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,141
Someone has to do it.

361
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:42,976
What a great civil servant you are.

362
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:44,644
You'll get a commendation.

363
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:50,650
Actually, I wanted
to get brownie points with Mr. Gong.

364
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,445
You know about that incident, right?

365
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,280
Everyone in City Hall knows that.

366
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,916
I'll only accompany you until here.

367
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,169
I need to go up on my own?

368
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,546
I never said
I would go to a haunted place.

369
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,298
I hate horror and thrillers.

370
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,426
I have a weak heart too.

371
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,387
I forgot to tell you
the most important thing.

372
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,599
There's only one raincoat.

373
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,601
Gosh. They call it a shrine,

374
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,686
but it's a haunted house.

375
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:23,493
We have got to demolish this place.

376
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:37,882
My goodness.

377
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,278
What took you so long to come here?

378
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,946
Dramas reflected the truth well.

379
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:27,408
The Grim Reaper is handsome.

380
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:45,927
You'll accompany me
to the afterlife, right?

381
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:50,515
Or are we going to a teahouse first?

382
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:55,645
I'd like to go to a teahouse with you.

383
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:10,869
Grim Reapers nowadays must
collect souls with newest cell phones.

384
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,802
You had a raincoat.

385
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,096
Is that important?

386
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,682
What happened?
Why are you lying down here?

387
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,688
Am I alive?

388
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,107
Well, what do you think?

389
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,781
What you're seeing might be my soul.

390
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:53,036
I just saw a Grim Reaper.

391
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,428
I feel so bad for his death.

392
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,554
I know, right?

393
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:15,266
Everyone except
the younger brother's family passed away.

394
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,853
Is he the oldest son
of the Poongsan Jang family?

395
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,813
The son who's a lawyer?

396
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,315
He's very handsome.

397
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,108
When I gave you the land in Onju,

398
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,486
I told you
to take good care of the shrine.

399
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,364
I entrusted that task to Kim Sam-bong.

400
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,199
"It needs to be repaired."

401
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,034
"My son's business went under."

402
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,119
He implored me with various reasons,

403
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:38,665
so I paid him three years' worth of pay,
300 million won in advance.

404
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,126
But when I went there today,

405
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,798
I realized that Kim Sam-bong
never managed that place.

406
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,675
You got scammed as a lawyer?

407
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,718
You recommended that scammer.

408
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:56,182
Do you not know
how important that shrine is?

409
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,519
You should've visited
and checked regularly.

410
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:02,522
I worked for 100 hours a week
after joining the law firm.

411
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,649
I can't even go to my house nearby.

412
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,609
So how can I manage the shrine?

413
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,778
Quit the law firm right away.

414
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,156
That's enough.

415
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,118
There's no use crying over spilled milk.

416
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,872
I'm sure Sin-yu will take care of it well.

417
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,043
Here.

418
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:26,921
Pour me a drink.

419
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,427
Would you be fine?

420
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,345
I'm 70 years old.

421
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,681
I'll be recorded as the man

422
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,976
that lived the longest in the Jang family.

423
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:43,479
Let me drink as much as I want now.

424
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:49,152
Sin-yu, please age safe and sound

425
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,903
and break my record.

426
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,777
What's wrong? Are you sick?

427
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,448
Don't you know?

428
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,950
It's popular among lawyers.
"Trembling liquor."

429
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,496
When you make your hands tremble
as you pour the liquor,

430
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,707
the air gets mixed in it,
making the liquor taste milder.

431
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:53,591
It tastes nice.

432
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:58,638
Legal professionals
lead the drinking culture.

433
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,099
Would you like it too?

434
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,835
Here.

435
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,922
How do I look?

436
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:37,301
Too much.

437
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,344
What is?

438
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,014
-My beauty?
-Everything.

439
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,101
Father is very angry.

440
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:48,563
You can't change your clothes,
but remove your makeup at least.

441
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,357
Where are you going?

442
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,110
Can't you come with me?

443
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:03,369
I get why it was famous
as a haunted house.

444
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:06,247
Yes. So we definitely need to demolish it,

445
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,623
but it won't be easy.

446
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,169
Why is it so?

447
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:16,465
The Mount Onju Trail is very famous,
so I thought it was owned by Onju.

448
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,177
But that area was a private property.

449
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,929
Then go to the owner
and ask them to demolish it.

450
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,015
They should clean up their mess.

451
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:28,227
The contact number isn't found
on the land register,

452
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:29,979
so I don't know what to do.

453
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,315
I'll ask you a question.

454
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,816
Think about it carefully.

455
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:40,072
Someone framed me with a malicious intent
and reported me to the Audit Team.

456
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:43,409
I know nothing about the accuser
except her name, Lee Hong-jo.

457
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,453
So what did I do?

458
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,080
You asked around?

459
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,290
Correct answer!

460
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:53,336
Until you find a correct answer,
don't come back.

461
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,963
Don't come to the office
until you solve the issue.

462
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:56,923
Is that clear?

463
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:58,591
Yes.

464
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,304
So the owner of the land is a shaman,

465
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,723
and the shaman's name
is Jang Sin-yu, right?

466
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:06,849
No.

467
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,852
The shaman's name is Eun-wol.

468
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:10,853
She's pretty.

469
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,688
The landlord is someone else.

470
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,400
It's a noble family for generations
and owns a lot of land.

471
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,487
That family is the richest.

472
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:25,618
So where can I go
to meet that family member?

473
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:26,786
Well…

474
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,040
I hear he's the chairman
of some construction company.

475
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,251
No.

476
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,920
That land doesn't belong to the chairman.

477
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:39,799
He handed it over to his son
a few years ago.

478
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:43,344
That son who is a successful lawyer.

479
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:47,014
SON OF A CONSTRUCTION COMPANY CEO,
SUCCESSFUL LAWYER

480
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,892
So he's from a noble family
with a lot of land,

481
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,770
a son of a chairman,
and a successful lawyer?

482
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,230
That Jang Sin-yu guy?

483
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:58,985
I hate him already.

484
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,778
I have bad news.

485
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,989
The left side
of your brain seems abnormal.

486
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,907
Near your basal ganglia.

487
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:08,452
The damaged blood vessel wall
caused a vascular disease.

488
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,747
That caused the headache
and the trembling in your right hand.

489
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,625
Wasn't it fine six months ago?

490
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,378
Well, it's a genetic disorder

491
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,630
and a chromosome mutation,

492
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,799
so it's hard to predict.

493
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,384
Still, try to predict

494
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,095
what will happen in the future.

495
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,639
Right hemiplegia,

496
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,891
loss of sense in your hands and feet,

497
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,770
and language impairment might happen.

498
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,356
How can I treat it?

499
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,486
You can't treat a genetic disorder.

500
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:46,949
But you need to continue
with the preventive treatment

501
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,200
for ischemic stroke.

502
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,870
Reduce stress as much as you can.

503
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:54,957
You have a time bomb in your head
that could explode any time.

504
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,381
Twenty-ninth floor.

505
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,303
Doors opening.

506
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,330
You should've taken me that time.

507
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,123
Why do you keep following me?

508
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,085
I was in this elevator first.

509
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,170
You got in after me.

510
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,297
I wasn't following you.

511
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:47,009
You could've expected me
to get in this elevator.

512
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,554
Not yet.

513
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,806
I don't want to go.

514
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,309
Move aside.

515
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,271
Why?

516
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,356
Doors opening.

517
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:04,193
I'm getting out.

518
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,279
Are you a human?

519
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,037
What's this?

520
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,622
He came here too?

521
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,500
Did you make an appointment?

522
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,419
I'm from Onju City Hall.

523
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:24,422
I'm here to see Jang Sin-yu for work.

524
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,675
The person that came in with you
is Lawyer Jang Sin-yu.

525
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,427
What?

526
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,311
Make an appointment first.

527
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:41,647
I'm not here for that.

528
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,066
I'm from Onju City Hall
regarding the house.

529
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,777
Haven't we met before?

530
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,904
In that haunted house on the rainy day.

531
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:49,864
Right?

532
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:51,365
Probably.

533
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,160
You scared me so much.

534
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,370
I even fainted. How could you just leave?

535
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,205
You should've called 911 at least.

536
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,834
I don't need to be kind to someone
who trespassed on my property.

537
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,419
It wasn't trespassing.

538
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,796
I went there to check
because of a complaint.

539
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,340
Anyway, you should've called 911.

540
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,842
What if I'd have died there?

541
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:12,178
Then the shrine
would've witnessed two deaths.

542
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,433
Demolish the haunted house
and restore Mount Onju.

543
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:18,642
No.

544
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:21,312
-Why?
-I don't want to demolish it.

545
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,523
Someone died in the haunted house.

546
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,900
I never told him to go there.

547
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:31,113
If you refuse to restore it,
we'll send you an execution notice.

548
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:35,075
You should send it
to the constructor, not me.

549
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:39,830
You can't demolish a building
without the constructor's agreement.

550
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:40,998
You can be charged

551
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,334
for property damage
or asked for compensation.

552
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:46,003
Then get the constructor's agreement.

553
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,296
Why should I bother?

554
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:51,300
If you do this,
the city might demolish it by force.

555
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:54,178
If you do that, I could sue you.

556
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,514
Hiking on someone else's property

557
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:59,892
and setting up the stairs,
street lamps, and workout equipment

558
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:00,851
is illegal.

559
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,855
I didn't do that,
and they've been there for over ten years.

560
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,233
Designating someone else's land as a park

561
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:10,277
without the owner's consent
and preventing the owner

562
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,530
from exercising property rights

563
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:15,533
is serious invasion of private property.

564
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,161
Now leave quietly.

565
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,288
And don't do anything.

566
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,123
If I sue you, you'll lose.

567
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:24,542
Correct answer!

568
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:28,087
Until you find a correct answer,
don't come back.

569
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,674
Why aren't you leaving?

570
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:34,802
Do you want to go to a teahouse
with a Grim Reaper?

571
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:42,017
I'd like to go to a teahouse with you.

572
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:45,104
Teahouse…

573
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,286
I thought I said it in my head.

574
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,538
Did I say it out loud?

575
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:06,709
You're crazy, Lee Hong-jo.

576
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:13,173
We're against incineration facility!

577
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,218
-We're against incineration facility!
-Incineration facility!

578
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,470
We're against incineration facility!

579
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:19,555
Yoon Hak-yeong!

580
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,070
Yoon Hak-yeong!

581
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:38,115
Yoon Hak-yeong must resign!

582
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:42,369
-Yoon Hak-yeong must resign!
-Resign!

583
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,330
Yoon Hak-yeong must resign!

584
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,958
-Yoon Hak-yeong!
-No.

585
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,084
Kwon Jae-gyeong.

586
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,211
Take this.

587
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,134
My gosh!

588
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,054
I'll call you back.

589
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,352
I was just passing by.

590
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:08,937
Go up. And continue with your protest.

591
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,648
-Sure.
-I'll get going.

592
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:23,243
Half of half of half.

593
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,746
Who said DS stocks would go up?

594
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,956
-Excuse me.
-Can't you feel it?

595
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,167
If I were you, I wouldn't talk to me.

596
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,711
I'll keep it short.

597
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:35,381
It will take longer
to demolish the shrine.

598
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,299
The owner of the land is stubborn.

599
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,719
So are those who complained.

600
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,681
They said they would sue City Hall.

601
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,850
Then who do you think will be the accused?

602
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:49,436
The mayor?

603
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,771
Correct!

604
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,650
You know that the mayor will be accused.

605
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:58,487
Those who started this job along with me
became managers, but I didn't. Why?

606
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,406
Because of Ms. Lee Hong-jo.

607
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:03,492
I can see myself
not getting promoted next year too.

608
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:05,411
Why? Because of Ms. Lee Hong-jo.

609
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:08,539
-I'm sorry.
-Don't do anything to apologize for.

610
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:12,376
What did I make you do?

611
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,421
Did I tell you to remove weeds
or make a flower bridge?

612
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:17,506
I even excluded you from choosing lunch.

613
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:21,885
I was so considerate
to give you one job, the demolition.

614
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,262
Why can't you do it?

615
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:25,681
Where is the swiftness
you used to report me?

616
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,354
Go get it demolished
before the mayor gets accused.

617
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:34,648
Aren't you going?

618
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,400
Go!

619
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:43,157
Can I sue my boyfriend
who goes MIA for a week?

620
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,701
For insulting me

621
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,161
or neglecting me?

622
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,787
I had a funeral.

623
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,539
All the more reason to call me.

624
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:53,959
Your parents will think badly of me.

625
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,253
They wouldn't have
had enough time for that.

626
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:57,921
They were busy with some stuff.

627
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,967
You feel very distant.

628
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:05,053
You don't tell me important things.

629
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:07,264
Tell me about the stuff in detail.

630
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,935
Right hemiplegia,

631
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,271
loss of sense in your hands and feet,

632
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:17,357
and language impairment might happen.

633
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,443
You can't treat a genetic disorder.

634
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:25,115
I'm studying the kinship terminology.

635
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,576
Guess what you call
the father of your in-law.

636
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,286
"Co-parent-in-law."

637
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,041
The one who passed away was
my second cousin once removed.

638
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:34,958
Guess the degree.

639
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:36,919
Nine degrees?

640
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,547
See why I didn't call?

641
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,965
You should study more.

642
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,551
Your family's interesting.

643
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,512
I really liked my aunt.

644
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:49,264
But I can't meet her
since my parents divorced.

645
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:50,974
Let's go to Sokcho.

646
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,435
There's a hotel in front of the sea.

647
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,145
I heard the view was amazing.

648
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,191
I need to prepare a trial.

649
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:02,736
Fine.

650
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:04,404
Trial? Fine, get married to your job.

651
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,823
Have the judge catch the bouquet.

652
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,951
I'll decorate your house for free.

653
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:12,579
A super-gloomy court style
using North American walnut wood.

654
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,040
Please hang
the national flag by the bed too.

655
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:17,751
DEATH OF A NEWTUBER: CITY HALL COPS OUT

656
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,717
-Give me that.
-Ma'am.

657
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,095
Where should I go to meet the shaman

658
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,180
that lives in the shrine?

659
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:33,684
Was it two years ago?

660
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,644
She went to a nursing hospital.

661
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,479
But I don't know where.

662
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,982
Right. Go ask the Jang family.

663
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:42,484
Since they treasured the shrine,

664
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,570
they must know.

665
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,406
I don't want to ask.

666
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:48,699
Why?

667
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:51,785
Because that Jang Sin-yu guy
won't tell me even if I ask.

668
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:28,739
You finished late.

669
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,075
So did you.

670
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:38,999
Are you okay?

671
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,501
Yes. Well…

672
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:44,046
I turn red all the time.

673
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:45,255
I have rosacea.

674
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,841
It's not climacteric.

675
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:52,721
Why did you do that earlier?

676
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,348
What if it was acid?

677
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:57,392
Gosh, could it have been acid?

678
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:58,852
I didn't think about that.

679
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:02,439
Then could it be that
my face is burning, not flushing?

680
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,984
Don't joke about it.
I was worried all day.

681
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,656
They're not someone to throw acid.

682
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:14,993
When I worked in Onju Dong-gu Office,
they protested and threw stuff.

683
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:17,829
Once, they threw yellow liquid,
so I thought it was pee.

684
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,748
But it was an energy drink.

685
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,083
Was it soda today?

686
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:22,959
It was quite sweet.

687
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:27,506
Don't do it again.

688
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,716
As for the demolition,

689
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,177
you don't have to do it.
So don't push yourself.

690
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,178
Okay.

691
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,514
Doors opening.

692
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:38,975
Wait.

693
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:43,397
GREEN BREATH ONJU

694
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,107
By the way,

695
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:50,320
how did you know
that I was in charge of the demolition?

696
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:58,495
It's written all over your face.

697
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,501
It was supposed to be a joke.

698
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,753
I'm terrible at it. Have a safe trip back.

699
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,646
How cute.

700
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:08,565
Hello.

701
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:16,990
Good morning.

702
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:20,076
If you want a good morning, get out.

703
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,580
-How rude.
-You're the rude one.

704
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:26,333
I have a good personality and am humorous.

705
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,418
So people say I'm cute like a puppy.

706
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:31,671
But you only come
on the days when I get sensitive.

707
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:34,174
So you're the unlucky one.

708
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:42,891
Is it the shrine that makes you,
who has a good personality, are humorous,

709
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:44,810
and are as cute as a puppy,

710
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:46,186
become sensitive?

711
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,981
I clearly told you
that I wouldn't demolish it.

712
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,905
I'll take care of the demolition issue.

713
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,115
I'll take care of it.

714
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,409
By restoring, not demolishing.

715
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:03,078
Restoring it is no use.

716
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:05,622
The shaman went to a nursing hospital.

717
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:07,415
Did you dig up information on me?

718
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,168
I performed my duty.

719
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:14,089
Which nursing hospital is she at?

720
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:17,801
It's no use going to her.

721
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,720
I'll still go and meet her.

722
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,306
If she refuses,
I won't bother you again. Okay?

723
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,224
I promise.

724
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:27,060
Why are you risking your life
for this demolition?

725
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:29,896
I'm not risking my life.

726
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,816
I'm only risking my job
as a civil servant.

727
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,359
Exactly.

728
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:35,944
Why are you risking your job?

729
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:39,406
You won't get fired
even if you don't demolish it.

730
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:41,783
Go now.

731
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,369
Because I'm lonely.

732
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:53,628
I feel like, if I sort this out,
my team leader will say,

733
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,422
"Let's eat together."

734
00:52:57,132 --> 00:53:00,385
Ever since I was transferred to City Hall,
I've been eating alone.

735
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,304
I eat alone at home,

736
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,932
so I don't want
to eat alone at work as well.

737
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,143
They'll know I'm an outcast.

738
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:18,236
Can you please tell me?

739
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:34,294
Are you telling me?

740
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,097
Is this the nursing hospital?

741
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:47,849
Ministry of Labor.

742
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,935
Workplace bullying consultation center.

743
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:58,526
Ministry of Labor.

744
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,237
Workplace bullying consultation center.

745
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,281
Call them for a consultation first.

746
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:06,493
The hospital name is written behind it.
Do whatever you want.

747
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,120
NURI NURSING HOSPITAL

748
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,374
Remember that you promised

749
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:16,586
not to bother me again if you didn't get
the permission to demolish it.

750
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:38,400
Excuse me. Can I ask you something?

751
00:54:56,751 --> 00:55:00,046
CULTURAL HERITAGE RESTORATION SPECIALIST

752
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,103
Lawyer Jang of Law & High--

753
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,021
It's Hong-jo.

754
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:18,189
Ms. Eun-wol allowed the demolition.

755
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:20,984
What?

756
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:22,819
No way.

757
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,530
I knew you'd say that, so I recorded it.

758
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:27,115
I'll send it to you now.

759
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:33,538
I'll start recording now.

760
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,624
Shaman Eun-wol.

761
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:41,129
Real name, Myeong-eun.

762
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:45,717
I agree to demolish
the shrine at Mount Onju.

763
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:47,677
Thank--

764
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,759
Do you recognize me?

765
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,596
Honey.

766
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:36,893
How dare she do that
to someone with dementia?

767
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:39,729
I don't have dementia. I was joking.

768
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:46,027
I used to be a beautiful young lady.

769
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:49,739
Handsome guys like you lined up behind me.

770
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,950
The god I served didn't let me.

771
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,245
I'm so upset.

772
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:58,665
By the way, Sin-yu, you punk.

773
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:01,167
I even named you.
How could you not visit me?

774
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,962
You didn't let me go near the shrine.

775
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:05,338
This isn't the shrine.

776
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,717
Were you threatened by that civil servant?

777
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:11,344
You told me not to touch it.

778
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:13,179
Why did you allow it?

779
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:16,516
She is… a total stranger at that.

780
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,282
You killed her.

781
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:39,122
The owner of the bloody hand
that caresses your cheek.

782
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:43,334
Karma will swallow you

783
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:47,213
and you will struggle in horrible pain.

784
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:56,055
But all the pain and curses

785
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,100
will end.

786
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:00,935
Finally,

787
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:05,148
the owner of the wooden box showed up.

788
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,869
The sun's so bright.

789
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:31,085
What a unique guy

790
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:35,048
from a unique family.

791
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:58,196
Did all my teammates get off work?

792
01:00:58,279 --> 01:00:59,822
They went to have dinner

793
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:01,783
to celebrate the demolition.

794
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:02,700
Call them now.

795
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:04,869
Okay.

796
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:07,955
You worked really hard back then.

797
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,499
I did, didn't I?

798
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:10,917
Su-jeong, good job.

799
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:11,876
MS. LEE HONG-JO

800
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,296
Be quiet.

801
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:23,304
-Hello?
-Ms. Son. Where are you?

802
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:26,015
I'm on my way back home. Why?

803
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:29,060
I heard you went to have dinner together.

804
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:31,312
Mr. Gong's unhappy because of his stocks.

805
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:32,730
How can we have dinner?

806
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:34,273
Give me two bottles of soju.

807
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:37,110
Not two. One.

808
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:39,654
Are you guys there together?

809
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:43,116
No. I said I was going home.

810
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,369
I told you to be quiet.

811
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:47,704
You startled me.

812
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:51,851
But all the pain and curses

813
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:55,021
will end.

814
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:56,939
Finally,

815
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,568
the owner of the wooden box showed up.

816
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:05,406
What do you mean? What's the wooden box?

817
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,408
What about its owner?

818
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:14,624
For the wooden box,

819
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,168
you'll find out soon.

820
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:19,670
And you already know the owner.

821
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,176
Who's the owner of the wooden box?

822
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:26,803
The woman you're thinking of

823
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:29,680
right now.

824
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:48,616
I HAVE FINISHED MY DEMOLITION REPORT.
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT!

825
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:52,787
I'm hungry.

826
01:03:54,956 --> 01:03:57,291
I'll stop by a convenience store first.

827
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:02,338
Let's go for the third round.

828
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:04,799
Let's go to karaoke.

829
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:06,217
Let's go to the car park.

830
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:08,219
A driver will come in five minutes.

831
01:04:08,302 --> 01:04:10,429
Who told you to call a driver?

832
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,306
You told me to call one.

833
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:17,603
Mr. Gong. Did you just burp?

834
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,480
-Yes.
-Did you eat what came up?

835
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:20,398
No.

836
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:22,900
It's garlic.

837
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:26,571
If you burped that much,
shouldn't you eat again?

838
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:28,322
Karaoke is the party's highlight.

839
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:31,534
You'll cry again if you go to karaoke.

840
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:36,497
Just one song.

841
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,187
Are you crying?

842
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:15,119
Do you want me to stay or leave?

843
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:20,082
I want you to leave.

844
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:23,920
I want you

845
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,131
to come with me.

846
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,474
DESTINED WITH YOU

847
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:21,185
I'm giving back what was yours to you.

848
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:23,854
What's inside?

849
01:06:24,897 --> 01:06:26,774
The lock is strange.

850
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:28,275
It has no hole.

851
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:29,902
People won't open up to me.

852
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:32,363
Even the lock won't open up to me.

853
01:06:32,446 --> 01:06:33,864
Then give it back.

854
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:36,325
I don't think
you're the owner of the wooden box.

855
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:40,037
You're wrong.
I think I'm the owner of the wooden box.

856
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,831
"All the pain and curses will end."

857
01:06:41,914 --> 01:06:42,832
SPELLS OF THE HEAVENS

858
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:44,834
The owner of the wooden box showed up.

859
