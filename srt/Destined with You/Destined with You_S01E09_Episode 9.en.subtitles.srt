1
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,966
DESTINED WITH YOU

2
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,220
EPISODE 9

3
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,181
Gosh.

4
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,349
It looks pretty.

5
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,893
Thank you for your hard work.

6
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,645
The signboard will be done
tomorrow afternoon.

7
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,022
I'll call you when it's up.

8
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,106
Okay.

9
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,192
I'll take pictures for my report.

10
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,785
It's cool.

11
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,420
Why are the lights off?

12
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,631
This shouldn't happen
during the festival, sir.

13
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:35,261
Sir?

14
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,436
Goodness.

15
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,024
UNKNOWN

16
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:54,656
Hello?

17
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,409
Hello--

18
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,167
What's happening?

19
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,926
UNKNOWN

20
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:01,991
Are you okay?

21
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:23,721
Hey.

22
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,724
-What?
-I'll move your washing machine. Let's go.

23
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:27,809
To my place?

24
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:28,768
Yes.

25
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,937
Won't that be a bit weird?

26
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,648
Why? I'm just a friend to you.

27
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,067
Well, that's true.

28
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,945
Can you open the door?

29
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,136
I moved the washing machine,

30
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,512
moved the bed,

31
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,015
and changed the lights. Done, right?

32
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,267
-All good?
-Yes, it's all good.

33
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,311
Here, raspberry wine.

34
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,980
I have no use for it, but…

35
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,524
Do you want some ramyeon?

36
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,947
Gosh, you startled me.

37
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,450
I don't have any other food,

38
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,744
so I thought
I'd make you ramyeon at least.

39
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,997
I have a blind date.

40
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,206
At this hour?

41
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,791
The Tax Department is busy.

42
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,419
Seung-yeon asked to meet
at night after her work.

43
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,545
What should I do?

44
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,088
Take it off now. I'll wash it.

45
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,214
Okay.

46
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,966
-Quickly.
-Okay.

47
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,093
-We must wash it fast.
-Let me…

48
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,035
I don't look suitable
for a blind date, do I?

49
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,246
The shirt's too dirty.

50
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,123
Right.

51
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,418
So why did you spill it?

52
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,176
Hey.

53
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:30,598
Can I hug you?

54
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,102
What are you saying?

55
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,566
What kind of man asks that beforehand?

56
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,613
That's why you've been alone forever.

57
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,573
Don't ever ask that to Seung-yeon.

58
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,283
It's so lame.

59
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,363
How could you two keep this a secret?

60
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,657
My son is sick.

61
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,368
But I was unaware of it.
Does this make sense?

62
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,203
You could wake him up.

63
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,164
Keep your voice down.

64
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,499
Mother, go home and get some rest.

65
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,751
I'm not going anywhere.

66
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,378
You go home if you want to.

67
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,338
I'll stay here.

68
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,466
Why would you lash out at her?

69
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:50,761
You should be thankful
that she found Sin-yu in the parking lot.

70
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,181
You go too. I don't want to see you.

71
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,057
You kept this from me.

72
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,435
How could you not tell me
that Sin-yu was sick?

73
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,687
He told me not to.

74
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,981
He didn't want to worry you.

75
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,192
He didn't tell me either.

76
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:07,820
My poor boy.

77
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,035
It must've been so hard
dealing with this all alone.

78
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,152
Hong-jo.

79
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,408
Hong-jo.

80
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,087
LEE HONG-JO, GREENWAY BUILDING DIVISION

81
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,108
Hong-jo.

82
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,609
Are you inside?

83
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:31,862
Hong-jo.

84
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,874
I was worried.
Your phone rang, but you didn't pick up.

85
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,795
I was lying down.

86
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,636
What's wrong? Are you sick?

87
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:58,889
Can…

88
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:02,476
Can I ask you a favor?

89
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,028
I ran out of painkillers,

90
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,614
but I didn't have the energy
to go buy some.

91
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,575
Will you be fine with that?

92
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,327
Yes.

93
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,581
I just feel chilly and a bit feverish.

94
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,499
Right.

95
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,171
I brought some sleeping pills
just in case.

96
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,174
You need to sleep soundly.

97
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,470
Thank you.

98
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,060
Jae-gyeong's on my list of suspects too.

99
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,437
It's easy for him to steal your pajamas.

100
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,610
I have a question.

101
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,657
Why were you in the park just now?

102
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,369
To check on the festival.

103
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,705
You checked it yourself?

104
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,335
I actually do quite a lot
of miscellaneous things.

105
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:19,678
Sin-yu asked

106
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,767
if I'd agree to set up a CCTV.

107
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,269
Did you agree to it as well?

108
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:32,024
No. He didn't tell me about that.

109
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,568
I didn't agree with the CCTV.

110
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:38,697
I don't understand why he's asking
such a favor worrying about you.

111
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,033
I wanted to talk about it,

112
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,036
but he's on sick leave,
so I couldn't meet him.

113
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,497
Do you know why

114
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,624
he's on sick leave?

115
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:49,708
No.

116
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,502
You should go sleep now.

117
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,338
I won't go down until you're asleep.

118
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,427
Go down first.

119
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,349
I'll think about setting up a CCTV myself.

120
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,476
And if anything happens,

121
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,019
tell me first.

122
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,522
I will.

123
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,567
Finish up the medicine
if you're still unwell tomorrow.

124
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:19,071
I brought a hot-water bottle.
I'll heat this up and leave.

125
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,248
JANG SIN-YU

126
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,751
Due to the illness's nature,

127
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,253
he might develop cerebral infarction.

128
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,383
But the affected area isn't large
this time, so he'll recover soon.

129
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,177
It's just a temporary TIA.

130
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,553
He was very lucky.

131
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,888
Why can't he wake up?

132
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,431
He's been sleeping for two days.

133
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:18,268
It might be due to
accumulated fatigue or stress.

134
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:21,689
Will Sin-yu be fine?

135
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,566
I told you not to say something ominous.

136
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,420
Is something wrong with you?

137
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,387
Hong-jo?

138
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:54,805
Come here.

139
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,224
Okay.

140
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,606
"Festival." I edited them all.

141
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,025
-Thank you.
-Welcome.

142
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:16,952
MR. KWON JAE-GYEONG

143
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,203
How are you feeling?

144
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,668
Hello, Gyu-hyeon.

145
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,714
Yes.

146
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,424
No. Yes.

147
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,181
Sin-yu. You're awake.

148
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,558
Are you okay?

149
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,357
Why won't you speak?

150
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,316
Look at me.

151
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,486
You recognize me, right?

152
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,197
Stop making a fuss.

153
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,658
Sin-yu.

154
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,077
How are you feeling?

155
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,161
Can you sit upright?

156
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,335
That was such a long sleep.

157
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,796
I was worried sick.

158
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:54,133
Look at my face.
I've aged so much in a few days.

159
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,470
It's not time for you
to be worrying about your face.

160
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,472
His face has become half its size.

161
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,268
His face was always small.

162
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,729
He takes after me and has a small head.

163
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,483
Having a small head
isn't something to brag about.

164
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,653
Back in the day,
a small head meant a small brain.

165
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,114
What you said

166
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,740
is insulating.

167
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,200
You mean "insulting."

168
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,913
GROOT

169
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,358
Are you in hospital?

170
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,611
Why won't you read my texts?

171
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,406
Reply when you read this.

172
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,588
GROOT

173
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,382
ARE YOU IN HOSPITAL?
WHY WON'T YOU READ MY TEXTS?

174
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,769
REPLY WHEN YOU READ THIS.

175
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,737
ARE YOU IN HOSPITAL?
WHY WON'T YOU READ MY TEXTS?

176
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,781
REPLY WHEN YOU READ THIS.

177
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,955
I guess you were worried.

178
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,416
Of course I was. You thought I wasn't?

179
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,169
I'm upset with you.

180
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,381
The first thing you look for
isn't your mom, dad,

181
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,384
me, nor Na-yeon.

182
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:01,927
It's your phone.

183
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,390
Aren't you busy?

184
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,558
That's not important.

185
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,523
When you're discharged, let's go skiing.

186
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,817
I want to see snow with you.

187
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:18,944
You can go now.

188
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,446
What do you mean?
I meant we should go together.

189
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,115
I meant you should leave.

190
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,686
It's cold. You should've dressed warmly.

191
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,481
You texted me a lot.

192
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:01,486
You told me to contact you
via the in-house email or messenger only.

193
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,948
There's an exception to everything.

194
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,335
You told me not to get closer.

195
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,596
What happened?

196
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,349
I don't remember.

197
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,021
Did your illness become worse?

198
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,148
What illness do you have?

199
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,488
I got sick from the AC.

200
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,159
It's so cold.

201
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,581
Stop fooling around, will you?

202
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,209
Do you know how worried I was?

203
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,003
And yet, you came empty-handed.

204
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:03,882
I'll buy you something before I leave.

205
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,510
I got to see you, so it's fine.

206
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:17,437
Actually, I didn't come here
to check on you.

207
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:22,025
I came here to get the wooden box.

208
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,070
Why?

209
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,117
I'm concerned about the curse doll.

210
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,499
I know what you're thinking.

211
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,669
But I've had this illness before that.

212
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,006
Wasn't it getting better
before it suddenly got worse?

213
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,051
-I want to check something.
-Don't.

214
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,262
Can't you just give it to me when I ask?

215
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:53,473
You said it was mine
and that I had to deal with it anyway.

216
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,769
Did anything happen?

217
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,440
Nothing happened.

218
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,654
When are you getting discharged?

219
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,657
I don't want to.

220
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,702
So you would keep worrying about me.

221
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,830
You're perfectly fine,

222
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,874
seeing how you're speaking nonsense.

223
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,754
Did you change the passcode to your place?

224
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,340
I didn't.

225
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:32,888
I know it's rude to go
to your house when you're not there,

226
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,222
but please excuse me.

227
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,143
I'll go with you.

228
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,398
You can't. You're sick.

229
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:44,649
Go back in now.

230
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,276
I don't want to.

231
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:50,989
Do you want to catch a cold
as well? Go in quickly.

232
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,420
I have things left to say.

233
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,523
I think you can stop taking pictures now.

234
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,962
I'm so glad that you woke up.

235
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,096
Hong-jo cleared up my misunderstanding.

236
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,808
I was still going to wait
until you contacted me first.

237
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,394
Isn't it good that I'm impatient?

238
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,230
It would've been bad
if I hadn't found you.

239
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,315
You should thank me.

240
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:12,112
Right. Did you hear
about our travel plans afterward?

241
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,323
Yes, I did.

242
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,244
I hope you get discharged quickly.

243
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,541
I bought some porridge. Let's eat.

244
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,586
I didn't eat dinner
because I wanted to eat with you.

245
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:44,519
SPELLS OF THE HEAVENS

246
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:59,367
"If someone is cursed by this spell
with strong and malicious energy,

247
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,537
their soul and body will be destroyed."

248
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,124
COMMANDMENTS

249
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:10,003
"If you cast the spell
with hatred and resentment

250
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:16,134
that cannot be spoken out,
a disaster would assuredly be unleashed."

251
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,604
LOVE DESTRUCTION SPELL

252
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,981
"Make a straw doll

253
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:33,068
and dress it with the clothes
of someone you love."

254
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:39,240
"Put a black cloth on its head and write
the name of the person you want to curse."

255
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,534
"Pierce it with needles

256
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,371
as many as the person's age."

257
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,796
Do you think Sin-yu's sick

258
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,090
because of this curse?

259
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,676
You believe in spells.

260
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,432
Ghosts exist for those who can see them.

261
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,476
They don't exist for those who can't.

262
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,065
I should try it again.

263
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,890
What are you doing?
It's so dark and spooky in here.

264
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,725
Did you bring it?

265
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,395
What do you need this for?

266
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,397
You don't need to know.

267
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,789
What a pervert.

268
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,833
I didn't tell you to do that.
Give it back.

269
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,421
Do you think I did

270
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:02,300
all the things until now
because you told me to?

271
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,641
If it wasn't because I told you to,
why did you do those things?

272
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,603
It was my plan.

273
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,774
Oh, my.

274
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,651
I wonder what plan that is.

275
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,364
Just shut up and cooperate.

276
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:26,991
You're insane.

277
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,660
Why would I cooperate with you?

278
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:29,577
It's fun.

279
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,705
Compared to drama or romance,

280
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,082
a thriller's more exciting.

281
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:40,672
So what do you want me to do?

282
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:45,552
BUYONGJAE FESTIVAL

283
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,228
Checked.

284
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,618
I have things left to say.

285
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,955
I can't go to work this week.

286
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,875
I need to go on a trip
after I get discharged.

287
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,838
Have a safe trip.

288
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,885
Don't you want to know with whom?

289
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,140
Why are you asking me that?

290
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,478
If you tell me not to go,

291
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,064
I won't go.

292
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,271
Rest well in Jeju Island.

293
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:23,399
When we come back,
pack up and move back into our house.

294
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,652
Resting for a few days isn't enough.

295
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,738
Maybe Sin-yu and I should stay there
for a month.

296
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:31,282
Why would Sin-yu live with you?

297
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,409
He should live with Na-yeon if anything.

298
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,620
Moving in together before getting married?

299
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,205
I'm too worried

300
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,958
about him staying alone.

301
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,876
Since we're at it, let's decide now.

302
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,380
Move into our house or live with Na-yeon.

303
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,674
Na-yeon doesn't know how to do anything.

304
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:51,219
If he lives with me, I can cook for him.
Don't you think so?

305
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,890
Do you believe in past lives?

306
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,103
He's not fully recovered.

307
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,522
Call Dr. Kim right now.
We need another checkup.

308
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:04,148
No. There's no need.

309
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,486
Why suddenly bring up past lives?

310
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:20,581
To the interested parties
and citizens of Onju

311
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,418
who graced us with your presence
despite the cold,

312
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,628
I sincerely express my gratitude.

313
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,760
Onju's fireworks festival

314
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:36,431
started in mid-Joseon dynasty
right here in Buyongjae

315
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,433
and has been passed down until now.

316
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,602
It's a traditional event
with a long history.

317
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,105
It has beauty incomparable

318
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,315
to modern fireworks.

319
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,570
With the fireworks
to light up the cold winter night,

320
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,947
I hope you wrap up this year well.

321
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:53,990
Now,

322
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:58,202
let the 30th Buyongjae Fireworks Festival

323
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,245
commence.

324
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,343
Get ready.

325
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,944
Sir, start lighting them up.

326
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,946
Okay, I'll ignite them.

327
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:31,439
GROOT

328
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,644
Look at that.

329
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,728
How pretty.

330
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,174
You didn't go on the trip.

331
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,180
Didn't you call to stop me from going?

332
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,519
That's right.

333
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,105
I called to stop you from going.

334
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,738
But I didn't expect you
to come all the way here.

335
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,992
Spells do work after all.

336
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,871
I tried it again.

337
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,290
I wanted to check if it worked or not.

338
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:46,902
It doesn't matter…

339
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,993
whether spells work or not.

340
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,374
I love you.

341
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,252
Let's run away.

342
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:50,299
It doesn't matter where.

343
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:55,888
Anywhere's fine.

344
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,015
Be careful.

345
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,684
I am being careful.

346
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,436
-Why is this so heavy?
-I know, right?

347
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,689
Goodness.

348
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,819
What was that?

349
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:53,904
Let's go quickly.

350
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:54,822
Quickly.

351
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:55,739
Hurry up.

352
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,700
Let's go quickly.

353
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:06,518
-Let me go.
-Don't do this.

354
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:07,811
I told you to let me go.

355
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,314
If you don't, I'll make them beat you up.

356
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:14,652
What is happening?

357
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:16,987
Please let me in.

358
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,864
I need to meet my mother.

359
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:20,324
Allow me to meet her.

360
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:23,327
I said you cannot go into her room.

361
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,953
I heard her illness got worse.

362
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,748
What if she passes away?

363
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:28,707
Your mother…

364
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,087
does not wish to see you.

365
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:35,964
That…

366
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,216
That cannot be true.

367
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:42,805
Sir.

368
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,306
My deepest condolences.

369
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,976
She has passed away.

370
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:50,771
Poor madam.

371
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,608
Poor madam!

372
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:16,982
How dare you smile?

373
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,359
Yes.

374
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:21,278
Don't cry.

375
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:23,113
Rather, get angry like now.

376
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,289
You don't study hard.

377
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:34,541
So you haven't seen
what your mother wrote.

378
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,838
She put a letter in your book.

379
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,174
Go and read it now.

380
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:28,720
CHILDREN'S FIRST TEXTBOOK

381
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,943
I dreamed about you even at dawn.

382
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,530
The fact that I could see you
in my dreams at least,

383
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,783
made me foolishly happy.

384
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,912
My precious son.

385
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:58,000
I miss you so much that it hurts.

386
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:02,129
But I was worried
about you catching my illness,

387
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:06,049
so I couldn't see you.

388
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,843
So,

389
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,097
please understand

390
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,683
why I'm doing this.

391
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,729
It was a short life,

392
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,274
but every day was joyful because of you.

393
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:25,193
My life

394
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,238
couldn't have been

395
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,241
happier.

396
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:56,808
You're the crybaby.

397
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,523
Did you read your mother's letter?

398
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,032
How dare a low being
like you talk to me informally?

399
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,284
You must not know who I am.

400
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:17,120
I'm the son of this town's governor.

401
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,415
I see.

402
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:21,708
Goodbye.

403
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,507
-But, sir.
-What?

404
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:30,842
Aren't you taking your books?

405
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,512
CHILDREN'S FIRST TEXTBOOK

406
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:39,393
That's a nice bow.

407
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,354
How dare you?

408
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:45,941
I know you waited for me
to thank me about your mother's letter.

409
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,611
I am grateful for that.

410
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,613
But I would've read it anyway.

411
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:53,615
I just had to open my book.

412
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,200
But you wouldn't have.

413
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:57,828
-What?
-I can tell.

414
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,579
You don't look like you study.

415
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:05,001
Hey, stop right there.

416
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:06,837
I placed first in school.

417
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,588
And what's that about my looks?

418
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,374
Here. Take this.

419
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,209
Wow.

420
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,096
It's a worm.

421
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,264
Don't touch it.

422
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:04,853
Don't. What are you doing?

423
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:09,524
Throw it away now.

424
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:12,611
-It's good for your health. Try it.
-No.

425
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:17,991
-Here.
-Stop.

426
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,037
-Boo!
-I told you to stop.

427
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:32,881
My father told me
to prepare for the state exam.

428
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:34,758
I'm very conflicted.

429
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:37,219
I'm talented both in studies
and martial arts.

430
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:39,054
So it's hard to decide what to do.

431
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,388
You have no talent in studies.

432
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:43,350
You always fail your tests in school.

433
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,272
Can you see my future?

434
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:52,776
What happens if I choose
to join the military?

435
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,737
Will I become a general?

436
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:03,787
What is it?

437
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,622
Will I be stuck as a foot soldier?

438
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,918
No. You'll work your way up.

439
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,683
Can you really ride it alone?

440
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:25,600
Yes.

441
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,485
Aren't you afraid?

442
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:38,572
I'm not.

443
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:41,783
Let's go.

444
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:31,578
Did you do your coming-of-age ceremony?

445
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:38,001
You have no idea
how much I've waited to be an adult.

446
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:40,128
How do I look?

447
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,299
I tied my hair in a top knot
and wore a gat for the first time.

448
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,428
I'm surprised.

449
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:50,722
You look so great.

450
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:54,517
That's a relief.

451
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,896
I wanted you to think that today.

452
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,691
Today is a very special day for us.

453
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:09,199
It might be for you
who did the coming-of-age ceremony.

454
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:13,620
But to me,
it's just a normal day like any other day.

455
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:16,498
You foresee others' futures so well,

456
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:20,502
but you have no idea
what will happen to you.

457
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:25,298
You don't know

458
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:27,467
what will happen to me either.

459
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:31,513
I know.

460
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:33,473
Because I'll do it.

461
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:40,939
For example…

462
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:44,442
Something like this.

463
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:13,721
Your face is as red as an apple.

464
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,227
It's because of the sunset.

465
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:20,436
You're lying.

466
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:19,973
DESTINED WITH YOU

467
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:23,476
There's one more person
who remembers the past life.

468
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,937
I've loved her since long ago.

469
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:27,313
Wait for me.

470
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,607
You're just confused.

471
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,985
We can't break up that easily.

472
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,152
Snap out of it.

473
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,113
Don't get shaken up by Sin-yu.

474
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:36,739
Come to me.

475
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,284
The view, the feel.

476
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:41,077
Everything felt real.

477
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,496
But why am I the only one who sees

478
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,957
and remembers it?

479
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:52,338
