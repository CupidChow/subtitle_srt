1
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,966
DESTINED WITH YOU

2
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,846
-I'm not done with it.
-What?

3
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,139
Apparently,

4
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:57,474
I love her.

5
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,142
I love Hong-jo.

6
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,898
What did you just say?

7
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,775
You heard everything. Why ask again?

8
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,027
You have a fiancée.

9
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,946
I wonder what makes you
say that with so much confidence.

10
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,074
I'm confident in a lot of ways.

11
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:14,991
Stop.

12
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,911
Are you okay with me
telling the mayor about this?

13
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:22,999
Let's not drag a private matter into work.

14
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,876
You're telling me not to report it.

15
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,254
Which means you feel
guilty and dishonest about this.

16
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,799
How should I understand this situation?

17
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,760
Are you her guardian or something?

18
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,720
Why do you keep butting in?

19
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,640
You keep coming to our house
and getting on my nerves!

20
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,771
You're dating the mayor's daughter while
flirting with an officer of City Hall.

21
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:45,939
Does this make sense?

22
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,775
Both of you, stop.

23
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:56,950
I'll explain everything
about why he's doing this.

24
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,327
Don't, unless you want him
to call you crazy.

25
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:00,829
No.

26
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,747
I must tell him.

27
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,591
Are you guys out of your minds?

28
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,137
I knew it. Why bother explaining to him?

29
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:19,931
You're saying,

30
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,226
he likes you

31
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,728
because he drank the love potion?

32
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,398
Yes.

33
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,734
You cast another spell
to break that spell.

34
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,403
But that went wrong too?

35
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:36,739
Yes.

36
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:45,623
Aren't you guys old enough
to tell reality and fantasy apart?

37
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:49,294
Time slips and parallel universes
have scientific logic at least,

38
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,463
but you believe in spells?

39
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,633
I came to her house multiple times.

40
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,843
That's the evidence.

41
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,261
Even now.

42
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,556
I'm very happy because Hong-jo is sitting

43
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,641
beside me.

44
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,977
Look at his condition.

45
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,730
He does look strange.

46
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,982
He does look strange indeed, but--

47
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,902
The shaman who wrote the spell book,
Aeng-cho was a real person.

48
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,863
One of my ancestors killed her.

49
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:20,033
He passed the military service exam
and served the king.

50
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:23,077
His name appeared multiple times
in Joseon Dynasty Records.

51
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,079
That's how great my family is.

52
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,917
How can you
believe in spells based on this?

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,628
Hong-jo, were you persuaded by him too?

54
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:36,174
Lady Jang Hui-bin used a doll
made of straws to curse Queen Inhyeon too.

55
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,801
She probably did that
because it had an effect.

56
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,929
During the Japanese Invasion,

57
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,349
they drove stakes into the ground
to dampen the national spirit.

58
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,477
Not you too, Hong-jo.

59
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,230
Forget it.

60
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,190
We don't need to persuade him.

61
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,275
-He doesn't believe us.
-"Us"?

62
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,070
Yes, us.

63
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,489
We believe in spells.

64
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,866
You don't believe in spells.

65
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,835
Fine, then do it.

66
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,923
Let's check if the spell works right now.

67
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,300
You can't simply cast a spell.

68
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,428
You need the right requirements
and ingredients.

69
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,598
And you need
to keep your body and mind clean.

70
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:29,227
Hong-jo is very tired now, so…

71
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,311
I'll do it.

72
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,231
I should've done it before.

73
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:38,027
That never occurred to me
because of you being a complete mess.

74
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,948
I cleaned up others' messes.
I was never a mess myself.

75
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:45,868
If I did look like it,
that's because of the spell.

76
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,287
No need to talk more.

77
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,124
Let's cast a spell right now
and check the results.

78
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,334
If it's proven
that the spell doesn't work,

79
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,753
finish this relationship.

80
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,924
If it's proven to work, what will you do?

81
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:02,719
We'll find out then.

82
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,975
It will take some time.

83
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,351
You can wait at your homes.

84
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,520
No, I'll wait here.

85
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:15,231
All experiments must be done
under the same conditions.

86
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,650
I live further away,
so I'm at a disadvantage.

87
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,445
Do what you want. I'll be downstairs.

88
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,654
I get cold easily.

89
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,114
Call me when you're done.

90
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,032
I will.

91
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,048
"Pregnancy Spell."

92
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,758
"A spell for having a baby."

93
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,844
I don't have a man. Pass.

94
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,430
"Good Fortune Spell."

95
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,931
"A spell for getting rich"?

96
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,436
"Shake your hand
with the richest man in Joseon

97
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,688
and get his energy."

98
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,693
It's hard to meet anyone now. Pass.

99
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,737
"Fair Skin Spell."

100
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,074
"A spell for becoming pretty."

101
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,285
Not bad. I'll put this on my list.

102
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,996
"Seduction Spell."

103
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,750
"A spell for getting the man
you truly want."

104
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,588
Look at that.

105
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,263
There aren't many spells
she can cast right now.

106
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,975
The spell she'll most likely cast

107
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,811
is Seduction Spell.

108
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,814
She would want Jae-gyeong instead of me.

109
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,544
Jae-gyeong?

110
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,630
Jae-gyeong.

111
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,424
What is it?

112
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,143
Weren't you going to wait outside?
Too cold, perhaps?

113
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,186
I didn't come in because it was cold.

114
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,230
I came in to check something.

115
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,905
These stairs aren't connected
to the second floor, are they?

116
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,533
Yes, they are connected
to the bedroom upstairs.

117
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,917
You're more gullible than I thought.

118
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,765
Hello.

119
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,434
Can you go to that main road?

120
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,102
I'll explain when we get there.

121
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,399
Move out to somewhere else.

122
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,568
This house must be drafty.

123
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,819
And you get cold easily.

124
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:08,988
The heater works fine.

125
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,490
Still, it's uncomfortable.

126
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:14,827
If someone saw you and her living here,
what would they say?

127
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:15,870
I don't care.

128
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,122
At least, I'm single.

129
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,127
Don't you care
about what Hong-jo might feel?

130
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,754
What about you?

131
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,090
If people see a man with a fiancée
coming in and out of this house,

132
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,092
what will they think about that?

133
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,638
You don't need to care about that.

134
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,973
You're just someone living
on the first floor.

135
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,850
Of course I care.

136
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,645
She likes me.

137
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,105
You already turned her down.

138
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,774
So stop minding her business.

139
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:50,154
I regret turning down those feelings.

140
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,828
And that Love Spell or whatever.

141
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,455
It wasn't for you either.

142
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,750
Be honest with me.

143
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,211
You were attracted
to Hong-jo from the start.

144
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,880
Isn't the spell just an excuse?

145
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,549
It isn't.

146
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,387
What's with that smile?

147
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,888
Promise me this.

148
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:21,060
When it's proven that spells don't work,
stop your rash game.

149
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,272
Sure, I promise.

150
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,189
But,

151
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,234
if it's proven that spells do work,

152
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,028
you stop meddling in our business.

153
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,806
Why are you so anxious?

154
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,267
I'm not anxious.

155
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,352
It's a new watch, so I keep looking at it.

156
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,438
I saw that watch a week ago too.

157
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,566
Are you worried
about what spell she might cast

158
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,942
and how it might turn out?

159
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,569
Sin-yu.

160
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,195
You graduated from a law school.

161
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,823
Scientists can make a wish
upon a shooting star

162
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,200
and Edison may want
to avoid Friday the 13th.

163
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,244
That's what shamanism is.

164
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,289
People believe in it
before they even realize.

165
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,334
Fine, let's say it's true.

166
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,002
Then how did you get involved

167
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,338
with Hong-jo
in such a ridiculous situation?

168
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,841
Mount Onju has been
my family's land for generations.

169
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,260
And that shrine was there
since the Joseon dynasty.

170
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,305
It was our unwritten duty
to take care of the shrine,

171
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,265
but Hong-jo had to demolish it,

172
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:44,810
and that's where
she got the spell book from.

173
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,564
How did Hong-jo end up getting it?

174
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,653
She is the rightful owner of the box.

175
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,141
Finally.

176
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,396
Do you think this blackout is
also caused by the spell?

177
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:33,901
Well,

178
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,362
it might be better if that was the case.

179
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:40,032
Because it would be worse
if you genuinely liked Hong-jo.

180
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,208
She called me.

181
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,087
Hello, Hong-jo.

182
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:55,881
Okay.

183
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,051
She says she's done. Let's go.

184
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,470
Sin-yu, that's cheating.

185
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,389
Come up slowly. Take your time.

186
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:08,978
Hey!

187
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,271
Open the door!

188
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,397
Gosh!

189
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,983
You said it must be done
under the same conditions!

190
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,902
You don't even believe in spells,
it won't matter to you!

191
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,363
The door's locked. Calm down.

192
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,990
I said calm down.

193
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,617
-Stop panting first.
-Do you think I'm panting?

194
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,870
-I think you're panting.
-I'm totally fine.

195
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,621
You're panting really fast now.

196
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,540
-I'm not.
-You're not?

197
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,042
Gosh.

198
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,420
Come in.

199
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,090
I came in first.

200
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,592
My foot is in front of you.

201
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,510
My hand is in front of you.

202
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,972
Hong-jo, can you judge who came in first?

203
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,645
What's wrong with you guys?

204
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,109
Hey. On the count of three,
let's go in together.

205
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,027
-Got it?
-Okay.

206
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,820
-One, two--
-Two!

207
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,699
And he calls himself a lawyer.

208
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,418
Not there. Come here.

209
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,219
Why are you acting like this too?

210
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,268
What spell did you cast?

211
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,439
Can't you tell at all?

212
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,399
Don't you feel anything?

213
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,696
Well…

214
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,781
I see.

215
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:44,990
I think it's good.

216
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:48,953
What is?

217
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,330
I cast the Fair Skin Spell.

218
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,416
-How do I look?
-I was right. Something good.

219
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,417
You became pretty.

220
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,585
The spell worked.

221
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,254
No, I think you look the same.

222
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,255
What's the same?

223
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,507
She looks twice prettier
than two hours ago.

224
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,175
Hong-jo has always been…

225
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,469
pretty.

226
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,891
Then did nothing change?

227
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,476
No, you changed.

228
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,770
Look at your skin. It's fair and nice.

229
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:15,938
It's not that fair.

230
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,606
No, it's fair and nice.

231
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,318
She had freckles on her right cheek.
They're gone now.

232
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,028
They're not. I can still see them.

233
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,739
Look. She doesn't have any blemishes.

234
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,199
Here they are.

235
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,034
Can't you see them? I can see them.

236
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,580
I'm not saying they bother me.

237
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:34,707
Me neither.

238
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,877
Stop looking, both of you.

239
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,086
It's hot.

240
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,384
Here's the result.

241
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,760
Spells don't work.

242
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,305
If they did,
it would've stopped her from blushing too.

243
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,723
Am I blushing again?

244
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:54,184
Fair Skin Spell didn't say
it could stop someone from blushing.

245
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,937
Stop it, Sin-yu.

246
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,481
Spells don't work.

247
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,692
Then what about the feelings

248
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,654
I felt for you
after drinking the love potion?

249
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,156
It's not due to the spell.

250
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,367
You might've been attracted
to Hong-jo at that instant.

251
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,536
No, I can't accept that.

252
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,580
Try another spell. Let's try again.

253
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,082
Jang Sin-yu.

254
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,792
You look

255
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,378
very pathetic now.

256
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,609
I was attracted to her?

257
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,777
Me?

258
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:47,571
No way.

259
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,453
My eye bags are still there.

260
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,416
So are the blemishes.

261
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,420
Even my laugh lines.

262
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,884
You did shoot me… with a love bullet.

263
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,261
When I'm shot, my heart races.

264
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,556
But I don't want my heart
to race looking at you.

265
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,058
But

266
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,061
it races.

267
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,524
If it wasn't due to the spell,

268
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,776
were his feelings real?

269
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,627
Are you up for beer?

270
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,217
Gosh.

271
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,055
I had no idea
the rooftop would turn out like this.

272
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,100
I bought them on impulse.

273
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,436
Now that I have a rooftop,

274
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,897
I wanted to try a lot of things.

275
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,442
It's really nice.

276
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,237
Your nose is pretty red,

277
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,656
but let's put up with it for the vibe.

278
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,910
I was already blushing a lot.
Is my nose red too?

279
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,498
I wish the spell had worked.

280
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,379
What?

281
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,799
Does it look that stupid
to believe in spells?

282
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,426
No.

283
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,720
I'm just happy

284
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:38,682
that you tried to cast
the Love Spell on me.

285
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,145
I did it just for fun.

286
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,439
I wasn't very serious or anything.

287
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,327
Try these snacks.

288
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,371
Okay.

289
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:28,398
This is for you.

290
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,157
GROOT

291
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:52,005
-Yes, Hong-jo--
-Why are you answering Hong-jo's phone?

292
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,050
It wasn't saved under your name,
so I didn't know.

293
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,261
You're still with her? Why?

294
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,429
Why did you call?

295
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,725
The garden owner is wandering around.

296
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,978
Tell her to lock her doors securely.

297
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,688
She'll understand what I mean.

298
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,148
Okay, I'll tell her that.

299
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,693
What are you guys doing at this hour?

300
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,070
Sin-yu, you're being
really pathetic again.

301
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,155
I'm hanging up.

302
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,620
"Pathetic."

303
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,456
Pathetic…

304
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,500
Yes, I'm pathetic.

305
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,094
It's soju this round.

306
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,611
Sin-yu had called.

307
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:58,238
He told you to lock your doors well

308
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,240
and mentioned the garden owner.

309
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,284
What's that about?

310
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,833
That owner

311
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,712
also drank the love potion
like Sin-yu and…

312
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,175
But why is he doing that?

313
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,886
If it's not the spell, I don't understand.

314
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,639
I think I know why.

315
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,814
How did you come to believe
in absurd things like spells?

316
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:36,818
Well…

317
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,864
You know, Sin-yu.

318
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,160
At first, he seemed unreasonable.

319
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:46,995
But later,

320
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,748
I felt bad for him.

321
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,753
It's not easy to think that.

322
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,216
He has everything.

323
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,974
Well, actually…

324
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,901
Can damaged blood vessel walls
in the left side of your brain

325
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,153
cause emotional malfunction too?

326
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:21,738
For example,

327
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,074
could it make you believe
that you like someone

328
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,326
when you actually don't?

329
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,123
One day,
I suddenly had tactile hallucinations.

330
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,958
Then I saw things.

331
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,711
I even had dreams which felt real.

332
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,254
And now,

333
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,507
I feel like I like someone.

334
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,259
Everything is a mess.

335
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:47,639
If that's also caused by the brain damage,
isn't it a serious issue?

336
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,060
Have you heard of neural coupling?

337
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,939
A phenomenon where the brain of a speaker

338
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,400
and the brain of a listener
work the same way.

339
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,154
When the speaker tells a story
in an exciting manner

340
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,740
instead of simply relaying information,

341
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,117
our brains react more strongly.

342
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,122
Are you the only one working?

343
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,458
I'm the best worker.

344
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,169
-Isn't this pretty?
-Yes.

345
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,754
Smell it.

346
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,425
It's so nice.

347
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,681
Chrysanthemum comes in many colors
which makes it prettier.

348
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:33,769
All of this

349
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,354
is just my confusion, right?

350
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,317
I see.

351
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,539
What is it?

352
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,918
Everything I did for Hong-jo until now,

353
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,212
there was a reason I had to act that way.

354
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,173
It's called neural coupling.

355
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,844
A confusion in my brain caused
by an intense story.

356
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,182
I heard you're sick.

357
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,476
Is it because of that?

358
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,355
Did Hong-jo say that?

359
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,738
She disclosed my secret that easily.

360
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,406
So do you want to confront her?

361
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,450
-Of course I should.
-That's an excuse.

362
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,329
Excuses to call her.
Excuses to go to her house.

363
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:35,872
Don't make any more excuses.

364
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,044
Don't act like you're anything to Hong-jo.

365
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,589
I think

366
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,925
I might become one.

367
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,553
I'll be straight with her.

368
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,188
Hong-jo works on the seventh floor.

369
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,482
"Straight" won't get you to her.

370
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:15,662
Come up to the rooftop right now.

371
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,046
What did you do?

372
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,591
What's this about?

373
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,093
Jae-gyeong knew I was sick.

374
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,013
How could you gossip
about something like that casually?

375
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,435
He thought of us very strangely, so…

376
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,189
He thought of us very strangely.

377
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,609
So you wanted to look less strange.
That's why you sold me out.

378
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,736
"Spells don't make sense,

379
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,237
but since he's sick,

380
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,739
I just did it out of pity."

381
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,324
Something like that?

382
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:55,076
Isn't that a better way
to protect your pride as well?

383
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,954
"I'm in my right mind,
but I believed in spells

384
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,956
and chased her around because of one."

385
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,709
Rather than that,
"I was sick, that's why."

386
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,836
Isn't this better?

387
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,963
It wasn't because I was sick

388
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,632
nor was it because I liked you.

389
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,634
It was neural coupling.

390
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,552
Neural, what?

391
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,804
Neural coupling.

392
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,848
A confusion in your brain.

393
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,934
I went to hospital this morning for this.

394
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:22,896
I heard about the curse in my family
thousands of times since I was young.

395
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,607
Aeng-cho is a real person.
I found the spell book.

396
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,567
You made the love potion.

397
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,902
And I drank it.

398
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:32,656
The story sounded pretty believable,
so my brain got fooled.

399
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:34,783
This happened to the both of us.

400
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:38,745
You called me out
this early just to say that?

401
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:39,663
Yes.

402
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,623
I wanted to end this properly.

403
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:45,168
"Gosh, someone like Sin-yu
followed me around."

404
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,170
In case you went around boasting that.

405
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,256
Why would I do that?

406
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:52,884
I'll only boast
when I get a real boyfriend.

407
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,262
You're a fake. How ridiculous.

408
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,725
GROOT

409
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,522
What are you doing?

410
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,702
What's wrong?

411
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:22,497
It's not my name.
I want to see what you saved my number as.

412
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:27,002
What? Why did you save my number as this?

413
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,255
You said it yourself.
You said you were Groot.

414
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,048
What about Jae-gyeong?

415
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,967
His name with a heart emoji. Happy?

416
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,845
Go away.

417
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,308
-And my number? How did you save it?
-It doesn't matter.

418
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:49,816
Did you hear what they said?

419
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,985
That's not important.

420
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,162
You have a strange habit.

421
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:04,914
-Sorry?
-You know.

422
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,459
Gosh, how unbelievable.

423
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,210
Stop hitting on people.

424
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,589
Do you like misters?

425
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,341
Last time, it was Mr. Kwon.

426
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,009
Now, it's Mr. Jang.

427
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,678
We were on the rooftop just now.

428
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:22,849
-I didn't hit on him.
-Then what?

429
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,895
Are you saying Mr. Jang hit on you?

430
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,609
You hit on all the handsome guys.

431
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:35,236
Do it outside of the office.
This is a workplace.

432
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,573
Why do you act like you're so desperate
to date someone at work?

433
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,909
-I--
-I'm against dating at work.

434
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,869
It's a headache when you break up.

435
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:43,787
I'm for it.

436
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:48,083
You can share your troubles at work
and also gossip together together.

437
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,918
You've been forever alone.

438
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,754
How can you give relationship advice?

439
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,092
I might not be single anymore.

440
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,929
I'm going on a blind date.

441
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:02,889
Really?

442
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,601
-Really?
-You're going on a blind date?

443
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:11,106
She must've found me cool
when I handled the rude complainant.

444
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,524
She's in the Tax Department.

445
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:14,734
Her name's Cha Seung-yeon.

446
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,904
Cha…

447
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,197
I know her.

448
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,990
She's very pretty.

449
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,575
But why…

450
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,954
She wanted a blind date with me.

451
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,331
She begged my friend for it.

452
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,382
Don't jump the gun.

453
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,510
That doesn't mean
you'll date her for sure.

454
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:43,972
Get to work, everyone.

455
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,391
No more chitchatting.

456
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,562
Put this in the middle. Yes.

457
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:51,980
Thank you.

458
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,189
Gosh.

459
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,024
Oh, no.

460
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:56,860
Run.

461
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,029
I didn't bring my umbrella today.

462
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:03,783
Thank you.

463
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:11,958
What brings you here?

464
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:14,502
To decorate the photo wall with flowers.

465
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,504
I don't think it will stop soon.

466
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,630
Let's go over there.

467
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,424
Okay.

468
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,648
What are you doing?

469
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,527
You'll get wet from the rain.

470
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,615
See? You're already drenched.

471
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,201
Don't do this.

472
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,037
This is unnecessary physical contact.

473
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:56,211
Use this.

474
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,881
What about you, sir?

475
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,841
I can't work while holding an umbrella.

476
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,885
Take it.

477
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,345
It's for the sikhye.

478
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,264
Thank you.

479
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:14,854
Sir.

480
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:18,066
I don't feel comfortable
with your kindness.

481
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,069
It's nice.

482
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:22,862
What is?

483
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:27,075
You're fine with the senior just now,
but you find me uncomfortable.

484
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:46,928
Hey, I'm here.

485
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,516
Should we go to Jeju Island
this weekend together?

486
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,524
Who…

487
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,777
Why are you going
to Jeju Island with Mr. Jang?

488
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:07,282
He has a fiancée
and she is the mayor's daughter…

489
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,870
-Are you the mayor's daughter?
-No.

490
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:18,960
Yes.

491
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,545
Oh, my gosh.

492
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:22,672
I'm heartbroken.

493
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,434
What should I do?

494
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,070
What are you doing?

495
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,072
This is for you.

496
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,994
If it's not the spell,

497
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,622
why is he doing this to me?

498
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,586
Who is it?

499
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,162
Sin-yu had called.

500
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,997
He told you to lock your doors well

501
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,333
and mentioned the garden owner.

502
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,089
Why worry about me?

503
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,470
You look very nice now.

504
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,932
I'll use this as my profile picture.

505
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,142
You know I don't like that.

506
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,562
Why? Let me show off my boyfriend.

507
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,231
We're dating openly now.

508
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,776
Take photos of the view.

509
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,987
The night view's nicer than me.

510
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,993
It is pretty indeed.

511
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,467
I didn't call to hear your voice.

512
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,262
I called to check
whether you would answer or not.

513
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,432
Don't read my texts.

514
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,933
Don't reply either.

515
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,269
It'll distract me from work.

516
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,270
No.

517
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,730
Not reading is more distracting.

518
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,942
I'm echoing to myself
because you're not replying.

519
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,236
You'll regret it.

520
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,364
I'm Jang Sin-yu.

521
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,800
What are you up to?

522
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,886
You called the wrong number.

523
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,389
You didn't call me to talk to me.

524
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,100
No. I called you because I was curious.

525
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,644
This won't make you
feel less lonely, you know.

526
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,149
Was it the Year of the Horse?

527
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,527
She loved the king,
but she couldn't have him.

528
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,863
So she hit on another guy.

529
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,866
But he turned out to be a eunuch.

530
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,618
That's exactly what you're doing.

531
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,703
I will meet such a guy?

532
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,288
Who knows?

533
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,998
Let's see.

534
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:46,167
Yes.

535
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,628
He's honest and strong.

536
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,338
He's beside you.

537
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,217
Can you really see all these things?

538
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,011
Then tell me more in detail.

539
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,387
Miss.

540
00:34:58,471 --> 00:34:59,639
I've got to hang up.

541
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,265
Don't fool me.

542
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,850
You're joking again, right?

543
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,477
I'm not.

544
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,105
I need to watch BTS. Bye.

545
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,736
I'm even more uneasy now.

546
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:24,413
Drink strong coffee
and blow off steam, okay?

547
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,041
How annoying.

548
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,043
Did something bad happen?

549
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,880
You haven't heard the rumor yet.

550
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,424
The woman renovating the first floor.

551
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,678
They say she's dating Mr. Jang.

552
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,305
She's been working here
only for a few days.

553
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,057
How so fast?

554
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,267
She's pretty, that's why.

555
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,728
You saw how she was dressed.
She must be rich too.

556
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,441
Right.

557
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,943
Poor you, Hong-jo.

558
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,529
Your efforts went in vain.

559
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,867
I didn't put any effort.

560
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:04,745
Yes, you did, to win Mr. Jang's heart.

561
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,039
Making a love confession to Mr. Kwon

562
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,167
and hitting on Mr. Jang.

563
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,960
Not the latter.

564
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,713
Right. That's what you think.

565
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:17,925
Darn it.

566
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:34,942
GREEN LANDSCAPE GARDEN

567
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,156
One of the employees from my team

568
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:44,076
came to discuss
about terminating the contract

569
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,494
with the maintenance vendor.

570
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,831
The owner personally
sent her a flower basket,

571
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,751
waited until she finished work
to ask her out for dinner,

572
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:55,588
and even made
unpleasant physical contact today.

573
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,155
I guess people do ask for those.

574
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,120
Aren't you the lawyer from City Hall?

575
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:10,454
You recognize me.

576
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,749
It's hard not to with how you look.

577
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,254
Are you here to buy flowers?

578
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,338
A pot, maybe?

579
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,466
I'm here to tell you something.

580
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:27,305
When you make
unnecessary physical contact,

581
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,598
you can be punished by law.

582
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,268
It is considered illegal,

583
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:35,229
so we can file a lawsuit and seek damages.

584
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,401
Are you threatening me?

585
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,320
Did it sound like I was?

586
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,156
Did Hong-jo say that?

587
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,949
So it was Hong-jo.

588
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,995
Ms. Ma just told me
it was one of the civil servants.

589
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,334
Well…

590
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,005
It's really unfair for men.

591
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:04,592
Even when a finger brushes by,
they say it's sexual harassment.

592
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,303
They make a fuss.

593
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:13,100
Whether it was a finger or two,

594
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,269
if the other person feels uncomfortable,

595
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,980
it is considered
sexual harassment or molestation.

596
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,734
If you want to continue
to work with City Hall,

597
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:23,611
keep that in mind.

598
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,535
I'll buy a flower since I'm here.

599
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,788
It looks like
I'm the first customer today.

600
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,414
It wouldn't be nice to just leave.

601
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:36,832
But

602
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,920
I don't want preserved flowers.

603
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,185
What are those flowers?

604
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,187
You said you were going out for work.

605
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,146
I did.

606
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,856
I bought this along the way.

607
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,400
For your girlfriend?

608
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,568
No, for you.

609
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,575
It's my first time
receiving flowers from a man.

610
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,828
You've never gotten one
from a woman either.

611
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,871
It's a defamation…

612
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,710
the mayor filed himself.

613
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,675
Have a look at it, and let's have lunch.

614
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,053
It's on me.

615
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,407
Food is great here.

616
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,368
She smiles too easily.

617
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,287
Her skin's flawless.

618
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,957
Because she got skin treatments
and plastic surgery, obviously.

619
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:01,750
She didn't get surgery.

620
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,675
We were in the same class in high school.

621
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,303
What is this?

622
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,930
You hit on your friend's boyfriend then?

623
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,809
I said I didn't hit on him.

624
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,107
He was taken.

625
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,442
He really has everything.

626
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,824
He's dating that woman.

627
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,743
I spread the news.

628
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,120
-Gi-dong.
-Don't scold me.

629
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,164
I'll use a coupon.

630
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,541
-Let's eat out.
-I don't want to.

631
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,669
Stop distancing yourself and eat together.

632
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,713
Your girlfriend is over there too.

633
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:09,777
They're wearing coats.
Are they matching clothes?

634
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,153
They look good together.

635
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:14,448
A handsome man and a pretty woman.

636
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,092
Onju is practicing go-green.

637
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:35,219
To keep up with the eco-friendly trend,

638
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,845
we decided to hold

639
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,598
an eco-plogging event for nature.

640
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,103
We'll walk and pick up trash.

641
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,772
You'll get gifts just from participating.

642
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,607
What will you get when you place first?

643
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,776
A Hanwoo beef set, guys.

644
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,573
This is how good I am.

645
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,993
Now, let the eco-plogging event

646
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,328
commence.

647
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,757
Hong-jo, you planned this event, right?

648
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,760
You knew that?

649
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:17,720
Yes.

650
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,598
I practiced since yesterday

651
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,182
to win.

652
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,811
You can't win.

653
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,273
Because I'm faster.

654
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,404
Doesn't Hong-jo

655
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,448
look very pretty, especially today?

656
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,533
Did something happen?

657
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,076
Her skin's clearer too.

658
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:43,495
They look so cute together.

659
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,915
It would be perfect if they dated, right?

660
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,692
You know.

661
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,694
I'm sorry,

662
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,154
but can you sell back

663
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:22,326
what I sold to you last time
at 2,000,000 won?

664
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,954
It was 200,000,
why should I sell it for two million?

665
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,289
I'll just give it to you.

666
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,875
But that would be unfair.

667
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:31,960
One minute, please.

668
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:44,431
There will be
a meteor shower in a few days.

669
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:48,519
LET'S GO SEE STARS
STARLIGHT FESTIVAL

670
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,187
Did you buy this

671
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,147
for me?

672
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:53,941
Yes.

673
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:58,779
Actually, my dad runs an observatory.

674
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:08,288
One more sauce, please!

675
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:09,790
Coming.

676
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,918
This chicken tastes amazing.

677
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,045
The smell of garlic's great.

678
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:18,757
Yes.

679
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,301
Though your heart is breaking…

680
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:26,098
chicken tastes so good, right?

681
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:30,519
But, Hong-jo, I feel bad for you.

682
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:34,690
Seeing your friend date a guy like him
must make you feel so jealous.

683
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:42,364
Is that why you let me join you today?

684
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,366
-Yes.
-Yes. That's a comfort drink.

685
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:46,910
You feel jealous, right?

686
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,537
You can be honest with us.

687
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,705
Mr. Jang is cool.

688
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,290
Guess what we call him.

689
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:52,207
Boo! Mr. Shocking.

690
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,210
We get shocked every time we see him.

691
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,671
Hong-jo,

692
00:45:57,754 --> 00:46:00,299
didn't your heart race when you saw him?

693
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:04,887
It's…

694
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:08,974
love.

695
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,982
My heart didn't exactly race.

696
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,444
Then why are you blushing?

697
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:23,572
Am I blushing again?

698
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,157
Yes.

699
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,952
Fair Skin Spell doesn't work at all.

700
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:32,498
What?

701
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,583
Nothing.

702
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:38,170
Hong-jo, you're quite pretty too.

703
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:40,339
But every guy you hit on turns you down.

704
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:44,176
Men don't only look at your face nowadays.

705
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,888
-Is that so?
-Your family and background too.

706
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,058
That's why we don't have boyfriends.

707
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,312
That was it.

708
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,567
We need to join forces in times like this.

709
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,111
Our biggest enemy
is the woman on the first floor.

710
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,030
Drink. Drink and cheer up.

711
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,115
We will

712
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,743
never fall.

713
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:11,745
-Never fall!
-Never fall!

714
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,374
ONJU CITY

715
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:19,753
Seriously, look at me
as an example and learn.

716
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,589
I'm saying this for your own good.

717
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,800
-You're so clueless--
-Ms. Yoo.

718
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:27,052
I'll get going. Goodbye, Hong-jo.

719
00:47:27,135 --> 00:47:28,095
Okay. Well…

720
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,304
Take me with you.

721
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,764
That'll take longer for me.

722
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:32,599
I'll pay you half.

723
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:35,978
Who pays the bigger half?

724
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,022
Me.

725
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,607
Okay, get in!

726
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,734
You're pretty cool.

727
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:43,777
My goodness.

728
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,903
-Excuse me.
-Goodbye.

729
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:47,406
-Have a safe trip back.
-Think about what I said.

730
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,583
I need to call a cab too.

731
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,503
My phone's missing again.

732
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,383
I'm so drunk.

733
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,148
Hong-jo.

734
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:24,484
Get up, Hong-jo.

735
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,113
Gosh, Mr. Shocking.

736
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:34,328
This is your nickname.

737
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:36,622
You're the talk of the town.

738
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:38,790
My goodness.

739
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,003
Don't hold me.

740
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,172
You shouldn't.

741
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:46,840
You're not my man.

742
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,306
Congrats on revealing your relationship.

743
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:58,060
The whole of City Hall
is going crazy over it.

744
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:01,938
Some say you're a match made in heaven.

745
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,191
Some are very jealous.

746
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:06,777
All the women in City Hall

747
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,738
were heartbroken today.

748
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:15,285
You must be happy to be so popular.

749
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:19,289
Gosh, where is it?

750
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:24,211
Mr. Popular.

751
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,506
Can you call my phone?

752
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,967
I lost my phone.

753
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:35,806
I don't know if I left it
in the restaurant or the office.

754
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,226
I'm sure I put it in here.

755
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:43,480
It's strange for it to leave me.

756
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,484
Where did it go?

757
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,114
Is nobody picking up?

758
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,618
I think it's ringing in there.

759
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:58,495
What?

760
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:00,539
No way.

761
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:02,082
I checked just… Found it.

762
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,501
There it was.

763
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,503
GROOT

764
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,257
You're not Groot anymore.

765
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:12,342
Get lost.

766
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:15,011
Groot was my favorite.

767
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:19,266
I liked you so much.

768
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,689
Gosh, look at me.

769
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,409
What are you doing?

770
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:39,786
What about you?

771
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,414
How did you save my number?

772
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:45,375
What is it?

773
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,210
How did you save mine?

774
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,337
Give me that. You're busted.

775
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,797
-Stop.
-Gosh.

776
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:51,965
You're feeling guilty.

777
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,049
I said stop.

778
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,426
Darn it.

779
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:57,679
Nice.

780
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:03,477
CIVIL SERVANT (HAUNTED HOUSE)

781
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,818
I don't have a name.

782
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:23,079
Hey.

783
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,249
Save my number under my name.

784
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:30,712
My dad had to think long and hard
to think of this pretty name.

785
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,757
"Hong" for big and "jo" for morning.

786
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,094
Wasn't it "Hong" for red?

787
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:40,764
Is that even important?

788
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,236
Sin-yu.

789
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,948
Don't live like that.

790
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,445
Get up.

791
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:41,950
Hong-jo.

792
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:56,506
What is it?

793
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,096
I was worried.

794
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,688
Why would you worry about me?

795
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,148
Just because.

796
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,317
You make me worry about you.

797
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,740
How absurd.

798
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,243
First, you said it was the spell.

799
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:28,538
Then you said it was neural coupling.

800
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:31,458
Now you don't have any other excuses,

801
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,834
and why worry about me?

802
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:36,338
You shouldn't.

803
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,675
And don't do anything for me.

804
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,220
Nothing at all.

805
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,182
You make me confused.

806
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:53,355
Then again,

807
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:56,274
you aren't doing anything now, too.

808
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,654
You don't call me anymore.

809
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,200
You told me not to.

810
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:08,370
You're so mean.

811
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:13,875
What makes me mean?

812
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:18,546
Everything.

813
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:20,298
Everything!

814
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:16,479
What's wrong?

815
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:17,814
No appetite?

816
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:22,318
No, I'm eating.

817
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:25,947
Your wedding date's decided.

818
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:28,950
February 5th, it's Sunday.

819
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:30,326
Na-yeon agreed too.

820
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,875
So only I wasn't aware of it.

821
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,129
You said you'd discuss it.

822
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,051
Let's eat quickly and go play golf.

823
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,555
Na-yeon,

824
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:53,308
why did you book a golf course
in this cold weather?

825
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:56,770
I got gifts for you, too.

826
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,855
Your golf clothes.

827
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:01,274
Why did you buy them?

828
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:37,352
Do I look like gimbap?

829
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,106
Then I must be Chungmu gimbap.

830
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:48,321
My fellow gimbap, shall we go?

831
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:49,739
Sure.

832
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:57,747
Here.

833
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,380
Why won't he eat?

834
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:07,841
Is he sick?

835
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,889
He just got here today,
so he doesn't have a name yet.

836
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:16,891
I see.

837
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,311
Why don't you name him, Hong-jo?

838
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:29,195
Bong-gil.

839
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:30,947
Bong-gil, are you okay?

840
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:33,533
Bong-gil.

841
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:35,994
Yes.

842
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:37,787
He said it's fine.

843
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:50,133
You're not… sick or anything, are you?

844
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:56,764
Why did you decide
on the date without telling me?

845
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:59,017
I decided and told you just now.

846
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:04,647
I'll clean this up.

847
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:14,991
Are you done yet?

848
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,163
You're taking so long.

849
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:21,915
I'll just wear this.

850
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:23,208
I'm sorry…

851
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,088
but I can't join you today.

852
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,944
What do you call it
when a dog had a hard day?

853
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:53,571
A ruff day.

854
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:55,448
How did you know?

855
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,327
You're a really good cook at least.

856
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:00,870
This gimbap tastes amazing.

857
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,542
You said "at least," not "also."

858
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:09,337
It'd be unfair if you were funny too.

859
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,340
What do you think I have?

860
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:17,887
You make people feel comfortable.

861
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,059
I don't want to make you feel comfortable.

862
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:28,314
I don't want you
to feel comfortable around me.

863
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,360
I want to give you butterflies.

864
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:43,871
I'm disappointed.

865
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,248
You're not blushing.

866
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,358
You said you had something urgent.

867
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,698
This is what's urgent.

868
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,011
Who sent you these pictures?

869
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:41,220
Is that even important?

870
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:44,390
Why you did this is what matters,
not who sent the pictures.

871
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:45,725
What is going on?

872
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,727
What is this?

873
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,729
What were you doing with Hong-jo?

874
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:03,034
I don't want you
to feel comfortable around me.

875
01:01:04,577 --> 01:01:06,537
I want to give you butterflies.

876
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,457
What is this?

877
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:15,588
I should blush
when I hear something like that.

878
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:18,174
Did the spell really work?

879
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:24,430
Did I become a fair-skinned beauty?

880
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:39,570
YOON NA-YEON

881
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:41,656
Why is she calling me at this hour?

882
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:48,496
What is it?

883
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,887
What is this about?

884
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,597
What brings you to my house?

885
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:15,273
Acting all kind and innocent,
you've been playing dirty behind my back.

886
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:19,569
Shouldn't you explain first?

887
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:22,029
Why should I get slapped by you?

888
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:23,948
Why did Sin-yu come to your house?

889
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:26,492
Did you have fun behind my back?

890
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,953
You held hands, hugged, and kissed.

891
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:30,830
You did all sorts of things.

892
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:35,835
It's not what you think.

893
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:37,754
I don't know what he said, but--

894
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:38,671
What?

895
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:41,257
Are you saying you didn't hit on him too?

896
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,177
It was the same back in high school.

897
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,972
How can you get involved
with every man I date?

898
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:51,559
It's impossible

899
01:02:51,642 --> 01:02:53,811
unless you hit on them intentionally.

900
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:58,065
There was a reason.

901
01:02:58,608 --> 01:02:59,817
We have nothing going on.

902
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:02,320
Hey.

903
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:05,281
You talk as if you let me have him.

904
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:07,408
Don't get the wrong idea.

905
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:09,702
It's not that there's nothing going on.

906
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:14,040
You're nothing.

907
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:09,011
Sin-yu, where are you?

908
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:16,018
Where are you?

909
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:50,011
What is it?

910
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:51,512
Did something piss you off?

911
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,224
It's Sin-yu.

912
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:57,643
So why do you want to marry him?

913
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:02,440
Shut up.

914
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:07,695
Should I?

915
01:05:51,697 --> 01:05:54,575
It must be something urgent.
We could've met tomorrow.

916
01:05:57,828 --> 01:06:00,831
I'm here to return the dress
and the wooden box.

917
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:02,416
Take them all.

918
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,001
Why, all of a sudden?

919
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:07,338
This is what couples that break up do.

920
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:10,132
I don't want anything from you.
Not a single thing.

921
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:11,050
So annoying.

922
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:14,136
If they're so annoying,
you should've just thrown them away.

923
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,181
Why bother coming all the way to me?

924
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,935
Is that an excuse to see me?

925
01:06:26,732 --> 01:06:29,819
Your girlfriend slapped me.

926
01:06:29,902 --> 01:06:31,988
She said I hit on you.

927
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:34,115
She said we held hands,
hugged, and kissed.

928
01:06:34,198 --> 01:06:35,950
Just what did you tell her?

929
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:37,743
Why must I get slapped by her?

930
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,745
What the hell did you tell her?

931
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,292
That I'm being swayed.

932
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:48,546
You must be insane.

933
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:51,757
You weren't really swayed.

934
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:53,759
You should've explained

935
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:57,346
that it was the spell or neural coupling.

936
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:00,099
You gave me so many excuses.

937
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:02,268
Why didn't you tell Na-yeon any of those?

938
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:06,480
Because it's true.

939
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:09,859
You swayed me

940
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:12,361
and are still swaying me.

941
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:21,746
But I'm not going to take any action.

942
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:25,082
I won't take a single step towards you.

943
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:28,711
Asshole.

944
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,634
What do you want from me?

945
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:39,221
You want me to be honest? Fine.

946
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:47,331
DESTINED WITH YOU

947
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:49,125
Are you playing with me?

948
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:52,711
Can you say you never wavered
when you saw me?

949
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,588
Just end it all.

950
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:55,923
Whatever the feelings were.

951
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:58,050
There were no spells.

952
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:01,846
Who sent you those pictures and why?

953
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:03,430
Seems like a stalker.

954
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:06,058
It's a crime to take
and spread others' photos.

955
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,434
PRIVATE PROPERTY
DO NOT ENTER

956
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:08,936
Did you hear that just now?

957
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,149
What is it?

958
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:19,530
