1
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,966
DESTINED WITH YOU

2
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,187
Thank you…

3
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,815
for saving my life.

4
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,986
You can't say you're saved

5
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,699
until you accept
the spirit into your body.

6
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,367
I…

7
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,622
do not want to be a shaman.

8
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,708
If you don't want to,

9
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,337
you'll die from the illness
caused by spirits.

10
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,673
If you wish to die…

11
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,929
I do not plan to stop you.

12
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:50,276
Shamans do not only tell the fortune.

13
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,529
Fortune and misfortune.

14
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,950
Happiness, anger, sadness,
joy, love, hatred, desire.

15
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:00,245
It is our job to scrutinize
and save the lives…

16
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,290
of those who are dying

17
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,585
and those who wish to die.

18
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,880
EPISODE 13

19
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,758
I don't know what she told you,

20
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,261
but you said it didn't matter.

21
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,599
You said what matters is the present.

22
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:45,642
Don't you remember?

23
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,618
The bloody hand.

24
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:07,997
Did you know…

25
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,918
that it was me?

26
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,513
Did you

27
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,391
fool me…

28
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,731
to steal the Book of Spells?

29
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,913
I said whoever kills me…

30
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,669
would be cursed.

31
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,656
I'm the one who put the curse on you.

32
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,331
It doesn't matter.

33
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,083
It matters to me.

34
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,167
So what?

35
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,381
I can't

36
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,717
see your face anymore.

37
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,052
That was the past.

38
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,096
No.

39
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,598
It might not have been the past.

40
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,393
It's because I waffled on

41
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,271
about the curse.

42
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,648
Maybe you've been having

43
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,901
the same dream
because that was imprinted in you.

44
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:24,986
No.

45
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,573
I clearly remember
the moment I was stabbed.

46
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,285
That texture, smell, and pain.

47
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:37,665
They're so vivid…
that I cannot see your face anymore.

48
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,929
That's not happening now.

49
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,224
Look at me.

50
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,854
I'm right in front of your eyes.

51
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,825
Give me some time.

52
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,860
He killed me,

53
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,240
so he was cursed by my spell.

54
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,116
In the end,

55
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,619
Sin-yu was sick

56
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,871
because of that spell.

57
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,667
Your hand soaked in blood

58
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,919
is holding onto Sin-yu
and won't let him go.

59
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,296
It can't be helped.

60
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,967
I don't want to believe in all this.

61
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,638
I don't know if that actually was
my past life, and even if it was,

62
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,224
we can just live happily regardless.

63
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,396
If you two had not met,

64
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,898
you could've lived fine regardless.

65
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,150
But what can you do?

66
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:31,237
You guys were destined to meet each other.

67
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,739
The karma is so strong

68
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,285
that you two were destined
to meet in the end.

69
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,624
Then what should I do?

70
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,878
I don't care what happened
in our past lives.

71
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,255
I like…

72
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,425
Sin-yu.

73
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,099
Reincarnation goes

74
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,644
round and round like a wheel.

75
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,152
Since I'm the one who cursed him,

76
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,112
shouldn't I be able to break it?

77
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,991
Maybe that's why I got the spell book.

78
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,911
You already know.

79
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,584
Before your life ends,

80
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,836
nothing ends.

81
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:37,887
Then…

82
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,098
what if…

83
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,019
I let him go?

84
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:40,991
You're deep in thought.

85
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,122
When did you come in?

86
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,708
I knocked, but you didn't notice.

87
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,001
What's going on?

88
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,295
Nothing. What brings you here?

89
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,598
Haum will take over
the development of the Mount Onju area.

90
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,771
It was decided via a competitive tender.

91
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,566
It makes no sense
to change it without a reason.

92
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,192
You know that.

93
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,948
You can get a refund for a 1,000-won item
with a simple change of mind.

94
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,451
And this construction is worth billions.

95
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,119
A change of mind is acceptable.

96
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:29,206
You know it's a personal revenge,
why do you keep siding with Mayor Yoon?

97
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,668
I'm the mayor's advisor.

98
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,172
I'm supposed to assist the mayor.

99
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,219
LANDSCAPING COMPANY
TRANSPARENCY ENHANCEMENT

100
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,017
Jeez.

101
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,895
Why do you look so worn out
early in the morning?

102
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,814
I'm fine. I feel very energetic.

103
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,400
Then why don't you hold
a housewarming party?

104
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,028
All of a sudden?

105
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,821
I didn't even move.

106
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,326
You weren't born in that house.
You must've moved at some point.

107
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,703
I know it's late, but congratulations.

108
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:11,040
I'm sorry that, as your senior,
I didn't go to help you with the move.

109
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,250
Let us help each other from now on.

110
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,127
So when's a good day for the party?

111
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:16,921
I'm sorry,

112
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,382
but I don't feel well enough
to have a housewarming party.

113
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,345
-That's perfect!
-That's perfect!

114
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:29,600
All the more reason to create
a new event and lift yourself up.

115
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,684
And…

116
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,271
If it's just us,
the party will be quite small, so…

117
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,568
you can invite Mr. Kwon too if you want.

118
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,528
That sounds good.

119
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,409
I don't get it.

120
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,829
Even I, the CEO of a company,
can make time,

121
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,749
and a mere civil servant can't?

122
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:56,252
Are you looking down on civil servants?

123
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,254
Whatever. Break up with her.

124
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,006
I haven't even met her,
and I already don't like her.

125
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,633
She's working overtime.

126
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,635
She's working hard.

127
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,470
I'll bring her next time.

128
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,558
She must be hungry
if she's working overtime, right?

129
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,935
I should pack her some food.

130
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,607
Tell me.

131
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,236
There's some issue
between you and her, right?

132
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,365
A work-related issue, for sure.

133
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,618
Mount Onju's development company
might change to Haum.

134
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,828
I know.

135
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,163
Why won't you scold me?

136
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,708
If I do, are you going to listen?

137
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,880
Haum will not take over.

138
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,257
I won't let it happen no matter what.

139
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,676
Don't worry about the business.

140
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,221
You should worry about
your relationship instead.

141
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:51,432
You should bring your girlfriend

142
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,143
so I can decide
whether or not to be against her.

143
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,564
So you did want me to bring her.

144
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,154
Gosh, why is the soup so salty?

145
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:12,411
GROOT

146
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,430
Hi, Hong-jo.

147
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,769
My mom packed this.

148
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,772
It's for you.
She told me to bring you along next time.

149
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:42,650
Everything tastes good except japchae.

150
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,234
Mom made it herself.

151
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:48,197
Mom's a bad cook, and so are you.

152
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,033
Am I destined to live with bad cooks?

153
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,792
Come on and take it. My arm hurts.

154
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,711
Sin-yu.

155
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,548
I'm not in the mood to joke around.

156
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,688
Don't you feel like time is slipping away?

157
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,609
Even when I'm with you all day long,

158
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,820
it's not enough for me.

159
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:37,413
It was ill-fated, and it will stay
as an ill-fated relationship.

160
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,540
But you're here because you missed me.

161
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,674
I'm here to return this to you.

162
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,679
Keep it with you.

163
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,932
I don't think I should.

164
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,018
What did Eun-wol tell you?

165
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,853
Why?

166
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,063
Did she say I'd die if we were together?

167
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,483
I don't care about that.

168
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,277
Everyone dies anyway.

169
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,361
Are you telling me

170
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,448
to watch you die?

171
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,959
Let's stay apart for a while.

172
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,211
We should take some time apart.

173
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,465
Then you might get better.

174
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,555
If it's still the same…

175
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,351
will you stay by my side then?

176
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,901
Let's talk about it when the time comes.

177
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,113
I really might not have enough time.

178
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,491
You might not have
enough time because of me.

179
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,124
Go back safely.

180
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,396
Are you on a diet?

181
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,399
Why do your cheeks seem
to hollow out every time I see you?

182
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,444
Didn't I become prettier thanks to that?

183
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,684
YOU HAVE A NEW DOCUMENT

184
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,228
LEGAL ADVICE REQUEST
FROM LEE HONG-JO TO JANG SIN-YU

185
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:18,991
REQUESTING LEGAL ADVICE ON
CIVIL COMPLAINT AGAINST NURI PARK TREES.

186
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:35,799
Come in.

187
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,640
Did you receive my present?

188
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,561
Yes, I received it.

189
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,396
I hoped it'd trouble the company,

190
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,981
but it wasn't enough.

191
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:54,067
Thanks to you,
Father is completely over you.

192
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:55,986
That's too bad.

193
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,696
I thought he'd stay on my side.

194
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:58,780
No way.

195
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,075
You don't look happy.

196
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,619
I hate to break it to you,

197
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,746
but I couldn't be happier.

198
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,998
Really? Then I should test it.

199
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,918
You said you just wanted
to protect your people.

200
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,878
How will you protect her?

201
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,087
Don't do anything.

202
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,424
If you harm her, I won't let it slide.

203
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,968
Mayor and Lee Hyeon-seo.

204
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,513
They both have a lot to lose,
don't forget that.

205
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:28,810
I kind of like this conversation.
It's like a lovers' quarrel.

206
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,146
If you break up, come to me.

207
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,856
I'm ready to accept you back.

208
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,586
Are you saying you find me cool too?

209
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,755
I did my best to look good in your eyes.

210
00:20:56,838 --> 00:21:00,259
Usually, I shower for ten minutes.
But today, it took longer than 20.

211
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,761
I spent more than 30 minutes
to choose my clothes.

212
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,346
I even put on some perfume.

213
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,348
I didn't know what perfume you'd like,

214
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,808
so woody on the left

215
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,143
and citrus on the right.

216
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,395
Which side do you like?

217
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,281
LAWYER JANG SIN-YU

218
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,331
Hello?

219
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,293
Come up now.

220
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,796
You can tell me on the phone.

221
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,131
This is about work.

222
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,883
Let's talk face-to-face
for a consultation.

223
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:45,137
I'm working outside.

224
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,809
We don't need to compensate.

225
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,352
Let them file the lawsuit.

226
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,314
I understand.

227
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,440
Thank you.

228
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,025
Wait.

229
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,323
How are you?

230
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,456
I'm fine.

231
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,836
I'm not fine.

232
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,589
My illness won't be cured
from us not meeting.

233
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,049
And

234
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,426
I'm under the Love Spell.

235
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,970
Imagine what my day feels like.

236
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:37,105
I'm busy. I'm hanging up.

237
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,503
-Ta-da!
-Ta-da!

238
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,838
-It's so nice!
-My goodness!

239
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,174
Ms. Yoo, look at the rooftop up there.

240
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:07,302
-It's so pretty.
-You didn't have to bring so many things.

241
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:08,261
Come this way.

242
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,514
Wait.

243
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,601
Did you invite Mr. Kwon?

244
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,105
I forgot to tell him.

245
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,817
-I'll go invite him.
-What?

246
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,413
Oh, my. I'm glad you were home.

247
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,333
We're having a housewarming party
in Hong-jo's place.

248
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,294
If you're free, would you like to join us?

249
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,507
Well…

250
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,009
It's fine if you're busy.
Don't feel pressured.

251
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,599
I'm free. I don't feel pressured.

252
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,769
That's great!

253
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,896
You seem appropriately dressed.

254
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,022
Shall we go up now?

255
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,315
This way.

256
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,483
Give me five minutes.

257
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,193
You're coming, right?

258
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,487
Please come.

259
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,826
Your bathroom's so big.

260
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,584
-Is this a rental?
-Yes.

261
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,420
Is this connected to the first floor?

262
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,130
It's detached.

263
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,968
You've ordered in so much
and also cooked for us.

264
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:33,555
This is a housewarming party.
I should at least cook one dish.

265
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,056
Enjoy.

266
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,683
It looks good.

267
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,400
Mr. Kwon, you must like tteokbokki.

268
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,280
I don't, but this one tastes good.

269
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,865
I'm glad you like it.

270
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,450
I just followed the recipe.

271
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,536
Here.

272
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,956
Have some grapes that I brought too.

273
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,709
My uncle runs a vineyard in Yeongdong.

274
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,961
He harvested these and sent them to me.

275
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,381
It tastes really good.

276
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,760
I'll eat it myself.

277
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:16,473
-How is it?
-I haven't tried it yet.

278
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,731
-It's delicious.
-Good for you.

279
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:29,194
I brought a bunch
so I can also share with you.

280
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,280
By the way,
I always saw you in suits at work.

281
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,574
When you're dressed naturally like this,

282
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,160
you look neat and cool.

283
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:38,912
Gosh, what's wrong?

284
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,622
-My gosh.
-Goodness.

285
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,333
Tissue.

286
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,088
Have some water.

287
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,339
Thank you.

288
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,008
Are you okay?

289
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,428
You're lucky, Hong-jo.

290
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,806
You must see him like this every day.

291
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,809
I don't see him every day.

292
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,855
The grapes are
really sweet and refreshing.

293
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,941
Cheers!

294
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,526
Okay.

295
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,361
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

296
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:16,616
By the way,

297
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,119
why aren't you meeting her?

298
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,873
It's very complicated.

299
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,419
That's the problem with you.

300
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,421
You never talk about your problems.

301
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:31,506
Let's say,

302
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,968
I killed you in my past life.

303
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:40,223
Can you still stay as my friend?

304
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,564
That's a bit too much.

305
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,193
Wait, did you have

306
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,030
some kind of a past-life experience
during the date?

307
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,489
Wow!

308
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,158
This is insane.

309
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,036
I don't think that's the reason.

310
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,496
She's probably pushing me away

311
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:08,460
because she thinks
she's the reason I'm sick.

312
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,254
Then go tell her right now.

313
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,759
"It's no one's fault that I'm sick."

314
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,056
I'm scared…

315
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,935
the more I approach her,

316
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,688
the more I'll push her away.

317
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,490
When my father visited last time,

318
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:39,657
I was too sensitive.

319
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,994
He's an alcoholic,

320
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,163
so I was sensitive about the alcohol.

321
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,123
Oh, no. And I gave him alcohol.

322
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,167
You didn't know about it.

323
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,586
I didn't mean to blame you.

324
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,923
I'll clean up here. Go back to your home.

325
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,676
This is my home.

326
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:01,930
Right.

327
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,560
You're finally smiling.

328
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,647
You've been looking down recently.

329
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,400
Did something happen with Sin-yu?

330
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,864
I must've felt pressured
to hold the party.

331
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:25,745
Actually, I think we had
this housewarming party because of you.

332
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:29,624
They heard you lived here,
and they wanted to be friends with you.

333
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:32,210
It seemed like it. That's why I came.

334
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,255
Thanks to you,
I think I got closer with them.

335
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:38,133
I wasn't getting along with them
since that scandal.

336
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,468
My participation paid off.

337
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,972
But in the future, if you need to cook,

338
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:44,889
leave it to me.

339
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,775
Do you know him?

340
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,028
I don't think so.

341
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,123
Hello. I'm Kim Wook.

342
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:13,126
I'm Sin-yu's best friend.
We've been friends for 15 years.

343
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,879
I see.

344
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,839
Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Hong-jo.

345
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,507
I know.

346
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,925
I heard a lot about you.

347
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,678
What brings you here?

348
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,264
Actually,

349
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:29,058
I'll leave Sin-yu here,

350
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:33,021
so please deal with him as you like.

351
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,314
Then I'll get going.

352
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,442
Excuse me.

353
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,537
Am I seeing things now?

354
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,256
Did you drink?

355
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,216
Gosh.

356
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,552
She's real.

357
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,596
She's the real Hong-jo.

358
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,184
Hong-jo.

359
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,314
I can't do this. I need to see your face.

360
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,989
You're even prettier since I last saw you.

361
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,920
You saw my face. Now go back in.

362
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:23,882
Just a moment.

363
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,426
Can we stay like this for a moment?

364
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,367
How much did you drink?

365
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,287
Three glasses.

366
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,834
Get in the car. I'll call a driver.

367
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,462
You're so mean.

368
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,720
You said until recently that

369
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:13,932
even if I didn't come to you,

370
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,601
you would come to me.

371
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,813
How can you do this now?

372
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,068
Can you live…

373
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,156
without seeing me?

374
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,371
You already know.

375
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,499
Before your life ends,

376
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,751
nothing ends.

377
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,178
Yes.

378
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:07,986
I understand.

379
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,280
I'll leave. You can go now.

380
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,790
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

381
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,753
I came out because I was worried.

382
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:27,940
Get in.

383
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,817
Let's go.

384
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,787
I… must have

385
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,415
liked Sin-yu a lot.

386
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,628
He came to me so playfully

387
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,215
and I got used to it so slowly

388
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:57,303
that I didn't know how much I liked him.

389
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,808
But now I know.

390
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,523
I didn't want to cry.

391
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:20,827
Why are you pushing him away
if you like him so much?

392
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,580
Because I think he's sick…

393
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,751
because of me.

394
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,217
I don't want to say this,

395
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,096
but if I were Sin-yu,

396
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,432
even if that was true,

397
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,561
I would want you to stay by my side.

398
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,861
This is my advice as your neighbor.

399
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:57,822
But as a man,

400
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,200
I want to stop you from going to him.

401
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,883
I was waiting there to get in your way

402
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,177
when you guys made up and got chummy.

403
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,182
Cursed Frog Prince.

404
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:25,308
Take my kiss.

405
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,644
If you won't, I'll come to you.

406
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,705
Can we eat together?

407
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,125
What's wrong
with colleagues eating together?

408
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,549
TAX DEPT CHA SEUNG-YEON

409
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,093
She's so persistent.

410
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,804
-Who is?
-Ms. Cha Seung-yeon.

411
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,307
I turned down the date,
but she keeps texting me.

412
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,227
Are you still talking with her?

413
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,562
Our relationship is a secret.

414
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,439
I don't want to make false excuses.

415
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,399
I thought it'd die down naturally.

416
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:18,611
Tell her you're dating.

417
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:21,697
What if she asks who?

418
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,116
Just tell her it's me.

419
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,247
Can I really?

420
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,335
I'm telling Seung-yeon first.

421
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,426
Mr. Gong?

422
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,222
Seung-yeon?

423
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,790
Why did you keep me waiting for so long?

424
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,793
Well…

425
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:19,046
I'm sorry that the blind date
keeps getting delayed.

426
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,429
Mr. Kwon brought these grapes.

427
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,722
They're really good.

428
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,474
He got it from Hong-jo's
housewarming party yesterday.

429
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,935
Right. Didn't you go
to the housewarming party?

430
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,063
Why did she have the party?
She didn't even move.

431
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,775
How would I know something
you don't know of?

432
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,863
Gosh, I poured too much.

433
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,199
Huh?

434
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,786
What's this?

435
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,956
The water is strange.

436
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,280
What's that?

437
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,495
Have you lost your gloves recently?

438
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:21,210
I think I left them in the restaurant
on the day I met Na-yeon.

439
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,506
Have you seen the garden owner recently?

440
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:28,801
What's going on?

441
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:32,638
It's nothing.

442
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,767
If you make that face
and say it's nothing,

443
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,269
how can I believe you?

444
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:41,188
I just wanted to check
if everything was fine with you.

445
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,945
Everything's fine.

446
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:52,700
So I hope you won't
worry about me from now on.

447
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,286
That's impossible for me.

448
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,289
Don't stop me from worrying about you.

449
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,335
I have my self-defense weapons.

450
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,754
I'm going back to work.

451
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:21,937
We meet earlier than I thought.

452
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,482
How do you know the garden owner?

453
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,069
What do you mean?

454
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,032
Look.

455
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:35,993
What's this?

456
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:39,955
From the pot you sent, a piece of my shirt
and Hong-jo's gloves were found

457
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,165
soaked in blood.

458
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,501
I never sent you a pot.

459
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,253
You're the only person
who could've taken my shirt

460
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,546
and her gloves.

461
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,257
The shirt was from when I was hospitalized

462
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,801
and the gloves were
from when you drank together.

463
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,556
I don't know anything.

464
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,685
Are you the one
who made him take the photos?

465
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,563
No, I'm not.

466
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:07,983
It wasn't me.

467
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,361
He approached me first.

468
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:14,740
He was following Hong-jo
and taking her pictures already.

469
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:18,661
Then when he found out I was
your girlfriend, he sent me the photos.

470
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:22,248
Saying, "Your boyfriend
is cheating on you, so separate them."

471
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:25,209
I didn't know he was this strange.

472
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,797
He asked you to bring him clothes I wore,

473
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,715
and you didn't find him strange?

474
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,260
I was threatened.

475
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,471
I started getting photos
because he sent them to me,

476
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,765
then he threatened to tell you
I made him do it.

477
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:41,767
So I had no choice.

478
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,353
Your words.

479
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,313
I'm not buying it.

480
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,735
You found out everything.

481
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,362
Why would I lie?

482
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,949
Call him.

483
00:42:57,032 --> 00:43:00,202
And tell him clearly not to do anything.

484
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:06,500
Theft, defamation, and stalking.

485
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:09,503
I could report you two
for these crimes. Should I?

486
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:10,963
Fine.

487
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,631
I'll call him.

488
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,015
The number you have dialed
is not in service.

489
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,641
He must've changed the number.

490
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,768
It's not in service.

491
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,404
NA JUNG-BEOM

492
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:41,619
The number you have dialed
is not in service.

493
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:44,079
Please check the number again.

494
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,960
Na-yeon, don't forget
you're the mayor's daughter.

495
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:50,961
That position

496
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:54,131
could be taken away easily
because of family issues.

497
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,257
And one more thing.

498
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,469
This is the last time
I'm giving you a warning.

499
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:13,275
LAWYER JANG SIN-YU

500
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,814
The transfer of ownership
of Mount Onju is complete.

501
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,358
That's good. Thanks for your hard work.

502
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,402
Right.

503
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:59,029
Before going back to the hotel,
let's have some wine.

504
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,408
I think we should visit
the traditional market.

505
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,076
Starting with local currency,

506
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:05,786
there is a lot to benchmark.

507
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:09,706
Why would you plan
the schedule so tightly?

508
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,334
You even made me
run the marathon in the morning.

509
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:13,710
I'm totally beat.

510
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,921
You can take a short nap.

511
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,874
LAWYER JANG SIN-YU

512
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:57,129
KWON JAE-GYEONG

513
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,215
What is it?

514
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,593
I saw someone suspicious
in the CCTV footage.

515
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,052
Check the message I sent you.

516
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:13,020
Is he the garden owner?

517
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,241
Can you go to the second floor now?

518
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,244
I'm on a business trip.

519
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,914
She didn't pick up, so I filed a report.

520
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:36,752
I'll go to her place now.

521
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:40,714
Keep checking the CCTV
and call me if anything dangerous happens.

522
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,933
MR. KWON JAE-GYEONG

523
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,062
Mr. Kwon?

00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:37,980

MR. KWON JAE-GYEONG
LAWYER JANG SIN-YU

526
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:03,463
Yes, Mr. Kwon.

527
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,882
Mr. Na is roaming around your house.

528
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:07,718
What?

529
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:10,262
The cops are on their way,
but it'll take time.

530
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:12,598
Lock the doors and don't leave the house.

531
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,183
Sin-yu is on his way there too.

532
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,060
All right, I see.

533
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:41,960
What are you doing?

534
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,087
I'm here to talk for a while.

535
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,631
We can talk in City Hall tomorrow.

536
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,383
If I were young and handsome,

537
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,344
you would've opened the door now.

538
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,054
Let me go.

539
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,013
Why?

540
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:56,099
You joke around
with a brat like Sin-yu just fine.

541
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,020
That has nothing to do with you.

542
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:03,482
We were getting along well
until he appeared.

543
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:06,693
We never got along well.
We were just working together.

544
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,323
Women like you

545
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,158
are the worst.

546
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:45,649
Are you okay?

547
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,984
-Are you her family?
-Her boyfriend.

548
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:52,572
She must be very shocked,
so stay with her.

549
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,950
We'll go out and patrol around the house.

550
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:57,786
Do you know about
Na Jung-beom who broke in?

551
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,079
Yes, I heard about him.

552
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,665
Please come to the police station tomorrow

553
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:04,376
to apply for a restraining order.

554
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:05,377
I understand.

555
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,422
We'll patrol around the house.
You can rest assured for now.

556
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:10,590
Let's go.

557
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:35,574
Was it him?

558
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:41,121
He popped out through the grills…

559
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,584
and I was so scared.

560
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,259
Pack some clothes.

561
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,470
You shouldn't stay here alone.

562
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,015
Stay in my house for a while.

563
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:03,018
It's dangerous
even with the restraining order.

564
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,440
But if I stay with you--

565
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:11,151
I can't give you more time.

566
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,532
Today's the last day…

567
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,119
that we stay separated.

568
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:28,877
Hello.

569
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,796
I like the friendly vibe.

570
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:34,800
Can you use local currencies
in the shops like this too?

571
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,384
Hello, are you okay?

572
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:39,137
He ran away right before the cops arrived.

573
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:43,099
Don't worry.
Nothing much happened.

574
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,310
Did Sin-yu arrive?

575
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,021
Yes. He's beside me now.

576
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:49,606
Can you put him on the phone?

577
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,068
He's driving.

578
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:54,402
Tell him I said thank you

579
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,447
and I'll take care of it from here.

580
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,158
Sin-yu says thank you and--

581
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,117
I heard him.

582
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,870
My schedule ends tomorrow morning.

583
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,121
See you in City Hall.

584
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,833
Okay, see you.

585
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:53,920
Let's go up.

586
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:04,180
It's herbal tea.

587
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,226
Drink it.

588
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,520
I'll go get some pills
to calm your nerves.

589
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:14,733
Don't go.

590
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,281
Just stay by my side.

591
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:27,329
You said I shouldn't stay by your side.

592
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,540
It's a special situation now.

593
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,346
I missed you so much.

594
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,142
Not in this kind of situation, though.

595
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,527
Don't get me wrong.

596
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:02,572
I'm staying over just for tonight.

597
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,535
I don't plan
to make you stay only tonight.

598
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,709
I'll be back soon.

599
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:20,131
I don't want you to go anywhere.

600
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:25,804
Don't worry.

601
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:28,264
I'll be with you all night.

602
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:33,687
I'll get going.

603
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:39,878
Mr. Jang.

604
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,671
It really was your car.

605
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:44,257
-Where are you?
-Me?

606
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:46,468
In the elevator.

607
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:47,802
Where are you going?

608
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:48,928
You know where.

609
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:52,640
Do you know how many CCTVs
there are from here to my house?

610
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:55,727
I don't know.

611
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,021
One, two,

612
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:01,024
three, four, five.

613
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,759
LAWYER JANG SIN-YU

614
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:46,194
Who is it?

615
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:54,285
LEE HONG-JO

616
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:08,842
LAWYER JANG SIN-YU

617
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:11,594
The line is busy.

618
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:14,139
Please leave a message after the tone.

619
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:15,431
LEE HONG-JO

620
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:34,422
DESTINED WITH YOU

621
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:38,926
A terrible curse is cast on me.

622
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:43,848
That awful curse will be
passed down for generations

623
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,351
and will not end.

624
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:52,523
Leave the shrine on Mount Onju as is.

625
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:55,735
From one generation to the next,

626
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,113
take good care of it.

627
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:15,505
