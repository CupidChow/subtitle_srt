1
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,966
DESTINED WITH YOU

2
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,082
I found out…

3
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,419
the answer.

4
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,523
Your destinies…

5
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,276
Your destinies…

6
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,867
-…cannot be severed.
-…cannot be severed.

7
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:02,872
-Accept it.
-Accept it.

8
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,810
EPISODE 5

9
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,258
That seat's not for you.

10
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,720
You don't like eating alone.
Are you going to eat alone here as well?

11
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,973
How did you become a lawyer?

12
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,183
Can't you take a hint?

13
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,811
That seat's not for you.

14
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,730
Then who is it for?

15
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,649
My dad.

16
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,156
Today's the day he passed away.

17
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,878
My deepest condolences.

18
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,465
Would you like to order?

19
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,800
Yes. One large order of grilled clams,

20
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,844
one kilogram of whelk,
and a bottle of soju.

21
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,012
Gosh.

22
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,765
It would be too much for two people.

23
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,516
It's okay. It's for three.

24
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,685
Is that so?

25
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,811
Okay.

26
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,313
I'll bring them quickly.

27
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,439
Thank you.

28
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:18,383
Thank you for joining me
on his commemoration day.

29
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,189
Why aren't you drinking?

30
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,232
I need to drive.

31
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,984
You didn't drive here.

32
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,740
I think it's rude not to drink
on a commemoration day.

33
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,202
Can you handle my habit when I'm drunk?

34
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,038
What is it?

35
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,581
Do you repeat what you said?

36
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,292
Or do you sleep anywhere?

37
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,918
Those are considered cute.

38
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,463
Don't tell me

39
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,343
that you kiss someone beside you
or something like that.

40
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:03,886
Who knows?

41
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,556
It could be more dangerous than that.

42
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:10,977
I can't control myself
as it is because of the Love Spell.

43
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,979
If I drink on top of it--

44
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:13,938
Don't drink.

45
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:21,154
I actually don't know what my habit is.
I've never had alcohol before.

46
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,574
You've never had alcohol before?

47
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,575
As in,

48
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:27,827
never in your life?

49
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,998
No way. That's a lie.

50
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,125
Why…

51
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,378
But it tastes so good.

52
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,213
You must be insane. I don't get…

53
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,426
Is it because of your disease?

54
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,761
It runs in my family.

55
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,637
Nobody has ever avoided it.

56
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,099
Father thinks it's due to a curse.

57
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,311
I didn't want him
saying that to me, so I didn't drink.

58
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,815
A rich guy has his own worries too.

59
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,693
Poor you for living a boring life.

60
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,659
How did your father pass away?

61
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,957
I don't talk about myself
to someone I'm not close with.

62
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,668
You don't talk about yourself
to close people.

63
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,588
You talk about yourself
to get close with someone.

64
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:33,893
-They're cooked.
-Watch out.

65
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,896
You'll get hurt. I'll do it.

66
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,411
Dad!

67
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,997
You always said

68
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,750
a stable job was the best.

69
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,504
So I became a civil servant.

70
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,258
Don't worry about me.

71
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,263
And…

72
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,016
I was really planning
to bring a boyfriend along this time.

73
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,104
But some strange guy followed me.

74
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,066
What are you doing?

75
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,234
Say hello.

76
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,622
I'm not her boyfriend.

77
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,167
Nor am I a strange guy.

78
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:40,918
But…

79
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,465
I'm Hong-jo's destiny,

80
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,008
apparently.

81
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,057
I found out the answer.

82
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,480
"Your destinies cannot be severed."

83
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,397
"Accept it."

84
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:09,280
You couldn't say it out loud
because you felt sorry, right?

85
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:14,118
Inseverable destinies normally mean love.

86
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:18,247
We can infer that the spell
you cast on me might never be broken.

87
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,418
And I'll have to
chase you around with my heart racing.

88
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,378
What are you going to do?

89
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,389
I'm too drunk. I should go home.

90
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,767
Don't be so irresponsible

91
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:41,270
with the person of your destiny.

92
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,691
Isn't the person of your destiny

93
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,818
-in Gangnam right now?
-That's right.

94
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,531
I came all the way here
to reconnect with that destiny.

95
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,449
But ridiculously,

96
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,576
we're destined to be together.

97
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,996
Didn't this happen
because you cast the spell wrong?

98
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,791
That's not true.

99
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:06,212
You're the one who drank
the love potion that wasn't meant for you.

100
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,421
I'm a victim too.

101
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,174
You should've been more careful
when casting the spell.

102
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,885
You should've been careful
when you gave me the box.

103
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,851
Resolving this issue is top priority.
Take responsibility no matter what.

104
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,690
Sin-yu.

105
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,900
Don't just think
of accepting your destiny.

106
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,569
Think of going against it.

107
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,321
Destinies are meant for you to go against.

108
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,864
Sin-yu.

109
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,951
-Do you want to be my destiny?
-No way.

110
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,328
I don't want to be your destiny either.

111
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:43,624
So let us do our best
and go against our destinies. Okay?

112
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,792
We can do this.

113
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,169
Okay.

114
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,131
I'll do my best to go against my destiny.

115
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,467
I don't want to be

116
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,304
your destiny either.

117
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,056
Okay. Give me a hand.

118
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,314
Just this time.

119
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,113
Gosh!

120
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,573
He let go on purpose.

121
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,116
He's so annoying.

122
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,560
I think I'd rather have the Red Hand.

123
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,652
It smells nice.

124
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,197
The smell of wood.

125
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,167
This is why…

126
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,172
I can't go against my destiny.

127
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,017
What's that?

128
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,568
What? Blood?

129
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,696
-Okay.
-What happened?

130
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,616
-Mount Onju is covered in blood.
-What?

131
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,077
Go to the mountain now.

132
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,954
-Okay.
-Let's go together.

133
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:45,913
No can do.

134
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,166
You'll pretend to go with her
and then play hooky.

135
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,795
You told me to look after them.
It's covered in blood of all things.

136
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,214
It might be dangerous. So I'm going.

137
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,549
As her team leader.

138
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,801
-I'm off.
-Let's go.

139
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,136
-What? I--
-Hurry up.

140
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,762
Why… Gosh.

141
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,389
OAK TREE

142
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,225
Shouldn't we call the police?

143
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,102
What if this is human blood?

144
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,771
There might be a corpse over there.

145
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,648
This is chicken blood.

146
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,026
How can you tell?

147
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,029
Back in my day,
we didn't have fried chicken shops.

148
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,490
To eat chicken,
you had to kill one at home.

149
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,576
And that smelled exactly like this.

150
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,493
-You--
-Mr. Gong.

151
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,121
This isn't the only place. Over there too.

152
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,833
There are more than 200
if we count all tree tags.

153
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,461
It's been less than ten days
since we changed them.

154
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,129
Just wipe them.

155
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,549
I'd get it if they spray-painted them.

156
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,260
But isn't chicken blood way too strange?

157
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,137
If this was spray paint,

158
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,848
there's no cleaning them.
We have to replace them all.

159
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,643
In my 21 years as a civil servant,
I've never seen such a madman,

160
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,312
but still, I'm thankful.

161
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,439
Why? We can just wipe them.

162
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,733
Take pictures of all of them

163
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,818
and clean up before we get complaints.

164
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,320
Okay.

165
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,532
-Do you have wet wipes?
-No.

166
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,620
What can we use to wipe?

167
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,730
It smells nice.

168
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,650
The smell of wood.

169
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,716
What took you so long?

170
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,135
I came as soon as you called.

171
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,053
What's it about?

172
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,055
Damaged tree tags.

173
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,183
You should've informed me about it first.

174
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,561
Will you report it?

175
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,020
Have a seat first.

176
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:16,897
Okay.

177
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,732
What's that smell?

178
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:23,153
I took a lot of pictures. Look.

179
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,045
I said look at this.

180
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,882
We can report this, right?

181
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,509
I won't report it.

182
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:50,514
-Why not?
-Twenty-nine tags were damaged.

183
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,808
You even wiped them clean already.

184
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,519
You can't waste the cops' time over this.

185
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,523
Then why did you call me?

186
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,359
To check whether you'd come or not.

187
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,653
What?

188
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,740
You shouldn't have come.
You told me to go against destiny.

189
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:11,827
If you come running to me like this,
you'll make things difficult.

190
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,291
Your condition is
what's making things difficult.

191
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,960
-Hong-jo.
-What now?

192
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,588
You got a rare chance.

193
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,090
It's not easy to look down on me.

194
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,220
How do I look from above?

195
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,807
People say my long eyelashes
make my eyes look charming.

196
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,437
Why are you doing this to me?

197
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,775
I want to impress you.

198
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,782
You won't forget once you see them.

199
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,829
He's not an advisor. He's an annoyance.

200
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,503
Should I use the Fair Skin Spell
and turn him into a woman?

201
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,216
No, it'll only make him look good-looking.

202
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,636
It's no use.

203
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,221
LEGAL ADVISOR
LEGAL ADVICE ROOM

204
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,399
What's wrong with you, Jang Sin-yu?

205
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,820
Give me three more days.

206
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,613
You won't solve it in 30 days.

207
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,115
This.

208
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,867
Your girlfriend's friend left it behind.

209
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,746
I'm sorry.

210
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,082
I can't pass it on to her now.

211
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,585
What do you mean?
Why can't you pass it on to her?

212
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,546
We broke up.

213
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,718
She used to hit on you so much.
Is she breaking up because you're sick?

214
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,720
I thought she was better than this.

215
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:53,804
I didn't tell her.

216
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,473
Are you mad?

217
00:16:56,557 --> 00:17:00,352
During hard times,
you need someone beside you.

218
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,021
It'll only make it hard for her.

219
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,482
Are you seriously trying to look cool now?

220
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,984
That's not being cool.

221
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,652
That's just bravado.

222
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,198
NA-YEON

223
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,953
You're so frustrating.

224
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,081
Hi, Na-yeon. It's me, Wook.

225
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:25,252
I'm Na-yeon's friend.
Something happened to Na-yeon.

226
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,295
What happened?

227
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,037
Did I put it on right?

228
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:01,830
Is it straight?

229
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,833
How does it look?

230
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:05,918
No.

231
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,504
You should put it up higher.

232
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,553
You're not supposed to
be here yet. I'm not done.

233
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,932
What's that?

234
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,529
I couldn't wait any longer
for you to propose,

235
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,114
so I'm proposing to you first.

236
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:39,910
-Na-yeon.
-I found out.

237
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,498
I know how sick you are.

238
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,377
I thought hard about it for a few days.

239
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,380
I think I like weak guys.

240
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:53,924
Will you

241
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,635
marry me?

242
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,557
Getting married wouldn't be just about us.

243
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,893
If the mayor finds out,

244
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,187
he'll go against this.

245
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,981
My dad isn't the one marrying you.

246
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,108
This is my marriage.

247
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,452
I love you so much.

248
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,913
I don't want to let you go.

249
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,363
The ingredients are very fresh.

250
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,364
Do you like it?

251
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,324
Is it good?

252
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,455
Eating like this makes it feel
like we're meeting before the wedding.

253
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,666
Oh, no. That's not what this is.

254
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,086
I came here without much thought

255
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,339
because my husband invited me
out for dinner.

256
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,468
We should have a proper meeting next time.

257
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,261
Carefully too.

258
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,391
Both families are here,
so it's a family dinner.

259
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:30,437
-The procedure doesn't matter.
-The procedure is important.

260
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:35,567
Marriage is a very important vacation.

261
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,071
Gosh.

262
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,031
I'm sorry.

263
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:41,990
Well…

264
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,952
It's "occasion."

265
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:45,953
What?

266
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,957
Na-yeon, would you like something more?

267
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,166
What about wine?

268
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:52,834
It's okay.

269
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,544
Both you and Sin-yu don't drink.

270
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,342
By the way, you're always so cute, Mother.

271
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,136
Not as cute as you.

272
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,393
Eat up.

273
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,271
"Cute"?

274
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,732
She was being sarcastic, right?

275
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,651
She wasn't.

276
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:20,946
I'm thankful that she found you cute.

277
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,825
What is "a very important vacation"?

278
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,286
Your brain went on vacation.

279
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,830
It was a mistake.

280
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,168
How can I bring you around
when you're such an embarrassment?

281
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,461
Why embarrassment?

282
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,256
Everybody makes mistakes when they talk.

283
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,508
You didn't make a mistake.

284
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,093
You were just dumb.

285
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,429
Don't talk when you go out next time.

286
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,763
Your stupidity shows.

287
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,807
BI.

288
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,977
Did you call me a brainless idiot?

289
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,730
You're quick to
catch on to stuff like this.

290
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,274
Go back to the entertainment industry.

291
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:01,361
You'll become popular
on variety shows for being dumb.

292
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,321
What?

293
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,666
It's been a while since we went on a date.

294
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,296
But it's so annoying.

295
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,590
Why?

296
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,300
He's so handsome.

297
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,677
-Everyone's looking at you.
-Is he a celebrity?

298
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,137
They're not looking at me.

299
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,473
-They're looking at you.
-Who's that woman?

300
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,475
They're looking at you in awe.

301
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,310
They're glaring at me in jealousy.

302
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,146
Hanbok looks nice.

303
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:38,565
Right? We should've rented some too.

304
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,527
I really like palaces.

305
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,446
I must've been a princess in my past life.

306
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,500
And this is

307
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,543
soju!

308
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:17,145
I think I met my dad thanks to you.

309
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,482
I went to the sea this time.

310
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:24,861
It felt like my dad
was walking by my side.

311
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,738
Well done.

312
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,990
What happened with Sin-yu?

313
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,578
When you say inseverable destinies,

314
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,789
people think about destined love and such.

315
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,458
But none of these apply to us,

316
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,002
so we decided to go against our destinies.

317
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,715
Always be on guard.

318
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,884
I can smell blood on you.

319
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,347
You're amazing!

320
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,516
I did see blood a few days ago.

321
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,559
Chicken blood.

322
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,992
I like it so much.

323
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,910
Your smiling face.

324
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,084
Wait.

325
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,213
MOTHER

326
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,883
I got a phone call. Let me answer this.

327
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,263
Yes, Mom.

328
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,518
I'm with Na-yeon.

329
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,479
Are you angry?

330
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,286
I'll call you back.

331
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,616
This is Sin-yu's car.

332
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,167
You're back again.

333
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,045
You said if I came running to you,
I'd make things difficult.

334
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,964
But you came running to me.

335
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,675
I had no choice.
I needed to check something.

336
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,095
-Were you in Changdeokgung today?
-What a random question.

337
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,222
Answer me. Were you in Changdeokgung?

338
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,601
I was in City Hall the whole day,
then I went to visit Eun-wol.

339
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,228
What about it?

340
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,232
This spell is terrible.

341
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,235
Now I'm seeing hallucinations of you.

342
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,987
I went to Changdeokgung just now.

343
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,614
I saw you running in hanbok.

344
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,076
She must've been a lookalike.

345
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,454
No. It was definitely you.

346
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:06,416
Then let's just say I went there.
I've been there two years ago.

347
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,792
This isn't a joke.

348
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,627
I'm serious now.

349
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:14,591
Sin-yu, do you really think
that's because of the spell?

350
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,384
I have a girlfriend.

351
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:20,513
I call her Na-yeon,
but others call her a goddess.

352
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:24,434
So why would I like you
when I have someone like her?

353
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,190
Hong-jo.

354
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:36,404
Do you really want me
to go against destiny?

355
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,697
Of course.

356
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:42,202
I don't want to have
an inseverable destiny with you either.

357
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:45,455
Then you shouldn't have
turned around when I called you.

358
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:48,291
Why do you turn around
and make my heart race?

359
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:52,921
Please,

360
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,341
stay out of my sight.

361
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,014
You're the one who came here.

362
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,823
I have a girlfriend.

363
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:24,035
I call her Na-yeon,
but others call her a goddess.

364
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,081
So why would I like you
when I have someone like her?

365
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,542
Goddess, my foot.

366
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:36,548
Hong-jo.

367
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,341
Sit here.

368
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:42,804
Okay.

369
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,442
Sit down.

370
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,695
Then I'll keep you by my side.

371
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:04,951
Sorry. I can't forgive someone who flirts
to steal her friend's boyfriend.

372
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,620
I told you. He wanted to talk--

373
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,998
Min-ho doesn't talk to poor people.

374
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,253
You said I was your best friend.
Why won't you believe me?

375
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,714
You believed that?

376
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,013
Clean the tray for me.

377
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:26,973
Also,

378
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,018
you're not my best friend.

379
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,853
You're my maid.

380
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,064
I'm off.

381
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,614
He's a poor judge of character.

382
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,783
Should I just reveal it?

383
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,035
No.

384
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,496
He should get married
and suffer his whole life.

385
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,651
Honey.

386
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:24,239
Do you want to go see stars with me?

387
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:27,575
No.

388
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,204
I want to go see the toilet.
My stomach hurts.

389
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,511
END-OF-YEAR FIREWORKS

390
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:49,764
Last year, the placements were pretty bad.

391
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:54,394
Why don't we move the specialties booth
to the left of the main square?

392
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,606
Do whatever you want.

393
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,111
What kind of answer is that?

394
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,990
You have a problem with it?
I agreed with you.

395
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,661
Who's the guest singer?

396
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,872
Call and ask.

397
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,206
Okay.

398
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,708
You haven't asked yet?

399
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,835
This is Onju's main festival.

400
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,629
The most important event
of Greenway Building Division.

401
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,006
Can you do your job properly?

402
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,135
I don't think
I'll be in this department at that point.

403
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:28,761
What?

404
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,849
Gong, come out for a minute.

405
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,399
You've lost your mind.

406
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:44,694
How is politely asking
for a transfer losing my mind?

407
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,322
You're doing that to screw me over.

408
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,993
Is this because you're upset?

409
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,412
Don't mind me.
I'm lazy and I avoid problems.

410
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:57,457
I have all the faults
of civil servants you hate the most.

411
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,167
So why do you care if I leave?

412
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,796
I'm sorry. My apologies.

413
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,506
I was harsh back then.

414
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:09,052
Why would you apologize
to a nobody like me?

415
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,720
A 21-year colleague is nothing.

416
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:13,139
-That was--
-You wounded me deeply.

417
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,934
I'll get going.

418
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,645
A deep wound is going too far.

419
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,855
Mr. Gong. Stop right there.

420
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:25,652
Hey!

421
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,822
What hand lotion do you use?
It smells so good.

422
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,783
Someone gave it to me as a gift.

423
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,160
Someone from work?
Why didn't they give me one?

424
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:42,919
Hello.

425
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,129
Hello.

426
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,764
-You must be going for lunch.
-Yes.

427
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,726
If you're going alone,

428
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,312
would you like to join us?

429
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,814
I have a prior engagement.

430
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,649
I see.

431
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,744
I should've told him to enjoy his meal.

432
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:20,707
Hong-jo.

433
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,001
A minute, please.

434
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,680
Excuse me.

435
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,688
You're not going to say that, are you?

436
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,733
"You shouldn't have come."

437
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,192
We have somewhere to go.

438
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:49,819
You had lunch plans.

439
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:52,238
This is the plan.

440
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,159
I never made a plan with you.

441
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:59,537
You better come with me
if you want me to go against my destiny.

442
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,416
Didn't you tell me
not to appear in front of you?

443
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,502
I'll allow it today.
You can stay in front of me.

444
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,129
And if I follow you,

445
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,423
you'll say,
"You shouldn't have followed me."

446
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,341
Can you please come with me?

447
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:13,468
No.

448
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,471
-Then fine. I don't want to go either.
-Okay.

449
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,015
Actually, no. Please.

450
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:21,309
Can you come with me?

451
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,403
Okay, let's go.

452
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:34,947
But,

453
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,909
I get to choose the restaurant.

454
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,461
This is on me.

455
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,297
It's hard to go against destiny, right?

456
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,007
Eat the salmon and cheer up.

457
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,092
Eat up.

458
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:58,846
Honestly, it feels good to have someone
like me chase you around, right?

459
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,725
Are you secretly hoping
for the spell not to break?

460
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,811
I'm a good judge of character.

461
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,729
That's the problem.

462
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,898
It's hard not to like me.

463
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,943
Everyone has different tastes.

464
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,237
You're not my type.

465
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,823
-That can't be true.
-It is true.

466
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,784
Exactly which part of me is not your type?

467
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,579
You're way too tall and handsome.

468
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,414
You're too much.

469
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:37,677
Everyone likes me
regardless of their ideal type.

470
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,428
I see.

471
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:43,182
Am I too hard to approach,
so you give up first?

472
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,184
Think however you like.

473
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,519
Eat up.

474
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,523
I can't sever
the inseverable destinies by eating alone.

475
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:53,359
We should eat and pull together.

476
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,570
Okay, I'll eat a lot.

477
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,614
I need energy to head toward my destiny.

478
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,367
So you do want to be with me.

479
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,077
I'm your destiny.

480
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,038
No.

481
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,833
My destiny is on the first floor.

482
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,545
-What do you mean?
-You don't have to know.

483
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,380
Eat up.

484
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,048
The lunch break is almost over.

485
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:19,886
GREEN LANDSCAPE GARDEN

486
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:22,555
Today, I'm here
for a personal matter, not for work.

487
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,223
I want to start gardening.

488
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,184
Are you okay?

489
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,562
I was worried. I heard about the tags.

490
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:33,357
Right. It does bother me,
but I'm used to dealing with such stuff

491
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,817
from my previous workplace.

492
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:38,821
There's a lot of lunatics
who appear perfectly fine on the outside.

493
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,700
For today, I'd like this chrysanthemum.

494
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:46,495
If you're buying that,
sacred bamboo's on the house.

495
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:49,081
It's the best landscape tree.

496
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,725
What are you doing?

497
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,938
Why are you home so early today?

498
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:14,774
My work ended early.

499
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:17,318
I told you I would do the gardening.

500
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,239
I have nothing to do at night.

501
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:23,824
How are they?

502
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,622
They're pretty,

503
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,457
like a funeral wreath.

504
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,629
They'll look better
with this tree beside them.

505
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,297
It's the best landscape tree.

506
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,507
It's sacred bamboo.

507
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,758
Sacred baby boo?

508
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,636
Sacred bamboo.

509
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,600
You should go in.
I'll finish planting them.

510
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,811
No, I'll do it.

511
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:54,855
It's okay. They're my housewarming gifts.

512
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,691
Even though you didn't have a party.

513
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,863
Are you free in 30 minutes?

514
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,741
Totally.

515
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:07,660
Why?

516
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,829
Let's have a housewarming party.

517
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,330
See you later.

518
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,010
"See you later."

519
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:31,642
A jacket?

520
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,228
A dress?

521
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,215
We're wearing matching clothes.

522
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,261
As neighbors, I suppose.

523
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,723
Yes, as neighbors.

524
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,391
Come in.

525
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,351
Okay.

526
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,358
Sit and wait just a moment.

527
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:21,984
Okay.

528
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,945
My stupid mouth.

529
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:33,746
I cooked a simple dish.

530
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,790
Is oyster sauce eggplant rice bowl fine?

531
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:39,001
Yes. Oysters and eggplants
are my favorites.

532
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,670
Oysters smell so nice.

533
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,381
There's no oyster in it.

534
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,137
You must be a good cook.

535
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,139
Yes. I've lived alone for a long time.

536
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,104
I've lived alone for a long time too,
but I'm terrible at cooking.

537
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,688
Cooking is a talent too.

538
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,276
Can you go back up
and come down in 30 minutes?

539
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:06,695
Why?

540
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,533
There's no rice.
I forgot to press the button.

541
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,089
My destiny is on the first floor.

542
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:29,552
What destiny is on the first floor?

543
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,638
Jae-gyeong works on the 11th floor.

544
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,600
I need energy to head toward my destiny.

545
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:41,439
Yes, I'll head
toward mine energetically too.

546
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:46,068
I'll never think about you, ever.

547
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,034
Do you like it?

548
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,371
Yes. As soon as I eat it,

549
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,666
the texture of eggplant
gently caresses my tongue,

550
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,210
and as soon as I taste the freshness,

551
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,087
the aroma that follows

552
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,756
is this nice oyster smell.

553
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,049
There's no oyster in it.

554
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,303
So…

555
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,806
Do you know what a killjoy is?

556
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,642
I know. Someone who kills joy.

557
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,020
I was trying to be funny.

558
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:22,480
I must've killed joy.

559
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:30,863
Gosh.

560
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:37,244
You're very different
from what I saw in City Hall.

561
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:41,248
Not in a good way, right?

562
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,584
I meant it in a good way.

563
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:48,130
Honestly, I was surprised
that you moved here.

564
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:52,384
You look like someone who would live

565
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:55,012
in a fancy high-rise condo.

566
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,768
I did live in a condo before this.

567
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:03,729
I only saw blinds all year long.

568
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:07,107
I couldn't tell
whether it rained or snowed outside.

569
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,902
I couldn't tell what season either.

570
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:14,198
So I wanted to come
to a house with a yard.

571
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,162
Why are you smiling?

572
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,081
What?

573
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:26,961
Because I like listening to you talk.

574
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,046
That's strange.

575
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,589
People find me boring.

576
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:38,264
-Would you like beer?
-Sure.

577
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,022
It must be raining.

578
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:58,075
After drinking, I'll do the dishes.

579
00:42:58,784 --> 00:43:00,995
I can't cook, but I'm good at dishwashing.

580
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,204
You don't need to.

581
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,416
I'm good at both cooking and dishwashing.

582
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,378
Being good at everything isn't that nice.

583
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:11,589
Honestly, I'm worried

584
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,674
about looking like an AI robot.

585
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,684
Don't feel obliged to laugh.

586
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,562
You don't need to be funny.

587
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:29,815
Just looking at you makes me smile.

588
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,694
That's what people said.

589
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:36,071
Who said that?

590
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:37,698
Well…

591
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,451
Numerous dogs in the dog shelter?

592
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:50,044
Is there a shaggy dog
in the shelter you go to?

593
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:53,672
This is top secret.

594
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,301
Raising one for ten years
will make you rich.

595
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,472
-You're drunk.
-I'm serious.

596
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,600
Do you want to go with me next time?

597
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,185
There's no shaggy dog though.

598
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:09,647
I'd like that.

599
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:30,793
You can pick it up.

600
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:32,711
Okay.

601
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,009
What is it?

602
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:42,346
What took you so long to answer?

603
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:44,682
What is this about?

604
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,058
What are you doing now?

605
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,518
Nothing.

606
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:50,646
Can't you give me
a longer and detailed answer?

607
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:52,940
Why should I?

608
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,525
I want to hear your voice.

609
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:56,443
I'm hanging up.

610
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,947
If you were going to hang up this fast,
you shouldn't have answered it.

611
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,365
You're not helping me.

612
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,617
I'm trying to go against my destiny.

613
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,035
You shouldn't have answered.

614
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,620
Would you like more beer?

615
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:08,580
I'd like that.

616
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,457
Why did your voice change?

617
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,376
-Are you with a man?
-Yes.

618
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:14,378
Where are you?

619
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,922
Who are you with?

620
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,216
Why should I tell you?

621
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:31,478
"I'd like that."

622
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,439
Annoying.

623
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,278
Thank you.

624
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:54,918
ONJU CITY

625
00:45:57,296 --> 00:46:00,215
CIVIL SERVANT (HAUNTED HOUSE)

626
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:10,726
I'm only eating with you
because you asked me so desperately.

627
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:11,810
Thank you so much.

628
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:13,687
I'm not eating alone thanks to you.

629
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,316
What's your name?

630
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,651
U-ram. Oh U-ram.

631
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,653
U-ram means big,

632
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,197
but you're so small.

633
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,866
Eat up. Enjoy.

634
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,079
GROOT

635
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,130
I won't get fooled again.

636
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,509
Just ignore it.

637
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,594
Yes, I'll ignore it.

638
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,304
But he'll call again.

639
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,805
But I won't answer it.

640
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,682
If I answer, he'll blame me for it.

641
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:58,565
He's not calling. That's new.

642
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,567
Call me all you want. I won't answer.

643
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,532
-How's the sandwich?
-Good.

644
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,325
By the way, Hong-jo.

645
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:11,828
You said you would ignore it,
but you're thinking about it a lot.

646
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:14,873
Am I? I'm not.

647
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,083
Yes, you are.

648
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,473
I didn't call to hear your voice.

649
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:34,560
I called to check
whether you would answer or not.

650
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:37,312
Don't read my texts.

651
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,772
Don't reply either.

652
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,108
It'll distract me from work.

653
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,877
I told you not to call.

654
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,714
NA-YEON

655
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,012
Hello?

656
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:11,221
Guess where I am.

657
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,098
Where are you?

658
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:15,809
At the City Hall lobby.
We have a renovation project.

659
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,645
It's not our City Hall, is it?

660
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:21,231
It's not our City Hall.

661
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:25,027
I won't be able to meet often
because of the construction.

662
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,653
Isn't this sad?

663
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:28,530
I need to hang up.

664
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,032
Hello.

665
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:41,585
Everyone's so excited in the lobby.

666
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:44,755
Some gorgeous woman is there.
I thought she was a celebrity.

667
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,716
Great timing.

668
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:49,676
We have a trial with Haum, right?

669
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,263
Print out every single report
from the Road Division regarding it.

670
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:54,931
Okay.

671
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:58,894
Wait. Seeing how she met
Construction Division's manager,

672
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,687
it's not a one-time visit.

673
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,564
I don't have time for this.

674
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,702
Hello.

675
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,245
I'm Kim Wook.

676
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,294
What brings you here?

677
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,673
You recognize me.

678
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:31,760
I can't forget your face
even if I'm drunk.

679
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:33,470
I even watched all your commercials.

680
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:36,098
They have the clips from 30 years ago?

681
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,307
Of course.

682
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,976
When you were young,
you were totally my type.

683
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:45,232
But did something happen?

684
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,151
Yes.

685
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:51,822
I want to get a divorce.

686
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:55,200
I see.

687
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,830
What made you
suddenly want to get a divorce?

688
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,751
You don't gain weight

689
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,754
overnight.

690
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,633
You gain it every day, bit by bit.

691
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:17,305
But one day, you suddenly realize

692
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,809
you've gained weight.

693
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:25,689
Is there a clear reason for a divorce?

694
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,983
Adultery or abuse, for example.

695
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,448
He won't go see stars with me.

696
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,159
Pardon?

697
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:55,302
Hey.

698
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:58,555
Did the CEO scold you? You look glum.

699
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,849
I saw a woman cry today.

700
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:03,602
I feel bad.

701
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:13,737
Hey. She said it was a secret.

702
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,781
Do you already know about it?

703
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:17,783
About what?

704
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:21,536
Nothing.

705
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,999
Why did you drink when you knew nothing?

706
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:28,877
This is whiskey, over 40% alcohol.

707
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:31,213
It's not bad.

708
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:34,800
What? Sin-yu, what's wrong with you?

709
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:38,261
You don't drink. What happened?

710
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:39,387
I'm in pain.

711
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:42,307
My mind and body work separately.

712
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,520
Can you

713
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,105
not perform at night?

714
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,650
I don't know what true love is.

715
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:54,194
It can happen when you're ill physically.

716
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:57,113
There's a real branded watch
and a knockoff watch.

717
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,826
I clearly know which one is a knockoff.

718
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:02,953
But I get confused.

719
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:04,955
"Is this really fake?"

720
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:06,790
"Could this be real?"

721
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:09,042
Just buy both. You can do that.

722
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,585
Do you even listen to me?

723
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,420
You don't listen to me either.

724
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,923
Stop talking nonsense

725
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:16,716
and take care of your mother.

726
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:20,262
The stars at night look nice these days.

727
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:22,722
Take her for stargazing and so on.

728
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:27,310
Let's go see the stars with me

729
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:31,273
I don't have time for that.

730
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:34,526
I'm overwhelmed
with just one person already.

731
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:39,489
What's wrong with you?

732
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:51,668
What's this?

733
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:57,257
"I had fun yesterday."

734
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:01,344
It must be from Mr. Kwon.

735
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:07,267
I HAD FUN YESTERDAY.

736
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:26,369
I dropped out of school.

737
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:28,872
I thought he would be very angry

738
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,917
when I told him
I would drop out of school.

739
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:36,338
"Do what you want."

740
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:41,301
"Since you're not going to school,
let's go on a trip."

741
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,511
He said that.

742
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,890
We went to a river and fished

743
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,059
and caught marsh snails.

744
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,395
We had so much fun.

745
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:58,443
Then two kids playing with a ball
next to us fell into the river.

746
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,822
Dad jumped in.

747
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:08,620
He saved the kids.

748
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,707
But he didn't come out.

749
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:19,172
He disappeared just like that.

750
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,259
I couldn't find him,

751
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:27,055
so I couldn't even hold a proper funeral.

752
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:35,397
If only I hadn't dropped out…

753
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:42,362
If only I'd stayed,
ignoring the whole bullying thing…

754
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:46,950
That wouldn't have happened then.

755
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,415
I killed my dad.

756
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:23,611
How pretty.

757
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:24,988
I'll show it off.

758
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,162
PHONE

759
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:36,624
He must've come to his senses.

760
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:37,751
He stopped calling.

761
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,503
How exciting.

762
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,381
I'm excited.

763
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,308
Sir, we've arrived.

764
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:29,094
GROOT

765
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:31,596
Is leaving them as unread too rude?

766
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,687
That startled me.

767
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,607
Who is it at this hour?

768
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,409
He's so bothersome.

769
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,036
What's wrong with him?

770
00:56:57,997 --> 00:56:59,833
Don't say anything and go.

771
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,584
I think I know what you'll say.

772
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:11,594
Don't get me wrong.

773
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:13,638
I didn't come here to see you.

774
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:16,015
I accidentally came here
because I'm drunk.

775
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,144
Did you drink?

776
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:28,027
You're not supposed to drink. You're sick.

777
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:30,196
You said you never drank in your life.

778
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,115
Why did you drink suddenly?

779
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:36,411
-Because you wouldn't answer my call.
-You told me not to answer it.

780
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:39,414
Yes.

781
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,292
Good job not answering it.

782
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,544
I didn't mean for you to answer.

783
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,172
Still, you could've read my texts.

784
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,425
No.

785
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,510
Good job not reading them.

786
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,849
Where's your driver?

787
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,768
You didn't come here alone, did you?

788
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:02,437
He left.

789
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:06,316
I asked him to go to my house,
but he dropped me off here.

790
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,612
I must've memorized your house address.

791
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:14,199
How much did you drink?

792
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:17,202
A lot.

793
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:23,875
I thought if I drank until I blacked out,
I would stop thinking about it.

794
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:30,632
Call the driver again
and wait in your car.

795
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:32,342
I'll go buy some hangover drinks.

796
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,093
Don't go.

797
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,225
Sin-yu.

798
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:44,103
Why are you here?

799
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,035
What's happening here?

800
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:03,581
Sin-yu.

801
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:05,833
What are you doing here?

802
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:09,254
I could ask you the same question,
Jae-gyeong.

803
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:10,755
I live here.

804
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:14,968
I moved in on the first floor.

805
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,472
Your destiny on the first floor
was Jae-gyeong?

806
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:24,060
Can you explain why he's here, Hong-jo?

807
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:25,770
She can't explain.

808
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:27,689
Am I wrong, Hong-jo?

809
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:31,734
Go home.

810
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:35,154
It's not appropriate
to visit a lady's house at night drunk.

811
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,197
I know that too.

812
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,324
But I couldn't help it.

813
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,784
I missed her.

814
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:41,035
Sin-yu.

815
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:45,039
What you're doing is called two-timing.

816
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:47,667
Is it?

817
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,504
But it's not completely my fault.

818
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,299
Strictly speaking, it's Hong-jo's fault.

819
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:57,343
She made me become like this.

820
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:03,308
What does he mean?

821
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:05,685
Well…

822
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,938
It's too complicated to explain.

823
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:15,987
Hong-jo.

824
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:21,075
I told you to meet a nice guy,
not a guy with a girlfriend.

825
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:25,121
Right.

826
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:26,831
Go in.

827
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:30,126
-Where do you live? I'll drive you home.
-I don't want that.

828
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,837
I want to be with Hong-jo.

829
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,549
Are you listening to yourself?
You have a girlfriend.

830
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,468
Don't worry so much.

831
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,429
Because these feelings aren't real.

832
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,265
Since this isn't real,

833
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:46,851
all the more reason
for you to take responsibility.

834
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,689
Get in. I'll drive you home.

835
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,663
I'll drive him home. Go in.

836
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,832
No. I'll handle this.

837
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:13,336
Actually, a big part of this is my fault.

838
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:54,210
You two must've had fun
after turning me into this mess.

839
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:57,380
I'm your inseverable destiny,

840
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,632
but you want to be
destined with him, right?

841
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:04,053
In the end, you wanted me
to work hard for your sake.

842
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:06,264
To go against your destiny.

843
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:11,144
What's wrong with trying our best
to find our own paths?

844
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:15,064
Your feelings for me aren't true either.

845
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:31,622
Hong-jo.

846
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:33,583
Stop the car.

847
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:36,586
I feel a bit sick.

848
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:44,677
What about Jae-gyeong do you like so much?

849
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:56,189
I think he and I are similar.

850
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:57,607
You're not similar at all.

851
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,525
Jae-gyeong's a perfectionist.

852
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,569
You're clumsy.

853
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:03,988
Mr. Kwon's clumsy too.

854
01:03:04,071 --> 01:03:06,282
I'm clumsy too.

855
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:08,951
It's a different kind of clumsy.

856
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:13,331
Mr. Kwon looks perfect on the outside,

857
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,583
but he's missing something.

858
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,338
Can't you see what I'm missing?

859
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,851
Are you free at night on the 19th?

860
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:37,939
I won't go out.

861
01:03:38,689 --> 01:03:40,149
Going out at night is dangerous.

862
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,945
-A full moon will rise that night.
-So what?

863
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:49,408
There's the Disaster Nullification Spell.

864
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:57,166
That spell can only be cast
on a full-moon night.

865
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:00,586
The 19th is a full-moon night.

866
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:04,924
I'll try the Disaster Nullification Spell
that night.

867
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:10,388
Are you saying I'm a disaster?

868
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:18,229
You hate the fact that you like me.

869
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:21,774
I don't want you doing this either.

870
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:24,986
Let me ask you one thing.

871
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:31,576
During this whole time,

872
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:34,579
you've never had feelings for me?

873
01:04:45,506 --> 01:04:46,507
No.

874
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:51,888
Why are you blushing?

875
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:57,184
I told you I blush when I'm angry too.

876
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:59,687
-That's a lie.
-It isn't.

877
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:05,818
I didn't know until now
because I never drank before.

878
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:11,240
But now I know
what my habit is when I'm drunk.

879
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,871
What's your habit?

880
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:23,878
If someone's next to me…

881
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:27,882
I want to kiss them.

882
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:42,707
DESTINED WITH YOU

883
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:46,961
What does a man normally do
when he blacks out?

884
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:49,505
You must not remember anything.

885
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:52,383
I can officially introduce you.
He's my fiance.

886
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:54,760
Did something happen
between you and Sin-yu?

887
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,387
I couldn't sleep. I was concerned.

888
01:06:56,470 --> 01:07:00,016
All these issues will be resolved
when the full moon rises.

889
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:03,144
Honestly, don't you think it's a waste
to use a spell on this?

890
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:04,770
Those feelings will disappear.

891
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:05,896
No, it isn't.

892
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:08,816
It's… love.

893
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:15,489
