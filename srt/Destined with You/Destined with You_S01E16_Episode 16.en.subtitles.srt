1
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,966
DESTINED WITH YOU

2
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,678
FINAL EPISODE

3
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,002
Sam-sik confessed everything.

4
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,339
You told him to drug me and knock me out.

5
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,466
So,

6
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,468
I didn't drink that drink.

7
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,888
You should've reported it right away.

8
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,433
Why did you come with me?

9
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,479
Because I had to catch you.

10
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,859
You're brave.

11
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,986
Sam-sik called the police.

12
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:35,572
The police should be on their way now.

13
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,867
It's over for you.

14
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,663
It won't be over.

15
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,125
I…

16
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,383
I will be with you forever.

17
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,314
You…

18
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,775
will marry me…

19
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,779
and we'll go together.

20
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,785
Go where?

21
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:24,996
To the next life.

22
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,751
Like I want to be with you?

23
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,713
You shouldn't have played around
with another guy.

24
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,883
Stop stalling for time
and get changed already.

25
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,760
Okay.

26
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,178
I will.

27
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,764
But first,

28
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,226
I need some privacy.

29
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,687
I know what you're planning.

30
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,608
Just change in front of me!

31
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,156
Change right now.

32
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,911
You wanted to marry me.

33
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,497
What kind of man
treats his bride like this?

34
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,090
Then…

35
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,885
I'll help you

36
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,138
get changed into the dress.

37
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,199
You…

38
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,451
You are insane.

39
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,624
Where is Hong-jo?

40
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,126
Is she safe?

41
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,628
We were too late.

42
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,939
This must be Na Jung-beom's hideout.

43
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,608
That was why it was hard to trace him.

44
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,117
It can't be

45
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,453
that place.

46
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,581
Follow me, you two.

47
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,181
Why did you have to resist?

48
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,642
It would've been nice
if you'd stayed obediently.

49
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,441
Until the moon rises…

50
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,863
let's wait for a while.

51
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,305
Don't waste your energy.

52
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,685
We'll do a soul marriage.

53
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,856
If we tie our souls with a red string,

54
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,193
we can be together in our next life.

55
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,197
The time has come.

56
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,075
The full moon has risen.

57
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,162
Don't be scared.

58
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,582
I won't send you alone.

59
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,250
After I send you,

60
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,711
I'll follow you too.

61
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,800
Drink it.

62
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,257
Let's run away.

63
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,219
It doesn't matter where.

64
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,806
Anywhere's fine.

65
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,481
If… there is a next life…

66
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,610
let us…

67
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,989
be happy.

68
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,121
I feel

69
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,332
strange.

70
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,668
Somehow,

71
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,504
it feels like

72
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,091
I've been caring about you
for a very long time.

73
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,055
In this life…

74
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,018
and in the past life…

75
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,189
I love you.

76
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,253
Na Jung-beom, stop!

77
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,306
Let me go!

78
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,102
Na Jung-beom, you're under arrest.

79
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,645
You have the right to remain…

80
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,786
Hong-jo.

81
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:46,849
Hong-jo.

82
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,561
Hong-jo.

83
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,358
Hong-jo, open your eyes.

84
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,404
Hong-jo, open your eyes.

85
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,034
Hong-jo, wake up.

86
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,454
Hong-jo.

87
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,957
Hong-jo, wake up.

88
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,378
Oh, my gosh. Hong-jo.

89
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,467
Wake up.

90
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,681
Wake up.

91
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,488
When was she poisoned?

92
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,989
About 40 minutes ago.

93
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,033
Make way!

94
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,536
Make way!

95
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,829
-Sir, you can't go in.
-No.

96
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,122
-Sir.
-I must go.

97
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,332
Please leave.

98
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,830
Okay.

99
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,123
Let's start over.

100
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:36,667
Sam-sik confessed

101
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,837
that he provided a fake alibi
for you five years ago.

102
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,089
Why did you kill your wife?

103
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,721
That bitch kept smiling

104
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,642
at some other guy.

105
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,272
Is it the same reason for Hong-jo?

106
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:02,234
Did you get angry
because she dated another guy?

107
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,820
Damn it.

108
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,406
I was going to do a soul marriage.

109
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,034
Did she die?

110
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,456
Did she die?

111
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,595
Lee Hong-jo's guardian?

112
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,305
Yes.

113
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,640
Please come in.

114
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:17,578
That freak who stabbed Sin-yu
tried to kill you as well?

115
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,996
He's caught, right?

116
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,165
That freak must be punished.

117
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,044
Watch your language.

118
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:28,213
I would say worse things,
but I shouldn't waste my energy on him.

119
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,383
So, my dear Hong-jo,

120
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,427
are you okay now?

121
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,012
Yes.

122
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,890
I felt a bit nauseous,

123
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,516
but I got better after an IV.

124
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,436
Get well soon

125
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:44,938
and go on a date with Sin-yu.

126
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,399
Since that freak is caught,

127
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,109
you can relax and go on dates.

128
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,071
Honey. I didn't approve of it yet.

129
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:56,909
She's lying down in the hospital
and how can you say such a harsh thing?

130
00:17:56,992 --> 00:18:00,037
I'm here out of sympathy,
not to allow their relationship.

131
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,415
I haven't warmed up to her yet.

132
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,792
Frankly speaking,

133
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,294
your life is too eventful.

134
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:10,214
I want Sin-yu to meet a girl

135
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,841
born and raised in a peaceful environment,

136
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,676
date her without any trouble,

137
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,678
and get married without any trouble.

138
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,930
-Father.
-I promise

139
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:21,100
I won't let anything happen from now on.

140
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:25,646
It's true that I wasn't born and raised
in a peaceful environment,

141
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,898
but I'm sure I'm the person

142
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,275
who loves him the most in the world

143
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,277
besides you two.

144
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,571
So,

145
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,242
can you see me in a good light?

146
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:42,955
I'm…

147
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,917
sorry to say this
when you're going through this--

148
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,418
I have something to tell you.

149
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,795
Nothing can change my mind.

150
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,588
It's obvious what you'll say.

151
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,298
Didn't Eun-wol call you?

152
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,092
What call?

153
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,138
It's a girl.

154
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,100
What?

155
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,606
Was that the strange thing

156
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,233
that Eun-wol said?

157
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,861
Yes.

158
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,406
She had a conception dream
where she picked a peach.

159
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:23,328
Am I really becoming a grandmother now?

160
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:28,584
You've always nagged him
to knock a girl up before getting married.

161
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,627
Your wish came true.

162
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,422
I said that so he would get married early.

163
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,799
I didn't actually mean that.

164
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,051
Why did you guys have to rush it?

165
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,471
You guys are strange.

166
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,850
After dating a strange girl,
even Sin-yu became strange.

167
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,519
He wasn't like this before.
What will you do?

168
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,355
What are you going to do about him?

169
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,066
I'll take full responsibility.

170
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,568
Of course you should.

171
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,653
What the…

172
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,698
That's not what I meant.

173
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,539
You should eat.

174
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,796
I don't want to get up.

175
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,341
You didn't eat anything today.

176
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,267
A kiss is for dessert.

177
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,644
You can get it only after you eat.

178
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,988
It smells so great.

179
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,909
Struggling with the octopus, I thought,

180
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,203
"The power of love is incredible."

181
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,789
"There's nothing I can't do
for someone I love."

182
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:33,542
And this food
is the result of that epiphany.

183
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,003
Chicken stew with fresh octopus,
the stamina booster,

184
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,964
wild pine mushroom,
abalone, and wild ginseng.

185
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:43,468
You added wild pine mushroom
and wild ginseng?

186
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,304
I put in everything that's good.

187
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,478
It's delicious.

188
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,815
I've just never tried it before,

189
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,775
but there's nothing I can't do.

190
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,569
What kind of man am I?

191
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,238
You used all the good ingredients.

192
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,823
Of course it tastes good.

193
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,867
Good ingredients don't guarantee that.

194
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,493
You've tried my mom's food.

195
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,786
Cooking is a talent too.

196
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,335
If you take on Bawoo's lawsuit,

197
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,046
does it mean you can't work in City Hall?

198
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:20,922
Yes.

199
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,675
I can't do it
if I'm contracted as City Hall's lawyer.

200
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,097
Does it mean we can't
see each other every day like this?

201
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,892
If you stay here, we can.

202
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,352
How can I do that?

203
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,938
What do you mean how? I won't let you go.

204
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:40,150
Not until your father approves.

205
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,777
I'll get Father's permission.

206
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,778
Eat first.

207
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,363
I want to do so many things with you,

208
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,865
but not in that condition.

209
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,993
What is it that you want to do?

210
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,632
You said a kiss was for dessert.

211
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,759
You did have a bite.

212
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:16,436
What brings you here?

213
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,815
I forgot something when I packed.

214
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:21,650
What is it?

215
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,361
Can I come in and look for it?

216
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:26,655
Be quick.

217
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,079
By the way,

218
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,207
was my proposal that horrible?

219
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,128
I've never felt
more embarrassed in my life before.

220
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,923
Gong, I can't go
to City Hall because of you.

221
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,216
Find it quickly and go.

222
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,260
What did you leave behind?

223
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,016
My love for you.

224
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:56,893
Hey!

225
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,566
Hey!

226
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,323
You shouldn't push a kid so hard.

227
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,409
It's a dog-eat-dog world, kiddo.

228
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,411
Do it again.

229
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,246
The result will be the same though.

230
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,873
I can beat you.

231
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,380
When I created his alibi five years ago,

232
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:28,425
I didn't know he was such a terrible man.

233
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,011
I really thought

234
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:34,347
she cheated on him and left the house.

235
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,893
After the corpse was found in the park,

236
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,395
I considered

237
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,439
turning myself in.

238
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:47,527
But I couldn't leave U-ram alone.

239
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,488
I'm so sorry, Ms. Lee.

240
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,699
It's all my fault.

241
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,496
You were threatened by him as well.

242
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,958
You told me everything before it happened.

243
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,545
Moreover, if I hadn't been the bait,

244
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,298
he would've come back to kill me anytime.

245
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,176
He's caught. That's what matters.

246
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,596
If I end up in jail,

247
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:20,185
U-ram will need to go to a shelter.

248
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,157
-Let's go.
-U-ram.

249
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,201
I gave you a good life lesson.

250
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,620
You little devil.

251
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,210
You were pretty bad too.

252
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,005
You pestered your father
to change the development business.

253
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,383
Mayor's daughter

254
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,095
made the mayor change
that big development business?

255
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,806
And she was a bully in high school.

256
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,268
Gosh, look at her throwing wine on her.

257
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,435
Isn't that Hong-jo?

258
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,020
Poor her.

259
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:07,315
I hope karma is coming for these guys.

260
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,235
These scums.
I would've chewed them into pieces.

261
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,362
You know I have a lot of teeth, right?

262
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:13,738
I know.

263
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,285
You're here.

264
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,580
What's going on?

265
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,500
Hong-jo, you went through a lot.

266
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,002
Sorry?

267
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,337
Lunch is on me today.

268
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,548
What do you want to eat?

269
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,273
You were pretty bad too.

270
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,693
You pestered your father
to change the development business,

271
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,739
just like how you avoided
punishment in high school.

272
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,574
You really never change.

273
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,329
JI MIN-HO

274
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,293
This is Hong-jo.

275
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,922
You're the one
who posted the video, right?

276
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:14,966
Yes.

277
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,847
…just like how you avoided
punishment in high school.

278
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:22,766
You really never change.

279
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,769
I thought that was all I can do

280
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,355
to apologize to you.

281
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:32,734
It would've been better
if you had revealed it in high school.

282
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,320
I won't thank you.

283
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:37,864
Take care.

284
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,708
RESIGNATION LETTER

285
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,547
No. You can't resign.

286
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,550
You pressured me to resign until recently.

287
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,969
You'll clearly
go against us after you resign.

288
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,388
I won't let it happen!

289
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,391
Article Seven of Labor Standards Act.

290
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,893
"Forced labor is abolished."

291
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:10,688
It's fine by law if I stop coming
to work starting tomorrow.

292
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:14,567
But I'll give you one month
to find my replacement.

293
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,027
As a courtesy.

294
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,575
Hey, stop there!

295
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,746
I don't think you have time
to be worked up about me.

296
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,124
You have your daughter's issue.

297
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:30,750
What?

298
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,807
FATHER

299
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:49,644
DECLINE

300
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,535
You changed the door password.

301
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:07,787
I got rid of the place.

302
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,540
-Didn't I tell you?
-Why?

303
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,460
I didn't think I would need
to meet you there anymore.

304
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:16,713
That's true.

305
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,466
We don't need to meet secretly anymore.

306
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,426
Both you and I are single.

307
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:23,928
Come to think of it,

308
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,514
I think I click better
with you than Sin-yu.

309
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,772
True, we clicked both day and night.

310
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,231
How about marriage?

311
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,282
Na-yeon.

312
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,161
I was interested in you

313
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,789
because you were Sin-yu's.

314
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,957
But you were dumped by him, right?

315
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,586
And I'm considered a leader
in our society in a way,

316
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,715
so getting married
to a former bully wouldn't look good.

317
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,931
Goodness, you haven't seen it yet.

318
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,266
You better check it quickly.

319
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,526
JI MIN-HO

320
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:26,074
The person you have called
is not answering. After the tone…

321
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,535
What an asshole!

322
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,250
FATHER

323
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,963
Stop calling me! I know it too!

324
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,756
I'm going crazy too!

325
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,557
I need to go home today.

326
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,600
I need to do the laundry

327
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,185
and clean the house.

328
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,979
What should I do?

329
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,897
I can't sleep alone now.

330
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,943
Then come to my place
once you're done with your work.

331
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,238
Okay.

332
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,156
How do I wait until then?

333
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,409
I miss you whenever I blink.

334
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,498
One, two, three…

335
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,127
Nine, ten, eleven…

336
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,463
Look outside the window.

337
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,548
Outside the window?

338
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:37,979
I love you.

339
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:40,940
Me too.

340
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,075
Stop now.

341
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,914
Working overtime before quitting?

342
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,458
There's a lot to do before I resign.

343
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,336
Don't mind me. I'm taking care of it.

344
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,715
I have something to do as well.

345
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,009
If I get sued,

346
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,471
you might become my lawyer.

347
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:26,653
It was you, right?

348
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,112
You made Min-ho post it.

349
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,783
You guys went there on purpose
to rile me up and took the video

350
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,952
to take revenge on me the same way.

351
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,121
I did want to take revenge the same way.

352
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,748
But I couldn't.

353
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,708
And Min-ho did it for me.

354
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,210
It was so satisfying.

355
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:45,046
Why do you always have to get in my way?

356
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:48,341
I never got in your way.
You made things worse for yourself.

357
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:51,260
-You took away my boyfriend.
-Believe it or not,

358
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,179
but we were destined to be.

359
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:55,098
We were destined to meet.

360
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,642
That's bullshit.

361
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,854
Sin-yu's calling.

362
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,732
Do you want to leave now

363
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,402
or listen to how lovey-dovey we are?

364
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,362
You bitch…

365
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,531
Do you want another video?

366
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,449
There's a CCTV here.

367
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,164
I told you.

368
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,501
Someone like you can never understand.

369
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,212
This is not fair.

370
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,756
Why must I lose what's mine

371
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,010
to someone who's a nobody like you?

372
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:38,850
Yoon Na-yeon.

373
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,935
We're from Violent Crime Squad.

374
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,730
You're under arrest
for aiding and abetting Na's escape.

375
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:46,733
You have the right to remain silent
and the right to an attorney.

376
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:50,111
Everything you say from now
can be held against you in court.

377
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,613
Was it you who helped Na Jung-beom?

378
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,366
No. I didn't know anything.

379
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,285
I really didn't know anything.

380
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,786
-Let's go.
-I don't know--

381
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,997
You can explain at the station.

382
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,998
I didn't know…

383
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,293
I didn't know anything!

384
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,503
Did you give him five billion won?

385
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:22,143
This morning, the prosecution indicted
Mayor Yoon of Onju City Hall

386
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,228
and Lee, the CEO of Haum Construction

387
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,273
regarding Mount Onju's
development business.

388
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,531
How much did you get in return

389
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,284
for changing the ownership
of Jang's land that Onju received

390
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,244
and giving it to Haum?

391
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,038
I received 300 million won.

392
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:45,124
But I reported it to the Audit Team
and sent them the money.

393
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,210
Why did you side with the mayor,

394
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,545
then suddenly change your mind?

395
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,090
I never changed my mind.

396
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,634
I never wanted to join them to begin with.

397
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:58,179
Then why did you accept the money?

398
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,140
If I hadn't, I wouldn't have
been able to blow the whistle.

399
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,726
So were you planning this from the start?

400
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,978
"If they abide by the law, that's good."

401
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,855
"If they don't, I won't sit back."

402
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,440
That was what I thought.

403
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:10,858
Your Honor.

404
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,111
The tenth evidence.

405
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:16,030
If you check the recording
of the conversation

406
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,448
between Kwon and Lee

407
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,076
and check his actions
before and after the crime,

408
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,830
you can clearly see
that the defendant is speaking the truth.

409
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,623
Therefore, defendant Kwon

410
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:29,585
is not guilty of bribery
nor did he request for one.

411
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,639
I told him not to come to the cafeteria.

412
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:46,727
Are you not eating together
because you fought after the proposal?

413
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:51,482
How did he injure his arm?

414
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,400
I know.

415
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,443
He got drunk and tripped on his foot.

416
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,281
Poor Mr. Gong.

417
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:01,367
He proposed publicly,
got dumped publicly, and even got hurt.

418
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,203
He's so embarrassed

419
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,789
that he requested
a transfer to a district office.

420
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,794
Go ahead and eat by yourselves.

421
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,259
Darn it.

422
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:25,391
I didn't want to come here either.

423
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,811
I had no choice because of the injury.

424
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,902
Just eat the rice and soup.

425
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,487
Why did you bring
perilla leaves to torture yourself?

426
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:41,449
I go crazy over perilla leaves.

427
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,377
Go ahead, eat the perilla leaves.

428
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,798
Helping me pick up the perilla leaves

429
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,884
means we should get married.

430
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,471
Stop your nonsense and eat.

431
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,439
I'm moving out.

432
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,316
I'm going to go to the Blue House.

433
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,071
Are you going into politics?

434
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:24,367
I was sued for whistleblowing,
but I was released thanks to Sin-yu.

435
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,953
And now so many politicians
want to recruit me.

436
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:32,416
Actually, I thought of staying
if he gave me more money,

437
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,211
but it was too little.

438
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,755
How much would've been enough
not to whistleblow?

439
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,174
Free sandwiches for a lifetime?

440
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,385
Come on.

441
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,263
I mean it. It's delicious.

442
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:52,395
Then what happens
to Mount Onju's development now?

443
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:55,690
It went back to being Sin-yu's,
so he'll take care of it.

444
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,361
You look cool, do you know that?

445
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,781
Not everyone can whistleblow.

446
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:06,909
Not just cool.

447
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,288
I must look very cool.

448
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,466
Can I order one more?

449
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:25,136
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

450
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:28,014
This place's chicken is so good
every time we come.

451
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,932
Chicken's always good.

452
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,475
Stop getting sidetracked.

453
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,771
Mr. Gong's proposal.

454
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,649
Will you accept it?

455
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,238
City Hall is turned upside down.

456
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,991
Mayor is about to be arrested.
It's not a good time.

457
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:50,369
What has the mayor getting arrested
got to do with our marriage?

458
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,287
Exactly.

459
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,708
Marriage is a form of arrest too.

460
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,085
Getting arrested once was enough.

461
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,463
I don't want to be arrested twice.

462
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:03,883
Let's just live together.
How many times must I say this?

463
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:05,634
Ma.

464
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,429
What we're doing
is a beautiful form of arrest.

465
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,681
It's so beautiful
that there's even a song about it.

466
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,436
You must hurry to get married this year.

467
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,398
My friend told me
it's so hard to book a wedding venue.

468
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,858
-That's right.
-Yes.

469
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:22,693
Don't worry about that.

470
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,488
I'm the manager
of Greenway Building Division.

471
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:29,867
Are you going to get married in a park?

472
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,081
I'm not getting married.

473
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,758
WEDDING DAY
GONG SEO-GU AND MA EUN-YEONG

474
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,941
Smile naturally!

475
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,825
Bride and groom, bow to the guests.

476
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,418
Mic test.

477
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,086
Hello.

478
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,214
"I, Ma Eun-yeong,

479
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:28,175
take Gong Seo-gu
as my husband as of today."

480
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:32,930
"Others say they will live happily
until their black hair turns white,

481
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,517
but our hair's already white
if we don't dye it,

482
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,979
so we'll live happily
until we lose our white hair

483
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,647
and become bald."

484
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,526
Hello.

485
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,903
"I, Gong Seo-gu,

486
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:51,365
am Ma Eun-yeong's husband as of today."

487
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,869
Today is the happiest day of my life.

488
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,372
I'll become happier every day,

489
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:02,501
so I'll make Eun-yeong happy
every day too.

490
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,545
I love you, Eun-yeong!

491
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:13,220
Next is the song of congratulation.

492
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,516
Hello. We are Onju's Three Star…

493
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,435
-Crystal!
-Crystal!

494
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,148
The song we'll be singing today

495
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,900
is called "It's Real."

496
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,651
Whenever you hear "it's real,"

497
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,612
if you're here alone,

498
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,322
make a heart on your head.

499
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:33,073
If you're here with someone…

500
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,743
-Heart.
-Make a heart together.

501
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,662
-Then we'll start singing "It's Real."
-We'll start!

502
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,806
Real, real, real, real, it's real

503
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,433
Heart!

504
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,893
It's real

505
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,478
Heart!

506
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:06,482
The real thing has appeared now

507
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,903
Real, real, real, real, it's real

508
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,154
Heart!

509
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,865
It's real

510
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:19,745
I'm going to make real love

511
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,710
Now's the time to throw the bouquet.

512
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,337
Who will catch it?

513
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,256
Me.

514
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,787
Bride and groom, march.

515
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:43,162
Mr. Kwon is moving out.

516
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:48,042
I know. But under
these pretty cherry blossoms,

517
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,294
do you have to talk about Jae-gyeong?

518
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:54,923
Are you jealous?

519
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,677
I'll be jealous of every man
that you see and speak of.

520
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:02,222
Idol singers, actors,
the guy downstairs, the guy next door,

521
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,100
and City Hall employees.
Everyone except me.

522
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,062
I like you being jealous.

523
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,482
I'm not joking.

524
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,153
The person moving in downstairs

525
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,155
is very important to me.

526
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,201
As long as it's not a single man.

527
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,411
I don't want that either.

528
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,831
I hope the landlady moves back in.

529
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,795
Right, what did your doctor say?

530
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,173
I got better.

531
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,634
Completely healed like a miracle.

532
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,135
Really?

533
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,180
Of course. The curse ended.

534
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:49,103
Others wouldn't believe us, right?

535
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,440
Some might, like we did.

536
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,535
Wait here for a while.

537
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,995
Why? Where are you going?

538
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:08,891
Let's go.

539
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:21,862
Wait.

540
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,990
There are two of us.
Why is there one cotton candy?

541
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:51,391
You've changed a lot
after dating a decent girl.

542
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,603
Aren't you the one who changed a lot?

543
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,063
Your skin got better.

544
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,942
You were always exhausted
and had huge eye bags.

545
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,612
Can you tell?
I spent a lot on dermatology.

546
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,325
I'm going to quit this law firm soon.

547
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,035
Where will you go?

548
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:11,745
A filming site.

549
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:15,499
I'll be filming
the same drama as your mother.

550
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:17,709
You only live once.

551
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:22,214
True happiness is
doing what you truly want.

552
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,138
It's so nice.

553
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,557
I'm a lawyer.

554
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,017
If you were treated unfairly,
I'll defend you.

555
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:35,894
You can tell me.

556
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,325
Cut!

557
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:53,620
-Moving on.
-Great!

558
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:54,538
That was great.

559
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:56,415
Both of you did great.

560
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,625
-Thank you.
-Good job.

561
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,168
I'm so nervous.

562
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,086
I need sugar.

563
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,839
Fan of yours sent a coffee truck.

564
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,382
You should go get some snacks.

565
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:07,884
A fan of mine?

566
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:11,638
YOU CANNOT STOP THE LOVE!

567
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,936
I wonder who sent this?

568
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:20,564
It can't be…

569
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:21,898
Is it you?

570
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:23,692
It wasn't me.

571
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,235
Then is it Sin-yu?

572
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:28,280
Nobody else would
send me something like this.

573
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:31,116
It's me.

574
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:33,994
What brings you here?

575
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,078
Well…

576
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:39,082
I wanted to support you,
but I had no other way.

577
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,209
What else besides money do I have?

578
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:45,714
I'm going to be in charge
of this drama's coffee truck from now on.

579
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:47,924
Unbelievable.

580
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:00,228
You know this is a serious crime, right?

581
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:05,359
Because you gave him
the fake alibi back then,

582
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,278
he was removed
from the prime suspects list.

583
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:11,698
You caused confusion in the investigation
and made us miss the criminal.

584
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,117
Do you know how serious
of a crime that is?

585
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,120
I'm sorry.

586
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:19,331
He begged crying his eyes out.

587
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:24,086
This time as well, you pretty much
helped Jung-beom abduct Hong-jo.

588
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,713
Hong-jo got hurt because of that.

589
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,758
Strictly speaking, you are an accomplice.

590
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:31,385
Accomplice for confinement.

591
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:34,971
Come in.

592
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,144
Mr. Jang.

593
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,191
I will join in as Oh Sam-sik's lawyer.

594
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:51,655
Mr. Jang.

595
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:04,251
Don't worry too much
about who might move in.

596
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:08,380
Even when I moved in,
the owner was very strict.

597
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:12,884
Thank you for whistleblowing.

598
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,971
I'm sure it helped Sin-yu a lot.

599
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:19,182
I didn't do it for Sin-yu.

600
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:21,309
I did it for myself.

601
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,937
I was looking at the big picture.

602
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,524
"When should I use
the Ace of Swords card?"

603
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,901
You're an ambitious person.

604
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,113
Did Sin-yu propose to you?

605
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:35,407
No, not yet.

606
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:40,662
You'll live alone if you don't get married
in six months after getting the bouquet.

607
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,915
If Sin-yu doesn't propose
within six months,

608
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:44,833
give me a call.

609
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:50,881
I regretted every time I saw you.

610
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:54,509
Why didn't I accept
your confession back then?

611
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:57,095
They say love is about timing.

612
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,473
I guess they're right.

613
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:05,479
Love is the collaboration
of timing and destiny.

614
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:09,232
Do you still believe in
the past life and spells?

615
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,400
No.

616
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:13,320
I don't believe in them. I just know them.

617
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:15,489
You're cool.

618
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,407
I envy you too.

619
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:23,914
The collaboration of timing and destiny
will come to you too, Mr. Kwon.

620
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,916
You promised not to call me Mr. Kwon.

621
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,251
Right. To you too, Jae-gyeong.

622
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:31,213
-We'll get going.
-Okay.

623
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,596
I'll get going.

624
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:41,723
All right.

625
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,099
Have a safe trip.

626
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:56,947
It's raspberry juice.

627
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,742
Are you sure you can
handle me after I drink this?

628
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:04,454
My friend keeps sending them
because she runs a farm.

629
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,124
Can we try some of that
raspberry juice?

630
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,835
We'd like to have some too.

631
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,212
Yes, we'd love some.

632
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,505
-I'd like some.
-Me too.

633
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:15,757
Why would you want to drink this?

634
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:18,760
-What do you need it for?
-You guys must have a use for it.

635
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:22,764
Guys, let's go grab coffee.

636
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:24,641
-Okay.
-Okay.

637
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,529
I chose the date
for my housewarming party.

638
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:39,656
You haven't even moved.

639
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:42,242
You wanted to have one again last time.

640
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,119
That was when Mr. Kwon was there.

641
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,871
He's moved out now.

642
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:49,124
I knew it. You wanted to have one

643
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:51,960
because of Mr. Kwon, not because of me.

644
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:55,213
Let's see who moves in and then decide.

645
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:58,717
I hope a cool guy moves in again.

646
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,095
It's hard for a single man
to move into a house like that.

647
00:53:02,178 --> 00:53:04,347
It definitely will be a family of four.

648
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:09,227
Even if it's a family of four,
let's have a housewarming party.

649
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:12,230
I want to get close with you guys. Please?

650
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,444
I still do get jealous when I look at you,

651
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,195
but you're too cute.

652
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,699
Fine, let's do it.

653
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:24,868
Under one condition.

654
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,872
Invite Mr. Jang's friends
and make it a triple date.

655
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:29,956
How does it sound?

656
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,084
Okay.

657
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:35,837
Fine then. You'll choose the time, right?

658
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,924
But I want the guys
to be taller than 180 cm

659
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,176
and look slightly more mature than I am.

660
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,761
MY BELOVED GROOT

661
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,765
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached. Please leave…

662
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,517
Why hasn't he been
picking up the whole day?

663
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:53,480
What's going on?

664
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:57,025
I'm worried,
so call me when you read the text.

665
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,127
Don't be obsessed with him.

666
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,505
He has his privacy too.

667
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:21,383
Let's clean up.

668
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,011
What privacy?

669
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,721
He must report everything 24/7.

670
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,435
MY BELOVED GROOT

671
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:38,233
Where are you?
Do you know how worried I was?

672
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,610
Come down to the first floor.

673
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:44,948
You should've called beforehand.

674
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:03,049
I know who you are.

675
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,262
You didn't even answer my calls.

676
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,931
I wanted to surprise you.

677
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:12,350
Surprise me with what? Your face?

678
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:16,479
That would be boring,
so I prepared something else.

679
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:19,858
I moved to a new place.

680
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:25,196
Did you move to Seoul?

681
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:29,951
I told you to come down
to the first floor, not to come outside.

682
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:44,090
You really moved in.

683
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:47,844
I've always wanted to be
the guy living downstairs from you.

684
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:49,846
Now you're the girl upstairs from me.

685
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:51,723
I bought this house.

686
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:55,018
I couldn't wait to live with you.

687
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,395
You sure are rich.

688
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,439
You spend money like it grows on trees.

689
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,066
You feel distant.

690
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,402
So do you not like it?

691
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:06,696
No. I'm excited.

692
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:10,700
You used your money so wisely.

693
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,369
You shouldn't do this.

694
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,497
I didn't even get to unpack.

695
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,959
I haven't put on the mattress cover yet.

696
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:24,839
You called me to make me work.

697
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:29,052
It's hard to do this on my own.

698
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,018
You didn't call me for that.

699
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:38,603
That's not it.

700
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:40,396
I really called you for this.

701
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,525
-Put on the mattress cover.
-You didn't call me for that.

702
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:45,693
Put on the mattress cover.

703
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:06,965
Slowly.

704
00:57:07,465 --> 00:57:08,466
Be careful.

705
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,009
Watch out.

706
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,095
You don't need to do this.

707
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:13,263
Don't be so dramatic.

708
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,142
Hello.

709
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:18,977
Welcome.

710
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:24,607
Try it.

711
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:28,528
It's the first decent dish
that we've ever cooked together.

712
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:31,739
We went grocery shopping
in the morning and cooked with care.

713
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:51,968
It sure is

714
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,971
full of care.

715
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:58,475
Did it taste good to you guys?

716
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,895
Did you not taste it while cooking?

717
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,440
It tasted fine to us.

718
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:06,941
Why?

719
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,196
-It seems fine.
-Exactly.

720
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:15,575
It's okay, it tastes good to us.

721
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,660
Yes, I think so too.

722
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:21,039
You're a match made in heaven
down to your taste.

723
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:22,957
Speaking of which,

724
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,085
-I checked your wedding date--
-Eun-wol.

725
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,213
I'm not ready yet.

726
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:30,048
You don't need to prepare anything.

727
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,633
It's just living together.

728
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:32,717
Well, actually,

729
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:35,053
you're already living together.

730
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:37,347
Father, I'm not ready yet either.

731
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:40,308
You don't have time for this,
you already have a girl.

732
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:41,726
Your belly will bulge soon.

733
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:43,311
I don't believe in you.

734
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:47,148
You said something strange last time
and made us grow apart.

735
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,400
And about what you
called for the other day,

736
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:51,528
that wasn't about us.

737
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,158
It has to be.

738
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,077
Well…

739
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:00,578
Actually,

740
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:03,164
it's me.

741
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:05,166
A late child.

742
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,210
Well,

743
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:09,295
the conception dream

744
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:11,506
was about us.

745
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:13,174
A daughter.

746
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:20,306
Sin-yu's sister will be so pretty.

747
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,725
Congratulations, Mother and Father.

748
00:59:23,768 --> 00:59:25,061
See, Eun-wol?

749
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:27,605
You were wrong again.

750
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:32,860
Eat up, everyone.

751
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:49,794
I love you.

752
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,463
I love you more.

753
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,925
I've loved you for more than 300 years.

754
00:59:58,886 --> 00:59:59,887
Well…

755
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:04,392
There was something I've wanted
to say since 300 years ago.

756
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:14,736
Father.

757
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:18,072
Can I

758
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:20,992
take her with me?

759
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:37,550
Let us…

760
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:42,680
get married.

761
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:04,429
Sin-yu, there's really
nothing you can't do.

762
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:06,097
You're good at shoveling.

763
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,349
Are you teasing me?

764
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:45,970
We should bury this, right?

765
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:51,809
Thanks to the wooden box,
I got to meet you again,

766
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,770
so I want to keep it forever.

767
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:01,903
But we achieved everything that we wanted.

768
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:13,915
Thank you.

769
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:17,960
Thank you.

770
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,716
DESTINED WITH YOU

771
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:43,045
SPELLS OF THE HEAVENS
