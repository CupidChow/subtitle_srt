1
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,966
DESTINED WITH YOU

2
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:17,911
Once you disappear,

3
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,621
everything will be all right.

4
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,819
You better leave now.

5
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,073
I called the cops.

6
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,421
EPISODE 14

7
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,927
Sin-yu?

8
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,020
Sin-yu.

9
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:16,070
Sin-yu.

10
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,741
Sin-yu.

11
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,120
Sin-yu, wake up.

12
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,790
Sin-yu.

13
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,250
No…

14
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,796
Sin-yu.

15
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,202
Aeng-cho, I'm sorry.

16
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,297
Sin-yu, stay with me.

17
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,382
Sin-yu.

18
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,681
Sin-yu.

19
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,815
EMERGENCY

20
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,747
Abdominal trauma.
Unstable vitals due to heavy bleeding.

21
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,957
What's his blood type?

22
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,626
I don't know.

23
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,504
-Test his blood type for transfusion.
-Yes, Doctor.

24
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,631
-Sin-yu.
-You can't come in here.

25
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,751
No.

26
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,372
Are you going
to practice archery tonight too?

27
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,917
No. Today…

28
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,298
I'll watch the fireworks.

29
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,928
Young Master!

30
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,517
Young Master.
Master wishes to see you urgently.

31
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,689
The exam is soon.

32
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:42,568
I don't even have enough time
to learn martial arts and war tactics.

33
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,071
But marriage?

34
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,490
If you pass the examination,

35
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,575
you'll be sent to the northwest border

36
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,537
and serve there for over a year.

37
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,331
We can't make
the Deputy Scholar's girl wait that long.

38
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,960
I will not marry her.

39
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,294
Do you wish to die?

40
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,799
I wish you'd loved a courtesan.

41
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,720
Then after you got married,
you could've made her your concubine.

42
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,599
How dare you love a lowly being
who is worse than an animal!

43
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,851
Father!

44
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,855
What will happen if I strip her naked

45
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,984
and sell her to a troupe full of men?

46
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,238
If you do not win over the Deputy Scholar,

47
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,364
I can assure you

48
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,909
that you won't get
to see her face ever again.

49
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,704
Do you understand?

50
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,905
You said you would come earlier.

51
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,423
Let's run away.

52
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,347
It doesn't matter where.

53
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,976
Anywhere's fine.

54
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,978
Why didn't you pack anything?

55
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,193
I have seen the future.

56
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,906
There is no place for me beside you.

57
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,370
You will protect the king, win honor,

58
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,790
get a wise wife,
and continue your family line.

59
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,833
That is your destiny.

60
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,085
I do not want

61
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,837
such a destiny.

62
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,221
You cannot go against your destiny.

63
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,598
You do not know until you go against it.

64
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:28,312
I know without going against it.

65
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,066
Running away with a lowly shaman

66
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,944
and living hidden in the mountains

67
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,738
will not make a happy life.

68
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,287
Are you saying though I wed someone else…

69
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,417
and cherish an affection for her…

70
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,254
it'd still be okay with you?

71
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,473
I should have told you this first.

72
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,731
My affection for you

73
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:17,445
isn't strong enough for me
to secretly run away with you.

74
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,338
I did as you ordered,

75
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,799
so please go back.

76
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,607
Let's go.

77
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,764
Are you Aeng-cho?

78
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,818
Let's go to the palace.

79
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,079
Is this the spell book you wrote?

80
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,542
SPELLS

81
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,420
I did not write it myself.

82
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,675
Somebody must have compiled
what was passed down by word of mouth.

83
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,598
No wonder it was not effective.

84
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,108
I need to birth a son.

85
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,445
Let her stay in the western quarter

86
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,238
and give her anything she needs.

87
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,115
Yes ma'am.

88
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,746
You must not be spotted by anyone.

89
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,957
Otherwise,

90
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,501
you will be beheaded.

91
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,923
There are things I need for the spell.

92
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,758
I must to go to the marketplace.

93
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,545
Why are you in the palace?

94
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,383
What is it?

95
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,720
Your affection isn't strong enough

96
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,723
to tell me the reason?

97
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,398
That was a lie.

98
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,742
That was not the reason.

99
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,542
Ever since I first saw you,

100
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,460
not for a single moment--

101
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,363
What are you doing?

102
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,383
You are truly beautiful.

103
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:56,570
Would you like to try?

104
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,618
Yes.

105
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:38,695
I hit the target.

106
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,281
Isn't it fun?

107
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,674
Hey.

108
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,634
Are you going home?

109
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,011
Good day.

110
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,597
Right.

111
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,934
They say there is
a cunning shaman in the palace

112
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,686
weakening the energy in the air.

113
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,771
Have you heard about it?

114
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,028
Take care.

115
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,018
Curse the crown prince.

116
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,272
I want my son to take his place.

117
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:38,940
Black Magic Spell

118
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:43,028
will make the person
who cast it pay in blood too.

119
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,948
Then make your choice.

120
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,826
Will you pay the price

121
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:54,539
or will you make
the person you love pay the price?

122
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,500
Was his name

123
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,628
Jang Mu-jin?

124
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,079
Capture the wicked shaman

125
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,164
at once.

126
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:38,917
Yes, Your Highness.

127
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,254
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

128
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,147
Burn every single spell book

129
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,151
that contains this sly girl's spells.

130
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,694
Yes, Your Highness.

131
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:15,203
It was not I who cursed the crown prince.

132
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:19,124
Do not stop the torture
until she confesses the truth.

133
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:28,383
I… did not do anything.

134
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:32,637
Then just say who did it.

135
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,056
Do you really wish

136
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,893
for me to speak?

137
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,521
One who made him vomit blood was you,

138
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,815
by not noticing
the arrow aimed at your back.

139
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,775
You know who is behind--

140
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,611
Shut your mouth!

141
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,409
I will cut off your head!

142
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,578
Whoever makes my heart stop

143
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,625
will die in agony
when the waning crescent moon rises.

144
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:05,420
Generation after generation,
they will face early deaths.

145
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:06,504
In the end,

146
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,132
that family will perish.

147
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,178
If you are not afraid,

148
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,097
go ahead and kill me.

149
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,499
Lock her up in a well

150
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,378
and to contain her shamanic powers,

151
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,589
seal it with goldenrain tree.

152
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,591
Yes, Your Highness.

153
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,278
What if she spills our secret?

154
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,158
Do not kill her,

155
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:21,246
until I get my hands on
the last spell book she wrote herself.

156
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,290
Yes, ma'am.

157
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:15,842
Aeng-cho.

158
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,555
Aeng-cho!

159
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,186
Wake up.

160
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,063
Aeng-cho.

161
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,197
Grab my hand.

162
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,168
Now!

163
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,540
I was forced to put a curse,

164
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,917
but I could not do it.

165
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,511
Run away.

166
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,181
If I run away,

167
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,099
I cannot protect you.

168
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,354
Is this the price

169
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,149
you had to pay
for using the Black Magic Spell?

170
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:25,949
She made a promise.

171
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,619
What concubine Jung wants

172
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,789
is the last spell book you wrote yourself.

173
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,000
Give it to her…

174
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,839
and leave with me.

175
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:43,842
I cannot…

176
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,846
trust them.

177
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,432
Trust…

178
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:54,936
Trust me.

179
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,702
You have been following me?

180
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:03,332
If I take her with me,
I'll be rewarded with 500 gyeol of land.

181
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,669
I cannot miss that opportunity.

182
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,427
Aren't you

183
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,972
afraid of the curse?

184
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,768
Once she is caught,
she'll be executed by dismemberment.

185
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,312
If bulls tear her apart,

186
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:27,190
humans won't get cursed.

187
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,650
It will be fun to watch.

188
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,330
You cannot go.

189
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,885
Are you going to fight with that injury?

190
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,776
Take the wooden box!

191
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,194
Yes, sir!

192
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,195
Ransack it quickly.

193
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,410
I think she ran away.

194
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,203
Let's go.

195
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,254
Shoot her.

196
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:19,607
Does the curse scare you?

197
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,693
I will handle it.

198
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,362
I will do it.

199
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,831
Were you still alive?

200
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,253
Leave that woman…

201
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,757
to me.

202
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,970
If you help that woman,

203
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,641
your family will be annihilated.

204
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,339
Let him be.

205
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,339
Did you

206
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,217
fool me

207
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,804
to steal the Book of Spells?

208
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:28,087
I said whoever kills me…

209
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:34,843
would be cursed.

210
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,305
Why…

211
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,560
I will

212
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:45,854
accept that curse gladly.

213
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,864
You would have been dismembered.

214
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,076
I cannot let that happen.

215
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,878
If… there is a next life…

216
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,594
let us…

217
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,474
be happy.

218
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,810
-Charge to 360.
-Charge to 360.

219
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:50,688
Clear.

220
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,776
His heartbeat's back.

221
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,779
Wrap it up and move him
to the operating room.

222
00:44:58,862 --> 00:44:59,863
Yes, Doctor.

223
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:42,614
JANG SIN-YU, OPERATING

224
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,575
It clearly was Na Jung-beom.

225
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,285
We checked the elevator's CCTV.

226
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,662
Did you catch him yet?

227
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:51,999
No. He abandoned his car
and ran away on foot.

228
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:55,502
We're tracking him down,
so we'll catch him soon. Don't worry.

229
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,629
I'll give you this smartwatch

230
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,631
so you can call me when you're in danger.

231
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,444
What happened?

232
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,404
JANG SIN-YU, OPERATING

233
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,616
-Sin-yu…
-Poor Sin-yu.

234
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:31,955
Excuse me…

235
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:34,917
Are you

236
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:37,377
Sin-yu's girlfriend?

237
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,381
Yes.

238
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,719
What happened?

239
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,680
Were you with him when this happened?

240
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,432
Why did Sin-yu

241
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:53,477
get stabbed with a knife?

242
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,646
Did he run into a robber?

243
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,444
I'm sorry.

244
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:18,752
Are you okay?

245
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:21,672
No.

246
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:24,550
I'm not okay.

247
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:29,596
How did it go?

248
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,599
The surgery was successful.

249
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,434
He's moved to a ward.

250
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,687
You can be at ease.

251
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,571
Don't stay here.

252
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:46,613
You should go in.

253
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:50,576
His parents came.

254
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:55,455
And I felt like I couldn't stay with them.

255
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,099
It feels like everything's my fault.

256
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,978
If it weren't for me,

257
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:22,524
Sin-yu wouldn't have been stabbed.

258
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,694
How is that your fault?

259
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,696
It's the criminal's fault.

260
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,241
I think this all happened…

261
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:36,997
because of the curse I put on him.

262
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,713
I shouldn't have been with him.

263
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,841
I should've stayed away.

264
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:52,137
I should've listened to Eun-wol.

265
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:57,517
It's all my fault.

266
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:00,604
Don't blame yourself.

267
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,607
What happened was a crime.

268
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,525
It was definitely not your fault.

269
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,874
You must be very shocked.

270
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,210
You should go home and rest.

271
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,754
Is there any place you can rest?

272
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:32,719
If there isn't,
let me accompany you around

273
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:33,929
until he's caught.

274
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:38,141
If you stay with me,

275
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:42,354
you'll be in danger too.

276
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,898
I won't let that happen.

277
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,109
Stand up.

278
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,402
Let's go somewhere else.

279
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,282
I'll go home.

280
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:02,624
I heard that the surgery went well.

281
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,501
What will Hong-jo do?

282
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,962
I told her to use
all of her leaves and rest.

283
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:09,923
They just started dating.
I can't believe this happened.

284
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:11,883
And they were even together,

285
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,218
she must've been shocked.

286
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:15,887
By the way, why is he still not caught?

287
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:16,805
I know, right?

288
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,890
I'm so scared.

289
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:21,643
Let's all be careful, just to be sure.

290
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:24,563
Ms. Ma, you will
commute with me from now on.

291
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:25,647
Su-jeong, Sae-byeol.

292
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:28,442
Make sure to get off work together.

293
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,444
Or drive her back home.

294
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,406
Okay, I will.

295
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:38,827
Why did you get involved
with him in the first place?

296
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,455
I didn't know he was a freak!

297
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:45,917
Don't tell me

298
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,919
you instigated the stabbing, did you?

299
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:49,838
Dad!

300
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:52,257
He dumped you and went to another woman.

301
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,968
It could look like you did it out of envy.

302
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:56,595
I never did any such thing.

303
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:59,014
I told you, I still love Sin-yu.

304
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:07,939
Stop crying.

305
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,358
You'll wear yourself out.

306
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:13,153
You should go grab some food.

307
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,992
I won't eat anything

308
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,620
until Sin-yu wakes up.

309
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:26,249
My boy is already ill,

310
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,668
and why did such a thing happen?

311
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,215
Something is definitely off.

312
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:37,844
What is?

313
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:39,888
It's strange.

314
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:41,890
That girl Sin-yu is dating.

315
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:46,061
How could she not visit even once
after she left the operating room?

316
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:51,149
Maybe she's too shocked
and might have fainted somewhere.

317
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,697
Wouldn't it be safer to stay at home?

318
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,866
I can take days off and stay at home too.

319
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,661
I got the smartwatch,

320
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:06,623
and in case of an emergency,
I can request for protection.

321
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:07,791
Don't worry.

322
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:09,751
What about Sin-yu?

323
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:15,632
I think it's better for you
to stay by his side.

324
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:18,969
If we stay together,

325
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:22,222
Na Jung-beom might come to us again.

326
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:24,933
I need to stay as far away as possible.

327
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:27,769
What if something happens to you
while you're alone?

328
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,896
Don't you worry about yourself?

329
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,319
To me,

330
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,656
he comes first.

331
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,160
Can I ask you a favor?

332
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:47,414
Please keep me updated
on Sin-yu's condition.

333
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,541
I'll check my phone once a day.

334
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:56,006
Let me ask you a favor too.

335
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:02,637
Let me accompany you
to wherever you're going.

336
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,652
Just leave it.

337
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,618
Are you awake? Are you okay?

338
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:26,995
Sin-yu.

339
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:30,874
Where is she?

340
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:35,795
Do you know how long you were asleep for?

341
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:39,883
We were so worried about you,
and the first thing you say is…

342
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:43,428
Don't worry. She's fine.

343
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:47,349
Where is she?

344
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,853
We met her once
in front of the operating room

345
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,189
and we haven't seen her since.

346
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:56,191
Can I have my phone?

347
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:57,484
No. Don't contact her.

348
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,027
I want my phone.

349
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,279
I said, don't contact her.

350
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,657
I heard everything.

351
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,325
You got stabbed because of her.

352
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,745
It wasn't her fault.

353
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:10,622
How was it not?

354
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:14,376
If it weren't for her stalker,
this wouldn't have happened to you.

355
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:15,502
Father.

356
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:18,421
Sin-yu. You almost died.

357
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:23,551
You've got to rest for now.
Don't think about anything else.

358
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:27,847
She must have her reasons for not coming.

359
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,391
What reasons?

360
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:31,726
How could she not visit him
when he's like this?

361
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:35,438
He got hurt because of her,
she should come and apologize at least.

362
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,488
NEW VOICE MESSAGE

363
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,536
First message.

364
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:53,123
They say Sin-yu is getting better.

365
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:54,749
He started eating.

366
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,668
Don't worry too much.

367
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,921
Hong-jo, make sure you eat well too.

368
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:01,965
I'll call you again.

369
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:08,388
Second message.

370
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:10,473
Where are you?

371
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:16,938
How can you leave
your injured boyfriend alone?

372
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:20,483
Come quickly.

373
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:24,821
I miss you, and I want to be with you.

374
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,139
What are you doing?

375
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,267
You know,

376
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,270
just thinking about stuff.

377
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:01,858
You've got to eat and cheer up
to stop the racing thoughts.

378
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:05,278
If you don't have an appetite,
I can make you some noodles.

379
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:08,490
Aren't you scared

380
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,409
of having me here?

381
00:56:13,369 --> 00:56:16,915
Your mom and I lived next door
when she was alive.

382
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:19,542
I was there
when she celebrated conceiving you.

383
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:22,462
She was like a sister to me.

384
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,925
So you're pretty much my own daughter.

385
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:29,135
And mothers don't have fear.

386
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,304
If the stalker comes here,

387
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:35,183
I'll run him over with a tiller.

388
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:45,318
Don't worry about anything and rest well.

389
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:50,031
-I will.
-Let's have some noodles.

390
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:53,159
Thanks to you, I'll have some too.

391
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:10,510
Are you okay?

392
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:12,637
Can you walk?

393
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,889
Please don't come out.

394
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,766
I have to drop by City Hall.

395
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:17,934
Just quit it already.

396
00:57:18,434 --> 00:57:21,229
Do you have to hand in
the resignation letter yourself?

397
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:23,731
Even if I quit,
there's a process to follow.

398
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,400
I can't just quit right away.

399
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,278
You can't drive.

400
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,697
Let our driver No drive you there.

401
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,407
Come back home when you're done.

402
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:34,534
I will.

403
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,870
And I got bodyguards for you,

404
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,372
so don't be startled
if someone follows you.

405
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,418
-Father.
-If you don't like it, stay at home.

406
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:44,627
What do you say?

407
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,717
Sin-yu is getting discharged today.

408
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:55,013
He seems to be fine,
so don't worry too much.

409
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:57,682
Hong-jo, are you doing fine?

410
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:03,146
It's secluded there, but always stay alert
and carry the smartwatch with you.

411
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,191
And…

412
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,446
when you check this, can you call me?

413
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,909
I'm worried about you, and…

414
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:18,786
It's nothing.

415
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:20,455
Enjoy your stay there.

416
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,890
What brings you here?

417
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:43,228
Where is she?

418
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:47,440
Are you sure you're good to walk around?

419
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,858
I asked, where is she?

420
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,446
I can't tell you.

421
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:55,615
Please do.

422
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,329
Do you think Hong-jo's hiding for herself?

423
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:02,413
I know she's gone

424
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:06,334
because she doesn't want me in danger.

425
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:12,507
Still, I need to know where she is.

426
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:17,303
What will you do after your leave?

427
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:19,722
I'm still thinking about it.

428
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,850
He might get in danger again
because of me.

429
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,852
I can't continue working in City Hall.

430
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:29,315
If they fail to catch him until then,

431
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:32,860
I'll request a transfer
and go to a community service center.

432
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,072
But then you'll miss him so much.

433
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:42,662
I must bear with it.

434
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,039
I won't see him.

435
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:54,882
LEE HONG-JO

436
00:59:55,466 --> 01:00:00,597
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone.

437
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,814
I'm back at my home in Seoul,

438
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:12,150
in case you're worried.

439
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,153
Call me when you hear the message.

440
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,405
Calling is fine.

441
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:19,949
I'm in pain.

442
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,121
I'll only get better
when you blow on my wound.

443
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:30,877
Don't you miss me?

444
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,756
I miss you so much.

445
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:42,388
The third message.

446
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:46,517
Mr. Jang got discharged.

447
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,103
Why are you staying hidden?

448
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,612
Meet me one last time.

449
01:00:58,112 --> 01:01:01,366
If you don't,
you will never be able to see Jang Sin-yu.

450
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:02,992
Just you wait.

451
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:08,373
Hello.

452
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:10,917
Sir, please drive fast.

453
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:39,297
How can you come here alone?

454
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:46,304
Sin-yu.

455
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:51,225
Don't worry.
They're bodyguards that I hired for you.

456
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:02,278
How did you know about this place?

457
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:05,031
Jung-beom said he'd come here.

458
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:06,783
Then why did you come here alone?

459
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:13,414
I thought

460
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,918
he might harm you if I didn't.

461
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:24,592
If I'm so precious to you,
why did you want to leave me?

462
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,516
Because you're so precious.

463
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:36,354
Because I care about you so much…

464
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:42,485
I was afraid
I might make your life miserable--

465
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:55,998
There's no such thing as a curse now.

466
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,044
You said a death would end it all.

467
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:02,797
I was dead.

468
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:04,715
When I was dead…

469
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:10,471
I saw everything.

470
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:19,689
What did you see?

471
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:36,951
In this life…

472
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:41,038
and in the past life…

473
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:46,085
I love you.

474
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:45,061
DESTINED WITH YOU

475
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:48,147
Promise me
you will never disappear from my sight.

476
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:49,732
Who is it?

477
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:52,401
-My parents.
-What?

478
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:56,447
If you accept this,
we're in this together.

479
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:59,366
Who is Ms. Ma?

480
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:01,035
That's me. Who are you?

481
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:02,078
You became braver.

482
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:04,622
Do you think I'm here to build friendship?

483
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:07,541
You have no idea what will happen to you.

484
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:09,543
You don't know either.

485
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:12,046
I know because I'm going to do it.

486
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:17,468
