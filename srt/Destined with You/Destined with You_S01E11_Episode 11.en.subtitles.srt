00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,966
DESTINED WITH YOU

2
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:34,594
What's wrong?

3
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,222
Are you in pain?

4
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,810
Let's go to the hospital.

5
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,186
Can you walk?

6
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,066
There's no time for that.

7
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,360
We've got to make a wish.

8
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,613
Are you okay?

9
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,451
It's just a mild migraine.

10
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,748
Look. The sun is almost set.

11
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,584
Let's make a wish.

12
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,921
I'm fine.

13
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,549
This is not fair.

14
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,551
I'm not done making my wish yet.

15
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,470
Continue. I won't bother you.

16
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,264
You are bothering me.

17
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,184
Then I'll continue bothering.

18
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:19,866
How do I look?

19
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,119
No.

20
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,992
EPISODE 11

21
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,498
Why did you buy me clothes?

22
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,999
We're not going back.

23
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,796
Something happened, right?

24
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,548
Is it related to the mayor summoning me?

25
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,259
It was nothing.

26
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,760
I'll handle that issue.

27
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,554
Then where are we going now?

28
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,682
We'll rest a bit and go see the sunrise.

29
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,561
NATIONAL PROPERTY CONDITION REPORT

31
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:35,441
LEE HONG-JO

32
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:41,823
Big news.

33
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,866
Mr. Jang grabbed the wrist

34
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,244
of the red-cheeked woman
in front of everyone

35
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,289
and walked out of the lobby
like a real man.

36
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,667
What on earth is happening?

37
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,420
I shouldn't have told him.

38
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,755
I should've handled it myself.

39
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,809
You said you liked someone.

40
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,227
And that was Hong-jo?

41
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,605
So, you're the culprit.

42
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:18,151
You pressured the mayor
to transfer Hong-jo to somewhere else.

43
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,988
I'm not "the culprit."

44
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,573
I'm Yoon Na-yeon.

45
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:29,120
You seem like the type to act on impulse.

46
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,207
It's better to do something
than not do anything.

47
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,752
Be thorough if you're going to do it.

48
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,295
Think before you act.

49
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,853
It's nice.

50
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,147
Of course it's nice, you're with me.

51
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,859
Your room's that way.

52
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,320
There's a bathtub inside.
Go wash up and rest.

53
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,574
Where are you going?

54
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:08,743
To wash up.

55
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,382
Why is he suddenly washing up?

56
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,345
No naughty thoughts.

57
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,638
Of course you wash up.

58
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:31,265
Washing your hands is washing up too.

59
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,573
What time is it?

60
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:31,909
Gosh.

61
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,995
He's taking so long to wash up.

62
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,831
He didn't go to bed, did he?

63
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,334
This is ridiculous.

64
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,546
I'm not upset about anything else.

65
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,881
I came all the way here.

66
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,717
Shouldn't he at least wish me good night?

67
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,739
Don't get me wrong.

68
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,033
You seemed to be sick earlier.

69
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,202
So I was worried.

70
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,496
I didn't mean to do anything else.

71
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,540
I didn't get you wrong.

72
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,168
That's good then.

73
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,670
How are you feeling?

74
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,965
I'm fine.

75
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,885
Then I, well…

76
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,095
I can feel at ease and go to bed.

77
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,933
That's right. I hope you sleep tight.

78
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,021
Sure. You sleep tight too, Sin-yu.

79
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,733
What is it?

80
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,738
I didn't say you should go to bed alone.

81
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,666
Sleep.

82
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,544
You've got to get
some shut-eye for the morning.

83
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,381
How can I sleep?

84
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,550
You're right in front of my eyes.

85
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,724
Now I'm not.

86
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,729
This won't make me sleep.

87
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,319
If you say another word,
I won't stay still.

88
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,655
You won't get to see the sunrise.

89
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,611
Every New Year's Day,

90
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,905
he'd wake me up at 3:30 a.m.,

91
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,908
saying we should
see the sunrise on Bukhansan.

92
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:22,079
I complained all the way up
saying I didn't want to go,

93
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:25,124
and complained all the way down
saying I was tired.

94
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,170
But after my dad passed away,

95
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,882
I started the New Year
by myself all the time.

96
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,426
And I always slept in.

97
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:41,057
I guess I didn't want to feel
that he wasn't around anymore.

98
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:47,563
So my New Year's Days
have always been depressing.

99
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:52,902
Thank you.

100
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,112
For being with me.

101
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,324
Aren't you cold?

102
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:00,910
It's bearable.

103
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,204
Because I'm a bear.

104
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:05,956
I'm cold.

105
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,708
Because I'm not a bear.

106
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,128
Goodness, you.

107
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,451
You don't hate holding hands?

108
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,662
Who says I hate it?

109
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,020
I…

110
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:11,856
Well…

111
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,191
I didn't expect to see you here.

112
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,988
I didn't expect
to see you like this either.

113
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,825
What brings you here, Mr. Kwon?

114
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,828
This is my sunrise spot
for New Year's Day.

115
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,542
There are many places to go.
Why here of all places?

116
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,502
You came here out of all places too.

117
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,760
Since we met,
why don't we eat tteokguk together?

118
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,888
What are you saying? No.

119
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:44,972
Yes, I'd like to.

120
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,063
Don't lift a finger and stay seated.
I'll do everything.

121
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,900
You don't look like a good cook though.

122
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,485
I've never tried it,

123
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,820
but as I said,
I can do anything once I try it.

124
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,282
Are you going to
look up the recipe on your phone?

125
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,493
I can cook without one.

126
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,746
Just look it up,
so you won't waste the ingredients.

127
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:16,295
Do you need a hand?

128
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,964
It's fine, Hong-jo. Just stay seated.

129
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,633
This is so exciting.

130
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:21,842
Looking forward to it.

131
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:41,320
HOW TO COOK TTEOKGUK

132
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,572
I was worried yesterday.

133
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,950
I'm glad nothing happened.

134
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:47,952
Right.

135
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,996
I didn't know you'd come
all the way here for the sunrise.

136
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,625
I got pictures from last year.
Do you want to see them?

137
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,502
Sure.

138
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,671
The weather was great.

139
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,883
Wow.

140
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,636
You're a great photographer.

141
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,181
You're a bear
with a keen eye for pictures.

142
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,642
What?

143
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,478
Gosh.

144
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,939
Do you want to see some more?

145
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,901
This is bad.

146
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,654
I thought I was a good cook, but I wasn't.

147
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,489
I might ruin the ingredients.

148
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,117
We must eat tteokguk today,
but I doubt we can.

149
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,702
Oh my…

150
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:30,744
Move, I'll do it.

151
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,745
Thank you.

152
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,247
Do you need help?

153
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,331
It's okay.

154
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,126
Take your recipe with you.

155
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,014
Thank you for the food.

156
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,641
It looks pretty good,

157
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,768
but good-looking food usually tastes bad.

158
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,732
It's good.

159
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,275
It's so savory.

160
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,486
This is the best tteokguk I've ever had.

161
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,406
Even your words are so nice.

162
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,911
That's the only nice thing about her.

163
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,538
Look at her, she's ugly.

164
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,664
Eyes, nose, and lips.

165
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,750
They're pretty.

166
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:21,962
Yes.

167
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,089
You're right.

168
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,703
It runs in my family.

169
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,580
Nobody has ever avoided it.

170
00:15:56,664 --> 00:16:00,292
Father thinks it's due to a curse.

171
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:24,525
There's no spell to use on a sick person.

172
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,284
MIND-BODY CLEANSE SPELL

173
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,715
LEE HONG-JO

174
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,018
What are you doing?

175
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,814
I was waiting for your call.

176
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,486
I thought about it long and hard.

177
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,156
Why don't we try
the Mind-Body Cleanse Spell?

178
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,199
It doesn't say it cures illness,

179
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,452
but it'll cleanse your mind and body.

180
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,290
Should I come to you now?

181
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,253
You can't.

182
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,006
Don't you miss me?

183
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,549
I do miss you.

184
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,801
So hang up.

185
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,848
If you miss me, why would you… hang up?

186
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,310
LEE HONG-JO

187
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,395
What…

188
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,081
What took you so long to pick up?

189
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,584
I was reading a book.

190
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,669
So I didn't know you called.

191
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:08,754
It's Meditations.

192
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:14,134
I guess I got in the way
of your journey of knowledge.

193
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,135
Should I hang up?

194
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:16,553
No.

195
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,388
I finished reading.

196
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,141
Which line is the most memorable?

197
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,855
I want to be with you.

198
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,608
Is that from Meditations?

199
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,401
No.

200
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,403
It's from me.

201
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,491
We were together until this morning.

202
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,618
You're not by my side now.

203
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,705
Lie down.

204
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,967
It feels like we're together.

205
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,555
Shall we go to bed?

206
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,724
Not yet.

207
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,725
Why not?

208
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,270
Isn't the bed
more comfortable than the sofa?

209
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,188
I said not yet.

210
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,065
Why not yet?

211
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,027
I don't know.
Let's talk about something else.

212
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,781
When did you start falling for me?

213
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,450
Not that. Something else.

214
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,453
Something else…

215
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,413
Something else.

216
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,123
When did you start falling for me?

217
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:29,209
Please. Something else.

218
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,087
Okay then.
When did you start falling for me?

219
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,047
You must be crazy.

220
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,468
When did you
start falling for Jang Sin-yu?

221
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,845
I'm going to hang up.

222
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,069
What did you talk about with the mayor?

223
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,738
He seemed to be in a bad mood.

224
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,240
The no-scolding coupons have expired.

225
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,951
Entering my room without knocking,

226
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,245
and entering my room when I'm not in it.

227
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,705
Please don't do these.

228
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,919
I'm doing this to get close to you.

229
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,421
What's that pot?

230
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,925
It was delivered
while you were out of office.

231
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,802
I think it's from your girlfriend.

232
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,557
Should I call her your ex-girlfriend?

233
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,268
Yes.

234
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,479
Does that mean

235
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,273
the red-cheeked woman you left with is--

236
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,608
No red cheeks anymore.

237
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:37,945
No way.

238
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,376
Ms. Ma, I'm sorry.

239
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,837
If there are unavoidable circumstances,

240
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,839
it's okay to leave during work hours.

241
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,134
But you should've given
one of us a heads-up.

242
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,761
Everyone was worried.

243
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,722
I'll be more careful from now on.

244
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,933
If something like this happens again…

245
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,893
How about paying a penalty?

246
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,148
Let's do something meaningful this year.

247
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,277
This bank account is very convenient.

248
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,237
It helps you manage group money.

249
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:24,074
We'll collect penalties
for tardiness, playing hooky,

250
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:28,036
or making mistakes at work,
and then give it to one person.

251
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,579
What do you think?

252
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,250
Who will you give it to?

253
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,004
Whoever gets married first among us.

254
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,840
Is that going to be you?

255
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,174
Are you marrying Ms. Cha?

256
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,426
That's not happening.

257
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,052
Why?

258
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,137
She dumped you.

259
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,181
I knew it.

260
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:51,351
It was strange
that she even wanted to date you.

261
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,603
To be honest,
you don't look very likeable.

262
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,023
Seung-yeon said I was her ideal type.

263
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,482
Shut up.

264
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,526
Let's change who will get the money.

265
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,902
Whoever gets sick first.

266
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,488
I don't want that. Marriage is fine.

267
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,824
I'm suddenly getting competitive.

268
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,160
That makes the two of us.

269
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,173
BUSINESS REGISTRATION

270
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,383
CERTIFICATE OF REGISTERED INFORMATION

271
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,642
This is Sin-yu.

272
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:36,229
Who's worked the longest
in Greenway Building Division?

273
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,650
Okay. I'll come down.

274
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,539
You don't even call me now.

275
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:58,752
Is that why you did this?

276
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:01,129
Yes, I sent you that on purpose.

277
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,508
I wanted you to call me,
get angry and come find me.

278
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,386
At this point, I don't think you love me.

279
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,430
I asked to wait until my work was over.

280
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:14,059
If you wanted me to do that,
you shouldn't have used your dad.

281
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,520
And why did I do that?

282
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,105
I chased her around first.

283
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,231
I liked her first.

284
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,651
So take your anger out on me.

285
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:40,168
I checked the transaction,
and the prime cost seemed inflated.

286
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,839
Autumn chrysanthemum festival,
Buyongjae Fireworks Festival,

287
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,215
and several other times.

288
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,467
He's a terrible guy.

289
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,802
He didn't seem like one.

290
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,179
By the way,

291
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,349
is being fooled also considered a crime?

292
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,852
Well…

293
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:59,020
The audit will take place,

294
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,107
but if you tell them
that you double-checked, found it,

295
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,151
and dealt with it, it should be fine.

296
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:09,114
However, they should be excluded
from any further events starting today.

297
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,701
There might be a hearing if he objects.

298
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,161
You can testify then.

299
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,288
Okay. I will do that.

300
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:18,498
By any chance,

301
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,459
did you practice tunneling?

302
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,547
You've only worked
with Green Landscape Garden.

303
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:31,219
Are you suspecting me of bribery?

304
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,889
I never got bribed.

305
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:37,225
It's a customary practice.

306
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:42,272
When did
that customary practice start and why?

307
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,651
Well, we kind of owe them a little.

308
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,988
Mr. Na's wife,
went missing five years ago.

309
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:53,283
So he was investigated as a suspect.

310
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,535
As her husband, he was suspected first.

311
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:58,663
Then rumors spread in City Hall
that he was the murderer.

312
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,707
Everyone was talking about it.

313
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,793
And his name even happens
to be Na Jung-beom,

314
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,629
which sounds like a murderer's name.

315
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,881
So?

316
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,926
He was acquitted in the end.

317
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:14,095
But the rumors that spread
don't die down easily.

318
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:17,098
He drank every day
and became a complete mess.

319
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,102
The manager of my team
back then felt bad for him.

320
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,856
So he decided to help him
and gave him all the work.

321
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,525
That's how we started working with him.

322
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,280
Is there no news from the missing wife?

323
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,908
I don't think so.

324
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,329
I see. Thanks anyway.

325
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,414
Sure. Thank you.

326
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,383
Mr. Jang found him inflating the cost.

327
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,718
We should've changed
our vendors regularly.

328
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,303
We were too complacent.

329
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,764
What about the tree replacement case?

330
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,183
Thankfully, that's done
by another partner.

331
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,268
Okay.

332
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,688
Hong-jo.

333
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,900
Starting with the bulb planting,

334
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:12,112
let's work with a different partner.

335
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,738
Give me a list of our partners.

336
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:14,823
Yes ma'am.

337
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,244
It's our first workday of the year.
How about a team dinner?

338
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,580
I have a prior engagement.

339
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,540
What?

340
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,042
Another date with Seung-yeon?

341
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,669
No, I'm going on a trip.

342
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,587
A very long trip.

343
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,008
What about the rest?

344
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:37,345
I'm so sorry,
but the three of us have plans too.

345
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:38,888
I see.

346
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,435
I have plans with you guys?

347
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,854
Yes, we do have an engagement.

348
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,356
What about you, Mr. Park?

349
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,859
I have a stomachache.

350
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,408
Hello.

351
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,451
Hello.

352
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,376
So you held hands.

353
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,546
You did.

354
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:14,507
Spill the beans.
What happened with Mr. Jang?

355
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,176
First, food and drinks.

356
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,053
Calm down.

357
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,471
Settle down, okay?

358
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,181
Just order the garlic flavor.

359
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,098
I prefer chili.

360
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,683
Then order that too.

361
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:24,768
Bingo.

362
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:26,978
What about this?

363
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:28,730
Are you off work?

364
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,357
Order that too. What else?

365
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:31,816
And for the drinks…

366
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,110
I'm with my seniors.

367
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,362
It's a gathering.

368
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,580
Mr. Jang, I knocked.

369
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,707
I'll be off now.

370
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,795
You wanted to get close to me, right?

371
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,258
Yes. I'll do anything.

372
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:10,855
Okay.

373
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:12,315
Tell us now.

374
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:16,236
Ms. Lee, why did Mr. Jang go out with you

375
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,531
holding hands?

376
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:22,909
Well…

377
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,620
Speak casually. What's up with "Ms. Lee"?

378
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:29,124
I've got to say though,
the chicken tastes amazing.

379
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,458
It's spicy.

380
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,044
-The garlic one tastes good too.
-Really?

381
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,755
Are you listening?

382
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:39,551
How many times do I have to
ask you what happened with him?

383
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:46,975
Well,

384
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,144
actually…

385
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:57,777
I'm dating

386
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,239
Mr. Jang.

387
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,787
How did you win his heart?

388
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,082
Well…

389
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,211
I cast a spell.

390
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,588
Love Spell.

391
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,552
Why won't you answer me?

392
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,141
What happened is…

393
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,728
He's here.

394
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,730
-What?
-Mr. Shocking.

395
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,736
You're here for dinner.

396
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,446
We're here for dinner too.

397
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:44,657
Gi-dong over here
pestered me to go for a drink.

398
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:46,993
You're drinking?

399
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,704
No. Not me but Gi-dong over here.

400
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,998
Yes. I'll be drinking.

401
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:53,792
Let's go.

402
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,093
Can we join you?

403
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,428
-Yes.
-Well…

404
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,597
If you insist--

405
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,015
Come here.

406
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,725
We work in the same place,

407
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,769
so it'd be strange to sit separately.

408
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,063
Come here.

409
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,371
Who is it?

410
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:32,997
The security.

411
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,584
Thanks for your hard work--

412
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:37,752
My goodness.

413
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,588
How can you
open the door without checking?

414
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,382
You live alone after all.

415
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:46,052
If someone comes at this hour,
you must check the intercom,

416
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:49,222
ask why they're here and check their ID.

417
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,021
You came here
all of a sudden to nag at me?

418
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,899
What's with this bag?

419
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,985
I'm on a trip.

420
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,779
And this is my destination.

421
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:07,657
What?

422
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:26,426
Is any of us three your ideal type?

423
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:29,470
No.

424
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,933
Why aren't any of us your ideal type?

425
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,560
I don't have an ideal type.

426
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:38,980
Also, ideal types have
nothing to do with dating.

427
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:43,568
That's true.

428
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,946
Beauty and the Beast
weren't each other's ideal types.

429
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,197
-But--
-Excuse me.

430
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,409
I'll spin it this time.

431
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,671
Is there a chance of breaking up

432
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:06,841
with that rumored woman?

433
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,179
We broke up.

434
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,560
Is your knee okay?

435
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:18,978
Yes.

436
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:22,273
The second round is on me. Let's go.

437
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:31,574
Check this out.

438
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,077
What is this?

439
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:36,955
ADVANTAGES OF LIVING WITH SEO-GU

440
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,963
ADVANTAGES OF LIVING WITH CHAMRING SEO-GU

441
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,465
PROPOSAL REASON AND DURATION

442
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:51,302
It's a nicely written document. It's neat.

443
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:52,929
Right?

444
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:56,432
There are a lot of advantages
of living together.

445
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,269
But I'm not doing it.

446
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,273
Why not? There are many advantages.

447
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,900
Let's live together first,

448
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,860
and if you don't like it, I'll move out.

449
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,321
I don't want to do it.

450
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,533
Do you not like me or living together?

451
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:14,617
Both.

452
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,080
Why did you do that to me?

453
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:23,751
Why didn't you let me go
on a blind date with Seung-yeon?

454
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,840
I don't want you with someone else,
but I don't want you with me either.

455
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,764
Can't you just be with me?

456
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,392
Think of me as your servant.

457
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,019
I'll do all the work.

458
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,103
I don't believe it.

459
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,063
My ex-husband said that too.

460
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,649
Some people don't change over 20 years.

461
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:49,110
You know that you're my first love.

462
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,084
Fine.

463
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:06,669
I'll leave.

464
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,214
I'm leaving.

465
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,218
Rewrite the document and bring it to me.

466
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:17,138
I hate typos.

467
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:20,266
What's with "chamring"
and "love of a thousnad years"?

468
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,234
What do you want to sing?

469
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,236
Don't mind me, Gi-dong.

470
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,073
"I Ain't Going Home Tonight."

471
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,534
Three, seven, three…

472
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:39,619
Hey.

473
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,081
About what I wanted to say earlier--

474
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,165
Tell me later.

475
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,505
Mr. Jang just became single, so…

476
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,924
-I have something to tell you.
-It's my song.

477
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,509
Sung by Sae-byeol.

478
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,177
"I Ain't Going Home Tonight."

479
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,934
Stop pretending you're ignorant

480
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:06,104
How can you have such slow wits?

481
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:10,525
You have aged in vain

482
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:15,404
Do I really have to say it out loud
For you to realize?

483
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,866
Actually, I'm not drunk

484
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:23,162
But I wanted to look drunk

485
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:28,209
You really don't know
You don't know women

486
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:34,841
I ain't going home tonight

487
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:40,012
I ain't going home tonight

488
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,641
Gi-dong.

489
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,436
Gi-dong.

490
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,480
Gi-dong!

491
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:55,194
Let's enjoy this in a more calm manner.

492
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:01,993
If you feel the same
If you want the same thing

493
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,579
IT WOULD BE NICE IF I HELD YOUR HAND TIGHT

494
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,290
It would be nice
If I held--

495
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,499
CANCEL

496
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,211
Gosh. Oh.

497
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,423
I meant to press "Clap."

498
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,907
Don't try to hold my hand
But hold me in your arms

499
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,659
Try to feel me
With your eyes closed tight

500
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:46,495
If your heart is tangled up
Look into my eyes

501
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:49,707
I am indeed seducing you

502
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:54,337
Move your limbs and do it!
Just the two of us

503
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,838
Tonight, let's take it!

504
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:59,800
Light up the moonlight
Let it shine your heart

505
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,928
And show it to me

506
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,141
Mr. Jang. You should sing too.

507
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,393
Sing!

508
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,396
-Sing!
-Sing!

509
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,273
Okay, I will.

510
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,484
I'll sing.

511
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,286
START

512
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,746
A THOUGHT ON AN AUTUMN NIGHT

513
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,581
It's my favorite song!

514
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:44,679
Even among the distant stars

515
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:51,852
There must be someone singing love

516
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,691
Every night he'd be merry

517
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,944
Collecting good old memories

518
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:04,949
And write a song to sing

519
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:08,619
The starlight that embroider

520
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:12,290
The pitch-black night sky

521
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:17,545
Follows where the wind blows

522
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:22,466
The thought of missing you

523
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:26,929
Grows in this October night

524
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:31,642
This beautiful night

525
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,190
You have a CCTV now,
but don't let your guard down.

526
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:41,569
When you work overtime or have gatherings,
make sure you tell me.

527
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,863
So you can drive me home every time?

528
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,699
Beware of the garden owner
and Jae-gyeong too.

529
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,743
All men are dangerous except me.

530
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,538
I get it. Go now.

531
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,706
It's late.

532
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,000
You don't need light fixing these days?

533
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,837
You asked me
to change the ballast last time.

534
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,797
Should I come up and check just in case?

535
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,674
They're fine.

536
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,886
You don't like eating alone.

537
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,679
Shall we go up and eat?

538
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,433
We had a gathering. I ate two chickens.

539
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,022
I guess this is it then.

540
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,447
Seriously.

541
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,637
Gosh.

542
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,430
You're the dangerous one.

543
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,767
I could be more dangerous.

544
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,853
Where are you going?

545
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:58,771
Go home quickly.

546
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,856
I don't need to go home.

547
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,316
I really don't need

548
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,568
to go home today.

549
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,362
-Hong-jo.
-No.

550
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:07,780
Why not? Hong-jo…

551
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,367
Drive safely and carefully.

552
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,494
-Must I really go?
-Wear your seat belt.

553
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,002
Oh, my goodness!

554
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,467
Gosh.

555
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:32,805
Why're you sitting here?

556
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,183
How could you do that
in front of the house?

557
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,854
I wanted to go buy drinks, but I couldn't.

558
00:40:40,646 --> 00:40:43,858
You already look very drunk though.

559
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,151
Yes.

560
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,777
I'm very drunk.

561
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:50,614
My drinking limit is
one bottle of soju, and I had two.

562
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,783
But I want to get more drunk.

563
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,375
You said you liked me

564
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,462
on September 27th.

565
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,173
It hasn't even been 100 days,

566
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,883
and now you like someone else.

567
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,385
It breaks my heart.

568
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,511
How can…

569
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,182
love change?

570
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:23,189
Who considers a crush as love?

571
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:24,356
Still.

572
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,193
It should've lasted longer.

573
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:32,114
To be honest, you guys
don't look good together.

574
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:36,660
The height difference.

575
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,829
It's too much.

576
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,373
A bear and a giraffe

577
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:44,752
cannot get together to begin with. A bear…

578
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,507
looks better with an otter like me.

579
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,384
They both eat fish.

580
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,347
-Mr. Kwon--
-Don't call me that again.

581
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:04,021
You call Sin-yu by his name.
Why won't you call me by my name?

582
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:08,651
Call me by my name.

583
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,111
So annoying.

584
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,365
Is my name hard to pronounce?

585
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,658
Kwon Jae-gyeong.

586
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,266
This is crazy.

587
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,351
Come out now.

588
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,944
Hi. What's up?

589
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:58,492
Anyone can get drunk and make mistakes.

590
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,952
Did I make any mistakes?

591
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:01,912
I don't remember anything.

592
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,833
Didn't you avoid me
because you remembered?

593
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,251
I didn't avoid you.

594
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,336
I went back in to get my phone.

595
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,381
I see.

596
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:15,217
You left your phone inside. That's why.

597
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,304
Does his phone have feet?

598
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,847
It keeps moving on its own.

599
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:21,849
Hong-jo.

600
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,562
About what I said last night…

601
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:28,522
Don't worry about it.

602
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,024
I didn't take it seriously.

603
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,776
No. Please take it seriously.

604
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,407
I do want to be called by my name.

605
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,534
"Mr. Kwon."

606
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,286
It's hard to pronounce.

607
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,050
You started having
tactile hallucinations again?

608
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,386
I didn't have this symptom for a while.

609
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,348
But it came back a few days ago.

610
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,981
There's an MRI that detects acute lesions.

611
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:13,317
If that turns out to be normal,

612
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,112
then… you'll have to go to a psychiatrist.

613
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:26,497
I don't know which is better,
the results being normal or abnormal.

614
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,749
I can't decide.

615
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,002
I'll set the earliest date.

616
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,837
Let's do it first and then discuss.

617
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,341
You killed her.

618
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:42,930
The owner of the bloody hand
that caresses your cheek.

619
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,946
"A terrible curse is cast on me."

620
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,492
That awful curse will be
passed down for generations

621
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,037
and will not end.

622
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,302
I feel endlessly sorry.

623
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:25,514
But I ask a favor.

624
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:32,271
Leave the shrine on Mount Onju as is.

625
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:40,863
From one generation to the next,
take good care of it.

626
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:56,753
By any chance…

627
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,508
if I was your mortal enemy
in our past lives,

628
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,634
what would you think?

629
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,139
Did you have the dream again?

630
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:10,309
Before, you had a high status
and I was a lowly being.

631
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,310
What is it now?

632
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:13,437
A young master and a servant?

633
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,772
A crown prince and a maid?

634
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,316
It was similar.

635
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:19,568
How absurd.

636
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,945
If that was the case

637
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:24,990
and I gave you a hard time,

638
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:29,203
and if you remembered all of that,

639
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:31,788
how would you feel?

640
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,587
Obviously, I'll break up
with you right away.

641
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,052
I'm joking.

642
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:48,514
Why is that important?
What matters is the present.

643
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,769
Promise me
that you won't change your mind.

644
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:56,271
Why go so far as to promise?

645
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,150
Close your eyes.

646
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,778
Another kiss?

647
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:42,693
It's pretty.

648
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,529
You can't go anywhere now.

649
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,116
I won't go anywhere.

650
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,431
This is my present.

651
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:13,515
Use it well.

652
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,943
How can she do this?

653
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:25,861
Unbelievable.

654
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:28,113
She didn't say anything when we drank.

655
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:29,865
You're right.

656
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:34,286
What I hate the most is that she acted
like she knew nothing in front of us.

657
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,039
Good morning.

658
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:42,544
Did something happen?

659
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,298
We need to talk.

660
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:37,391
Did you post the pictures?

661
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:39,768
Why would I do that?

662
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,896
I still don't think Sin-yu and I broke up.

663
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,233
Did you really not post them?

664
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,568
I told you before.

665
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,612
I think you have a stalker.

666
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:52,739
Aren't you scared?

667
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:56,243
If I were you, I would be
looking for that stalker first.

668
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:00,956
And you didn't hire that stalker?

669
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,420
You must think

670
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:09,631
you're somebody.

671
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:13,927
Well, you are the talk of the town.

672
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:16,346
For hitting on multiple men.

673
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,228
This was a stupid idea.

674
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:24,604
Even if you did it,

675
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,606
you would never admit it.

676
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:29,818
Forget it. Get back to work.

677
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,745
It's her in the pictures.

678
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,500
She's so promiscuous.

679
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:47,419
I'm actually jealous.

680
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,629
Both of them
are the most popular men here.

681
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,968
Excuse me. I can hear you.

682
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:59,514
And I'm not promiscuous.

683
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:04,895
Goodbye.

684
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,399
It was posted then deleted quickly.

685
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,902
But the screenshots keep going around.

686
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,571
The whole City Hall is making a fuss.

687
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,532
Mayor shouted in anger.

688
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:21,620
This is the biggest scandal I've seen
in five years of my career here.

689
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:26,917
Where are you going?

690
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,628
Not to Hong-jo, right?

691
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:33,840
If I go meet her right now,
don't you think things will get worse?

692
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:41,515
Then where…

693
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:47,979
I was going to tell you. But--

694
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:49,856
You were going to tell us?

695
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,191
You should've told us.

696
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,736
We were trying
to impress Mr. Jang in karaoke…

697
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:00,951
No!

698
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,120
My pride is hurt.

699
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,540
So embarrassing.

700
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,000
What did you think of us?

701
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,877
Did you have fun watching us?

702
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,629
-Yes.
-Did you find us funny?

703
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,422
No, I never thought that.

704
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,968
I didn't keep it a secret on purpose.

705
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,553
I couldn't tell you.

706
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,721
Of course you couldn't tell us.

707
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:23,932
You were two-timing.

708
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,433
How can you date two guys?

709
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,435
I don't believe this.

710
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,606
I will tell you everything.

711
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,984
Whatever. It's too late.

712
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:37,487
You're worse than girls like her
who hit on guys so aggressively.

713
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,823
Flirting with everyone, acting innocent.

714
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:42,200
Let's go.

715
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:47,622
What's wrong?

716
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,000
Ms. Yoo.

717
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,091
Are you okay?

718
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:07,183
Yes. I'm perfectly fine.

719
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,727
I'm working energetically.

720
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,447
What's going on here?

721
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,990
I can't even breathe.

722
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,492
If you have a problem, just fight.

723
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,494
That's absolute nonsense.

724
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,332
It's fun to watch others fight.

725
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:33,168
I'll go check out
the tree replacement site.

726
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:35,587
It's just that tree, right?

727
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,505
Why did it die alone?

728
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:39,215
Since you're curious,

729
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,051
I'll do my best to find out.

730
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:42,469
And one more thing.

731
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:47,349
I'm rewriting the document.
Are you curious?

732
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:52,687
I'm not.

733
00:53:58,151 --> 00:53:59,903
A tree over three meters dies.

734
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:01,613
And a ridiculous scandal breaks.

735
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:05,325
Why are so many incidents happening
since the start of the year?

736
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,232
You seem fine.

737
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,110
Is there any reason not to be?

738
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:43,989
On my way in,

739
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,533
the atmosphere felt strange,
so I asked around.

740
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:50,787
An incredible scandal broke apparently.

741
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,747
It's not a scandal. It's a crime.

742
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:57,002
You can't take others' pictures
without permission.

743
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,461
I see.

744
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,131
They posted pictures.

745
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,677
I wonder who did that.

746
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,638
Is there no news yet?

747
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,265
About your missing wife.

748
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:22,569
You know a lot about me.

749
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,740
Yes.

750
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:29,200
And I'm thinking

751
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:31,911
that it's very strange.

752
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:35,123
You're here to complain
about how unfair it is

753
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:37,542
to be excluded from the partner selection.

754
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:40,920
But you keep talking about something else.

755
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:48,178
We can… talk about that now.

756
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:54,934
Up!

757
00:55:58,563 --> 00:55:59,981
Up.

758
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:03,068
Okay.

759
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,652
To the right.

760
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,949
Move aside.

761
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:21,503
-What?
-What is it?

762
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:22,587
What's wrong?

763
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,507
-That…
-What's that?

764
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,383
Human bones.

765
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,285
Where is this?

766
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,784
I think it's around here.

767
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,716
There really is a pit.

768
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,645
Who did this?

769
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:24,959
Did Green Landscape Garden
take part in creating this park too?

770
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,128
I guess so.

771
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:29,255
But it was under a different name then.

772
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:32,383
By any chance,

773
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:35,803
did Na Jung-beom's wife go missing

774
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:38,431
around the time this park was created?

775
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,226
I think she went missing much earlier.

776
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:42,560
But why…

777
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,188
Don't tell me…

778
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:47,565
Don't.

779
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:49,317
Don't come in.

780
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:05,917
GROOT

781
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:22,327
DESTINED WITH YOU

782
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,328
Hong-jo?

783
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:27,332
I now understand what you said.

784
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,959
You said you saw me in your dreams.

785
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:31,669
I saw you too.

786
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:34,339
Even all my servants have names.

787
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,591
I can't call you "No-name."

788
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,635
I'll name you.

789
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:40,511
What did you see?

790
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:44,515
I saw something

791
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:48,603
I didn't want to see.

792
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:55,443
