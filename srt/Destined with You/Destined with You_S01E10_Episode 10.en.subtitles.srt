1
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,966
DESTINED WITH YOU

00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,176
EPISODE 10

3
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,348
MISSED CALL: CIVIL SERVANT (HAUNTED HOUSE)

4
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,107
You didn't go on the trip.

5
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,155
Didn't you call to stop me from going?

6
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,619
That's right.

7
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,996
I called to stop you from going.

8
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,546
But I didn't expect you
to come all the way here.

9
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,967
Spells do work after all.

10
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,846
I tried it again.

11
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,265
I wanted to check if it worked or not.

12
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:12,835
It doesn't matter…

13
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,926
whether spells work or not.

14
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,557
I love you.

15
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,459
Mom!

16
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,513
That was weird.

17
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:09,142
That confession was just out of the blue.

18
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,103
Of course it's out of the blue.

19
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,731
"I'll confess to you
at 9:30 p.m. Get ready."

20
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,107
Who even does that?

21
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:17,900
Why are you angry?

22
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,736
-I'm not.
-You are.

23
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,987
Your voice got louder.

24
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,739
I said I'm not angry.

25
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,287
I'm just embarrassed.

26
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,754
I thought you were someone…

27
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,799
who couldn't feel embarrassment.

28
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,678
You have a girlfriend,
and you said you love me so easily.

29
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,892
It wasn't easy.

30
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,188
Then you have no conscience.

31
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,024
You're two-timing now.

32
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,693
I'm not.

33
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,534
Wait for me.

34
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,373
I'm coming to you soon,

35
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,167
pure and wholly.

36
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,840
So I want you to be pure too
and wait for me.

37
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,303
I've always been pure.

38
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,847
I'm much purer than you.

39
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,059
My whole life,
I've never had a proper boyfriend.

40
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,355
Your mind isn't pure.

41
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,525
Are you saying my mind is dirty then?

42
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,901
Kwon Jae-gyeong.

43
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,069
You liked him.

44
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,490
You still have feelings for him.

45
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,703
That was just one-sided love.

46
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,124
You even loved him?

47
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,546
Who considers one-sided love as love?

48
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,173
The word "love" is still there.

49
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,093
Don't do that to other guys.

50
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:08,886
I hate it.

51
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,773
Are you feeling better?

52
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,025
You must be very worried.

53
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,445
Sin-yu, you said

54
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,322
it doesn't matter
whether spells work or not,

55
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,366
but it matters to me.

56
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,287
I'm concerned about the curse doll.

57
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,580
Please take care.

58
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,125
I will.

59
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,089
Don't catch a cold from the cold wind.

60
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,924
-Go home now.
-You go first.

61
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,218
I said it first.

62
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,261
Go now.

63
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,473
I won't leave until you do.

64
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,974
It's cold.

65
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,894
You said I should avoid the cold wind.

66
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,734
All right, then.

67
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,986
I'll get going.

68
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,072
I'm leaving.

69
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:18,831
Go now.

70
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,298
I said go.

71
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:54,450
I think I loved her back then too.

72
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,454
The view.

73
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,165
The smell.

74
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,461
The feel.

75
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,049
Everything was vivid.

76
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,013
Even the emotions I felt at that moment.

77
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,934
Everything felt real.

78
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,395
Finally.

79
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,480
There's one more person

80
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,191
who remembers the past life.

81
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,361
Is that really my past life?

82
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,781
A lot of people remember their past lives.

83
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,408
More than you think.

84
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,618
I remember everything too.

85
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,663
When you said inseverable destinies,

86
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,416
did you mean this?

87
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,919
Karma is as strong as an iron chain.

88
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,797
It doesn't disappear
even after kalpas of time.

89
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,925
But why am I the only one who sees

90
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,177
and remembers it?

91
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,222
Why don't you ask her?

92
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,643
I won't.

93
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,770
You think you might sound crazy?

94
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:07,815
Just because.

95
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,068
I'm scared for some reason.

96
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,946
People and their destinies

97
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,574
can come together at different times.

98
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,577
Since you are reborn after a long time,

99
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,955
you can live according to
the destinies that you encounter.

100
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:28,002
You cannot burn what is already burnt.

101
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,004
Make sure you have no regrets.

102
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:40,181
NURI NURSING HOSPITAL

103
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:51,233
NA-YEON

104
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:02,036
SIN-YU

105
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,717
Hey, this…

106
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,264
This whiskey is from
the movie Decision To Leave.

107
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,101
Do you know why I chose this whiskey?

108
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,104
So you can decide to leave him.

109
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:31,482
I'm not leaving him.

110
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,778
Men hate persistent women.

111
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,324
If I'm not, our relationship will end.

112
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,454
Why do you live like that with that face?

113
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,165
If I were a woman and had your face,

114
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,417
I wouldn't live like you.

115
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,170
I like Sin-yu a lot.

116
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,009
Then why do you sleep with me?

117
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,263
Because he doesn't fill my loneliness.

118
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,741
Hye-jeong is on a trip.

119
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,493
The house is empty, come in.

120
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,328
No.

121
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,122
Get in the car.

122
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,642
Did you reflect on yourself yesterday?

123
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,063
Where are we going?

124
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,357
Wherever it is, let's go quickly.

125
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,651
-Na-yeon.
-Shall we eat ramyeon by Han River?

126
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,779
You never tried it, right?
I heard it's really good.

127
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,949
Wherever we go now,
our way back will be terrible.

128
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,327
So I'll just say it here.

129
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,286
Don't.

130
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,830
I don't want to hear it.

131
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,422
Na-yeon.

132
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,760
You said you'd end it.

133
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,221
I can't.

134
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,641
I'll let it slide.

135
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,559
I'll turn a blind eye.

136
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,311
You said you wavered for a while.

137
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,274
I don't know how different wavering is

138
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,194
from love.

139
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,158
Ever since we started dating,

140
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,036
you never once said you loved me.

141
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,123
And now are you saying you love Hong-jo?

142
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,092
No way.

143
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,929
I would understand
if she was better than me at least.

144
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,597
She's nothing.

145
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,104
You're just confused.

146
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,107
You're just pitying
or feeling bad for her.

147
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,235
That's why she's on your mind.
You're mistaking it for love.

148
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,329
You have every right to judge me.

149
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,832
-I'm the worst.
-Yes.

150
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:36,709
You're the worst.

151
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,628
How can you do this to me?

152
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,715
I'm sorry I left you alone on Christmas.

153
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,137
Are you pure now?

154
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:32,723
Yes.

155
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,857
Don't accept it.

156
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,319
-Mr. Kwon.
-A bouquet?

157
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,905
He has no right to give you one.
Come to me.

158
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,240
Don't go.

159
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,742
Let go of her.

160
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,035
You let go first.

161
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,078
You let go.

162
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,287
-Let go.
-Let go.

163
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,039
Come here.

164
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,791
I'll make you happy.

165
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,418
I can make you happier, you know that.
Let go of her.

166
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,921
Don't fight over me.

167
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,339
I can make you happy.

168
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:06,507
Let her go.

169
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,925
-Let go.
-I said, let go.

170
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,426
Guys.

171
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,804
Don't fight over me.

172
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,056
Goodness. Sin-yu!

173
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,641
-Watch out.
-Watch out, Sin-yu.

174
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,372
Why do humans have imagination?

175
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,293
I got excited for nothing.

176
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,590
How was your Christmas?

177
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,675
Well…

178
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,052
No blind date nor Gi-hoon.

179
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,596
I spent a depressing one
with NewTube in the end.

180
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,433
Next year, no matter what,
I'll have a romantic one.

181
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,519
With that man.

182
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:09,194
Mr. Jang.

183
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,280
I finally get to see you.

184
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,907
I was so shocked
when I heard you were on sick leave.

185
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,326
Don't ever get sick again.

186
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,457
Okay. Did you sleep well?

187
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,252
Yes, I'm a heavy sleeper, so…

188
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,879
What about you, Hong-jo?

189
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,217
I slept well too.

190
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,220
That's good to hear.

191
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,392
Eleventh floor.

192
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:42,227
Seventh floor.

193
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,273
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

194
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,609
I'm sorry.

195
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,027
There's no space.

196
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,075
Doors closing.

197
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,664
Mr. Jang, you're very tall.

198
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,000
Your body's so well-proportioned.

199
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,127
My body proportion
is more like an insect's.

200
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,004
Head, thorax, abdomen.

201
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,265
I'm here.

202
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,190
Doors opening.

203
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:30,859
Excuse me.

204
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,334
How's the CCTV setup going?

205
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,586
It was pretty expensive.

206
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,171
You'll pay for it, right?

207
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,882
As long as you send pictures
of where they're set up.

208
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,969
Why? Do you think I'll overcharge you?

209
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,679
Forget it. I'll pay.

210
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,014
I'm not so stingy like you.

211
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,641
You are stingy.

212
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,061
You invited me to lunch
and here we are at the cafeteria.

213
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,357
Our cafeteria's stir-fried squid
and kimchi soup make the best pairing.

214
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,487
You're rather childish
with your food choices.

215
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,907
See? He didn't get seasoned bracken.

216
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,200
I'm not childish.

217
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,827
I just don't eat bracken.

218
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,120
I have bad memories.

219
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,623
This person got bitten
by a snake while picking bracken.

220
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,085
Who got bitten by a snake?

221
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,468
It's nothing. Eat up.

222
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,727
Why didn't Mr. Gong go on the blind date?

223
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,812
His blind date isn't the issue now.

224
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,063
We need blind dates.

225
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,523
Mr. Biases are there.

226
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,026
Mr. Biases? Who is he?

227
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,903
My top three biases.

228
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,863
Mr. Jang, Mr. Kwon, and Gi-dong.

229
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:01,033
Three men, three women.
It's like a three-on-three blind date.

230
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:02,993
We can't do it.

231
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,871
His girlfriend is here.

232
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,456
May I join?

233
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,301
She's still pretty,
and they still haven't broken up.

234
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,845
What a terrible sight.
I shouldn't have come here.

235
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:26,850
Hey.

236
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,021
You might find
this question uncomfortable, but--

237
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,272
Then don't ask.

238
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,899
How did you two end up dating?

239
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,111
I kept hitting on him.

240
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,614
So beauties like you
make the first move too.

241
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:45,160
If you two aren't dating anyone,
I can set you up with my friends.

242
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,996
That would be great.

243
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,873
I'll pass.

244
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:51,667
Why?

245
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,294
You're not dating anyone either.

246
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:56,922
I have someone I like.

247
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,261
Why don't you try at least?

248
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,680
I doubt you will end up
with the person you like.

249
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,685
You're a cold person,
but her persistence won your heart.

250
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,436
Oh, I see.

251
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,647
So you want to keep hitting on her too?

252
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,232
I don't have to.

253
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,525
I'll just see her.

254
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,987
Just seeing her doesn't mean anything.

255
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,740
I know you like chickens,
but don't count them before they hatch.

256
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,451
What's wrong, Sin-yu?

257
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,037
Did I tell you this?

258
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,082
You guys look perfect together.

259
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,355
Can we have a cup of tea in your office?

260
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,108
You were being so showy in the cafeteria.

261
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,736
It makes me uncomfortable.

262
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,740
Because of Hong-jo, not others.
Am I right?

263
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:08,410
I made a promise,
so I'm doing my best to keep it.

264
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,078
So don't be sarcastic.

265
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,185
Hi, Hong-jo
of Greenway Building Division speaking.

266
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,699
How was

267
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,452
your lunch?

268
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,498
It was fine.

269
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,627
Don't you

270
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:03,006
have something to tell me?

271
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:09,638
About the feeding station,
it's illegal. You need to take it down.

272
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,432
You can't keep it
unless you change the rules.

273
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,104
Is that all you want to say?

274
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,486
Keep your self-defense tools with you.

275
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,449
I will.

276
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,267
Hi, I'm Legal Advisor Jang Sin-yu.

277
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,019
Can I see the business registration,

278
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:02,482
registry information, and the company seal
of Green Landscape Garden?

279
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,950
What's so good about this
that he nags me so much?

280
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,788
Thank you for giving it back to me.

281
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,957
You didn't have to come all the way here.

282
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,042
I would've brought it to you after work.

283
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,129
I had things to do around here.

284
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,925
My depression worsened recently.

285
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,969
So I went for counseling.

286
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,306
Did you go to a psychiatrist?

287
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,058
No. A fortune teller.

288
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:39,311
Fortune teller?

289
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:43,648
Talking to a fortune teller
when I'm down makes me feel better.

290
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,068
She was really good.

291
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,196
As soon as I sat down, she said,

292
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,698
"You're here because of a man."

293
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:53,742
She got it right.

294
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,494
Even I can guess that much.

295
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,413
Men have women issues

296
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,998
and women have men issues.

297
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,499
It's obvious.

298
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,335
It wasn't obvious at all.

299
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,839
My husband is a pain in the neck,

300
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,800
and I'm worried about Sin-yu.

301
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,887
If you're so depressed,

302
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,848
why don't you start acting again?

303
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:25,190
They say better never than late.

304
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,568
It's too late for me.

305
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:39,287
YOON NA-YEON

306
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,130
Hi. What's up?

307
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,469
You want me to break up with him, right?

308
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,847
But that will never happen.

309
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,516
Our wedding date is set.

310
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:05,397
Why did you call me out to say this?
I doubt you want me to catch the bouquet.

311
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,107
So you can snap out of it.

312
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,819
Just like you thought we were friends,

313
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:13,154
you're being mistaken again.

314
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,491
Thinking that Sin-yu might come to you.

315
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,829
Something happened between you two.

316
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,247
We might move in together.

317
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,915
His parents want that.

318
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,417
It was expected.

319
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,921
We've been dating for two years,
staying together 24/7.

320
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,673
We didn't want to stay apart.

321
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,010
And Sin-yu doesn't like holding hands.

322
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,303
Especially in winter.

323
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:39,222
He's worried his cold hands
might make mine cold too.

324
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,559
He doesn't sleep much,
but when I pat his hair,

325
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,852
he falls asleep fast.

326
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,520
Do I need to know these things?

327
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,939
I don't want to know any of this.

328
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,235
You've never had
a long-term relationship, have you?

329
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:57,198
Countless things happen
in a long-term relationship.

330
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,992
You fight and make up.

331
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:00,702
You get close and distant.

332
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,662
Then you get close again.

333
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,707
We can't break up that easily.

334
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,585
That's what it's like.

335
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,211
He might waver for a while,

336
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,380
but he comes back in the end.

337
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,095
I can tell you're very anxious,

338
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,514
seeing that you're saying
all these unnecessary things.

339
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,601
He was with me last night too.

340
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:26,978
Hong-jo.

341
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,147
Don't trust men so much.

342
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,859
Sin-yu's a man too.

343
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,202
The CEO told me to feel you out

344
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,870
on whether you want to return.

345
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,373
I don't plan to go back.

346
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,126
Is working in City Hall fun?

347
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,127
Isn't it boring?

348
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:52,545
It's fun.

349
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,132
Although things are a bit tough now.

350
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,134
Then again,

351
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,053
all work is tough.

352
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,264
Still, acting sounds fun.

353
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,394
Acting like how?

354
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,605
Not that kind of acting.

355
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,899
Acting, as in
what actors and actresses do.

356
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:13,900
Don't.

357
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,485
You have no talent in acting.

358
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,238
I'm not saying I want to be an actor.

359
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,073
Actually, I'm acting at the moment.

360
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,201
I miss her. I want to be with her.

361
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:26,663
It's driving me crazy,
but I'm acting like I'm fine.

362
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,749
If you miss her, just tell her to come.

363
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,002
You don't even drink.
It's a waste of wine.

364
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:36,047
The CEO gave me the corporate card,

365
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,591
so I splurged on the wine.
It's over a million won.

366
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:40,552
Call Na-yeon. Let's drink together.

367
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,934
I must be honest with you.

368
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,436
When were you not?

369
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:51,980
Just as I thought.

370
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,400
I have a crush on someone.

371
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,405
What?

372
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,076
Who? What happened?

373
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,370
You don't easily fall for anyone.

374
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:11,499
This is the first time
I've heard you saying you like someone.

375
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,302
Hey, wake up.

376
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,304
Go home and sleep.

377
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,683
Call Sin-yu.

378
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,852
I miss him.

379
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:35,940
I'll call a driver.

380
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,442
Where's your car?

381
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,778
Aren't you curious?

382
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,239
If I tell him I'm here,

383
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:46,868
will he come or not?

384
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,629
Do you believe in reincarnation?

385
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,130
Of course I do.

386
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,341
Then you'll understand this.

387
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,551
Actually,

388
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,763
I've loved her since long ago.

389
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,474
She's your first love.

390
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,185
From elementary school?

391
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,978
Or from kindergarten?

392
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,522
LEE HONG-JO

393
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,608
No.

394
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,402
Way before that.

395
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:24,072
Way before that?

396
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,242
Were you two born in the same hospital?
Don't be silly.

397
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,952
I need to answer this call.

398
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,874
Yes.

399
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:42,882
Where are you?

400
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:17,876
You're here.

401
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,628
Take Na-yeon.

402
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:29,429
What happened?
It's odd you were drinking together.

403
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,766
She called,

404
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,101
so I had to come.

405
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,104
She said random things to me
and then got drunk.

406
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,648
What things?

407
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,277
Things I didn't want to know.

408
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,701
Whatever she said, don't mind it.

409
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,244
How can I not?

410
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:56,623
Do you know what I was thinking
after I called you?

411
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:01,544
Let's talk later.

412
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:05,965
I've got to go.

413
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,896
I can't believe he actually came.

414
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:46,607
Mr. Kwon?

415
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,118
I'm sorry.

416
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,328
I didn't know it was you.

417
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:04,333
What were you doing there
in the middle of the night?

418
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,544
I just wanted to share some food with you.

419
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,217
My landlord sent a parcel.

420
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:14,969
And there was a note inside

421
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,014
with some kimchi and eggs,

422
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,059
saying I should share
half of them with you.

423
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,937
Still, you didn't have to come
at this late hour.

424
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:27,815
Because it was late,

425
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,567
I was worried

426
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,527
if you came home safely.

427
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,989
We even put up a CCTV to protect you and…

428
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:36,741
Gosh.

429
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,661
I'm sorry.

430
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,416
If you're sorry,

431
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,293
be my plus-one.

432
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,754
Sorry?

433
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,803
Are you turning me down
after ruining my face?

434
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,388
Fine.

435
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,855
I must go home, but I can't see.

436
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,982
Am I going blind?

437
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,404
I can't go to the gathering anyway.

438
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,367
Who are you?

439
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,786
Do you want to be my plus-one?

440
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:23,955
I'll go.

441
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,040
Happy now?

442
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,418
You promised.

443
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,355
You woke up.

444
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,615
Why are you here?

445
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,785
We could've gone to your place.

446
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:05,538
Don't get me wrong.

447
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,541
I came to tell you something.

448
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:09,959
That's why I waited.

449
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,253
Don't meet with Hong-jo.

450
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,799
You're so mean.

451
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,885
I'm prepared to hear you say that.

452
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,083
He was with me last night too.

453
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,458
I'll get going.

454
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,293
Good luck.

455
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,422
Thank you. See you later.

456
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,632
See you later.

457
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,437
JANG SIN-YU, LEGAL ADVISOR

458
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,240
Hello. Lee Hong-jo speaking.

459
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,783
Come up to my office now.

460
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,494
What is it about?

461
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,621
You'll find out when you come up.

462
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,513
Have a seat.

463
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,103
Why did you come like that?

464
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,942
What do you mean?

465
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,694
Why did you dress up so nicely?

466
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,195
Because I wanted to.

467
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,573
I know he gave you a ride this morning.

468
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:50,036
What would others think if they find out
you're carpooling with Jae-gyeong?

469
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,329
It can be misleading.

470
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,621
What about you?

471
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,831
-Me?
-Last night.

472
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,666
Why did you do that?

473
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:57,585
Are you jealous?

474
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,295
I'm not jealous. I'm annoyed.

475
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,671
What are you playing at?

476
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,214
You told me to wait.

477
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:05,343
You said you'd wait,
but then you carpooled with him.

478
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:06,969
Yes, we carpooled.

479
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:10,348
Because it shortens
my 40-minute commute to 20 minutes.

480
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,016
You promised to be pure.

481
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,060
You're not pure either.

482
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:18,230
Do you know what I was thinking
while waiting for you at the bar?

483
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:22,109
I was wishing you wouldn't come
to pick Na-yeon up.

484
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,402
That's what I was thinking.

485
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,696
I'm wishing for a couple to break up.

486
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,531
I'm worried about it not happening.

487
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,826
I get suspicious and jealous
about what might've happened.

488
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:35,081
Do you know how terrible this feels?

489
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,002
Is that why you go around with Jae-gyeong?

490
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,796
You go around with Na-yeon too.

491
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,047
It's not the same.

492
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,965
I even told you that I loved you.

493
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,509
And you still don't trust me?

494
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,970
I'm not the only one you love.

495
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,390
There are a lot of people you love.

496
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:57,520
So I guess it's possible for you
to love a lot of people at the same time?

497
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,438
You like both me and Jae-gyeong.

498
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,440
Maybe. I'm not sure about my feelings.

499
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,651
Because of all the mixed signals.

500
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,283
So words are not enough.

501
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:49,947
What are you doing?

502
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,032
You're not even pure.

503
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,618
I'm doing this
because I'm not pure right now.

504
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,846
Mr. Jang.

505
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:20,394
You two…

506
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,354
What are you doing?

507
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,148
Can't you tell?

508
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,233
We were consulting.

509
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,490
I think you pushed her.

510
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,658
No. The chair slid by itself.

511
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,495
-The wheels work well.
-Did they lube it?

512
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,498
Thanks for the consultation.

513
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,582
Thank you.

514
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:47,338
Can't you knock before you enter?

515
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,673
I used a coupon for it.

516
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,676
It's valid until this year. What is it?

517
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,679
Mr. Kwon is going
to a couple gathering today.

518
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,806
He didn't tell me who his partner was.

519
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,226
-Should I find out?
-Please don't.

520
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,186
And

521
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:03,687
get out.

522
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,065
Right now.

523
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,651
Right now?

524
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:20,746
Ms. Ma.

525
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,998
I sent you next year's business report.

526
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,416
I'm reading it now.

527
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,544
ONJU CITY'S 2023 FIRST HALF

528
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,379
Since my work's done,

529
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,130
can I get off work early?

530
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,636
Where are you going all dressed up?

531
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,556
Give me a good reason for playing hooky.

532
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,182
I'm not playing hooky.

533
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,433
I have a blind date.

534
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,271
I knew it.

535
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,731
That's why you dressed so nicely today.

536
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:49,650
Oh my.

537
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,735
Is that blind date still ongoing?

538
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,320
How persistent.

539
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:56,699
You can't go early.

540
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,870
If I can't get off work,
then I'm going to the restroom.

541
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,999
I'll go to the restroom now.

542
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,462
You look gorgeous!

543
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,434
Gong.

544
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,937
Dinner's on me today.

545
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,857
I said I was going on a blind date.

546
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:35,237
Obviously, I don't want you to.
What do you think that means?

547
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,874
Your face and eyes look okay now.

548
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,044
I massaged them all night
and thought about you.

549
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,505
That's why I had bad dreams.

550
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,175
Not in a bad way.

551
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,178
You kept popping up
in my mind, so I smiled.

552
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,058
Hong-jo. I have something to say.

553
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,936
You might be shocked
to hear this so suddenly.

554
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,522
Is that gathering for couples cancelled?

555
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:12,775
How did you know?

556
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,652
Is it really cancelled?

557
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,237
-Yes.
-Why?

558
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,783
It's a gathering for couples,

559
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:23,285
but two of the couples broke up recently.

560
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,290
Then where are we going now?

561
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,920
There's something on your face.

562
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,713
-Beauty?
-How did you know?

563
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,567
This parking lot is huge,

564
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,278
and we're the only ones here.

565
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,034
Who would go on a car picnic
at minus 12 degrees?

566
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:07,287
Then why are we doing it?

567
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:10,332
Isn't it pretty nice?

568
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,919
Both Seoul
and the night view of Han River.

569
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,588
It's been a while. I like it.

570
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:21,510
I don't like it that much.

571
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,595
I'm cold

572
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,097
and hungry.

573
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:28,475
Wait for a bit.

574
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,900
ORDER 1 CRISPY CHILI CHICKEN

575
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:39,903
Isn't it delicious?

576
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:40,946
It feels less cold.

577
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,156
You're right.

578
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,324
This is the best thing you did today.

579
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,747
Eat the drumstick.
This means I'm giving you my everything.

580
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,916
I prefer chicken breast.

581
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:54,710
Here it is.

582
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:57,671
Breast?

583
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,023
Where are you?

584
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,166
Aren't you replying?

585
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:42,549
Have you ever been
in a long-term relationship?

586
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:48,889
If you date for longer than two years,
is it hard to break up?

587
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,605
Breaking up is easy.

588
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,566
What's hard is dating someone else.

589
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:04,279
The longer it was,
the longer time you need to move on.

590
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:10,786
If you dated for two years,

591
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,914
will it take two years to move on?

592
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,460
That depends on the individual,

593
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:21,004
but if you truly cared for that person,

594
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:25,884
the process of moving on
may take around that long.

595
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:31,640
Some people date someone else
right after they break up.

596
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:35,018
That kind of relationship won't last long.

597
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,813
They'll compare
their new lover with their ex

598
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,524
or keep being reminded of their ex.

599
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:45,654
I see.

600
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:51,577
Breaking up sounds hard.

601
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,869
Yes, it is hard.

602
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,454
So don't wait for Sin-yu.

603
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,669
I'm confessing my feelings now.

604
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,382
Don't get shaken up by Sin-yu.

605
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:07,134
Come to me.

606
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:31,950
This is Hong-jo's.

607
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:43,670
How can that make this into a thriller?
Tell me your plan at least.

608
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:44,630
I feel disgusted.

609
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:47,841
I'll just

610
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,594
make a wish.

611
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:54,598
Hey.

612
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,850
If you're doing it, do it quick.

613
00:48:57,392 --> 00:48:58,977
I have no time to wait.

614
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:01,516
My goodness.

615
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:05,061
Why bother covering yourself?
I saw it all yesterday.

616
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,193
Eat breakfast.

617
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,320
Then go home, get changed, and go to work.

618
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:16,281
Don't wear the same clothes.
They'll find out.

619
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:19,117
I wear the same clothes for a week,

620
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,243
so it's fine.

621
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,288
Hey.

622
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,332
Are we dating starting today?

623
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:27,834
What are you saying?

624
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,920
Don't be so old-fashioned.

625
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:35,842
She must be embarrassed.

626
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:39,054
WHY AREN'T YOU REPLYING?
YOU'RE NOT WITH JAE-GYEONG ARE YOU?

627
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:41,807
I'M CALLING IF YOU KEEP DOING THIS.
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE PURE!

628
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,734
It's me, Sin-yu.

629
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,986
Hong-jo, come up right now.

630
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,249
Hong-jo, why aren't you checking your…

631
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,382
You said you'd keep your promise.

632
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,634
Is this keeping your promise?

633
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,345
You broke the promise.

634
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,681
You'll have to pay for this.

635
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,945
Who comes into my office without knocking?

636
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:40,866
Na-yeon.

637
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:42,826
What's up?

638
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,452
Why do you look so down?

639
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:45,370
Dad.

640
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:47,706
I need to ask you a favor.

641
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,001
YOON HAK-YEONG, ONJU CITY MAYOR

642
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:05,307
Can't you come quickly when I call?

643
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,686
I was at the budget meeting.

644
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:11,938
Is there something wrong?

645
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:18,403
Lee Hong-jo in Greenway Building Division.

646
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:20,405
Transfer her to another branch.

647
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:24,034
-Excuse me?
-One more thing.

648
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:27,871
About Bawoo Construction…

649
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:35,170
Did you get it from Gi-dong?
Don't you know how to knock?

650
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:36,713
What the hell did you do?

651
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,298
Is this how you do things?

652
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,175
What's with your attitude?

653
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,302
Please explain what you're trying to say.

654
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:45,180
Mayor told me to transfer Hong-jo

655
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:49,893
because she defamed
the civil servants by hitting on you.

656
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:53,063
This is all your fault.

657
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:57,442
Because you didn't behave properly,
she's the one being accused.

658
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:04,366
Thank you for telling me what's going on.

659
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,661
Whatever it is, I'll deal with it.
Keep your nose out of it.

660
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:10,747
I can't keep my nose out of it
until you get this sorted out.

661
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,333
-How are you going to fix this?
-Too bad.

662
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:16,378
I'm too busy to explain it to you now.

663
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:26,846
Why are you here?

664
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,394
Mayor called me up.

665
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:37,482
You don't need to go.

666
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:41,778
What are you doing?

667
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:46,533
Where are we going?

668
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,575
Let go of my hand.

669
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,536
People are looking at us.

670
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,371
Seriously…

671
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,747
Isn't he Jang Sin-yu?

672
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,293
Everyone can see us. What are you doing?

673
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,005
This could spread weird rumors, you know.

674
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,924
I'm doing this because it doesn't matter.

675
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:06,886
Get in the car.

676
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:25,822
Put your seat belt on.

677
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:28,992
Where are we going?
I'm supposed to be at work now.

678
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:30,535
Submit a report.

679
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,517
You never listen to others, do you?

680
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:57,562
Aren't you going to tell me
why you're doing this?

681
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,780
Na-yeon made me make a promise.

682
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:09,741
Everyone in City Hall knew we were dating,

683
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,994
so she'd be too embarrassed
to work if we broke up.

684
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:18,374
So she asked me to keep it a secret.

685
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,585
She asked me to pretend

686
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,922
that nothing happened
until the construction was over.

687
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:28,426
I accepted that request

688
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,221
because of you.

689
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,893
People just found out
about me and Na-yeon,

690
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:40,688
so people would've judged you
for dating me.

691
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:46,027
That's why I wanted to take it
as slow as possible.

692
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:48,488
I wanted a peaceful start

693
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:50,490
even if it meant we had to start late.

694
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:55,829
I thought… that's the right thing
to do to show you respect.

695
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,749
But none of that matters now.

696
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:03,044
I'm going to side with you openly now.

697
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:12,387
Then both of us will get in trouble.

698
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,181
People will point fingers at us.

699
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:16,975
They'll bad-mouth us.

700
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:21,229
That's why I need to know your feelings.

701
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,816
So I know what I should do.

702
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:27,610
Tell me.

703
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,072
Tell me what you're feeling now.

704
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,169
I…

705
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:52,844
feel

706
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,013
strange.

707
00:57:58,516 --> 00:57:59,601
Somehow,

708
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:02,061
it feels like

709
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:05,773
I've been caring about you
for a very long time.

710
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:12,989
You're right.

711
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:16,618
We cared for each other.

712
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:21,706
Though you probably don't remember.

713
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,650
DESTINED WITH YOU

714
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:56,069
You started having
tactile hallucinations again?

715
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,320
Are you okay?

716
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,781
I didn't have this symptom for a while.

717
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:03,117
There's no spell to use on a sick person.

718
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,328
You said you liked someone.

719
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:06,829
And that was Hong-jo?

720
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,665
Be thorough if you're going to do it.

721
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,375
Did you have the dream again?

722
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:12,710
You had a high status
and I was a lowly being.

723
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:14,462
By any chance,

724
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:17,757
if I was your mortal enemy
in our past lives,

725
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:19,967
