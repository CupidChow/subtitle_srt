1
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,966
DESTINED WITH YOU

2
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,596
EPISODE 3

3
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,624
NA-YEON

4
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:30,799
Hello?

5
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,974
She waited a long time.

6
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,685
I'll leave her be until she wakes up.

7
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,770
Okay.

8
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,535
I won't wake up.

9
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,372
I died 30 minutes ago.

10
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,586
Your loved one has died.

11
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,046
How can you be so calm?

12
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,264
Ouch.

13
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,307
It's too late.

14
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,893
I told you to hurry. You dawdled, right?

15
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,937
You don't love me anymore.

16
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,814
I had a car accident.

17
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,984
I sent the car to a repair shop
and took a cab here.

18
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:37,944
That's why I'm late.

19
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,487
Why did you come here then?

20
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,822
Go to the hospital.

21
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,573
You were dying to see me.

22
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:43,700
I had to save you.

23
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,618
Are you crazy?

24
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,036
Let's go to the hospital.

25
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,080
It was nothing.

26
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,749
How is it nothing?

27
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,919
It was a car crash.
You could get health issues later.

28
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:59,424
Then you'll say your back hurts
so you can't go far for the honeymoon.

29
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,717
I hate stuff like that.

30
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,763
That won't happen.

31
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,314
Na-yeon.

32
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,903
I knew something was going on

33
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,115
when you decided to quit your job
and moved to Onju on your own.

34
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,410
Dad said you came to help him
and felt so proud.

35
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,995
But that's not why, right?

36
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,874
My friend's getting married soon.

37
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,709
She asked me to catch the bouquet.

38
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,544
That's why I had drinks.

39
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,757
And we had so much fun talking
about who'd catch my bouquet.

40
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,802
Why today of all days?

41
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,019
I have a question.

42
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,646
Are we breaking up?

43
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,316
Then what is this?

44
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,651
Why do you need time? For what?

45
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,528
There is something I need to figure out.

46
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,238
We can figure it out together.

47
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,157
I need to do it alone.

48
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,038
Can you wait a little for me?

49
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,965
"When the rose
starts to bloom in the milk,

50
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,847
burn this page
and mix it with the ingredients."

51
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,237
"When the rose blooms completely,

52
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,988
filter it in a burlap bag."

53
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,283
"When the water becomes clear…

54
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,872
it'll become a love potion."

55
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:05,299
"Make the person you want
to charm drink it."

56
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:20,940
Su-yeong.

57
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,859
-Let's guide everyone in the lobby.
-Okay.

58
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,163
ONJEONG-DONG GENERAL MEETING

59
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,712
POLICY ADVISOR KWON JAE-GYEONG

60
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,411
I'm counting on you.

61
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,934
Good morning.

62
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,103
We're so busy lately, right?
Thanks for your hard work.

63
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,772
Have a seat.

64
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,689
Yes.

65
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,026
-Mr. Park.
-Yes?

66
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,820
Congrats on your son
getting into university.

67
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:50,947
Gosh, thank you.

68
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,365
-Next meal's on you?
-Of course.

69
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,450
-I'll keep it in mind.
-Thank you.

70
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:05,127
Gosh.

71
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:09,840
Yes, Mr. Gong.

72
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,342
Are you playing hooky somewhere?

73
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,971
-I had something to do.
-The mayor's gone crazy, thanks to you.

74
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,055
What?

75
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,515
Stop playing and come back now.

76
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,558
Okay.

77
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,438
Urban Planning Division's main tasks,

78
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:28,401
the checklist, and the case analyses.

79
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,570
Who wants to present first?

80
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,862
Did he drink it or not?

81
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:42,748
Go to Onjeong-dong.

82
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,376
-The hanging baskets were destroyed.
-But why?

83
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,086
How would I know?

84
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,213
The mayor saw it on his way to work.

85
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,214
You're in trouble.

86
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,757
-I'll go right now.
-Be quick.

87
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,488
You're taking a day off already?

88
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,532
You said

89
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,577
that nobody would come
for a consultation for a while.

90
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,829
Still, it's too soon.

91
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:26,417
I really didn't want to ask
for your help,

92
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,169
but I have no choice.

93
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,505
There goes your day off.

94
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,549
Have a nice consultation.

95
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,890
Some lunatic crashed into the median strip

96
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,101
and wrecked the hanging baskets
along a 50-meter stretch.

97
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,020
What should I do?

98
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,481
Don't do anything.

99
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,274
The insurance will cover it.

100
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,109
We worked so hard hanging them.

101
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,820
Not just me, but the seniors too.

102
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:59,116
We worked while drivers
cussed at us for blocking the road.

103
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:01,952
I can't let it slide.

104
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:05,206
I'll sue the person.
I'm pretty sure he drank and drove.

105
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,667
It wasn't drunk driving.

106
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,460
Then it was drowsy driving.

107
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,213
Someone who's sober
couldn't crash into them like that.

108
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,382
The brakes didn't work.

109
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,844
Are you siding with the offender now?
You're the City Hall's lawyer.

110
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,056
Citizens sue civil servants
for the smallest things.

111
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,599
Why can't we sue someone too?

112
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,226
They're a criminal.

113
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,646
According to the Civil Law,
he's only responsible for the damage.

114
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,899
He filed a report,
the insurance company came,

115
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,526
the police investigated him,

116
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,778
and he proved that it wasn't intentional.

117
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,739
So he didn't violate
the Criminal Act, Road Traffic Act,

118
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,366
nor Special Traffic Accidents.

119
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,203
How do you know
if it was intentional or not?

120
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:47,039
Did he say
that he didn't do it intentionally?

121
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,625
Yes.

122
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,211
Did you meet him?

123
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,798
You're meeting him now too.

124
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,135
What…

125
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,432
-Don't tell me…
-It was me who caused the accident.

126
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,769
Why on earth did you do that?

127
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,856
Shouldn't you ask if I'm okay first?

128
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,358
You're worried about baskets, not me?

129
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,736
You're perfectly fine. You even
went to the development plan meeting.

130
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,281
How did you know I was there?

131
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,703
You're no help.

132
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,788
Go down and apply for a day off.

133
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,459
-Meet me in the parking lot in ten.
-Why?

134
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,586
You're going on a trip with me.

135
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,715
-Why would I?
-You promised to give me one spell

136
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,925
and take the rest yourself.

137
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,135
I want my spell today.

138
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,179
This is ridiculous.

139
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,182
You want me to take a day off
after ruining my baskets?

140
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,518
Look here. This is an emergency.

141
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,271
I need to go clean up
the mess that you made.

142
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,523
Are you the only one in your department?

143
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,027
-Others can go clean them up.
-That's my task.

144
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,195
I saw the org chart.

145
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,490
Everyone else's tasks
ended in one or two lines,

146
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,909
but yours had seven lines.

147
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,828
That's unfair.

148
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:12,041
Go tell your coworkers who are
always sitting around to clean them up.

149
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,920
Let us disappear for a day.

150
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,975
This year must not be Hong-jo's year.

151
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:33,354
She got dumped
and her work got ruined the next day.

152
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,231
She tried to steal our crush.

153
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,066
It serves her right.

154
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:39,902
Gosh.

155
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,071
Hong-jo, you were here.

156
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,490
Do you have time to sit here?

157
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,408
Clean up the mess.

158
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,329
"Gosh."

159
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,792
"Did what I say just now

160
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,753
sound like a love confession?"

161
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,798
"Yes, it did to me."

162
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,216
"Was it not?"

163
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,469
That sounded so pathetic, right?

164
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,348
My gosh.

165
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,147
Mr. Gong.

166
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,649
-Can I--
-What, a day off?

167
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,987
-Take it.
-What?

168
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,157
I didn't think it through yesterday.

169
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:31,287
It's best to take a day off
to overcome heartbreak.

170
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,752
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone.

171
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:42,047
MA EUN-YEONG

172
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,133
Is everything okay?

173
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,968
Eun-yeong, are you okay?

174
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,640
You can just reply with a period.

175
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,446
How could someone so educated

176
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,114
believe in such a superstition?

177
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,159
It's not like he's going to pay me extra.

178
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,077
Why I should go on this trip?

179
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,789
Because if you get a boyfriend,
it's thanks to me.

180
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,587
You must've believed
in such a superstition.

181
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,631
Give me that.

182
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,383
Someone so educated like you
used the Love Spell already?

183
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,426
Give me that.

184
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,303
Take it if you can.

185
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,765
Tickle, tickle.

186
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,196
Yes, I got it.

187
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,912
I didn't use the Love Spell.

188
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,082
That's the only page missing.

189
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,627
It wasn't that.

190
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,005
I used the spell
for losing weight or getting pretty.

191
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,507
I have a photographic memory.

192
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,925
I remember everything.

193
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,637
Should I recite the book
from beginning to end?

194
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,894
Fine. I used the Love Spell.
Are you happy now?

195
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,521
You're very fast.

196
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,855
When did you use it?

197
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:25,317
You said it was mine.
It doesn't matter how I use it.

198
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,199
The spell book is precious,
so put it in the wooden box.

199
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,993
I will.

200
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,396
Did he drink it?

201
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:03,772
He must have.

202
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,442
I hope he drank it.

203
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,986
Why does it have to be today?

204
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,365
I happen to want it today.

205
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,536
The hanging baskets were totally wrecked,

206
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,829
but your car seems fine.

207
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,248
That car is in the repair shop.

208
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,709
So you have two cars.

209
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,419
Your dad gave you everything.

210
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,921
What more do you want with the spell?

211
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,967
I need to know too.

212
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,721
What spell do you want so badly
that we have to drive this far?

213
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,972
Don't worry.

214
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,266
I won't take the Fair Skin Spell.

215
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,402
By the way,

216
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,031
are you hurt anywhere?

217
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,784
It was a car accident after all.

218
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,286
Is it okay for you to drive?

219
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,497
Do you want to drive instead?

220
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:02,831
Can you drive?

221
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,917
Of course, I can. Gosh!

222
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,879
My license is kept safely in my closet,
so it's clean, I should've brought it.

223
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:11,548
Why keep your license
in the closet? To wear it?

224
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,304
It's a self-driving car.

225
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,639
Don't worry and sleep.

226
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,017
I'm not the type to sleep in a car.

227
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,770
That's rude to the driver.

228
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,149
I see.

229
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,616
Should I stop by the rest…

230
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,786
I guess not.

231
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:04,203
I become red
only in front of someone I like.

232
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:09,917
Did what I say just now
sound like a love confession?

233
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,811
Son Sae-byeol
of Greenway Building Division.

234
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,897
Is Ms. Lee away from her desk?

235
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,859
Is this Mr. Kwon?

236
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,820
Yes.

237
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,864
Hong-jo took a day off.

238
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,200
You can talk to me.

239
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,453
Can you spare me a second?

240
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,540
Just me?

241
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,258
Why did you want to meet us?

242
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,388
You guys filmed
and spread the video, right?

243
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,057
We didn't.

244
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,102
I did film it, but I didn't spread it.

245
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,437
I just showed it to her.

246
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,523
It wasn't me either.

247
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,151
Well…

248
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,822
I showed it to just one person
in the PR team.

249
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:26,201
Filming a video
without consent is illegal.

250
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:29,162
Sorry.

251
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,040
I won't report it to the Audit Team.

252
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,502
Instead, I want you to
delete the video in front of me.

253
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,755
MOVE TO BIN

254
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,842
MOVE TO BIN

255
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,886
It might've been fun for you two,

256
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,514
but it could've hurt someone.

257
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,142
If something similar happens,

258
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,519
don't make the same mistake.

259
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,398
Goodbye.

260
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,943
He's so cool.

261
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,278
I love how cold he is.

262
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,488
Su-jeong.

263
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,907
-Yes?
-Get a grip.

264
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,243
We're totally in the doghouse.

265
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:09,911
It's okay.

266
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:13,457
We still have Jang Sin-yu.

267
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,543
You're right.

268
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:19,921
Our eyes met.

269
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,006
Go this way.

270
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:28,889
That was fast.

271
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,641
It wasn't. You slept for a long time.

272
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:37,814
Gosh.

273
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,359
It's so nice.

274
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,452
Even in an expensive place like this,

275
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,080
the owner would grill pork belly
for us if we ask, right?

276
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,040
There's no owner. This is my villa.

277
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,879
Then let's go buy some pork belly.
You have a grill, right?

278
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,799
I've never gone camping before,
so I've always wanted to try that.

279
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,051
"If there's no one else here,

280
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,470
do we have to spend the night alone?"

281
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,180
Shouldn't you react like this?

282
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,434
Does being alone with me

283
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,895
concern you?

284
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,652
Yes, very much.

285
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,320
You might do something to me.

286
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:29,825
Look.

287
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:33,328
Some people
might find you very attractive.

288
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:37,290
But to me, you're not even half of half
of half as attractive as pork belly.

289
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:39,835
I won't do anything to you,
so don't worry.

290
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,295
It's not that way.

291
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,676
Get ready. We'll climb the mountain.

292
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,221
We're going hiking?

293
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:59,062
I never thought I'd come
all the way to Jirisan Mountain.

294
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,605
Can't you find it alone?

295
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:04,276
I don't know what spell you want,
but you must've memorized it.

296
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,735
Can't you do it yourself?

297
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,988
Did you read the book properly?

298
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,949
Only those selected can cast the spells.

299
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:15,787
I didn't take you for the type
to blindly believe in shamanism.

300
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:19,166
In Joseon, they called
the spell book Book of Spells.

301
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,835
The first person
to write the book was Aeng-cho.

302
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,420
Aeng-cho was a real person.

303
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,797
I read Joseon Dynasty Records.

304
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,593
Then the book I have
is the book written by Aeng-cho?

305
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,095
Maybe.

306
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,723
What do you want me to find?

307
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,559
I can't get caught
for illegally picking a rare plant.

308
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,436
It's not protected.

309
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,937
It just grows here.

310
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,481
So what is this plant?

311
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,609
Rhododendron fauriei.

312
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,402
Rhododendron fauriei.

313
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,614
Are you sick?

314
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:54,034
Are you planning to do
the Cure Disease Spell?

315
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,497
You must be crazy.

316
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,875
In this day and age?
Come on. You're a lawyer.

317
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:06,338
-Do you believe in miracles?
-No, not at all.

318
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,132
-What about curses?
-Curses…

319
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,134
I believe in them.

320
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,303
Then you'll get what I'm going to say.

321
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,764
I am cursed.

322
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,560
Now is not the time to joke around.
Go to a hospital if you're sick.

323
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,354
You don't have time for this nonsense.

324
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:25,065
Have you ever been
desperate for something?

325
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:30,278
So desperate you would grasp at straws.

326
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:33,990
I have.

327
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:37,035
Then be quiet and keep searching
before the sun sets.

328
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,627
Now I want to do it even less.

329
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:05,397
I found it.

330
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,362
Here, I found it.

331
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:57,490
Even wizards don't entrust
their wands to Muggles.

332
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,160
You're a witch. I'm a Muggle.

333
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,412
Pluck it yourself.

334
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,916
I'm ready.

335
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,042
You can start now.
I'll be standing by you.

336
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:48,059
SPELLS OF THE HEAVENS

337
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,234
"Cure Disease Spell."

338
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,570
"Before casting the spell,

339
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,698
cleanse your mind and body by bathing."

340
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,701
"Wear neat and white clothes."

341
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:07,996
"Cast it at night,
at a place full of grass

342
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,290
when the full moon is at the highest."

343
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,085
"Place brassware on red silk

344
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,795
embroidered with plum blossoms."

345
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,590
"Add chocolate vine, wild ginseng fruits,

346
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:20,884
antler reishi,

347
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,553
and rhododendron fauriei."

348
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,932
"Mash them with a pestle
and squeeze out the juice."

349
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,777
"Sincerely hoping for the person to heal,

350
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:23,238
use the juice to write

351
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,740
on the palm of the sick person…

352
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,536
the character 'life.'"

353
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:40,797
LIFE

354
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,679
How do you feel?

355
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,558
My heart seems to be beating faster.

356
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,186
Is that a good thing?

357
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,021
Are you getting better?

358
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,408
You better go in.

359
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,911
-What?
-Go in first.

360
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:19,747
Why?

361
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,207
I'll stay with you.

362
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,792
I want to know what happens.

363
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,171
What's happening?

364
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,020
This won't do.

365
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,064
Where are you going? Stay by my side.

366
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,111
Can't you just go in first?

367
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,698
Are you getting mad at me?

368
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,201
When I came all the way here,
wore this strange dress,

369
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,995
and did my best to help you?

370
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,833
What's strange about it?

371
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,169
I think you look pretty in it.

372
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,017
What's wrong with him?

373
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,390
I hope it works.

374
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:05,520
That would mean the Love Spell works too.

375
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:13,778
Are you okay?

376
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,530
How're you feeling?

377
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:21,953
I was just worried you might've developed
an allergy from inhaling the ashes.

378
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,373
Why aren't you answering?

379
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:27,959
Are you sleeping?

380
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,966
Seriously.

381
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,609
You startled me. I thought you left.

382
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,071
Gosh.

383
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,739
The spell must've worked.

384
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,366
You look healthy.

385
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,953
Your skin looks so fair. Better than mine.

386
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,664
Wash, get changed, and pack.

387
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,332
I'm almost done.

388
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,961
We're leaving already?
After coming all the way here?

389
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:37,004
I'm feeling under the weather.

390
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,674
I couldn't sleep properly
because I had a nightmare.

391
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,093
Was the bed uncomfortable?

392
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,302
No.

393
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:46,180
My condition must've
gotten worse after the spell.

394
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,016
It could be a healing crisis.

395
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,019
Even flu takes a few days
for you to recover.

396
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:56,065
I don't know about your illness,
but you might recover slowly.

397
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,652
Pack up and come out.

398
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,541
Hong-jo took a day off.

399
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:21,841
I came all the way to Jirisan
just to go back like this?

400
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,889
I'm so unlucky.
What kind of guy does that?

401
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,851
One moment, he believes in spells.
Next, he doesn't.

402
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,019
It's Mr. Kwon.

403
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,105
It's Mr. Kwon.

404
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,156
What do I do?

405
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,166
Hello?

406
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,043
It's me, Jae-gyeong.

407
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,504
Hi. To what do I owe this call?

408
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:06,510
Is the video
the reason you didn't come to work?

409
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:09,764
Well, that's not the only reason.

410
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,641
I have some personal matters to attend to.

411
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:13,726
That's a relief.

412
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,144
I was worried about you.

413
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,189
-Me?
-Yes.

414
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:19,815
What about tomorrow?

415
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:20,816
I'll be at work.

416
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:25,404
-Can we meet after work tomorrow?
-Pardon?

417
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:27,948
Why are you surprised?

418
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:30,576
I'll text you about the time and place.

419
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,037
Okay.

420
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,504
I think the Love Spell worked.

421
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,465
He was worried
because I didn't go to work.

422
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,343
He asked about tomorrow
and to meet after work.

423
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:50,054
He'll let me know when and where to meet.

424
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:53,766
This clearly proves
that the Love Spell worked.

425
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:56,310
Is he going to confess
his feelings for you or what?

426
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,187
There's a high chance.

427
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,027
Cheer up.

428
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,863
The Cure Disease Spell
will take effect soon too.

429
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,866
See? I told you to wait.

430
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,411
Sin-yu, you're always so impatient.

431
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,371
First, you pestered me to open the box.

432
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:16,288
And now this.

433
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:20,751
Nowhere in the book did it mention
how long it would take for you to recover.

434
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,921
Just wait and see.
Because the Love Spell is working.

435
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:27,341
That means
the Cure Disease Spell will work too.

436
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,844
I'm so excited!

437
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,679
Hurray!

438
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,309
Remember. You promised
to take only one spell.

439
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,103
The rest of the spells are mine.

440
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,401
Don't change your mind.

441
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:46,777
Don't ask for more.

442
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:47,862
Okay?

443
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,363
Got it?

444
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,574
YOU CAN JUST REPLY WITH A PERIOD.

445
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,741
Good morning, sir.

446
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:53,909
Good morning.

447
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:54,827
-Hello.
-Hi.

448
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:55,911
Good morning.

449
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,415
Mr. Gong.

450
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,544
Did Ms. Ma resign?

451
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,213
Her time off is over,
but she's not here today.

452
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,021
Who the hell…

453
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:26,650
You said to reply with a period.
That was a period.

454
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,904
Why are you replying only now?

455
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,366
I turned on my phone today
to come to work.

456
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,327
Your texts were funny.

457
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:40,414
You wanted to check
if I was dead or alive,

458
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,083
-but you were scared, right?
-Of course.

459
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,212
Everyone knows
about the affair and the divorce.

460
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,506
He shouldn't have pretended
to be so loving on TV.

461
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,050
The whole nation knows you,
and your phone was off.

462
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,593
I won't die.

463
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,720
See? I came back alive.

464
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,310
Wait for me.

465
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:07,483
FLOWER GARDEN

466
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,247
Really not going to eat?

467
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,540
I'm not hungry.

468
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:27,962
Skipping wild veggie bibimbap at Jirisan
is like not bathing in a bathhouse.

469
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,840
Since you're so excited,
go enjoy it yourself.

470
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,260
Gosh.

471
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,435
-Hello.
-Are you here alone?

472
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,145
Yes. One bibimbap, please.

473
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,230
Okay.

474
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:10,296
I'm at Jirisan Mountain
and I'm still eating alone.

475
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,472
I thought you weren't hungry.

476
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,515
What?

477
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,392
Did you suddenly get hungry?

478
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,273
What do you want?

479
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:40,743
Could I get another bibimbap
but without bracken, please?

480
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:41,952
Okay.

481
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:44,288
How did you know I didn't like bracken?

482
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,594
MR. KWON JAE-GYEONG

483
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:13,901
You keep staring at your phone.

484
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:16,278
If you're so curious,
why not text him first?

485
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,155
I can't do that.

486
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,823
What I'm doing is verification.

487
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:24,036
If he contacts me first,
it means the Love Spell worked.

488
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,122
Then, we can hope
for you to get better too.

489
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:30,209
I'm not making a fuss just for myself.

490
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:33,212
Just text him first. I'm curious too.

491
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:34,672
No, I'll wait.

492
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:42,471
KWON JAE-GYEONG

493
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,807
Oh, my gosh! He texted me.

494
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:48,852
What does he say?

495
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,067
What did he text?

496
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,323
It's a secret.

497
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,707
Put your feet down.

498
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:11,792
Okay.

499
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:25,848
Thank you.

500
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,474
Go home and get some rest.

501
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,478
You're tired from driving,
not from the spell.

502
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:32,938
So don't blame it on me.

503
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:33,939
Just wait and see.

504
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:36,942
What about the dress?

505
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,279
Would I ever wear it again?

506
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,156
And you think I would?

507
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,032
It looked expensive.

508
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:51,582
Sell it in a thrift shop or whatever.
Deal with it yourself.

509
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,250
That dress is yours.

510
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:33,582
He'll let me know when and where to meet.

511
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:37,127
This clearly proves
that the Love Spell worked.

512
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:40,422
Is he going to confess
his feelings for you or what?

513
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,550
There's a high chance.

514
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,472
What does he say?

515
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:50,766
What did he text?

516
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,314
It's a secret.

517
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:09,868
See you at 7:00 p.m. tomorrow.

518
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,161
Let's meet here.

519
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,246
Okay.

520
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,082
I'd like that.

521
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:25,509
Yes, I'd…

522
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:33,767
MR. KWON JAE-GYEONG: LIKE THAT.

523
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,777
The spell must've really worked.

524
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,698
Oh, my gosh.

525
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:02,838
Good morning, Mr. Gong.

526
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,047
Get here earlier next time.

527
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,007
Okay.

528
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,509
Good morning.

529
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,177
-Hi.
-Good morning.

530
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:12,931
You caused a mess and took a day off,
so your coworker had to clean it up.

531
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,144
I'm sorry.

532
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:21,773
Did you receive the email?

533
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,734
Yes, the files?

534
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,611
You should've told me if you did.

535
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,822
-I received it well.
-My tumbler.

536
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:44,796
-What is it?
-I lost my tumbler.

537
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,341
-Did you see my tumbler?
-No.

538
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,384
What's the fuss about?

539
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:52,012
I lost my tumbler. It's this big and--

540
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:52,971
It's pink.

541
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:54,973
Yes.

542
00:48:58,810 --> 00:48:59,811
This?

543
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:06,151
Why do you have my tumbler?

544
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:08,195
I took it to prevent accidents.

545
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,614
It was on the floor
and someone could've tripped.

546
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:14,534
Did you drink the water in here?

547
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,745
Was I not supposed to?

548
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,419
Did you really drink it?

549
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:27,547
It's not yours to drink.

550
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:31,301
I guess no good deed goes unpunished.

551
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,928
I found it and kept it safely.

552
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:35,013
-I deserve a "Thank you," not--
-Quiet!

553
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,434
Unless there's a wildfire,

554
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:43,188
your voice should not be louder
than 20 dB in Greenway Building Division.

555
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:47,234
I'm sorry.

556
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,069
You don't have to apologize.

557
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:51,321
He's the one that was loud.

558
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,450
I'm Manager Ma Eun-yeong.

559
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,245
Nice to meet you.

560
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,914
You already know my name.

561
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:01,873
Thank you.

562
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,419
Park Maintenance Team

563
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,839
has a team dinner today,
and everyone must attend.

564
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,591
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

565
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:17,931
Oh, no.

566
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:19,850
See you at 7:00 p.m. tomorrow.

567
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:20,767
Let's meet here.

568
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,067
What are we eating?

569
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,457
I'm meeting him tomorrow instead.

570
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,417
So I can't check if the spell worked.

571
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,294
I think it did though.

572
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:50,547
He works overtime a lot,
but he said tomorrow is good too.

573
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:53,675
You're too close.

574
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,682
How do you feel? Did you get better?

575
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:03,393
-There are even side effects.
-Side effects?

576
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:05,604
My chest feels tight. My heart beats fast.

577
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,522
It's hyperventilation or arrhythmia.

578
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,650
-You didn't have them before?
-Of course not.

579
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,944
Hong-jo, did you wander off again?

580
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,321
I'm coming!

581
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:17,449
Give it a bit more time.
Tell me if you start to feel better.

582
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:18,867
What's she doing there?

583
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,245
Everyone's waiting for you.

584
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,832
Let's go. Everyone up front.

585
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:05,997
I think it did though.

586
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:09,167
He works overtime a lot,
but he said tomorrow is good too.

587
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:14,130
Not being able to drive is the worst.

588
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:31,398
How did you get here?

589
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,525
Aren't you glad to see me?

590
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:47,539
Is the theme of the house
ink wash painting?

591
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,751
I should redecorate it when you're out.

592
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,088
Go do your work.

593
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,923
Don't worry and take your time.

594
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,305
Let's see.

595
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:07,976
What are those?

596
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:09,060
These?

597
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:11,021
At first,

598
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:13,690
I was very upset to hear
that you moved to Onju.

599
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:16,067
But come to think of it,
it's a good thing.

600
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:18,403
You're not living
with your parents anymore,

601
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:20,238
so I can visit you whenever I want.

602
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,158
Look.

603
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:24,868
Aren't they nice?

604
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:47,766
Na-yeon.

605
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:50,352
I bought pajamas just in case.

606
00:53:51,227 --> 00:53:52,270
How is it?

607
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,985
What's with those eyes?

608
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,154
How is it?

609
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:13,458
Did I upset you by coming over
when you told me you needed some time?

610
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:21,341
What's wrong? You're making me anxious.

611
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,484
Na-yeon, let's stop this.

612
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:49,703
You want to stop dating and get married?

613
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,432
Was this what you meant
when you said you needed time?

614
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,393
What's the reason?

615
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,316
During our two years together,

616
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:24,195
you never told me anything important.

617
00:55:26,114 --> 00:55:28,241
You won't tell me why
we're breaking up either?

618
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,745
I need a clear explanation to accept it.

619
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,164
Do you not love me anymore?
Is it another girl?

620
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,875
Or do you just not want to get married?

621
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:42,505
What reason can you accept?

622
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:51,681
Are you saying
you'd say anything to break up?

623
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,019
How can you do this to me?

624
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:08,656
I know.

625
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:12,077
I liked you first, so I chased you around.

626
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:15,080
It's also true that I like you more.

627
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:17,540
Even so,

628
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,543
how can you do this?

629
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:34,140
I'll go today.

630
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,771
But give me some time too.

631
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:42,065
I need time to think.

632
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:46,778
I'll give you a ride home.

633
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:48,947
You don't have to.

634
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,574
Giving me a ride home after breaking up?

635
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:55,078
That makes me feel pathetic.

636
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:12,887
What's for lunch?

637
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,932
-Ms. Lee.
-Yes?

638
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:18,935
What's for lunch?
We should eat together with Ms. Ma.

639
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:21,229
Right.

640
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,897
What about the cafeteria?

641
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,317
It provides a balanced diet
that changes daily.

642
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,862
No. We should eat webfoot octopus today.

643
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,071
Isn't that so, Ms. Ma?

644
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,448
I'm up for the cafeteria.

645
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,366
I don't want to go out.

646
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:36,035
See? Ms. Lee always chooses the best menu.

647
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:43,376
What's up with the thumbs up?

648
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,503
He used to hate her.

649
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,046
His old age makes him fickle.

650
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:50,758
Let's go quickly
before the cafeteria gets crowded.

651
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:54,596
Mr. Gong. I'm sorry
but I need to go out for work today.

652
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,974
Working outside again?

653
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,726
You work way too hard.

654
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:12,447
LAWYER JANG SIN-YU

655
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:19,746
CIVIL SERVANT (HAUNTED HOUSE)

656
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:24,667
What is it?

657
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,754
Are you feeling better?

658
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:30,089
I called because I was concerned.

659
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:33,176
You must be concerned
about Jae-gyeong, not me.

660
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:35,845
What to say when you see him

661
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,931
and whether the spell worked or not.

662
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:41,684
You catch on quick.

663
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,103
Don't get your hopes up.

664
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:47,899
I'm still not feeling good,
both physically and mentally.

665
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,235
There might be another--

666
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:51,903
Don't blush for no reason,

667
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:55,657
fidget, or tuck your hair behind your ear.

668
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:59,035
I personally hate those things.

669
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,998
As if I ever did those for him!

670
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,793
When did I ever fidget?

671
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:08,336
Ridiculous.

672
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,631
LITIGATION PLAN

673
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:16,803
Hello?

674
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:34,529
Knock, knock.

675
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,866
Mr. Jang, did you
read all of these already?

676
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:43,705
My mind kept getting sidetracked,
so I tried to focus on work.

677
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:45,748
There were over 200 of them.

678
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,542
There were 198.

679
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,133
The mayor would like to
have dinner with you.

680
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:56,259
I can't.

681
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,681
Can't you just join?

682
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:03,850
Mr. Kwon has a prior engagement.

683
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,560
If you turn him down as well,

684
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:07,937
what am I supposed to tell the mayor?

685
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:16,988
Where is Mr. Kwon heading

686
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,115
for his prior engagement?

687
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:05,161
Am I late?

688
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:06,704
No, I just arrived too.

689
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:08,414
I see.

690
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:09,832
You must be busy.

691
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:11,542
I'm fine.

692
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:53,876
-What would you like?
-I'll--

693
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:54,794
No, it's on me.

694
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:57,046
I'd like a hot iced latte.

695
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,381
Thank you.

696
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:00,633
Okay.

697
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,622
I'm Sin-yu, the legal advisor.

698
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:15,208
I need to check CCTV footage
from three days ago.

699
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,292
Yes, sir.

700
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:36,938
I want to introduce someone.

701
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:41,567
He is Lawyer Jang Sin-yu,
the new legal advisor for City Hall.

702
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:43,986
-Nice to meet you.
-Mr. Kwon.

703
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,864
-Yes?
-It took a lot of effort,

704
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,033
but Mr. Kwon hired him away
from Law & High.

705
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:50,117
Let's give him a hand.

706
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:54,163
Mr. Kwon is very competent.

707
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,957
He did a great job.

708
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:23,901
LOVE SPELL

709
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:22,812
What brings you here?

710
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:31,195
I wanted to know what Jae-gyeong said.

711
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:34,824
I won't tell you.

712
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:37,910
It's an issue between him and me.

713
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:40,997
So there is an issue.

714
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,500
No. We were vibing so well.

715
01:06:47,294 --> 01:06:49,755
There's no way the Love Spell worked.

716
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:52,008
How can you be so sure?

717
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:54,218
-Do you think I got dumped again?
-No.

718
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,972
Jae-gyeong does like you.

719
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:02,143
And I

720
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,978
like you too.

721
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:57,490
DESTINED WITH YOU

722
01:07:57,573 --> 01:07:59,992
Like me?

723
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:01,952
Do you think I want this?

724
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:04,747
I can't control my feelings
because of the spell.

725
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,457
Get a grip, Sin-yu.

726
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:07,833
Did you follow me?

727
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:08,751
No.

728
01:08:09,293 --> 01:08:11,253
Yes. Actually, I did follow you.

729
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:14,340
I don't want to do this.
But I can't control my body.

730
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:16,550
Teach me how to break the spell.

731
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:18,427
There's only one way.

732
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:20,221
What is it?

733
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:22,139
What if I end up

734
01:08:22,723 --> 01:08:24,183
really loving her?

735
01:08:27,686 --> 01:08:30,564
