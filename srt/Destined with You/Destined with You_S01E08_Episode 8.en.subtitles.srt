1
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,966
DESTINED WITH YOU

2
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,052
EPISODE 8

3
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,972
Your girlfriend slapped me.

4
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,558
She said I hit on you.

5
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,561
She said we held hands,
hugged, and kissed.

6
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,605
Why must I get slapped by her?

7
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,315
What the hell did you tell her?

8
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,651
That I'm being swayed.

9
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:11,946
You must be insane.

10
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,241
You weren't really swayed.

11
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,577
You should've explained

12
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,663
that it was the spell or neural coupling.

13
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,750
You gave me so many excuses.

14
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,086
Why didn't you tell Na-yeon any of those?

15
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:28,797
Because it's true.

16
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,008
You swayed me

17
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,552
and are still swaying me.

18
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,140
Asshole.

19
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,146
What do you want from me?

20
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,900
You want me to be honest? Fine.

21
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,351
What are you doing?

22
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,937
Do you really have to ask?

23
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,233
Did you break up

24
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,903
with Na-yeon?

25
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,202
Are you playing with me?

26
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,041
You're a lost cause.

27
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:47,959
What about you?

28
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,836
-What about me?
-Tell me honestly.

29
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,046
Can you say you never wavered
when you saw me?

30
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,050
Yes.

31
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,386
I never did.

32
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,805
So you shouldn't either.

33
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,058
It's undesirable.

34
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,565
I'll drive you home.

35
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,444
If I get in your car in this situation,

36
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,447
that means I'm out of my mind.

37
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,598
It's a crime to take
and spread others' photos.

38
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:27,725
Sin-yu.

39
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,019
I'm not asking Jang Sin-yu, as the lawyer.

40
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,313
I'm asking Jang Sin-yu, as my boyfriend.

41
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,944
Why won't you say anything?

42
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,863
Give me an excuse or anything.
Say something.

43
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,408
There's no excuse to make.

44
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:45,868
What do you mean?

45
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,080
I was swayed.

46
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,542
I didn't realize it.

47
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,670
I didn't know I wavered.

48
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,641
I think such things can happen

49
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,977
in a long-term relationship.

50
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,272
I can't go to City Hall for now.

51
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:15,982
Wrap it up and call me.

52
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,193
I won't ask anything.

53
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,281
Just end it all.

54
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,242
Whatever the feelings were.

55
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,441
Why did you close your eyes?

56
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,484
Why!

57
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,278
You should've slapped him.

58
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,501
Are you a fool?

59
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,294
You got slapped and stayed still?

60
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,089
I won't let this pass.

61
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,143
HONG-JO

62
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,687
I DON'T DESERVE
TO GET SLAPPED BY YOU.

63
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,230
SEE YOU BEFORE WORK TOMORROW.

64
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,066
What's this?

65
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,848
I couldn't sleep
because I was mad at you.

66
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,851
They say the offender sleeps well.

67
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:57,852
Why couldn't you?

68
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,353
You must've slept well then.

69
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,105
You think so?

70
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,290
I want to pay you back,
but I'm holding myself back.

71
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,083
It's a waste of water.

72
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,466
Is this why you called me out this early?

73
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,801
No need to give me that dirty look.

74
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,720
I called you out to tell you

75
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,306
about what happened between Sin-yu and me.

76
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,851
It seems like your boyfriend
that you love so much

77
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,145
didn't tell you the full story.

78
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,755
CIVIL SERVANT (HAUNTED HOUSE)

79
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,104
Meet me on the rooftop.

80
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,279
I'll come to your office.

81
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,101
I need your consultation
regarding a stray cat feeding station.

82
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,647
We have something else to talk about.

83
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,732
No, I don't.

84
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,526
I told Na-yeon everything
on my way to work.

85
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,612
About what?

86
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,656
Why we did what we did.

87
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,534
If you had told her
it was due to the spell,

88
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,620
she wouldn't have gotten it wrong.

89
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,747
Why keep it a secret from your girlfriend?

90
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,626
Were you too embarrassed to tell her?

91
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,213
Did you tell her the truth?

92
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,298
Yes.

93
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,467
I told her the truth,

94
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,219
but don't worry.

95
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,055
I didn't tell her about last night.

96
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,517
Why didn't you tell her about last night?

97
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,937
It wasn't a big deal.

98
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,773
A kiss isn't a big deal?

99
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,941
It must be bothering you a lot.

100
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,735
But I'm rather open-minded.

101
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,862
I decided to get over with it.

102
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,322
Everyone makes

103
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,491
such mistakes.

104
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:07,083
I'm glad that you're nonchalant.

105
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,587
I thought you'd attach
too much meaning to it.

106
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,464
So I was very bothered.

107
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,676
You shouldn't be.

108
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,304
I didn't put any meaning to it.

109
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:30,981
Check the documents fast.

110
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,192
I need to go out for work. I'm in a hurry.

111
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:37,780
ONJU STRAY CAT FEEDING STATION SET UP

112
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,909
Someone set up
a feeding station in the park.

113
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,744
I know it's unauthorized,

114
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,996
but I want to leave it as is, if possible.

115
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,166
Please check if that's doable legally.

116
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,627
Okay.

117
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,964
I would need it as soon as possible.

118
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,757
Please don't call or text,

119
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,511
but use the in-house email or messenger
to contact me.

120
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:03,806
Okay.

121
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,933
I'll review it at my earliest opportunity

122
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:09,895
and contact you
using the in-house email or messenger.

123
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,564
Is that all?

124
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,941
Yes, thank you.

125
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,828
As if it'd make any difference
if I put meaning to it.

126
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,706
It changes a lot of things.

127
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,168
Before I called her name

128
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,920
She was merely a moving gesture

129
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,256
But when I called her name

130
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,425
She came to me and became a flower

131
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,344
Now.

132
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,762
I'll call your name.

133
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:45,931
Hong-jo?

134
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,020
Why aren't you becoming a flower?

135
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,315
You're already a flower.

136
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,112
Mr. Kwon. It's not funny at all.

137
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:02,948
I find it funny.

138
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,002
What are you doing?

139
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,880
Didn't you say you were in a hurry?

140
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,924
I am. I was going to leave now.

141
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,762
I feel much better
thanks to you, Mr. Kwon.

142
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,263
I'll get going now.

143
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,932
Okay. Good luck with your work.

144
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,571
This isn't important now.

145
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,367
I feel like Admiral Yi Sun-sin fighting
in the Battle of Hansan Island.

146
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,328
What strategy should I use
for the blind date?

147
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,663
Give me some ideas.

148
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,624
It's just a blind date.
Don't make a big fuss.

149
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,543
It might be LBDOML.

150
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,002
Last blind date of my life.

151
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,546
Speaking of which,

152
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,131
I asked all my friends
to find out about her.

153
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,926
She's a pesco-vegetarian.

154
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,512
A what?

155
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:09,181
A vegetarian who doesn't eat
poultry or meat.

156
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,933
Poultry means chicken.

157
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,142
Yes.

158
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,227
It sounds bad already.

159
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,812
Mr. Gong.

160
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,272
Get a grip.

161
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,149
You might stay single
for the rest of your life.

162
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,485
I could lose chicken
for the rest of my life.

163
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:25,531
You can think about that
after the blind date goes well.

164
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,657
Firstly,

165
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,952
eat seafood pasta for dinner.

166
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,413
For the second round,
have a glass of wine.

167
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,832
Then the third round…

168
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:35,749
The third round--

169
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,918
How does
Buyongjae Fireworks Festival sound?

170
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:38,919
Karaoke should do…

171
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,424
You cry whenever you go to karaoke.

172
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,968
Will Seung-yeon
from the Tax Department like that?

173
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,845
Who knows?

174
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,222
She might like sensitive men.

175
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,476
Look at our hopeless team leader.

176
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,063
The festival's near
and he wants to talk about his blind date.

177
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,441
-We finished talking about the festival.
-Really?

178
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,568
How many fireworks do we need?

179
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,989
Why do you keep bringing up
this blind date topic in a meeting?

180
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,366
Why do you do that?

181
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,879
He said they weren't so bad.

182
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,299
I think they're very bad.

183
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,426
My grandpa said

184
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:31,138
real bad guys would even put
pesticide in the cat food.

185
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,058
I won't let that happen.

186
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:37,227
I'm a very brave
and skilled civil servant.

187
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,771
That doesn't matter.

188
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,607
Even if they kill cats,
it'll be hard to catch them.

189
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,776
-Why?
-Look.

190
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,653
Here's the blind spot of the CCTV.

191
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,783
You know what a blind spot is?

192
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:56,413
If you're free,
let's have a cup of hot chocolate.

193
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,543
On my way back home after class,

194
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,588
Ji-woo suddenly held my hand.

195
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,425
I'm not interested
in having a girlfriend now.

196
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,553
And honestly, she's not my type.

197
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:15,683
But since that day, I couldn't sleep.

198
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,227
She keeps getting on my mind.

199
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,772
What's important is

200
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,941
how long you two held hands.

201
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:24,858
How long was it?

202
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,568
Let's see.

203
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,195
About five minutes?

204
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,198
Hey, that means you like her.

205
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,910
You should've let go immediately
if you didn't like her.

206
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,121
That's why she keeps getting on my mind.

207
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,916
I was taken aback, so I couldn't let go.
But she might think I liked it.

208
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:46,005
I really don't like
tall girls like Ji-woo.

209
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,424
She's over 150 cm.

210
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,010
U-ram.

211
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,554
You're in denial now.

212
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,683
You started liking someone,
but you don't want to admit it.

213
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,395
Is this consultation really going fine?

214
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,731
You don't even have experience.

215
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,358
Aren't you taking this too lightly?

216
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,985
I'm not.

217
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,321
It annoys me to think about it too.

218
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,781
Why did I close my eyes?

219
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,116
Why didn't I push him away?

220
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,118
It felt so weird,

221
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,578
but I needed to act cool.

222
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,247
You're in denial too, right?

223
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,708
I'm not.

224
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,210
I'm not denying
that I don't like him when I do.

225
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,920
I just

226
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,089
don't like him.

227
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,098
What is going on?

228
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,808
What is this?

229
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,144
What were you doing with Hong-jo?

230
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:51,236
PROSECUTOR HAN MIN-GYU

231
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:59,036
Sin-yu? I didn't expect you to call.

232
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,663
Can you track down a phone number?

233
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,125
They took photos without consent
and sent them to a third party.

234
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,669
There's a high chance
they used a burner phone.

235
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,671
Did you report it?

236
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,256
It's not bad enough to report.

237
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,925
Seems like a stalker.

238
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,176
Is it serious?

239
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,220
Is that stalker stalking you?

240
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,056
I don't think so.

241
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,184
They're stalking my acquaintance.

242
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,730
Let me ask this first.

243
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:30,609
What did Sin-yu tell you about me?

244
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,112
He didn't say anything about you.

245
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,489
Then why did you suddenly slap me?

246
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,742
Someone sent me pictures
of you and him together.

247
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,079
You guys in front of your house,
in a park, and so on.

248
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:49,211
Who sent you those pictures and why?

249
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,380
I don't know either.

250
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,299
I called the sender,
but the number didn't exist.

251
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,764
You better watch out.

252
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,101
Someone might be stalking you.

253
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,533
Get in.

254
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,044
You have nothing going on
with Sin-yu now, right?

255
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,630
What do you mean?

256
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,718
Does he still talk about spells?

257
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:41,013
Did he come to his senses now?
That's what I wanted to ask.

258
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,893
I don't know.

259
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,522
Why? Did something happen again?

260
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,941
You know the saying,

261
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,402
"Whoever cares more, loses."

262
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,487
I won't care about him.

263
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,159
You saying that makes me care even more.

264
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,417
Any plans for the end of this year?

265
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,715
I must go to a gathering
I don't want to attend.

266
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,301
Would you come with me?

267
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,054
You don't want to attend it.

268
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,889
So why are you inviting me?

269
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,184
It's a gathering for couples.

270
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,235
That kind of a gathering is a bit…

271
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,698
From now until we arrive home,

272
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,284
if all traffic lights stay green,
let's go together.

273
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,120
If any of them turns red,
let's go together.

274
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,957
So either way, I have to go.

275
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,209
That's right.

276
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,296
Isn't it a bit hot in here?

277
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,509
No.

278
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,554
I'm cold.

279
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,349
I see.

280
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,913
So envious.

281
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,583
It's been a million years
since I last kissed.

282
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,755
What on earth is he doing?

283
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,014
Hey.

284
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,808
Have you arrived? Where are you?

285
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:53,603
The situation is bleak.
We have an issue at the commercial shoot.

286
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,813
What issue?

287
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,732
Is there an accident?

288
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,400
I need to hang up now.

289
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,068
Mr. Jang.

290
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,654
Yes, Hee-ae. Yes.

291
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,120
Did he stand his wife up

292
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,040
to meet a celebrity?

293
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,516
Isn't this a reason for a divorce?

294
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,311
I'll scold him real bad.

295
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,331
Why are you alone?

296
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,249
Didn't he come with you?

297
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,505
I… got stood up.

298
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,675
What about you, Wook?

299
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:10,013
I'm here to meet my dad
and help out with the event.

300
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,598
Let me carry that.

301
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:12,766
It's okay.

302
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,936
I'm thinking of going back.

303
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:17,813
Jeez.

304
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:21,274
I'm the only one who came alone,
so it feels awkward.

305
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,194
No, you're not alone.

306
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,571
What?

307
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:31,952
I made some mulled wine today.

308
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,751
You're very sweet.

309
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:51,346
Nobody does this for me.

310
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,682
I do for others

311
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,434
what I wish others would

312
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,354
do for me.

313
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:04,192
I'm someone who's full of love.

314
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,029
But there's nobody to receive my love.

315
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,365
That makes me

316
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,617
so upset.

317
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,540
I can relate.

318
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:23,003
I want to receive lots of love,

319
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,297
but nobody gives it to me.

320
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,509
That's a pity.

321
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,221
Gosh, it's a shooting star.

322
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,182
Quick, make a wish.

323
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,020
You should look at the star.

324
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:41,855
Right.

325
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,203
It's the Geminids meteor shower.

326
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,371
It's been ten years since that many fell.

327
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,420
It's so beautiful.

328
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:22,938
What is it?

329
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,857
Why are you all dressed up?
Are you going out?

330
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,693
I'm not going out. I just came back.

331
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,946
How could you sleep
when I wasn't even back?

332
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:32,906
Weren't you worried

333
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,282
about what I was doing?

334
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,952
You must've gone and seen the stars alone.

335
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,412
I wasn't alone.

336
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,790
I saw them together with a man.

337
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,294
Good job.

338
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,088
I said I was with a man.

339
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,714
Aren't you jealous?

340
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,342
I am.

341
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:56,846
If you sleep now, you fail as a husband.

342
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,515
I'll really get a divorce!

343
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:00,809
Sure, do it.

344
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:03,395
Do everything you want.

345
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,116
Why did you bring this?

346
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,743
She just passed it on to me.

347
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:22,747
Keeping it at home
makes me keep thinking about it.

348
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,792
But it doesn't feel right
to throw away a 300-year-old book.

349
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,794
Do whatever you want with it.

350
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,504
This must be in the owner's hands.

351
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:30,839
You're not fooling me.

352
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,883
There were no spells.

353
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,679
Just return it to Hong-jo.

354
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:38,805
I can't.

355
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,682
I can't meet her.

356
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,729
How nice.

357
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,647
Nothing's nice.

358
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,942
I feel like trash.

359
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:53,903
I hate messy things.

360
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,239
But I'm a mess now.

361
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:03,079
Love is always messy and foolish.

362
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,748
Who said it was love?

363
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:12,380
You and Hong-jo's destinies
cannot be severed, so--

364
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,299
Inseverable destinies?

365
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,509
There are no such things.

366
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:20,472
Your heart racing crazily
doesn't mean it's love.

367
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,766
It just means you're crazy.

368
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,395
If I dated someone for a long time,

369
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,647
I should stay loyal to her.

370
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,525
Being loyal alone
is the dumbest thing in the world.

371
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,486
Both the spell book and the box.

372
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,946
Deal with them as you like.

373
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,240
Do you really want to call it quits?

374
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,123
Then there's only one way.

375
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:56,174
Everything depends on your mindset.

376
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,720
It's excruciating!

377
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,392
No. You'll lose if you do this.

378
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,395
Even at this moment,
he's not thinking about you at all.

379
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,730
He might be just enjoying his date.

380
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:13,858
What should I do first?

381
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,945
Delete everything.

382
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,241
GROOT

383
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,992
EUN-WOL

384
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:28,915
Hello, Eun-wol.

385
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,295
Outside? Why?

386
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,105
I didn't intend this.

387
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:55,734
I know. Eun-wol told me about it.

388
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,278
What were you doing?

389
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:00,947
Nothing much.

390
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,744
Looks pretty without makeup.

391
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:08,913
What did you say?

392
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:16,212
Eun-wol looks pretty without makeup.

393
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,382
She is beautiful indeed.

394
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:22,719
Why did you bother taking that to her?

395
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,888
You could've just thrown it away.

396
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:27,974
Just like you threw it away
and didn't give it to me?

397
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,896
She said something would happen
if you kept the box.

398
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,606
What does she mean?

399
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,942
Didn't something already happen?

400
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:40,820
I see.

401
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,324
From the moment we met, to the kiss.
It's been a big mess.

402
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,786
You know it all started
because of you, right?

403
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,705
That's why I'm here
to take the final responsibility.

404
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,709
Can I really trust you?

405
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,795
If I put it back to where it was,

406
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,463
will everything be settled?

407
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,340
There's no harm trying.

408
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,884
She says misfortune
will fall upon us if we don't.

409
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,223
Give me that and leave. I'll do it myself.

410
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:11,559
It has to be the exact spot
where the wooden box was found.

411
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,895
Do you know where it was?

412
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,070
Not there.

413
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,447
That's the wooden box's seat.

414
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,460
PRIVATE PROPERTY
DO NOT ENTER

415
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,505
You walk like a snail
and are alert like a meerkat.

416
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,966
Isn't it really strange?

417
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,552
It's not as if we're celebrities.

418
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,387
Why would they take pictures of us?

419
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:49,722
Aren't you cold?

420
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,100
No.

421
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,229
Sin-yu. You saw those pictures, right?

422
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,566
Yes. If it's heavy, I'll carry it.

423
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,401
It's okay.

424
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,028
What were the pictures like?

425
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,283
I was shocked.

426
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,286
We've spent a lot of time together.

427
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:13,955
What?

428
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,084
What I'm saying is,

429
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,837
they have been following us
for a long time.

430
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,839
What was their intention of doing it?

431
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,424
I couldn't help but question.

432
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,636
Are they taking pictures of us even now?

433
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,806
There are only two of us for now.

434
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,058
How can you be sure?

435
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,144
I can see from a higher place.

436
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,440
You always could,
so why didn't you spot them before?

437
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,443
Don't worry too much.

438
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:45,612
We're not doing anything strange.

439
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,947
It's strange no matter how you see it.

440
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,365
In the 21st century,

441
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:52,118
two people are going
to a shrine to bury a spell book.

442
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:57,957
I really hope today will be the last day.

443
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,668
I don't want
to meet you outside of City Hall

444
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:01,961
unless it's for work.

445
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,505
Watch out. The leaves are slippery.

446
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,135
See? I told you to watch out.

447
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,595
You're wearing white pants.

448
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,139
Are you okay?

449
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,099
This is bad.

450
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,435
What should we do?

451
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:23,524
Wait.

452
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,611
There must've been another spell book.

453
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,912
"Black Magic Spell"?

454
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:40,416
It seems these spells are used
to curse someone.

455
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,251
It feels strange.

456
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,672
The content is horrendous.

457
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,510
It doesn't matter.

458
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,136
We're going to bury it anyway.

459
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,603
Can't you remember?

460
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,147
I want to go back down.

461
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,941
Were you always easily frightened?

462
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,652
I would get scared even if I wasn't.

463
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,070
It's ominous.

464
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,489
I'm holding a spell book
used to kill people.

465
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:14,200
Then stop carrying it
and put it on the ground.

466
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:20,331
The wooden floor was around here.

467
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,291
A big room was at the back.

468
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,585
A door to the side.

469
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,588
There was a small room in it.

470
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:29,966
It should be here.

471
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:32,552
Start digging.

472
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,387
She said you had to bury it yourself.

473
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,264
I'll bury it.

474
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,682
You dig.

475
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:40,685
Here.

476
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:48,735
What is it?

477
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,323
Did you hear that just now?

478
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,160
I heard nothing.

479
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:58,661
That can't be.

480
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,174
What is it?

481
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,717
Don't look.

482
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,136
What is it?

483
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,597
Is there something?

484
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,099
No. There's nothing.

485
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,269
What is it? What's wrong?

486
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,109
I told you not to look.

487
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:33,946
This won't do.

488
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,324
We should just go back today.

489
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,285
Wait.

490
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:41,704
Those clothes.

491
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,501
I think they're mine.

492
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:50,755
JANG SIN-YU

493
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:05,228
So those are your pajamas, right?

494
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,063
Yes.

495
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:08,689
It's been long since I lost them.

496
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,859
I hung them on a drying rack.
Then they disappeared.

497
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,696
I never thought someone broke into
my house and stole them.

498
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,492
As a lawyer, you must know well.

499
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,744
Even if they curse you like this,

500
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,247
it's impossible to punish them by law.

501
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,582
Theft is a bigger issue than that.

502
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:30,253
They clearly trespassed too,
and there are signs of stalking.

503
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,505
You're right.

504
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,760
JANG SIN-YU

505
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,897
That doll from earlier.

506
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,899
They cursed both of us, right?

507
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,283
Pull over.

508
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,994
I saw something similar
in the black magic spell book.

509
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,204
I want to check what curse it was.

510
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,622
I didn't read it properly.

511
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,000
We verified it recently.

512
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,627
And we concluded that spells didn't work.

513
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,462
So don't get scared by a doll.

514
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,756
Still, I feel uneasy.

515
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,466
Curses don't exist.

516
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,926
People are the scary ones.

517
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,513
The person who made the curse doll,
not the curse itself.

518
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:36,944
Where are we?

519
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,994
Welcome.

520
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,840
You told me not to get scared.

521
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,717
You must be very scared.

522
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,887
Yes, I'm very scared
that something might happen to you.

523
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,683
-This, this and this. Give me these three.
-Okay.

524
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,108
Change your door lock password.

525
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,444
Don't use your birthday
or your phone number.

526
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,119
How can you leave the windows unlocked?

527
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:28,996
I'll lock them later.

528
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,164
This won't do.

529
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,582
Install some grilles.

530
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,043
It's okay. I'll handle it myself.

531
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:36,295
A man could easily push this open.

532
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,215
Mr. Kwon's downstairs.

533
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:41,008
If something happens, I'll scream.

534
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,343
Then he'll come running.

535
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,178
What if he's not at home like now?

536
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,973
Don't worry.

537
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,934
Actually, I am a yellow belt in taekwondo.

538
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,437
Isn't that the belt you get
when you sign up?

539
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,772
-That's a white belt.
-So?

540
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,858
Do you think
you can protect yourself with that?

541
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:01,904
I have the spray
and the stun gun you bought for me.

542
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:06,826
Should I stay with you?

543
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:09,704
It's okay.

544
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:10,913
Are you sure?

545
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,124
Is it fine for me to leave?

546
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,460
Sin-yu.

547
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,545
What now?

548
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,214
I shouldn't care for you personally?

549
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,301
No.

550
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,219
Thank you for today.

551
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:35,438
If you're that grateful…

552
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,069
let's go on a date.

553
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,636
Must you make it so obvious?

554
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,809
I guess we must.

555
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,981
Taking photos and spreading them
without consent are crimes.

556
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,359
And I'm a victim of those crimes too.

557
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,527
The pajamas were yours,

558
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,696
but it was my name that was nailed.

559
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,991
Should we just wait
since we filed a report?

560
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,994
Having a very uncomfortable
and uneasy weekend?

561
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,041
I didn't want to stay at home either.

562
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,795
Actually, staying at home
doesn't feel safe.

563
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,881
You did well.

564
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,383
Let's go.

565
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,518
Enjoy.

566
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,811
Thank you.

567
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,820
It was hard to make a reservation here.

568
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,571
I can tell. The food is good.

569
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,325
You haven't even started eating yet.

570
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:13,244
Relax.

571
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,835
Did you get some sleep?

572
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,963
No.

573
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:26,757
I couldn't sleep,
and I nodded off this afternoon.

574
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,802
I gave it some thought.

575
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:32,805
I think the prime suspect
is the garden owner.

576
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,933
Jae-gyeong's on my list of suspects too.

577
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,686
It's easy for him to steal your pajamas.

578
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,230
We came across each other quite often too.

579
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,233
He's not someone who would do that.

580
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:46,360
With his hair down,

581
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,362
he looks very cute and docile.

582
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,823
I look cute and docile
with my hair down too.

583
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,158
Like now.

584
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,003
Do you still eat alone?

585
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,047
No. My seniors take good care of me.

586
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,801
It's all thanks to you.

587
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,511
I must've looked pitiful.

588
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:15,473
They think I hit on you
and then was turned down.

589
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,142
They said we were in the same boat.

590
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,602
They even bought me drinks.

591
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,438
Then this one's on you.

592
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:24,440
You're not an outcast anymore,
thanks to me.

593
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,025
Come on.

594
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,402
You're the son
of a construction company owner,

595
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:32,072
have lots of land, and have an ancestor
mentioned in Joseon Dynasty Records.

596
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,032
Don't do this.

597
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,620
You know a lot about me.

598
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,456
I don't know much about you.

599
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:51,383
Do you have other family members?
Mom, aunt, or uncle?

600
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,679
My mom passed away
soon after she gave birth to me.

601
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:59,433
My dad was an only child,
so I don't have any relatives.

602
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,855
Have I now passed
the "friend you share snacks with" level?

603
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,610
You said you don't talk
about yourself to strangers.

604
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,911
Since white magic didn't work,
black magic won't as well, right?

605
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,122
Actually, it bothers me

606
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:25,042
that they nailed your name.

607
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,379
It's not a Death Note.

608
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,756
I won't die
from my name being written there.

609
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:32,716
Don't worry.

610
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,272
Don't run, Hong-jo. It's dangerous.

611
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,523
Come quickly.

612
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:01,328
Sin-yu. Aren't you coming?

613
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:06,625
I'll come when the wind stops.

614
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,255
Do you need help?

615
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,881
Yes, please.

616
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,354
-Be careful. You might fall.
-One, two…

617
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,902
You prepared a lot.

618
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,113
Our goal is to make this look like a date.

619
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:38,407
Look at my pathetic life.

620
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,328
I'm on a fake date to catch a stalker.

621
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,749
Regardless, the night view was nice.

622
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,793
By the way, I think you're amazing.

623
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,296
Why?

624
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,632
You said you had a fear of heights.

625
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,675
Still, you went all the way up there.

626
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,510
I don't have that fear.

627
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:01,513
I generally don't have any fear.

628
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:04,892
Since I was young,
everyone told me I was bold.

629
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,644
That's a lie.

630
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:10,147
You're so tall, but you have tiny guts.

631
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:14,276
You're scared of bugs,
dogs, and even heights.

632
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,278
Didn't the curse doll scare you?

633
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:18,489
You might have a nightmare and say,

634
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,659
"A ghost appeared in my dream."

635
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:31,710
Don't look at me like that.

636
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,339
How am I looking at you?

637
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,677
In a way that makes me confused.

638
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:51,438
Sin-yu. Why did you do that?

639
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:57,111
What do you want to do with me?

640
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:04,118
What do you want to do with me?

641
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,580
Why are you pushing it back to me?

642
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,916
It's as if you're playing with me.

643
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,168
You show a bit
of your feelings and hide them.

644
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:14,962
Then you feel me out.

645
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,755
You're such a coward.

646
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,726
At first, I thought it couldn't be helped
because of the Love Spell.

647
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:32,771
But spells didn't work.

648
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,482
Then I need to wake up.

649
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:38,318
But…

650
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,156
I'm still a mess.

651
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,787
I don't want to believe
in temporary feelings either.

652
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:51,665
I really…

653
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:57,087
I really don't want to.

654
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,759
But when I look at you…

655
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:07,848
I can't control myself.

656
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:27,910
You know,

657
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,704
I'm not friends with Na-yeon.

658
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,832
I thought we were for a while,

659
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:35,626
but I was mistaken.

660
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:40,172
But I don't want
to steal someone else's boyfriend.

661
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,593
So don't do anything.

662
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,764
You're a City Hall lawyer.

663
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,683
I'm a civil servant of the same City Hall.

664
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:55,354
Let's just stay that way.

665
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:58,148
Let's not get any closer.

666
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:27,719
Stay right there.

667
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:51,910
Thank you for showing me
the great night view.

668
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,300
This needs to look
like a real date until the end.

669
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,265
Go in.

670
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:15,434
I'll check around the house
before I leave.

671
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:19,271
-Take the spray.
-No.

672
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:23,191
Keep it with you.

673
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,279
Be careful.

674
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:30,782
Don't worry.

675
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:33,660
I'll get going now.

676
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,190
Why are you so late?

677
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:51,905
You weren't

678
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,574
waiting for me, were you?

679
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:57,119
Where have you been?
You weren't home yesterday.

680
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:58,412
You were here last night?

681
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,455
To see me?

682
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,545
Or are you still not over Hong-jo?

683
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,883
Tell me where you've been first.

684
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:17,431
I was on a three-day business trip
with the mayor.

685
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:18,932
Now tell me why you're here.

686
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:23,812
I need your permission.

687
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:28,687
You can't be here
to buy flowers at this late hour.

688
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:35,360
I'll be straightforward.

689
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:37,904
The straw that was there.

690
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,031
What did you use it for?

691
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,955
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

692
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,228
Ms. Yoo. Look at me.

693
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:13,940
How do I look?

694
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:17,152
Naturally smudged makeup
that makes people want to kiss me.

695
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:21,615
Did you not wipe your mouth after eating?

696
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,452
Men might think differently.

697
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:28,496
I'm going to Mr. Jang for a consultation.

698
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,083
He won't fall for you.

699
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,001
Why not?

700
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:37,756
The woman on the first floor
is nowhere to be seen recently.

701
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,299
They might've broken up.

702
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,968
No love lasts forever.

703
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,053
Love

704
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,472
changes.

705
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,769
Ms. Son. Can you pass mine to him too?

706
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:55,482
I asked him about the stray cat issue,
but he hasn't replied or picked up.

707
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:56,858
That kind of a request…

708
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:00,320
I love it.

709
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,114
You're thoughtful.

710
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,076
I'm off.

711
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,120
Thank you.

712
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:21,257
Why are you back already?

713
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:23,927
Mr. Jang's not there.

714
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:24,928
He's on sick leave.

715
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,390
-Why?
-I wouldn't know about that.

716
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:30,058
Gi-dong told me that.

717
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,560
I even bought new clothes.

718
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,062
Wear them tomorrow.

719
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:36,940
He won't know you wore
the same clothes two days in a row.

720
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:40,902
He's not gone for a day or two.
Gi-dong doesn't know when he'll be back.

721
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:43,029
Is he very ill?

722
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,031
I hope he gets well soon.

723
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:48,910
My heart breaks
when a handsome man falls ill.

724
00:54:51,287 --> 00:54:52,288
Yes?

725
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,289
I didn't call you.

726
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:56,668
The pamphlet's sample is here.
Let's check together.

727
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,045
Where's Ms. Ma?

728
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,132
Can we write this already?

729
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,467
I'm sorry.

730
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,428
-Hello.
-Where have you been?

731
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:08,304
The festival's soon, so we're busy.

732
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,848
I couldn't endure it anymore.

733
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:11,933
-So I went to hospital.
-Oh, my.

734
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:13,435
What happened?

735
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:16,062
My unbalanced washing machine
would keep sticking out.

736
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,148
I sprained a finger while fixing it.

737
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:20,608
It's so hard living alone.

738
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:23,528
I can't move a washing machine
nor my bed alone.

739
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:25,447
My house is a mess.

740
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:28,158
I cried because I couldn't uncork wine.

741
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,827
My boyfriend would've
opened it for me if I had one.

742
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:33,496
It made me feel so lonely and miserable.

743
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,583
Speaking of which, all of us are single.

744
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,710
Is this team under a curse?

745
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:39,878
It is.

746
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,589
Under a malicious one.

747
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:50,597
Won't the curse be lifted soon?

748
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,725
You're going on a blind date today.

749
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,268
That's right.

750
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,439
Stop your nonsense. Check the pamphlet.

751
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:02,233
We got in big trouble last year
because of a typo.

752
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:05,528
There's a typo here.

753
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:08,531
Instead of "festival,"
it's written "testival."

754
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:13,870
Who wrote the draft?

755
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:17,290
I did.

756
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,292
Are you going to work like this?

757
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,003
It's not her fault.

758
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,880
I didn't check properly at the end.

759
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:29,385
-Call them and fix this.
-Okay.

760
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:33,473
You're so prepared for the blind date,
but your work's a mess.

761
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,190
You got good eyes.

762
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:44,275
Yes. Maybe because she has big eyes.

763
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:45,527
-Goodness.
-Good job.

764
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:46,820
I'm sorry.

765
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:48,988
But there's one more.

766
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,115
Come on.

767
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:52,450
Goodbye.

768
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,501
Why do you want

769
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:04,254
to set up a CCTV at my house?

770
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:07,590
Someone stole Hong-jo's clothes
from her house.

771
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,593
I'm worried about it happening again.

772
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,013
Are you suspecting me?

773
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,057
So you asked where I've been?

774
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,935
If it sounded like that,
I guess that's true.

775
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,567
I can't let you set up a CCTV.

776
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,610
If we need one, I'll set it up myself.

777
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:28,778
Stay out of it.

778
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:44,627
Gosh.

779
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,754
It looks pretty.

780
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,298
Thank you for your hard work.

781
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,092
The signboard will be done
tomorrow afternoon.

782
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,469
I'll call you when it's up.

783
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:53,595
Okay.

784
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,805
I'll take pictures for my report.

785
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,315
It's cool.

786
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:13,865
What?

787
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,825
Why are the lights off?

788
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,077
This shouldn't happen
during the festival, sir.

789
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:23,708
Sir?

790
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:31,883
Goodness.

791
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:36,471
UNKNOWN

792
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:39,933
Hello?

793
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,020
Hello--

794
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:49,234
Jae-gyeong's on my list of suspects too.

795
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:52,570
We came across each other quite often too.

796
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:57,158
What's happening?

797
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:47,667
UNKNOWN

798
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:57,403
DESTINED WITH YOU

799
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,698
-Will Sin-yu be fine?
-Hong-jo.

800
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,451
I brought some sleeping pills.

801
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:05,328
You need to sleep soundly.

802
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:07,622
I'm concerned about the curse doll.

803
01:01:08,998 --> 01:01:12,335
Do you think Sin-yu's sick
because of this curse?

804
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:14,879
"A disaster will happen for sure."

805
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:17,590
"Your soul and body will be destroyed."

806
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,467
You know nothing

807
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,177
about what will happen to you.

808
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,720
Let's run away.

809
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:24,681
It doesn't matter where.

810
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:30,520
