1
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,966
DESTINED WITH YOU

2
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,012
EPISODE 6

3
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:34,886
What happened?

4
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,555
Don't tell me…

5
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,402
Are you crazy?
How dare you try to kiss me?

6
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,034
No.

7
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,621
I wouldn't have come back home safely
if that was the case.

8
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,375
Then was it…

9
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,397
We shouldn't do this.

10
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:30,400
What?

11
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,777
I do understand what you must be feeling.

12
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,614
You might want me.

13
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,659
But please go back.

14
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,126
Of course.

15
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,880
You have amazing self-control, Sin-yu.

16
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,551
I can't remember anything.

17
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:04,350
Get a grip, Sin-yu.

18
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:14,944
Good morning.

19
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,827
Why are you here?

20
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,495
Well…

21
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,956
I waited for you.

22
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,127
Why?

23
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,880
You're the one who took me home yesterday.

24
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:35,381
Yes.

25
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,051
What did you do to me in the bedroom?

26
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,719
I was undressed.

27
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,765
I didn't undress you.

28
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,017
Then did I undress myself?

29
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,357
You must not remember anything.

30
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,944
Yes, I remember.

31
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,820
That's why I'm complaining now.

32
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,657
Whatever happened,

33
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,284
it's both our fault.

34
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,162
What happened yesterday?

35
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,707
You know, that happened.

36
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,875
What exactly?

37
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,503
Like I said, that.

38
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,304
Honestly, I can't remember a thing.

39
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,515
I think we did kiss.

40
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,518
Oh, that's what you're talking about.

41
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,729
You were terrible at it.

42
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,524
At what?

43
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:36,734
Congratulations.

44
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,195
You said you wanted to black out.
Your wish came true.

45
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:42,615
But don't drink so much next time.

46
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,325
I think you have low alcohol tolerance.

47
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,007
These are five years' worth of reports

48
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,508
from the Road Division.

49
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,679
What does a man normally do

50
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,849
when he blacks out?

51
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,935
Can a man, who's very collected,

52
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,688
has strong self-control,

53
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,316
and is overly neat,

54
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,485
make a mistake when he's drunk?

55
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,279
-Did you make a mistake?
-It's not me.

56
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,531
You sound angry. So it is you.

57
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,160
When you woke up,

58
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,037
were you totally naked?

59
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,330
I wasn't.

60
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,914
Then I swear

61
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,541
nothing happened.

62
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,294
Wearing your underwear again
before sleeping

63
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,671
when you're drunk enough to black out?

64
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,131
That's not easy.

65
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,351
Get a grip, Sin-yu.

66
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,439
Yes. I checked the complaint.

67
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,648
I investigated it.

68
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,443
Based on the Wildlife Protection
and Management Act,

69
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,487
we cannot capture raccoons.

70
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,950
We must abide by the law, after all.

71
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:12,497
But we'll do our best
to make the trail around the water…

72
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,583
cleaner and safer.

73
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,671
Did he swear and hang up again?

74
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,842
Yes. He says I should
come and catch the raccoon now.

75
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,136
It's okay.

76
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,429
Shall we eat?

77
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,640
-Yes.
-Okay, let's eat.

78
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,104
I'm dying after a 16-hour fast.

79
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,021
Mr. Gong.

80
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:38,981
What do you want to eat?

81
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,360
I'll eat with Hong-jo.

82
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,988
We need to eat and go catch the raccoon.

83
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,372
Article 19, paragraph 4,
sub-paragraph 1 of that act states

84
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,999
exceptional situations
for catching raccoons.

85
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,337
I made a mistake.

86
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,465
I should've checked
the act more thoroughly.

87
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:08,052
Let's decide whether to
catch the raccoon or not after seeing it.

88
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,930
Now that's called slacking.

89
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:11,889
Why decide later?

90
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,432
Decide now.

91
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,355
Hong-jo. Pack up. Let's go quickly.

92
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:21,941
What do you want for lunch?

93
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,948
Greenway Building Division
of Onju City Hall.

94
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,745
What is it about?

95
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:39,041
Did I surprise you
by calling you out of the blue?

96
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,044
Yes.

97
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,797
What is it that you must tell me?

98
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,593
It's not easy to say it.

99
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,762
I was shocked after hearing it from him.

100
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:55,933
May I ask

101
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,854
what it is that you heard?

102
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,318
I found out about it
when I ran into Min-ho a few days ago.

103
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,405
That your dad passed away
after you dropped out.

104
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,534
I cried a lot when I heard that.

105
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:19,373
I didn't know anything
and assumed you were doing fine.

106
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,002
I'm not asking for your forgiveness.

107
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:27,006
I know saying this
doesn't mean anything to you now.

108
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,383
But I just wanted to tell you how I feel.

109
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,263
You must've resented me a lot.

110
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,660
I did resent you,

111
00:08:57,119 --> 00:09:00,665
but it's not your fault
that my dad passed away.

112
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,255
Thank you for saying that.

113
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,223
Sin-yu.

114
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:26,941
Hurry up. This way.

115
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,659
Sit here.

116
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:42,999
Were you crying?

117
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,959
She made me cry.

118
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,212
You moved me.

119
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,257
Is it fine for me to be here?

120
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,593
You didn't say you had company.

121
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,761
I wanted the three of us to meet.

122
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,221
So I can officially introduce you.

123
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,473
You've met before, remember?

124
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:03,060
We had a misunderstanding before,
but we just made up.

125
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,855
She's my best friend from high school.

126
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,566
And he's my fiancé.

127
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,651
Say hello.

128
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,446
Hello.

129
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,824
Yes, hello.

130
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,536
You don't look good.

131
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,413
Are you sick?

132
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:24,999
Well…

133
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,668
I don't think I should be here.

134
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,795
Enjoy your time with her.

135
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,006
I have something to do. I'll be off.

136
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:33,924
Hong-jo.

137
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,552
What's up with her?

138
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,272
Why do I feel like
I've been cheating and then caught?

139
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,691
This feels awful.

140
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:57,531
Didn't you say we couldn't meet often
because of a city hall renovation?

141
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,741
Yes.

142
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,660
I don't think we can meet.

143
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,827
But you'll see me around.

144
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,871
The city hall I'm in charge of

145
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:05,998
is Onju City Hall.

146
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,627
Why didn't you tell me that before?

147
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,796
I wanted to surprise you.

148
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,090
But then I realized I shouldn't.

149
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,927
After all, I'm the daughter of the mayor
and I'm dating you.

150
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,389
People will definitely say
that I pulled strings to get the job.

151
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,609
Is that your lunch?

152
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,447
I missed my lunch break.

153
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,575
Then let's eat together.

154
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,161
Sorry?

155
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,252
Did something happen
between you and Sin-yu?

156
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,045
You came back at dawn.

157
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,881
Did I wake you up?

158
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,634
I tried not to make any noise though.

159
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,302
I couldn't sleep. I was concerned.

160
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,808
When did you two
establish such a relationship?

161
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,310
There's nothing going on.

162
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:13,315
Men normally don't go
to a woman's house drunk

163
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,651
unless they really like that woman.

164
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,780
Sin-yu didn't come because he liked me.

165
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,282
He came to make a complaint.

166
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,827
I caused a bit of trouble.

167
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:30,332
I think he has a bigger fault in this,
but he keeps insisting that he doesn't.

168
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,920
Anyway, all these issues will be resolved
when the full moon rises.

169
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,675
It can be resolved
by making a wish upon a full moon?

170
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:45,139
Then you should've eaten a round bread
instead of triangular gimbap.

171
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,145
Right. Thank you for the flower basket.

172
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,147
I've never received one before.

173
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,316
What flower basket?

174
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,154
Didn't you send me the roses?

175
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,490
No, I didn't.

176
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,993
Then who was it?
There's nobody else who'd send me that.

177
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,496
Maybe it was Sin-yu.

178
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,247
No way.

179
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,417
Throw away the flower basket

180
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,920
unless you have feelings
for whoever sent it.

181
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,891
Is the triangular gimbap enough?
Do you want more?

182
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,893
I had lunch with the mayor.

183
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,897
Are you eating again because of me?

184
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,487
Triangular gimbap is perfect for dessert.

185
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,038
Will you stop being mad already?

186
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,916
I just got divorced.

187
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:57,836
I'm already upset.
I don't need you to add to it.

188
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,676
When you took an extended leave,

189
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,928
I couldn't sleep because I was worried.

190
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,472
As soon as I saw the news story

191
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,809
about your trashy husband,
I almost had a panic attack.

192
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:15,354
I was worried about you harming yourself.

193
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:18,691
Why did I even care?
Because clearly, I'm nothing to you.

194
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,194
Why did you do that?

195
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,154
When my mom was battling cancer,

196
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,490
why did you visit her
to help her so often?

197
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,826
On her deathbed,
she said she missed you.

198
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,203
I guess I was delusional.

199
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,747
I thought you were my family.

200
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,125
But no. I'm nothing to you.

201
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,337
Have a good life
and stay strong, on your own.

202
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,672
Like a lonely rhino.

203
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,925
Or should I say, a malicious rhino?

204
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,306
He's so petty.
He's still upset over what I said.

205
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,392
Fine. Go.

206
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,271
MA EUN-YEONG

207
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:58,856
Darn it.

208
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,035
Ms. Ma?

209
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:12,703
Who are you?

210
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,204
Gosh.

211
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,166
You sure look malicious.

212
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,584
Right?

213
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,880
You wanted to see my face.

214
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,757
You wanted to fight with me. Right?

215
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,052
So here I am, you fucking bitch!

216
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,266
You're the one who called multiple times.

217
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,810
But as I said,

218
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,688
I don't fight with someone who's drunk.

219
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,981
Go get some sleep.

220
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,150
A nap is good for day drinking.

221
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,237
Hey.

222
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:50,032
Do you think I'm here because I'm drunk?

223
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,533
You piece of…

224
00:15:56,288 --> 00:16:00,167
How dare a mere civil servant talk back?

225
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,045
Hey.

226
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,005
Can't you see my broken leg?

227
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,131
Can't you?

228
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,925
Are you sure it's broken?

229
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,885
You kicked the pot just fine.

230
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,805
You!

231
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,306
Shut that mouth.

232
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:18,310
I'll show you what I can do.
I'll show you.

233
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,104
Hey.

234
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,314
What do you say? Should I cut your face?

235
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,108
Put it down.

236
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,193
-Put it down.
-Get lost.

237
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,697
Don't come close.
Put the damn camera away.

238
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,741
People like you

239
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,453
need to be taught a lesson.

240
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,871
Got it?

241
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:40,582
Who are you?

242
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,584
Let me go, punk.

243
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,380
How dare you?

244
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,173
You jerk.

245
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,909
Ms. Ma, are you okay?

246
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,081
Call the cops.

247
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:22,082
Sorry?

248
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,043
Okay.

249
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,630
Stupid problematic complainants.

250
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,983
Are you hurt anywhere?

251
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,443
No.

252
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,114
Thank you. I mean it.

253
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,868
I didn't do that for you.

254
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:02,331
I just did
what a martial artist should do.

255
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:24,353
LEE NAM-HO, HONG WOO-SEOK, JO NEUNG-HAN

256
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,313
LEE HONG-JO

257
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,903
How can you appear

258
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,738
out of the blue?

259
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,917
Throw away the flower basket

260
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,294
unless you have feelings
for whoever sent it.

261
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:53,841
All right.

262
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,108
Wait.

263
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,151
My pajamas.

264
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,611
Laundry's done.

265
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:17,906
Where did they go?

266
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,578
Are they here?

267
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:40,929
What?

268
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,146
-Yes?
-It's new for you to pick up so fast.

269
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,024
I had to check something.

270
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:55,110
Did something happen? Why are you panting?

271
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,071
I was looking for my pajamas.

272
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,823
My favorite pajamas are gone.

273
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,451
I hung them on the drying rack.

274
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,869
But I can't find them.

275
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,704
You're like me.

276
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,457
Both you and I need
to find something immediately.

277
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,127
Jae-gyeong is more like,
"It should be somewhere," and leave it be.

278
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,462
I'm busy.

279
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,922
I don't have time for this.

280
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,216
Why did you pick up when you were busy?

281
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,135
I said I had to check something.

282
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,846
Did you send me a flower basket?

283
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,140
I sent it in my thoughts. Did you get it?

284
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,058
I'm serious.

285
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,351
Did you not send me one?

286
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,813
You're the only one
who would send me something like that.

287
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:32,940
Well,

288
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,525
your destiny
on the first floor must've sent it.

289
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,569
What flowers were they?

290
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,571
Were they roses by any chance?

291
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,366
Whatever I got is none of your business.

292
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,202
How is it not? It makes me jealous.

293
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,457
I'm not being jealous because I want to.

294
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,251
I don't want to,

295
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,420
but I end up being jealous
before I realize it.

296
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,257
I know that too.

297
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,926
I'm busy with an important trial.

298
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,303
But I can't focus on work

299
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,846
because you keep appearing.

300
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,765
It must be the hangover.

301
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,767
You looked very tired in the afternoon.

302
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,935
That's not it.

303
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,689
I miss you.

304
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,946
Hold it in for a few days.

305
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,200
Those feelings will disappear soon anyway.

306
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,916
Yes. I want the full moon to rise quickly.

307
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,710
Two-timing

308
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,336
feels terrible.

309
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,838
The same goes for me.

310
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,382
Being with Na-yeon
and you felt very strange.

311
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,176
Just prepare
the Disaster Nullification Spell well.

312
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,970
We must succeed this time.

313
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,388
Especially the peach branch.

314
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,223
Get a nice, decent one.

315
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,350
You prepare well.

316
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,353
Don't eat meat or drink
because they might jinx it.

317
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,855
Don't even kiss.

318
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:55,939
Stay pure, okay?

319
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:56,940
Wait.

320
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:01,278
Must I not kiss to stay pure?

321
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:05,407
Then we can't do it this month.
We kissed yester--

322
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,867
I said we didn't do it!

323
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,206
I shouldn't have picked up.
He's of no help.

324
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,337
She sounds angry.
That must mean I was right.

325
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,560
Get a grip, Sin-yu.

326
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,070
Do you think we can win?

327
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,739
In a lawsuit to cancel the penalty,

328
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:49,284
Onju City Hall needs
to prove the legality of the disposition.

329
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,328
But they didn't in the first trial.

330
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,622
We can't lose this trial

331
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,499
because we got the evidence.

332
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,336
That's good. When we get
the overdue road occupancy fee,

333
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:02,172
I'm planning to use it
to support small businesses.

334
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,841
Even if we win, Haum won't just accept it.

335
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:08,011
They'll take it
to the Supreme Court and stall for time.

336
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,806
By the way,

337
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,725
why did you move into that house?

338
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,187
Why did you come
to see Hong-jo that night?

339
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,481
The driver made a mistake.

340
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,941
That's not true.

341
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,532
Don't come to our house ever again.

342
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:31,827
"Our"?

343
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,287
If that bothers you, I'll rephrase it.

344
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:38,416
Don't come to Hong-jo's house ever again.

345
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,587
That won't happen.

346
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:49,136
Mayor is looking for you.

347
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,934
Welcome, Mr. Jang.

348
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,185
You must be busy.

349
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,029
Did you call for me?

350
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,532
Yes. I wanted to introduce you to someone.

351
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,284
Hello. Nice to meet you again.

352
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,787
Do you know him?

353
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,247
Of course.

354
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,417
He had my back
when he worked in Law & High.

355
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,710
What are you doing? Sit.

356
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:25,005
I'm busy.

357
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,215
I have a trial with your company.

358
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,301
That's why I'm telling you to sit.

359
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,763
Mr. Jang. Have a seat for a bit.

360
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,683
Just for a while.

361
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:49,529
Why is such a skilled lawyer
like you working here?

362
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:50,822
That's private.

363
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,700
Didn't you quit the law firm
because I hurt your pride?

364
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,660
It wasn't because you hurt my pride.

365
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,995
It was because it felt dirty.

366
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,208
Lawyers are so eloquent.

367
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,879
This is the problem with rich kids.

368
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,923
If you were penniless,

369
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,343
you wouldn't have quit
even if your work felt dirty.

370
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:12,761
Am I wrong?

371
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,138
Jeez,

372
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,349
why are you so touchy today, Mr. Lee?

373
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,726
I should get going.

374
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,565
Because the company you run,
which makes you richer than me,

375
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,400
I need to receive compensation

376
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:31,696
for the illegal occupation of the road and
the failure to make timely payment for it.

377
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,741
You don't need to go.

378
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,452
What do you mean?

379
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,579
I'm just going to pay 3.7 billion won.

380
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:43,959
After all this?

381
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:44,918
Yes.

382
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,836
I know you well.

383
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,255
Why would I waste my time?

384
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,548
I'll definitely lose the trial.

385
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,634
Right?

386
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,303
Gosh, Mr. Lee.

387
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,222
Thank you for your promise to pay.

388
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,684
Mr. Jang. Good job. See you later.

389
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,405
The CEO of Haum gave up on the trial.

390
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:16,408
He'll pay the compensation
for occupying the road.

391
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,286
In return,
he'll get development preference.

392
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,746
You better assist the mayor well.

393
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,249
Anyway, didn't it end well?

394
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:26,543
We got 3.7 billion won without a trial.

395
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:28,753
Dinner to celebrate?

396
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,630
I'll pass. I have somewhere to go.

397
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,842
You can go there tomorrow.

398
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,468
I can't.

399
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,761
Tonight's the full moon.

400
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,639
What? What about the full moon?

401
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:41,099
All these issues

402
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,518
will be resolved
when the full moon rises.

403
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,198
The moon.

404
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:14,007
But now I know
what my habit is when I'm drunk.

405
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,218
If someone's next to me…

406
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,473
I want to kiss them.

407
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:10,397
He dozes off when he's drunk.

408
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,453
He's so annoying whenever he talks.

409
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,164
But he looks so handsome when he sleeps.

410
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,254
Gosh. Wake up.

411
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,214
Sin-yu.

412
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,508
Wake up, Sin-yu.

413
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:42,387
Why are you shouting?

414
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,431
What is it?

415
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,933
Why am I lying down here?

416
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,477
Never drink again
if you're going to act this way.

417
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,104
Let's go now.

418
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,527
Aren't you going home?

419
00:28:58,737 --> 00:28:59,654
I will.

420
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,198
Then why are you lying down?

421
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,493
My body won't listen to me.

422
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,246
I see.

423
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:11,249
You'll wake up when you get wet with dew.

424
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,001
Your body will listen to you then.

425
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,878
I'm too tired, so I'm off.

426
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,464
What if I get bitten by some killer ticks

427
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:21,342
or get scrub typhus and die?

428
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,636
Then this would become a field
where a person died.

429
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,099
You're cruel.

430
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,436
Hong-jo.

431
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,981
Take me home.

432
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,692
I'm scared of bugs.

433
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,740
Gosh.

434
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,456
You're heavy!

435
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,167
Hey, wake up!

436
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,463
I'm beat.

437
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,341
He's freakishly heavy.

438
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:03,259
I'm thirsty.

439
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,889
Give me water.

440
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:11,851
Drink.

441
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,353
Thank you.

442
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,647
Rest well. I'll get going.

443
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,941
Right.

444
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,400
Change your door password.

445
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,277
How could you use 12345678?

446
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,196
Unbelievable.

447
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,781
I won't change it.

448
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:28,701
Don't forget my door password.

449
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:32,539
Sleep now.

450
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,250
I don't want to do it.

451
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,669
The Disaster Nullification Spell.

452
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:52,308
My heart keeps beating fast
when I see you.

453
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,566
You die if your heart doesn't race.

454
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:07,782
My heart has never beaten
this fast for anyone.

455
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:13,621
I've never spent the whole night awake
thinking about someone either.

456
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,750
Do you know how much my heart ached…

457
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,338
in the cab on the way back from Sokcho?

458
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,553
When you talked about your father…

459
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,474
I thought my heart was going to melt.

460
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,776
I don't cry

461
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,279
for others.

462
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,617
But when I look at you, I want to cry.

463
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,621
I can't sleep either.

464
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:57,916
All day long,
I'm curious about what you're doing.

465
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:01,878
It's so annoying that you live
in the same house as Jae-gyeong.

466
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,880
But still,

467
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:06,466
I like you.

468
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,472
Do you really think

469
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,351
this is the spell's doing?

470
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:24,817
Yes.

471
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:26,694
It's the spell.

472
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,029
No, it isn't.

473
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,449
It's…

474
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,453
love.

475
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,568
He made me feel uneasy
by saying strange things,

476
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,112
and he doesn't even remember.

477
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:38,725
You look like gimbap.

478
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,810
Your clothes aren't neat.

479
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,485
Why won't you look? I'm very neat.

480
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,369
I don't have a car.

481
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:02,373
I couldn't get on the bus
without a jacket because it was too cold.

482
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,418
Good job on wearing the seaweed.

483
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,047
So you didn't shock people
with your beauty.

484
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:15,303
Just wait for a while.
I won't look beautiful to you anymore.

485
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:16,846
That's a relief.

486
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,139
Exactly.

487
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,224
Let's go nullify the disaster quickly.

488
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,144
Sure.

489
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:44,999
I'm ready.

490
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,299
What are you doing? Come.

491
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:56,761
It feels ominous.

492
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,555
You think of me as a disaster.

493
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,100
If you cast this spell, I might disappear.

494
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,521
I never thought of you as a disaster.

495
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:10,316
The fact that you like me is a disaster.

496
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:11,984
You don't want it.

497
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,319
I don't want it.

498
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,072
Are you sure?

499
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,240
Do you not want me?

500
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,616
Let's get started quickly.

501
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,121
I don't think that's a peach tree branch.

502
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,793
If you keep this up,
I won't cast the spell.

503
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:34,382
You promised I could have all the spells
except one, but you're using them all.

504
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,227
Come here.

505
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:50,982
Sit.

506
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,667
"Prepare a branch of a peach tree,

507
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,752
red chili, red beans,

508
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,590
black ink, and red Korean paper."

509
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:19,302
"Close your eyes and think peacefully

510
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,138
about the disaster you wish to nullify."

511
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,982
Close your eyes.

512
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,447
Bong-gil!

513
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,284
Bong-gil!

514
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:48,539
Bong-gil!

515
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,085
Have you seen Bong-gil?

516
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,505
Did you lose your child?

517
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,925
No. My dog.

518
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,637
We were on a walk,
and when I answered my phone,

519
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,888
I let go of the leash.

520
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:06,933
I've been looking for him,
but I just can't find him.

521
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,143
He wouldn't be here.

522
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,437
We've been here awhile.
We didn't see him.

523
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,774
Then will I never find him?

524
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,901
He's like my son.

525
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,361
Bong-gil, you jerk.

526
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,071
We'll look for him.

527
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,740
Really?

528
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:26,202
We can't ignore a civilian
in need of help. She's a civil servant.

529
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:28,537
She's in charge of park maintenance too.

530
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,705
But not this park.

531
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:30,706
So?

532
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,126
Are you not going to help?

533
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,717
I'll help, of course.

534
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:43,886
Bong-gil.

535
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:45,972
Bong-gil.

536
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,057
Woof. Bong-gil.

537
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,767
Where are you, Bong-gil?

538
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,018
You little punk.

539
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,062
Park Bong-gil.

540
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,563
Lee Bong-gil.

541
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:55,898
Kim Bong-gil.

542
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:57,733
Bong-gil.

543
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,110
Where are you, Bong-gil?

544
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,403
Bong-gil, where are you?

545
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,654
Bong-gil.

546
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,258
Hong-jo. Keep calm and listen to me.

547
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:27,388
Can you walk toward me slowly?

548
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:29,890
Bong-gil.

549
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:31,767
Are you Bong-gil?

550
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,448
Are you hiding behind me?

551
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,284
We should just go.

552
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,243
Look at it.

553
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,370
It doesn't look like Bong-gil.

554
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:55,249
He looks like a Maximus, a Darth Vader,
or something along the same lines.

555
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:57,877
Right?

556
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:17,897
Oh, my goodness!

557
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,571
What happened?

558
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:27,740
Did it bite you?

559
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:30,117
It's dangerous. Stay still.

560
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,329
I…

561
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,748
I can't breathe.

562
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,543
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

563
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:44,882
I am

564
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:46,759
not okay.

565
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,053
What?

566
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:52,264
My heart keeps pounding.

567
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,144
Move aside.

568
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:00,940
It startled me.

569
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,616
Bong-gil.

570
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:13,661
His heart must be pounding because of you.

571
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:17,123
Goodness.

572
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:20,668
Dogs sure get along.

573
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,423
You said it yourself.
You are as cute as a puppy.

574
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,258
Sit.

575
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:29,718
Are you ordering me?

576
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,221
Not you. Bong-gil.

577
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,348
Bong-gil, sit.

578
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,393
Paw.

579
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,481
Gosh.

580
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:47,486
Bong-gil!

581
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,197
Bong-gil.

582
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,407
There's your mom.

583
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:53,951
Thank you.

584
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:55,161
It's nothing.

585
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:57,955
Bye, Bong-gil.

586
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,540
Let's go. Thank you.

587
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,875
Bye.

588
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:04,920
Let's really start now.

589
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,214
Wait. We can't do it now.

590
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,676
I'm dirty because
Bong-gil licked me all over.

591
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,137
-Sin-yu--
-Look at the moon.

592
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,265
When I look at it closely,
it doesn't look completely round.

593
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:17,808
Are you serious?

594
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:20,561
If today passes,
we need to wait for a month.

595
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,898
Honestly, don't you think it's a waste
to use a spell on this?

596
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,775
Shouldn't we save it for a car accident

597
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,236
or an earthquake
that may happen in the future?

598
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,115
Fine then. I won't cast it.

599
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,118
You'll like me forever
and I'll like Mr. Kwon.

600
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:38,162
A tangled love triangle is not bad.

601
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:39,413
But what about Na-yeon?

602
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:41,457
What about her?

603
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,753
Just as it's a disaster
that you fell in love with me,

604
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,880
being sick is a disaster too.

605
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:52,801
I want you to recover quickly

606
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,471
and I hope everything works out
for you and Na-yeon.

607
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,266
That's not the reason.

608
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:04,271
You want to get rid of me
and get together with Jae-gyeong.

609
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:11,278
Still, I'm grateful to you.

610
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:14,782
You ate with me

611
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,867
and joined me to help honor my dad.

612
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,036
You even called me.

613
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,502
Actually, I was very lonely.

614
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,797
But I felt less lonely

615
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,591
because you called me every day.

616
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,814
Sit down now.

617
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,363
Hurry.

618
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,239
"Close your eyes and think peacefully

619
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,784
about the disaster you wish to nullify."

620
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,456
"Dip the peach tree branch into the ink

621
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:46,790
and write…

622
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,420
'prevent disaster' on red Korean paper."

623
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:56,342
"Fold the Korean paper carefully

624
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,554
and make the person keep it for 100 days."

625
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:05,476
Here.

626
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,353
Keep this with you for 100 days.

627
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,646
Don't lose it.

628
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:11,440
Don't worry.

629
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,484
You don't need to take me home.

630
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,486
I wasn't planning to.

631
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:17,821
Because this is the end.

632
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:21,950
Then I'm off.

633
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,370
Sure. Goodbye.

634
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:44,556
Gosh.

635
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,186
What?

636
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,314
Did the Disaster Nullification Spell
not work?

637
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,779
Why did you call again?

638
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,447
I feel so refreshed.

639
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,658
I didn't think about you at all overnight.

640
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,453
-Really?
-Yes.

641
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,998
I stayed up all night
to check if I would think of you.

642
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,500
And I didn't.

643
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,794
I think the charm really worked.

644
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,337
That's a relief.

645
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:20,259
Actually, I was nervous
when I wrote the charm yesterday.

646
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:21,552
Don't worry.

647
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:23,804
I won't chase you around

648
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,265
or call you ever again.

649
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:28,016
Congratulations.

650
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,977
I'm so happy.

651
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:34,440
But shouldn't you sleep
to get to work tomorrow?

652
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,567
I'm going to sleep now.

653
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:39,445
Did I wake you up by any chance?

654
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:40,904
It's okay.

655
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,239
I woke up to good news.

656
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,198
Right?

657
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,075
Go back to sleep. Sweet dreams.

658
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,619
Sure. Sweet dreams too.

659
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,496
Thank you.

660
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,268
Hello.

661
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,145
You look happy.

662
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:14,146
Yes.

663
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,899
I'll get going.
I came out just in time for the bus.

664
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:17,941
Wait.

665
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,949
Did you wrap things up with Sin-yu?

666
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,493
Yesterday was the full moon.

667
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:30,704
Yes, we wrapped it up neatly.

668
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:35,417
I'll get off at the supermarket.

669
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,920
If we go all the way
to City Hall together,

670
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:40,214
people might misunderstand.

671
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,008
Okay.

672
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:46,512
It feels rather strange.

673
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,765
I'm going to get out halfway secretly.

674
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:53,018
It feels like
we're doing something secretive.

675
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:54,978
Like Bonnie and Clyde?

676
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,356
Are they a famous couple?

677
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:01,693
Bonnie and Clyde.

678
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:08,909
They worked as a duo.

679
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,620
They robbed and murdered

680
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,580
and died.

681
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:16,708
They were that kind of couple?

682
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,301
You've made my commute much easier.

683
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,261
Thank you.

684
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,180
Are you free this Sunday?

685
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,392
Why?

686
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:37,521
Let's go to the dog shelter together.

687
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:40,732
I see.

688
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,819
Sure.

689
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:49,241
What nice weather.

690
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:09,970
Yes!

691
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:22,566
What was that?

692
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:26,278
Hey!

693
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:42,294
Look. Which is better?

694
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,380
-Aren't they the same?
-How are they the same?

695
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,549
This is slim-fit. This is regular.

696
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:49,384
Well…

697
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,887
-Right?
-I'll go with the left one.

698
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,473
Always go with the left one
for special occasions.

699
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,271
Which is better?

700
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,106
-Left?
-Okay.

701
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,149
They both look bad.

702
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:05,275
I'm going with red.

703
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:10,781
Which is the best?

704
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:12,366
Just wear whatever.

705
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,659
Who looks at the belt?

706
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,119
I knew I should go with my feelings.

707
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,623
-Then why did you even ask me?
-Exactly.

708
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:20,624
Why did I ask you?

709
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:22,959
I shouldn't ask you.

710
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,395
Why are you dressing up?

711
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:42,771
Are you cheating on me?

712
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:46,858
I have a meeting with Kim Hee-ae today.

713
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:49,528
Didn't I tell you?

714
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:52,364
Ms. Kim agreed to star
in our company's commercial.

715
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:54,950
Ms. Kim, my foot.

716
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:00,330
I look perfect. This is great.

717
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:07,421
Daddy will get going.

718
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,965
Keep the house safe while I'm gone, okay?

719
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:26,857
You.

720
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:30,819
Today's your last day with your dad.

721
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,828
Those were the days.

722
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:42,914
I'm jealous.

723
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:02,893
Gosh.

724
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:05,353
Is that you, Wook?

725
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:07,272
Yes. Hello.

726
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,693
Are you here to sell secondhand goods?

727
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:13,820
How did you know?

728
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,156
Is your nickname "Beyonce"?

729
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:21,328
Then are you "The Jade Sleeve"?

730
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,830
-Yes.
-Gosh.

731
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,165
I can't believe this.

732
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:27,250
Here.

733
00:51:28,084 --> 00:51:29,252
Gosh.

734
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:32,255
Are you sure
you want to sell it for 200,000 won?

735
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,965
Originally, it's over a million.

736
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,425
Do you want more discount?

737
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,803
That's what they do
when they sell used goods.

738
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:39,846
I can't ask for that.

739
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,640
It's already a great deal.

740
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,351
Coffee's on me.

741
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,231
That's pretty.

742
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:50,941
I needed a tumbler.

743
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:55,654
Which is better?

744
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:57,864
What?

745
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:03,161
This?

746
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,705
You sure have good taste.

747
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,541
I found this better too.

748
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,838
Don't you want a drink?

749
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:18,927
I wished women like her
wouldn't come to City Hall.

750
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,221
I hate she looks so pretty
in such basic clothes.

751
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:24,349
The renovation will take over a month.

752
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:26,268
What if she meets Mr. Jang here?

753
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:28,019
I hope they don't fall in love.

754
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:31,731
Let's eat salad instead of
pork backbone stew. I'm on a diet.

755
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:32,941
Hong-jo.

756
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,864
I was waiting for you.

757
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,700
Is this why you suddenly apologized?

758
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:43,159
Because you had to work here?

759
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:44,953
Yes.

760
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:48,206
We'll get to meet often.
It's better to become friends again.

761
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:51,167
But don't tell others
that I'm dating Sin-yu

762
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:53,378
and that I'm the mayor's daughter.

763
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,964
I don't want to
get attention for stuff like that.

764
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:59,801
The news won't spread
if you don't advertise it.

765
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:02,345
Good luck with your work.

766
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,350
A drunk complainant came a few days ago

767
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,395
and caused a ruckus.

768
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:13,273
I just grabbed his arm and did this.

769
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,483
Let me check the situation.

770
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,319
It might have been self-defense.

771
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:22,240
Isn't that considered self-defense?

772
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:26,077
Some might think you overdid it.

773
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,370
Then what happens to me?

774
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,414
Will I be locked up for assault?

775
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,583
You'll be fined at most.

776
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:35,128
I won't be promoted this year either.

777
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:37,923
I'm sorry, Mr. Gong.

778
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,134
Thank you for your advice.

779
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,055
Wait for me.

780
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:10,580
Dad is home.

781
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,043
Where did my baby go?

782
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,343
Where did my baby go?

783
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:25,637
Did you move it?

784
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:27,973
Yes.

785
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:32,811
Your baby was such an eyesore.

786
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:35,313
So I disowned it.

787
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,693
Put it back right now.

788
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,361
Or we'll get a divorce.

789
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:45,907
That's great!

790
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:49,619
I have more than enough reasons
to get a divorce now.

791
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:57,293
GREEN BREATH ONJU

792
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:02,382
GREEN LANDSCAPE GARDEN

793
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,385
Why does he call at this hour?

794
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,025
Why aren't you picking up?

795
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:24,738
I was just going to.

796
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,823
What brings you here at this hour?

797
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:28,324
I waited for you.

798
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,659
Let's have dinner together.

799
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,037
With me?

800
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:33,538
Yes.

801
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,124
This is for you.

802
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:40,628
Did you send me the flower basket?

803
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,048
No pressure.

804
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:47,218
The roses would rather
bring joy to someone

805
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,846
than be thrown away for not being sold.

806
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:53,266
But roses are a bit too much.

807
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:55,393
These are ranunculus.

808
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:58,605
They're fine
since they're not roses, right?

809
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,691
Well… Sir.

810
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:06,780
Last time, you remembered
what my tumbler looked like.

811
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,866
Did you drink the water in it?

812
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:12,243
Oh, yes.

813
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:15,163
I wanted to know what tea you drank.

814
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:17,082
It tasted rather unique.

815
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:18,958
What was that?

816
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,798
I'll treat you to dinner
to apologize for drinking it.

817
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:27,342
Let's go. I reserved a restaurant.

818
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:29,219
I'm sorry,

819
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:32,764
but I don't want to meet privately
after working hours.

820
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:37,852
Let's talk about the confederate rose
festival then. That's work-related.

821
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:39,729
Sir.

822
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:41,606
You told me to tell you

823
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,359
when I wanted to talk about my wife.

824
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,614
I'm not available today.

825
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:50,782
I have dinner plans.

826
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,492
I'm going to meet him in front.

827
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:53,701
Who?

828
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,579
You won't know him.

829
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,206
Still, tell me.

830
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:02,919
It's me.

831
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,094
Let's go, Hong-jo.

832
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,973
Isn't Ms. Ma waiting?

833
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:18,226
Okay.

834
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:21,354
I'll get going.

835
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,756
What's wrong with him?

836
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,051
He drank it.

837
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:54,804
Drank what?

838
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,390
The love potion?

839
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:00,310
He might have drunk more than you did.

840
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:05,190
You've put so many people in trouble.
You should've poured it into Han River.

841
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:08,860
So everyone in Seoul drinks the
love potion and falls in love with you.

842
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,279
I didn't think of that.

843
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:13,198
I should've just done that instead.

844
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:16,951
I went through trouble to make it
only to have irrelevant people drink it.

845
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,328
I didn't drink it on purpose.

846
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:19,996
I didn't do that on purpose either.

847
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,332
That doesn't make you guiltless.

848
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:24,667
Ignorance is the source
of crimes and misery.

849
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:28,129
You shouldn't be saying that.
I cast the Disaster Nullification Spell.

850
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,558
-Get out.
-I'm going to.

851
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:43,603
Still, thank you for just now.

852
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:45,522
Don't get out.

853
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,194
I want to drive you home.

854
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,447
The charm must not be working yet.

855
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,451
That's right.

856
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:02,163
Actually, I missed you.

857
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:05,833
Here we go again.

858
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:12,173
Why would the spell instruct me
to keep the charm with me for 100 days?

859
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,092
We need to wait for 100 days.

860
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:16,094
There's always the first 100 days.

861
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:18,471
It won't work for me overnight either.

862
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,890
I'll just disappear.

863
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:25,061
Don't…

864
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,811
What's wrong with you? Get a grip.

865
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:38,676
What's this?

866
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:50,229
Gosh.

867
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,814
Don't you think this is too much?

868
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:54,817
We just saw each other.
And you're here again?

869
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,362
I didn't come because I wanted to.

870
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:59,364
I had no choice but to come this time.

871
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:02,325
Did you miss me again?

872
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:05,495
Yes. I missed you so much.

873
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,997
And I think I will forever.

874
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:10,792
What do you mean?

875
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,545
What will you do about this?

876
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,674
What about it? Keep it.

877
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,467
There's no use keeping it with me.

878
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:22,303
When I saw the CCTV footage,
all I could see was you.

879
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:25,473
Seeing you fall
made my heart ache tremendously.

880
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:28,476
Seeing the strange man flirt with you
made my insides burn.

881
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:32,397
When you got on the bus
and disappeared, I felt like crying.

882
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,690
Of course I felt that way.

883
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:35,316
It couldn't be helped.

884
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:38,486
Because you ruined the spell completely.

885
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:43,157
What did I ruin?

886
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,493
This character means "flower."

887
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:47,620
It doesn't mean "prevent disaster."

888
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:49,872
What?

889
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,250
Can't you tell even now?

890
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:54,711
They're clearly different characters.

891
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:57,046
SACRIFICE

892
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,090
FLOWER

893
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:02,927
I could've turned into a flower.
Why did you do this?

894
01:02:03,511 --> 01:02:05,638
Why did you make such a critical mistake?

895
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:09,475
Well…

896
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:12,395
I must've been too nervous.

897
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:14,689
Why get nervous at that important moment?

898
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:17,024
You stared at me too intensely.

899
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,617
Did you get nervous
because I stared at you?

900
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:28,035
Why?

901
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,080
You said you never liked me so far.

902
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:35,334
I didn't say it was because I liked you.

903
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:39,046
You keep making me feel uneasy.

904
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:42,049
Saying you loved me and whatnot.

905
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,597
I said that?

906
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:53,436
No way.

907
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:56,689
I don't cry

908
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,150
for others.

909
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:02,987
But when I look at you, I want to cry.

910
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:04,530
It's…

911
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:08,701
love.

912
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:18,836
I was drunk.

913
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:20,880
I know that too.

914
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,175
Don't take it seriously.

915
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:26,636
I didn't take it seriously.

916
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,679
You were just drunk.

917
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:33,059
You were just saying nonsense.
So why would I take it seriously?

918
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,895
I wasn't just saying nonsense,

919
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:37,563
to be exact.

920
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:56,249
Sin-yu, what's wrong with you?

921
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:00,670
You promised you'd never come.

922
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:05,800
You said it was over.

923
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:07,468
Yes. Well--

924
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:08,928
I'm not done with it.

925
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:11,848
What?

926
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:14,100
Apparently,

927
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:15,059
I love her.

928
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:16,811
I love Hong-jo.

929
01:04:58,227 --> 01:05:01,147
DESTINED WITH YOU

930
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:04,400
I regret turning down those feelings.

931
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:05,610
I'll be straight with her.

932
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:07,486
You haven't heard the rumor yet?

933
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,405
They say she's dating Mr. Jang.

934
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,824
Congrats on revealing your relationship.

935
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:13,576
Be honest with me.

936
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:15,912
You were attracted
to Hong-jo from the start.

937
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:18,706
Isn't the spell just an excuse?

938
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:21,250
Then do it.

939
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:24,211
Let's check if the spell works right now.

940
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:27,715
If it's proven to work, what will you do?

941
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:33,471
