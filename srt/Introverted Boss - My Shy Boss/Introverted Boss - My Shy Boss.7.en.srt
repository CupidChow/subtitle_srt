1
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,450
Wow, a panda.

2
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,020
Isn't it cute?

3
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,929
- Yes!
- Yes!

4
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:57,799
All right. Let's begin!

5
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,399
It's okay
because my face is covered.

6
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,969
It's okay because they're kids.

7
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:16,780
The adults
are unexpectedly enjoying it too.

8
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:27,030
I've changed.

9
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,069
Oh, my. It's Panda!

10
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,579
But it looks
a little different from mine.

11
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,049
Gosh, it's a man!

12
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:56,719
Boss.

13
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,090
What is this?

14
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:02,959
I didn't want to come
empty-handedly.

15
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,870
Kimchi?

16
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,159
Can I ask you something?

17
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:36,930
I heard a rumor.

18
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:38,960
Three years ago...

19
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:43,099
I heard that your secretary
took her own life.

20
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,139
That secretary.

21
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,180
What was she like?

22
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,520
I'm sorry.

23
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,590
She was a good person.

24
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,800
But...

25
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,930
I never...

26
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,340
told her that, not even once.

27
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,139
That's what I regret the most.

28
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:27,580
I see.

29
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:42,689
You said you don't like kimchi.

30
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,060
I don't dislike it.

31
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,900
I just couldn't like it anymore.

32
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,210
Since you told me what you've been
bottling up inside,

33
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,979
shall I also tell you something
I've buried away in my heart?

34
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,180
A while ago,

35
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,919
I told you about my sister.

36
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,560
My sister...

37
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:16,290
is actually dead.

38
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,769
After she died,

39
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,439
my mom stopped making kimchi.

40
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,209
So I asked her one day.

41
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,509
"Mom, why don't you make kimchi?"

42
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,879
Guess what she said.

43
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:39,319
We no longer have anyone...

44
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,720
that will eat kimchi.

45
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,730
"We no longer have anyone..."

46
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,129
"that will eat kimchi."

47
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:59,470
I like kimchi, too.

48
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,810
I'm her daughter, too.

49
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,290
Just like that,
my mom stopped making kimchi...

50
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:18,660
and also lost her will to live.

51
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,500
Then soon after that,

52
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:30,000
she died from a heart disease.

53
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,370
Since then,

54
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,750
I haven't even touched kimchi.

55
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,220
It reminds me of my mom.

56
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,930
But...

57
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,269
I think I can eat it now.

58
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,870
Who made this, by the way?

59
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,810
Don't tell me you did.

60
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:11,910
That's unbelievable.

61
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,079
This tastes way better
than my mom's.

62
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,420
It doesn't remind me of my mom
at all.

63
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:30,129
Let's see.

64
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,000
It tastes so refreshing.

65
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,000
It feels like a huge weight
has been lifted off my chest.

66
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,439
Merry Christmas.

67
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:46,680
Merry Christmas.

68
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,480
Do only good-for-nothings...

69
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:53,649
work at Silent Monster?

70
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,389
They blew a project
that wasn't even child's play.

71
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,959
What's wrong with them?

72
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,290
You know Mr. Park
of Rose Airlines, right?

73
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:03,329
Yes.

74
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,329
The one who was accused
of power abuse?

75
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,269
I was so sad when Hwan Gi was
criticized for power abuse.

76
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,870
Mr. Park made me feel much better.

77
00:07:12,069 --> 00:07:15,509
There's someone else who's
as embarrassed as I am.

78
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,079
He'll get in touch with you soon.

79
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:26,019
I need his wife's family's help
in the primary election.

80
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,990
Do you understand?

81
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:31,490
Let Silent Monster
take charge of the PR project.

82
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,160
And you butter Mr. Park up.

83
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,600
Okay, I will.

84
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:39,899
Let's stop talking about work.

85
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,690
Did my sister not see
who Boss really is?

86
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,259
Why didn't she see it?

87
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,000
It might not have been his fault.

88
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:23,370
What if something else...

89
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,269
happened to her?

90
00:09:38,179 --> 00:09:40,690
(Mr. Kang Woo Il)

91
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,889
Yes, Mr. Kang.

92
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:47,490
Where are you?

93
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:51,529
Can we meet now?

94
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:59,500
I have something I have to tell you.

95
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,570
Could it be...

96
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:08,750
You'll be the best PR expert
in this country.

97
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:10,549
I'm sure of it.

98
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,220
It was just a practice.
Don't be too hard on yourself.

99
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,259
It'd be a big problem if you
become even stupider.

100
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:28,769
Could Mr. Kang be Mr. Smith?

101
00:10:34,409 --> 00:10:36,269
(Yi Soo)

102
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,409
(Yi Soo)

103
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:56,990
(Yi Soo)

104
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,009
Hello.

105
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:12,039
He's alone. He's very drunk.

106
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,070
Are you okay, Mr. Kang?

107
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,570
How can you be here?

108
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:47,009
You told me to come.

109
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,580
It's you, Ms. Chae.

110
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,690
Yes, it's me.

111
00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:00,059
You said you had something
you had to tell me.

112
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,759
I have something I want to
ask you as well.

113
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:08,730
Are you the person...

114
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:10,370
I think you are?

115
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,740
I'm...

116
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,909
not the person you think I am.

117
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,580
I'm...

118
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:25,580
no one to be looked at that way.

119
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,389
You'll be disappointed
once you get to know me.

120
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:31,620
Well...

121
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,230
I'm not sure I understand.

122
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,830
You don't even know who I am.

123
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,870
When you look at me...

124
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,440
that way,

125
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:51,009
it makes me ashamed of myself.

126
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,450
I didn't know
you were getting married.

127
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:09,360
- But I know everything now.
- That's not what I mean.

128
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,669
Are you okay?

129
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,980
I'm sorry.

130
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,250
You shouldn't look at me.

131
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,460
You shouldn't look at me like that.

132
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:46,659
But I wanted you to...

133
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,539
I wanted you to watch me.

134
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:55,240
I'm sorry...

135
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:58,610
I'm such a coward.

136
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,750
I'm really sorry.

137
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,929
You seem very drunk.

138
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:23,330
I'll go get some medicine for you.

139
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,799
Wait here.

140
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,019
Thank you so much for today.

141
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:48,490
Thanks to you, the kids had
a happy Christmas.

142
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:50,690
I should thank you.

143
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,269
By the way...

144
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,899
Ms. Chae left earlier.

145
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,009
Take care.

146
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,389
(7 missed calls)

147
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,970
Did you call?

148
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:36,340
I did. Woo Il suddenly disappeared.

149
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:37,570
He did?

150
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,750
Yes, but we found him. Don't worry.

151
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:53,259
He was drunk at a bar.

152
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,889
He was by himself.

153
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,730
Are you sure he was alone?

154
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,440
Yes.

155
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:14,980
He was alone.

156
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,450
It's nothing.

157
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,889
One of our staff has been
giving him trouble.

158
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:14,910
(Episode 7:
The Dignity of a Supporting Role)

159
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,009
- Your revenge is over?
- Yes.

160
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,619
I think there must be something else
that pushed my sister...

161
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,349
to commit suicide.

162
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:34,259
- Just eat this.
- It's hot.

163
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:38,730
Anyway, it doesn't seem like
Boss was the reason.

164
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:41,329
What changed your mind?
What did Eun Hwan Gi do?

165
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,529
What?

166
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:49,240
Because you're Chae Ro Woon.

167
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,140
(Merry Christmas!)

168
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,450
You're Chae Ro Woon, not Eun Yi Soo.

169
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,660
Does that mean you will quit Brain?

170
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,359
Smart thinking.

171
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,130
Just watching you made me anxious.

172
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,799
I will stick around for a while.

173
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,140
- I want to find Mr. Smith.
- Mr. Smith?

174
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:24,069
That anonymous fan
who always sends you flowers?

175
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,680
He started to send me flowers
three years ago,

176
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:31,109
ever since my sister passed.

177
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,779
Why won't he show himself?

178
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:36,950
I think it's someone from Brain.

179
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,519
What are you drawing?

180
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:45,430
Of what someone is always
looking at.

181
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,029
Someone?

182
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,170
Did you get a boyfriend?

183
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,769
What?

184
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:54,839
No way.

185
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,170
It's just...

186
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,480
someone from work.

187
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,049
Mr. Smith
will definitely know something.

188
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,650
The truth no one else knows.

189
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,119
Speech...

190
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:19,700
Hello. I'm your fan.

191
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,500
I heard you went on a workshop.

192
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,940
You look a lot more relaxed.

193
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:34,380
Our team's future
depends on Rose Airlines project.

194
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,809
If I don't change...

195
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:37,880
Why are you working here alone?

196
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,420
I thought you wanted to change.

197
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,190
That's because
I'm trying to change...

198
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,890
You're trying so hard
when no one is looking.

199
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:53,700
Isn't that the way you lived
all your life?

200
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,200
You didn't change that much.

201
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:01,910
Don't do it alone. Work together.

202
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:03,740
If you really want to change,
that is.

203
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,109
Together...

204
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:10,049
You must sit close
with your teammates...

205
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:13,549
and put your heads together
to exchange ideas.

206
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,490
I'll get started.

207
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,059
Mr. Park of Rose Airlines...

208
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,170
had time off after controversy
spread about his power abuse.

209
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,069
However, negative public opinion
is still dominant.

210
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,240
It is crucial that we improve
the owner's public image.

211
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,579
(Rose Airlines CEO back at work?)

212
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:40,680
It's not too bad.

213
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:42,109
Some don't even take time off...

214
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,519
Gosh. Please.

215
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:51,420
When the focus is on you,

216
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:54,119
use a tool that could calm you down.

217
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:06,369
Please continue sharing
your thoughts. I will listen.

218
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,509
Then...

219
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,410
How about a volunteer outing
for Mr. Park?

220
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:16,950
This campaign's intention
would be too obvious.

221
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,720
Since he aroused public criticism,

222
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:25,019
it makes sense to give to the public
in order to change his image.

223
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:28,630
An owner's public image
cannot be easily changed.

224
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,299
What about an overseas trip
for the orphans?

225
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:39,440
We're not the cleaners that clean
up after owners who abuse power.

226
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:42,039
Sun Bong, please.

227
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:44,569
I think he's about to explode.

228
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,309
It'll be hard to restore his image,
so we must focus on...

229
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:53,220
bringing up the company image
that went down with him.

230
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:55,549
How do I say this?

231
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:58,720
Well...

232
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,089
What do you think, Sir?

233
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,630
Everyone shared their opinions
very enthusiastically.

234
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:09,799
How do I make sure
I don't hurt anyone...

235
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:13,470
while moving forward with this?

236
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:16,470
My opinion isn't necessarily
the right answer.

237
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:19,539
I don't want them to agree
just because I'm the leader.

238
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:22,750
Should I say it humorously?

239
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:23,950
No, no.

240
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:27,750
I better talk loud and clear
for them to understand easily.

241
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,420
Should I mention about
focusing on the company image?

242
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:33,859
Or is it better to say,
"brand over individual"?

243
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:37,259
All right. I should talk confidently
while being open to ideas.

244
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,059
I will finish it up saying
we should try our best together.

245
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:44,940
He's mad. He's angry.

246
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,170
Sun Bong, why did you say that?

247
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,940
I think Boss needs some time
to think it over.

248
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,039
Of course. It must be better
for him to work alone.

249
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,009
- That's not it.
- Let's get up.

250
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:56,950
Everyone needs time.

251
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:00,619
Let us know.

252
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:03,819
Take your time.
We won't pressure you.

253
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:06,220
- Bye.
- Enjoy your lunch.

254
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:09,130
- You'll think of something good.
- Goodbye.

255
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,559
Right, my desk is over there.

256
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:21,440
This is hard.

257
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:30,309
It's still so difficult
to stand before a lot of people.

258
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:35,490
- I can never be a leader.
- Come on.

259
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:38,759
You're the leader.

260
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,359
You can't be
a supporting role forever.

261
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,630
You should challenge yourself
to a team dinner next time.

262
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,700
Put your arms around them,

263
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:49,529
and take pictures, too.

264
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,970
- Cheers.
- This is nice.

265
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:01,210
Anyway, why a team dinner?

266
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,809
He must be trying...

267
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:05,019
to change himself.

268
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,880
Yes. He scheduled a meeting,
and now a team dinner.

269
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,849
Don't you think he's changed?

270
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,490
What's taking him so long?

271
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,160
Did something happen?

272
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,990
Can someone go check?

273
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:17,359
- Last one loses. One.
- Two.

274
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,900
- Three.
- Four.

275
00:24:21,099 --> 00:24:22,130
You're it.

276
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,200
- Congratulations
- Congratulations

277
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,339
- Congratulations
- Me?

278
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,309
Do I look too young?

279
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,150
Is it too formal?

280
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:55,029
Excuse me,

281
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:57,700
everyone's waiting.

282
00:24:58,569 --> 00:25:01,369
Yoo Hee was worried
and asked me to check on you.

283
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:02,869
Hey,

284
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:04,839
can you help me?

285
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,640
- Pardon?
- Well...

286
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:11,009
You seem to be interested
in fashion and beauty.

287
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,019
Me?

288
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,279
Yes.

289
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:18,420
I thought maybe you could
specialize in that area...

290
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,829
as an Account Executive.
I thought about it for a while.

291
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,059
I mean it.

292
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,960
- Me?
- Yes.

293
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,170
Help me out.

294
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,750
Just as I expected. I knew that
suits would look amazing on you.

295
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,519
You look so dashing.

296
00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:55,960
It's just a casual team dinner.
I wonder if this is a bit too much.

297
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:04,130
- Do you not like it?
- Don't get me wrong. I like it.

298
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,339
- Really?
- Yes.

299
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,599
Then...

300
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,069
let's accessorize you up with this.

301
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:14,880
This is how you tie it.

302
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,480
Like this.

303
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,180
Lastly...

304
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,250
What is that?

305
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,589
This will set it in place.

306
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,390
I see.

307
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,000
He's here.

308
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:45,039
My gosh.

309
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,819
Doesn't he look so dashing?

310
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:02,130
- I styled his outfit.
- Is he attending an award ceremony?

311
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,630
He's definitely too
overdressed for this occasion.

312
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,970
I think he looks pretty good.

313
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,940
Let's sit down.

314
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,509
Wait, why are you going over there?

315
00:27:19,509 --> 00:27:21,009
Why are you sitting here?

316
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:23,250
- Come join us. Sit with us.
- Yes, please sit with us.

317
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,079
- You have to join us.
- But...

318
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:27,349
- Please drink with us.
- I have to leave shortly.

319
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,119
You can still have a drink with us.

320
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,259
Since you're here,
let's have a drink.

321
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:36,859
How about you make a toast?

322
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,230
Say something awesome.

323
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,740
- Bottoms up? Already?
- Bottoms up?

324
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:54,039
- Bottoms up?
- Let's do it.

325
00:27:54,109 --> 00:27:56,380
- Let's go, guys. Bottoms up.
- Gosh, wait.

326
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:57,910
Seriously?

327
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,289
Finished!

328
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,059
I drank it all, too.

329
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,829
- That's it?
- Is that it?

330
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:12,960
Yes.

331
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:15,369
Let's sit down.

332
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,839
Gyo Ri,
let's take a selfie together.

333
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,809
In 1, 2, 3.

334
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,109
- What are you two doing?
- It turned out great.

335
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,880
- Let's take one more.
- They look so cute together.

336
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,480
- We should take a photo, too.
- Okay.

337
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:30,109
- I want to be in it, too.
- Hurry up.

338
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:32,279
All right. Here we go.

339
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,549
Let's see.

340
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,420
In 1, 2, 3.

341
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,190
- Send it to me.
- Okay.

342
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,359
Send it to me, too.

343
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:45,130
- Send me the photo.
- Done. I just sent them.

344
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,730
- I want it, too.
- Thank you.

345
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:50,930
- Gosh, that's a bad photo of me.
- I think you look good.

346
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,970
My gosh, Gyo Ri
has such a small face.

347
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,710
This is a good photo of Gyo Ri.

348
00:28:57,339 --> 00:28:59,339
There.
I invited Boss to our chatroom.

349
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,049
You didn't have to.

350
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,450
Goodness.

351
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,259
All of us should take
a photo together.

352
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:15,829
Shall we? I'll take it.

353
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:17,660
No, no. All of us.

354
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,859
That'd be great. Then...

355
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:23,400
Oh, excuse me.
Do you mind taking a photo of us?

356
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,569
- Let's do it.
- Yes. Come on, guys.

357
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,970
- I don't have to be in it.
- Nonsense.

358
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,140
- Come on. Let's do it.
- Come over here.

359
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,410
Smile, Boss.

360
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:38,920
In 1, 2, 3.

361
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:50,990
It's our very first team photo.

362
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,500
Sent.

363
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:58,400
My gosh, it turned out great.

364
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,440
That velvet suit
looks awesome on you.

365
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:04,069
That hairstyle suits you very well.

366
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:06,880
Boss, you look more handsome
in photos.

367
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,750
You're very photogenic.

368
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:11,549
- Did you hear about it?
- My gosh.

369
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,180
I didn't know Silent Monster's
team dinner was here, too.

370
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,250
- Oh, my.
- Hello.

371
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,390
- Hello.
- Hello.

372
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:20,319
- Mr. Kang.
- Hello.

373
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,089
Hwan Gi, are you drinking
with them here?

374
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:27,759
Gosh, what's up with that outfit?

375
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,400
We were taking photos together.
Please join us.

376
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,569
Oh, shall we?

377
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,470
- Shall we take a photo?
- Yes, I'd love that.

378
00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:39,380
The ones at the front should
sit down for those at the back.

379
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,339
- Everyone has to be in the photo.
- Move over.

380
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,049
- Move over a little.
- In 1, 2, 3.

381
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,150
All right, one more. In 1, 2, 3.

382
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,240
Try to aim both at the same time.

383
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:13,240
Gyo Ri,
what are you doing here alone?

384
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,910
I was going through
a job search app.

385
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:22,049
I'm actually the one
who told Boss to wear that suit.

386
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,990
I guess I'm not cut out to be an AE.

387
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:31,660
If this project fails,
I'll get fired anyway.

388
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:35,230
Aren't you worried, Se Jong?

389
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:38,769
I actually want to get fired.

390
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,539
I guess your family is well-off.

391
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,109
I have a dream.

392
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,140
Becoming a celebrity.

393
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,440
I want to be a multi-talented
entertainer who can sing and act.

394
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:50,849
You just sounded like
my little brother.

395
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:52,549
Remind me. How old are you?

396
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:54,119
You just sounded like my mom.

397
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,000
Is it that good?

398
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,529
I rarely get to eat
stuff like this at home.

399
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,799
You can eat it all.

400
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:14,769
You seem to be loving it. Eat up.

401
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,779
It sounds like
you have it as tough as I do.

402
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:21,039
I'm all right. My life isn't so bad.

403
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,910
Gyo Ri, do you want to play
a game of pool?

404
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,619
- Sure.
- Great!

405
00:32:29,089 --> 00:32:30,789
Move. Move over, guys.

406
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,289
He's so happy-go-lucky
even though he's poor.

407
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,630
With a guy like him, I think I'll be
happy even if I don't have much...

408
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:40,529
What am I thinking? Gosh.

409
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,400
Gyo Ri. Come on.

410
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,640
Oh, okay.

411
00:32:48,569 --> 00:32:51,410
- Oh, no.
- That was close. Oh, look!

412
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,279
Boss, I'll strike a pose.
Please take a photo of me.

413
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,680
This is how you pose for the camera.

414
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,950
There. Please take it right now.

415
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,220
That's amazing.

416
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,160
You need to step up your game.

417
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,660
- Please, please...
- Focus!

418
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,400
I'm going to distract you.

419
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,400
I'm so bad at this. My goodness.

420
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,700
One more time.

421
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:18,500
No, you don't have
to do it that way.

422
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,769
Relax and focus.

423
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:23,170
You can do it!

424
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,680
You seem experienced.

425
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,119
You saw that, right?

426
00:33:33,349 --> 00:33:35,049
- You should do better than that.
- I'm getting better.

427
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:10,150
- There's something I want to...
- I'm sorry about that day.

428
00:34:13,789 --> 00:34:16,190
- You mean, Christmas Eve?
- If you don't mind,

429
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,730
I'd appreciate it
if we don't talk about that day.

430
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,300
It'll only make things awkward.

431
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:29,010
Okay, I won't bring it up.

432
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,489
That's not what I wanted
to talk to him about.

433
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,199
Hi, guys.

434
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,230
How's the Rose Airlines project
going?

435
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:58,630
Are there any issues at all?

436
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,670
Communicating with them
hasn't been that easy.

437
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,769
I knew it.

438
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,179
- I want a report on it.
- There's no need.

439
00:35:07,309 --> 00:35:09,010
I'll handle Mr. Park.

440
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,280
You don't need to get involved.

441
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:13,420
I'm not trying to intervene.
I just want to help.

442
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:15,619
Hey, I said I don't need your help!

443
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:39,610
- Let's have some beer.
- Okay.

444
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,849
This beer tastes great.

445
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,280
It's 100 percent barley.

446
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:48,280
- Barley?
- Yes.

447
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,889
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

448
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,420
- When it's awkward, drink.
- Cheers.

449
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:54,789
- Barley, barley, rice.
- Barley.

450
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,190
- Barley.
- Barley.

451
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,500
I'm angry. I'm angry. I'm angry.

452
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:04,929
I'm angry. I'm angry. I'm angry.
I'm angry. I'm angry. I'm angry!

453
00:36:05,469 --> 00:36:06,800
Most of all,

454
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,039
I'm angry that I got angry.

455
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,250
How was the team dinner?

456
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,719
I messed it up.

457
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,619
Why? What happened?

458
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:28,289
I got angry,
and in front of everyone.

459
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:35,159
Your emotions have surfaced.

460
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,369
That's a very good change.

461
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,670
No, it isn't.
That's not how I meant to change.

462
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:43,769
I don't think
we need more counselling sessions.

463
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:46,409
- I keep getting side-effects...
- That's what it was about?

464
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,519
You even got counselling...

465
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,519
to change?

466
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,099
I'm getting so many wrinkles.
I'm tempted to get Botox injections.

467
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,269
My goodness. What if Dad finds out?

468
00:37:16,309 --> 00:37:18,139
It'll be fine as long as
you keep your mouth shut.

469
00:37:18,409 --> 00:37:21,179
- I'm home.
- Come on in, Woo Il.

470
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:33,420
Since her hairdresser did a bad job,

471
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:35,219
she's been in a bad mood for days.

472
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,590
I'm sure it's about me.

473
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:40,159
I disappeared without a word
on Christmas Eve.

474
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:44,400
It's cold outside, isn't it?
Have some hot tea.

475
00:37:50,909 --> 00:37:52,739
Why are you acting like
nothing happened?

476
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:58,050
I think I should warm up the water.

477
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:06,889
I got wasted after dashing out
on a day like that.

478
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,730
And you don't want to know
why I did that...

479
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:12,659
or what happened?

480
00:38:13,929 --> 00:38:15,059
You don't get angry, either?

481
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,099
You're not going to tell me anyway.

482
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,409
But I like that.

483
00:38:28,909 --> 00:38:31,380
Words are not needed between us.

484
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,449
Even if you don't say anything,

485
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:36,789
I can understand you
and wait for you.

486
00:38:38,289 --> 00:38:39,619
I trust you.

487
00:38:41,059 --> 00:38:42,219
I'll get the tea ready.

488
00:39:44,619 --> 00:39:45,889
You seem experienced.

489
00:39:46,889 --> 00:39:48,059
What should I do?

490
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,369
I forgot my wallet.

491
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:05,940
Right.

492
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:09,079
The director of
White Cloud Orphanage called...

493
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,110
regarding the trip to Malaysia
sponsored by Rose Airlines.

494
00:40:12,449 --> 00:40:14,480
She gladly agreed to go.

495
00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:17,889
On Christmas Eve,

496
00:40:19,889 --> 00:40:21,190
did you meet Woo Il?

497
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,230
Well...

498
00:40:34,469 --> 00:40:38,070
He said he had something to tell me.

499
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:43,449
It seemed like he called me
by mistake because he was drunk.

500
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,920
He just asked me why I was there...

501
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,219
and who I was.

502
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:52,960
I went out to get some medicine
for him, and he disappeared.

503
00:40:53,989 --> 00:40:56,590
That's all.
Nothing special happened.

504
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,300
I'm thirsty.

505
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:08,500
I'll drink some water
and then leave.

506
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,780
By the way, what were you doing
this late?

507
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,449
Were you working alone again?

508
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,340
Boss?

509
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:48,809
Is it something...

510
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:50,849
I shouldn't see?

511
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:55,179
Is it something dirty?

512
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:57,820
I won't see it.

513
00:41:58,489 --> 00:41:59,559
I won't see it.

514
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:02,889
So will you please...

515
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:04,889
let go of me?

516
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,610
I'll get going, then.

517
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:57,050
What is this?

518
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,920
Was I startled?

519
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:02,650
Of course.

520
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,250
Of course, I was startled.

521
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,760
It suddenly went dark.

522
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:11,260
I couldn't see anything
all of a sudden.

523
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,900
It's no surprise I was startled.

524
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,639
Hello. I'm the person in charge,
Dang Yoo Hee...

525
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,349
I'm the person in charge,
Dang Yoo Hee.

526
00:43:30,449 --> 00:43:32,579
Where's Mr. Eun?

527
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,880
Ro Woon, where's Mr. Eun?

528
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,050
Oh, he's...

529
00:43:40,389 --> 00:43:41,820
He was right here a moment ago.

530
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,690
Boss. Boss.

531
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,230
One more.

532
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,570
Smile. Smile.

533
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:58,639
Okay.

534
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:01,039
Could we see Mr. Kang?

535
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:03,750
Mr. Park is a bit shy
with strangers.

536
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:07,349
He prefers deeper relationships
with fewer people.

537
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:09,690
He's very introverted.

538
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,989
He'll hit it off with our boss.

539
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:15,590
What?

540
00:44:16,429 --> 00:44:17,429
Hey.

541
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,099
Why are you here?

542
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,929
Do I know you?

543
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,900
Aren't you the grandson of
Mr. Kwon, the chairman of KJ Food?

544
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:26,769
Are you not?

545
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:29,369
Well, yes.

546
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,010
It must be a secret at the office.

547
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:39,650
Is that why you acted like
you don't know me?

548
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,250
I'm sorry about that.

549
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,789
It's not really a secret.

550
00:44:44,389 --> 00:44:47,059
I'm not acting like
I don't know you, I really don't.

551
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:55,400
Anyway, where is Mr. Kang?

552
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:56,900
Bring him right away!

553
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:02,239
Yes, I just arrived at the airport.

554
00:45:02,739 --> 00:45:03,809
Okay.

555
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:11,550
Are you all right?

556
00:45:12,349 --> 00:45:13,480
Get up.

557
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:15,849
Gosh, Si An.

558
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,519
Thank you.

559
00:45:28,699 --> 00:45:30,030
You're here.

560
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:35,239
This is the director
of White Cloud Orphanage.

561
00:45:35,769 --> 00:45:36,940
I'm Kang Woo Il.

562
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:42,440
It's been...

563
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:45,880
20 years, Ma'am.

564
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:48,679
Kang Woo Il?

565
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:53,659
Woo Il?

566
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,989
Do you two know each other?

567
00:46:02,929 --> 00:46:04,030
Woo Il.

568
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:14,940
You shouldn't cry.

569
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:20,519
You're like the sunshine
that shines through the rain.

570
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:23,750
I'll make sure to be in touch.

571
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,559
I won't ever forget you.

572
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:31,630
To me,

573
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:34,460
you were my mother.

574
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,619
Mr. Kang.

575
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:56,650
Mr. Kang, what are you doing here?

576
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,849
Mr. Park has been asking for you.

577
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:02,059
He keeps asking for you.

578
00:47:03,889 --> 00:47:05,329
What do you think you're doing?

579
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,300
If you decided to take the project,
you should be responsible.

580
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,929
Just because you're tall
and handsome,

581
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:12,940
that doesn't make you a CEO.

582
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,840
You're late.

583
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,639
Don't you have common sense
about treating your clients?

584
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:18,909
How can I trust you with a job?

585
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,039
I'm sorry.

586
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,510
I'm really sorry for being late.

587
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:23,880
I'm sorry.

588
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:27,349
It's all my fault.

589
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:30,019
Let's go somewhere we can talk.

590
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:32,349
Gosh. My goodness.

591
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,510
I'm the star of this project.

592
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,610
I asked you to get rid of
my bad public image.

593
00:47:57,949 --> 00:47:59,949
Who cares about
orphans going on a trip?

594
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,050
How will this help recover my image?

595
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:06,989
Silent Monster or Dumb Monster,

596
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:09,289
why would you bring
all those halfwits here?

597
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,829
Are you trying
to get away with easy money?

598
00:48:11,429 --> 00:48:14,929
Only because of Senator
Eun Bok Dong...

599
00:48:16,099 --> 00:48:17,429
Are you serious?

600
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:21,769
Where are you? What are you doing?

601
00:48:22,269 --> 00:48:23,369
Call me.

602
00:48:25,809 --> 00:48:26,940
Gosh.

603
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:31,909
Hurry. It's an emergency.

604
00:48:32,349 --> 00:48:33,420
Now.

605
00:48:36,489 --> 00:48:37,849
My goodness.

606
00:48:39,789 --> 00:48:41,289
Aren't you going to focus on me?

607
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:43,659
I'm sorry.

608
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:50,969
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Excuse me for a moment.

609
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:53,869
Our staff will inform you
on the following schedule.

610
00:48:57,639 --> 00:48:59,039
- Come.
- Why?

611
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,880
What is it?

612
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:02,480
It's an emergency. Hurry.

613
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:10,090
I sincerely apologize.
I will be right back.

614
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:16,929
Hey. What kind of situation is this?

615
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:24,630
What is it? What happened?

616
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:29,239
Go.

617
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:31,940
Go back to the office...

618
00:49:32,039 --> 00:49:33,309
and leave this to me.

619
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,780
What do you plan on doing?

620
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,309
Mr. Park isn't someone
you can handle.

621
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:41,920
If this flops,
Father's mayoral race...

622
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:45,650
No. What about your staff?

623
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:48,690
Like you just said,
they're my staff.

624
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:50,690
So...

625
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,960
leave it to me.

626
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:22,320
Yi Soo.

627
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:25,190
Woo Il?

628
00:50:26,929 --> 00:50:28,760
Did Mom call you, too?

629
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,170
She said it's something urgent.

630
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,539
Ta-da.

631
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:41,480
How do I look?

632
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:44,780
Mom, why are you wearing a dress?

633
00:50:45,849 --> 00:50:48,119
Must all moms wear hanboks?

634
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:50,719
I want to wear a dress, too.

635
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:54,820
Sure. You can wear what you want,

636
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,260
but our wedding is far away.

637
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,429
It's been three years
since you two got engaged.

638
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:04,929
You delayed it because of
the incident three years ago,

639
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,840
then you got too busy at work.

640
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:08,940
And now your father
is running for mayor?

641
00:51:09,909 --> 00:51:12,469
Hurry up and let my daughter
wear her dress.

642
00:51:14,139 --> 00:51:15,809
What do you think you're doing?

643
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,949
- Did you call Dad, too?
- Of course.

644
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:21,880
I should put my partner
in a tuxedo, too.

645
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:28,019
- Dad!
- Mr. Park called. He's outraged.

646
00:51:28,059 --> 00:51:30,730
I told you to flatter him,
and you're preparing your wedding?

647
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,889
What are you doing
wasting time here?

648
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:35,659
Mom called him. It was Mom!

649
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:37,699
How is this my fault?

650
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,699
He's not a robot I order around.

651
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,139
He had no problem...

652
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:44,639
storming out during dinner
on Christmas Eve.

653
00:51:46,539 --> 00:51:47,710
How can you do this?

654
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:50,550
You're my parents,
but you make me sick.

655
00:51:51,349 --> 00:51:52,510
What is this?

656
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,860
Woo Il.

657
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:05,889
Woo Il, wait.

658
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:11,099
(Chae Ro Woon)

659
00:52:17,269 --> 00:52:18,369
Woo Il.

660
00:52:19,809 --> 00:52:21,039
Look at me.

661
00:52:23,449 --> 00:52:24,949
Please, just take one look at me.

662
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:36,119
Don't go.

663
00:52:45,429 --> 00:52:47,199
I'll take one now. Pose.

664
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:49,300
In 1, 2...

665
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:53,610
Why is he crying?

666
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:56,110
He lost his favorite teddy bear.

667
00:52:56,849 --> 00:52:58,309
That's nothing.

668
00:52:58,909 --> 00:52:59,920
I'll buy you one.

669
00:52:59,949 --> 00:53:02,480
I'll buy you one this big, okay?

670
00:53:03,019 --> 00:53:04,920
Stop crying.

671
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:06,789
Stop.

672
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,659
Don't cry. Come on.

673
00:53:15,699 --> 00:53:17,300
You're a good boy.

674
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:20,940
Kids, he's not a bad man.

675
00:53:21,139 --> 00:53:22,500
He's just not good
at expressing himself.

676
00:53:22,539 --> 00:53:24,969
He's a very shy man. Kids?

677
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:28,079
Hey, what is this mess?
Where is Mr. Kang?

678
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:29,639
How would I know?

679
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:32,980
I'm the CEO of this company.

680
00:53:33,849 --> 00:53:36,690
You can talk to me.

681
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:39,349
- My gosh.
- What should we do?

682
00:53:39,489 --> 00:53:40,659
What's going on?

683
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:45,230
I entrusted your company with
the project because of your father.

684
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,929
You're disgracing his name!

685
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:49,460
I asked you to make
my public image more likable.

686
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:51,170
Quit it
if this is how it's going to be!

687
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:54,170
- It's okay, kids.
- All right, then.

688
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:56,199
We should cancel
the rest of your schedule...

689
00:53:56,269 --> 00:53:57,940
so that you can leave now.

690
00:53:58,769 --> 00:53:59,769
What?

691
00:54:00,409 --> 00:54:02,940
Are you basically saying
that you're giving up?

692
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:06,920
- What should we do?
- Did he just ask if he's giving up?

693
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:08,820
- Peek-a-boo!
- Even for the kids' sake,

694
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,849
a further exposure
wouldn't be a good idea.

695
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,860
Hey, what did you just say?

696
00:54:17,059 --> 00:54:20,860
I can't guarantee I'll be able to
make your image favorable again,

697
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:23,400
but I'll be sure
to promote your company.

698
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,030
You can trust me on that.

699
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:27,239
How dare you!

700
00:54:29,869 --> 00:54:31,039
Smile.

701
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,210
Gosh, who knew there'd be
so many cameras at the airport?

702
00:54:37,309 --> 00:54:38,550
I had no idea.

703
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:41,179
A famous celebrity must be
arriving soon.

704
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:46,590
The talks about you being an abusive
boss must be stressing you out.

705
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:49,420
You should really try
to stay calm about it.

706
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:51,360
I know because I've been through it.

707
00:54:51,929 --> 00:54:52,929
You little...

708
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:01,900
Sir, Sir.

709
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,469
My sincere apologies.

710
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:06,610
He's such an introvert person.

711
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:08,280
He gets very shy around people.

712
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:10,179
- I see.
- Oh, I should give you this.

713
00:55:10,579 --> 00:55:12,579
Mr. Kang dropped it earlier.

714
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:14,650
- Thank you.
- No problem.

715
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:17,619
I should go. Sir, Sir!

716
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,539
We want food!

717
00:55:40,579 --> 00:55:42,840
- You guys ate jjajangmyeon earlier.
- Come on.

718
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,010
My gosh.

719
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:46,920
- Let's go.
- Let's go have something delicious.

720
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:49,579
Are we going on a trip?

721
00:56:00,199 --> 00:56:02,400
Si Won, it's okay.

722
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,039
Really?

723
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:12,469
Of course.

724
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:15,079
I promise you. Let's pinky swear.

725
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,150
There we go.

726
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,719
Go on without me.

727
00:56:26,389 --> 00:56:27,590
What about you?

728
00:56:28,659 --> 00:56:29,760
I'll follow you.

729
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:33,860
We'll wait for you.

730
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,469
Shall we go?

731
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:39,269
I'll be waiting for you.

732
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,039
Hurry up.

733
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:51,449
Mr. Kang,
we're boarding the plane now.

734
00:56:52,349 --> 00:56:54,650
Well, except for Boss.

735
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:57,489
He actually took off
all of a sudden.

736
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,719
But please don't worry.

737
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,760
He said he'll meet us there.

738
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:37,530
Are you interested in him
now that you know?

739
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:39,530
No, it's not like that.

740
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,230
Don't even dream.
The walls are way too high.

741
00:57:45,699 --> 00:57:47,239
I know that.

742
00:57:47,869 --> 00:57:49,940
I was just looking at him.

743
00:57:50,139 --> 00:57:51,809
I can't even look?

744
00:57:53,809 --> 00:57:54,980
Do you have a crush on him?

745
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:57,480
Wake up, seriously.

746
00:57:57,949 --> 00:58:02,079
No one will think that
your feelings for him are genuine.

747
00:58:03,019 --> 00:58:04,789
Everyone will see you
as one of those girls...

748
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:07,760
who are willing to use a guy
to move up the social ladder.

749
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:10,389
I know that, too.

750
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,530
I'm fully aware.

751
00:58:13,659 --> 00:58:14,800
The sausage...

752
00:58:16,829 --> 00:58:18,929
He really enjoyed that sausage.

753
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,070
Why did he enjoy it so much?

754
00:58:28,179 --> 00:58:30,010
How much sausage did he eat?

755
00:58:30,309 --> 00:58:31,480
Do you really like him?

756
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,280
Is it the sausage or him?

757
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:40,389
Get some rest, Yoo Hee.

758
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,320
Do you want to come to me?
Come here.

759
00:58:45,659 --> 00:58:47,059
Thanks, Ro Woon.

760
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,760
- Get some rest.
- All right.

761
00:58:50,369 --> 00:58:51,829
Let's go.

762
00:58:53,869 --> 00:58:57,510
By the way, what did that man
dressed in black say to you earlier?

763
00:58:57,769 --> 00:59:00,510
He said he forgot to bring
the boarding pass.

764
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:22,559
Let's go.

765
00:59:27,269 --> 00:59:28,800
She was dropped off
at the orphanage...

766
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,769
with the stuffed toy
inside her wrapper.

767
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:35,340
To her, it's like a friend
and family.

768
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:39,780
She used to carry it with her
all the time.

769
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:53,489
Do you want to get
some fresh air with me?

770
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:56,860
Let's go!

771
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:04,940
It's so beautiful.

772
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:07,110
It's you. How disappointing.

773
01:00:08,139 --> 01:00:10,179
I told you that he's not coming.

774
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,119
- Why isn't he here yet?
- Why isn't he here yet?

775
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:21,090
Are you also waiting
for the man in all black?

776
01:00:21,789 --> 01:00:23,219
Panda.

777
01:00:23,889 --> 01:00:27,500
Do you think he found
Panda's boarding pass?

778
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:28,900
Panda...

779
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:31,929
Boarding pass?

780
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:35,840
Hey, what is this?

781
01:00:37,309 --> 01:00:38,340
Have a look.

782
01:00:39,739 --> 01:00:42,309
Wow, it's Panda!

783
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:44,750
It's Panda.

784
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,480
So many people have liked the post.

785
01:00:49,449 --> 01:00:50,489
I like it, too.

786
01:00:53,719 --> 01:00:54,760
Si Won.

787
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:58,630
Si Won.

788
01:00:59,659 --> 01:01:03,900
This is the first time Panda is
flying with you, you know.

789
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,900
Panda got so excited
and forgot the boarding pass.

790
01:01:08,269 --> 01:01:11,110
I'll go find it and get
on the next plane with Panda.

791
01:01:11,239 --> 01:01:13,309
Just go ahead
and wait for us there, okay?

792
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:15,139
Really?

793
01:01:15,179 --> 01:01:16,409
Of course.

794
01:01:17,309 --> 01:01:19,010
I promise you. Let's pinky swear.

795
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:22,550
There we go.
We'll see you there, okay?

796
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:26,650
Excuse me.

797
01:02:26,849 --> 01:02:29,920
Have you seen a stuffed panda
about this size?

798
01:02:29,949 --> 01:02:31,820
- Yes, we have it here.
- You do?

799
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:37,460
Yes, I think this is it.
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

800
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:38,690
Yes!

801
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:41,099
Panda missed the flight.

802
01:02:44,329 --> 01:02:48,239
He was so excited about his first
overseas trip with Si Won...

803
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,110
and forgot to bring
the boarding pass.

804
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:56,139
Panda is on his way
to the departure gate.

805
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,309
Panda found his boarding pass.

806
01:03:01,079 --> 01:03:03,480
Panda is going through
the security check point.

807
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:11,159
Panda is having a meal on the plane.

808
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:20,030
Panda fell asleep
wearing a sleep mask.

809
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:39,719
He was a supporting role.

810
01:03:41,219 --> 01:03:43,789
Se Jong, Gyo Ri, Yoo Hee, come here.

811
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:49,699
Oh, my.

812
01:03:50,429 --> 01:03:51,800
What's gotten into him?

813
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:53,699
It's unbelievable.

814
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:55,300
Mr. Park must be so happy.

815
01:03:56,039 --> 01:03:57,769
I didn't know he could
do something like this.

816
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:01,909
- Are we not getting fired, then?
- I guess not.

817
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:06,210
He was a supporting role who
shines brighter than the lead role.

818
01:04:07,179 --> 01:04:08,750
(He got too excited about his
first flight and ate too much.)

819
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,320
Should we go and welcome Panda?

820
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:15,460
- Let's go.
- See you.

821
01:04:15,489 --> 01:04:18,159
- See you.
- You're so cute.

822
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:20,090
What do you think?

823
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,949
You want to see the guy in black
as soon as possible, right?

824
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,920
What? That's not true.

825
01:04:44,989 --> 01:04:46,349
I think I'm right.

826
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:50,519
- You look sad because you miss him.
- That's not true.

827
01:04:50,659 --> 01:04:51,860
Gosh.

828
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:54,159
There he is.

829
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,239
You're smiling now.

830
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:21,719
I missed you.

831
01:06:01,329 --> 01:06:04,000
(My Shy Boss)

832
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:05,599
Kang Woo Il. When are you leaving?

833
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:08,000
Have you ever dug out
the incident three years ago?

834
01:06:08,039 --> 01:06:09,039
Is Woo Il avoiding your calls?

835
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:10,809
Yi Soo, tell me what happened.

836
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:12,739
Boss, I want to see you smile.

837
01:06:12,769 --> 01:06:14,340
I want to see your big smile.

838
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:16,679
You take Ro Woon's calls
and run to her when she needs you.

839
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:18,010
Why didn't you take mine?

840
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:19,150
Yes, I'm a terrorist, a sniper.

841
01:06:19,179 --> 01:06:21,679
- A sniper?
- Mr. Um!

842
01:06:21,719 --> 01:06:23,480
I won't try to change you anymore.

843
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:24,690
Don't change.

844
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:26,750
You're abandoning me
blinded by something else.

845
01:06:26,789 --> 01:06:27,860
You're not being abandoned.

846
01:06:27,889 --> 01:06:29,489
You're just like your father.

847
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:31,889
- Do you have a crush on Boss?
- Has something bad happened?

848
01:06:31,929 --> 01:06:33,489
I'm sure you have a crush on Boss.

849
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:34,900
I'm not going to
repeat the same mistake.

850
01:06:34,929 --> 01:06:36,429
I'm not going to hesitate anymore.
