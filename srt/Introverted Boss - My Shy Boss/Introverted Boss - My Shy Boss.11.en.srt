1
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,990
If you feel too nervous,

2
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:52,990
fix your eyes on me.

3
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,659
Imagine no one except me is...

4
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,929
in the room.

5
00:01:19,849 --> 00:01:21,489
Come on.

6
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,290
I'm begging you.

7
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,819
Don't change.

8
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,489
That completes the real Eun Hwan Gi.

9
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,030
We have to rush to the
presentation. We're in trouble.

10
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,729
Are we doomed once again?

11
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,830
- What should we do?
- Let's go. I'm sure he'll come.

12
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,599
- Shall we leave? We have to.
- Of course we have to leave.

13
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:50,969
Gosh.

14
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,569
We'll figure it out.
Do we have a car, by the way?

15
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:34,949
The presentation.

16
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:38,620
What should I do?

17
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:47,629
Eun Hwan Gi is...

18
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:51,699
the one who drove
your sister to death.

19
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,139
No.

20
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:05,680
No more.

21
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,620
(Chromatic Paint,
Marketing Strategy Competition)

22
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:28,399
- Why isn't Ro Woon here yet?
- I have no idea.

23
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,629
She's not even picking up.

24
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,910
She probably won't come.

25
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:45,519
What should we do?

26
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,920
We're presenting
right after Mr. Kang.

27
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:45,009
Silent... Silent Monster...

28
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:50,850
I'm Eun Hwan Gi.

29
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,470
Boss, I'm here.

30
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:27,579
You can do it.

31
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,360
Kids do...

32
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,899
foolish things sometimes.

33
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,299
Doodling on walls is one of them.

34
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,639
To us adults, it seems...

35
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,580
so foolish and useless.

36
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,649
But as adults,

37
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,519
we also do foolish things...

38
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,850
from time to time.

39
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:16,960
When someone like me
who's not good with words...

40
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,330
can't find the right words to say.

41
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:27,169
When you just can't...

42
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,470
say anything.

43
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,110
When no one listens...

44
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,580
no matter how much
you want to be heard.

45
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,389
Se Jong is trying to make me happy.

46
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,690
Who else would be...

47
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,190
so nice to me?

48
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,200
Fully knowing
that it'd be pointless,

49
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:56,500
we still try to knock...

50
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,700
on the firmly shut door.

51
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:04,610
We'd like to...

52
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:07,509
listen to...

53
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,549
that pointless knocking.

54
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:17,419
He heard my knocks.

55
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,929
The listener...

56
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,330
can be just one person.

57
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:26,700
One person...

58
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,070
is all you need.

59
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,480
- Mom and Dad, I love you!
- Mom and Dad, I love you!

60
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:45,519
Way to go!

61
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,889
Il Ho.

62
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:50,789
Il Ho, you got this.

63
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:53,259
Mom is right here.

64
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,289
- Mom.
- You can do it.

65
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,299
Il Ho.

66
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,169
The mother and the child...

67
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,710
can doodle on the walls together.

68
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:13,039
Those drawings
will add up to become...

69
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,509
the world's only art hall.

70
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,789
Instead of filling the walls
with paint,

71
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:29,059
think of it as breaking down walls.

72
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,230
And those walls...

73
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:33,860
will become doors,

74
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,470
windows...

75
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:41,210
that open wide.

76
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,610
After opening
all the doors towards me,

77
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:56,590
he looked at me.

78
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,600
Ro Woon.

79
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:22,080
There is something
we need to make clear.

80
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,649
I...

81
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:35,460
Thank you.

82
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:48,710
Don't thank me.

83
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,850
You were fooled by me.

84
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,759
If you knew
what I've done until now...

85
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,649
Actually,

86
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,049
I...

87
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,889
If he finds out who I am,

88
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:40,389
he might close all the doors
he opened towards me.

89
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:41,429
I'm...

90
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,529
Boss, are you all right?

91
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,570
Boss.

92
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,500
My goodness.

93
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,039
- Did he faint?
- Yes.

94
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:15,259
I brought something to bring
your fever down.

95
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:19,529
I'm okay.
Resting will make me feel better.

96
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,629
I'm sorry I bothered you.

97
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,639
I'm always making mistakes
ever since I was your assistant.

98
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,309
Wait.

99
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,049
Give it to me.

100
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:38,419
Will you take it?

101
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:41,690
Here.

102
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:53,929
About your presentation...

103
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,269
I ended up crying.
Something came over me.

104
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,500
I see.

105
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,909
Get some rest, Boss.

106
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,509
Thank you.

107
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,950
No problem.

108
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:33,840
What is this?

109
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,110
The air in here is musty.

110
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:39,610
The fine dust is bad these days.

111
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:43,750
Your presentation today...

112
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,120
was pretty cool,

113
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,620
Boss.

114
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,370
Boss, I heard you fainted.

115
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:11,980
My goodness.

116
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,549
You overworked yourself
because of me.

117
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,879
How was your son's talent show?

118
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,250
It was great, all thanks to you.

119
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,289
Thank you so much.

120
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:25,389
When I heard that you got sick,
I bought some porridge.

121
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,960
Please have some.

122
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,789
Thank you, but I'll eat it later.

123
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,399
Yes, you should rest.

124
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,169
I'll leave it here.
Eat it before it gets cold.

125
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,429
I love you.

126
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,570
Eat it later. Good luck.

127
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,120
Gosh.

128
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,690
- Are you up?
- What is it?

129
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:59,789
Well, I came to check
if you were tucked in.

130
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,159
I'm fine.

131
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,130
Don't kick your blanket off
like a child.

132
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,809
I lost.

133
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:20,839
You challenged yourself and
conquered your fears for someone.

134
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:23,450
It's annoying,

135
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,220
but I approve.

136
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,650
Don't make Ro Woon cry,

137
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,460
Boss.

138
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:43,900
Why are they all calling me that?

139
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,140
We decided to call you that.

140
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,980
We'll all call you Boss.

141
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:56,980
Please, I asked you not to call...

142
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:04,660
Are you really sick?

143
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,559
You're burning up.

144
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,910
You must have strained yourself...

145
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:24,940
to faint right away
after presenting.

146
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:28,950
Here, it's red ginseng.

147
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,480
Drink it all up.

148
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:32,619
Now.

149
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,049
Go ahead.

150
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,619
Good job.

151
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,589
All done.

152
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:45,200
Get well soon.

153
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:50,470
There is something
I didn't get to tell you earlier.

154
00:18:51,069 --> 00:18:52,170
Get some rest.

155
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:05,279
I'm not going to get any sleep,
am I?

156
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,599
Boss is doing the presentation...

157
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,700
because of you.

158
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:29,609
He asked for you to be sent back
if he wins the competition.

159
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:41,849
Are you up?

160
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:43,950
You're still here?

161
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,960
- Do you need anything?
- I'm okay.

162
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,059
No.

163
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,130
Do you want water?

164
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,539
I... I can do it myself.

165
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,420
Thank you.

166
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:29,829
Blanket...

167
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,410
How do you feel?

168
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:39,279
I'm a lot better.

169
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,880
Thank goodness.

170
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,130
- Well, Boss.
- Well...

171
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:03,930
I'll go first.

172
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:09,710
It must be something hard
for you to say.

173
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,079
I already know
what you're going to say.

174
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,019
Sorry?

175
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,019
I know we can't be...

176
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:28,990
together.

177
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,829
I know...

178
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:37,500
who you are.

179
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,809
What do you mean?

180
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:50,109
I caused...

181
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,019
what happened...

182
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:55,420
three years ago.

183
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:01,490
I've made you suffer all this time.

184
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,799
How did you know?
When did you find out?

185
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,640
Are you Mr. Smith?

186
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:28,589
Are you the one...

187
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:33,259
who sent me flowers...

188
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:35,589
for three years?

189
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,599
Why did you watch me?

190
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:50,710
That means you were aware of who I
am the whole time.

191
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:54,410
Why didn't you say anything?

192
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,779
I've tried to say this...

193
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,579
many times.

194
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:05,660
I'm finally saying it.

195
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,130
I'm sorry.

196
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,259
No.

197
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:17,170
It's not your fault.

198
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,369
I got you wrong.

199
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:23,009
I published the article
on your power abuse.

200
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,309
I'm the one who should apologize.

201
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:30,910
You just did what you had to do.

202
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,079
That's not true.

203
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:35,319
It's not your fault.

204
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:41,019
There must be some other reason
why my sister died.

205
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,089
The real reason
people don't know about.

206
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:47,259
There is, right?

207
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:51,539
Tell me there is.

208
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:54,809
One thing is clear.

209
00:23:56,069 --> 00:23:57,769
I'm partly responsible.

210
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,309
What responsibility?

211
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,880
I can't tell you yet.

212
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:08,589
Wait.

213
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:13,559
Well...

214
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:16,089
Leave if you must.

215
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,230
When I'm ready,

216
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,569
I'll get back to you.

217
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:26,500
What exactly happened?

218
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:29,170
Please tell me.

219
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:30,470
Give me just a little time.

220
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,609
Just a little.

221
00:24:34,609 --> 00:24:36,809
Although I can't undo anything,

222
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:39,519
I'm going to do...

223
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,990
everything...

224
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,359
I can now.

225
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,859
Wait for me.

226
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,329
Please.

227
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:22,789
He didn't say anything
even though he knew everything.

228
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:28,160
He pretended he didn't know.

229
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,299
He kept everything to himself.

230
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,769
Then again,

231
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:39,440
that's how he always is.

232
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,579
He knows everything,

233
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:45,549
but keeps it all to himself.

234
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,700
Did you eat?

235
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:34,970
Yes.

236
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:42,970
Did she cry?

237
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:17,700
(Episode 11:
The Tall Shadow of Mr. Smith)

238
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,180
Wait. Where did it go?

239
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:34,819
Where is it?

240
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,549
Someone keeps taking my trash.

241
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:39,859
- Did it disappear again?
- Yes.

242
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:42,930
It must be a pervert
with a fetish for hair.

243
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,930
Or it might be someone
obsessed with cleanliness.

244
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,170
When I came out
to clear away the snow this morning,

245
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,400
the snow was already gone. Look.

246
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,500
It's all clean.

247
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,710
Boss.

248
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:03,009
What is it?

249
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,420
Your condition seems worse today.

250
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:11,589
I'm sorry. I should be
feeling better by now.

251
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:13,119
I'm sorry.

252
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:19,529
The eco-friendly paint campaign.

253
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,769
We won.

254
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,529
We did it.

255
00:29:25,069 --> 00:29:26,940
Ro Woon's transfer has been
announced, too.

256
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:28,710
She's coming back to
Silent Monster.

257
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,140
Get some rest first.

258
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:33,339
- Get some rest.
- Leave him alone.

259
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,150
- We'll leave you alone.
- Let's go.

260
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,849
Get some sleep.

261
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:42,950
Gosh, I can't believe it.
How can this be possible?

262
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:46,059
What? Mr. Kang lost?

263
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,990
In a presentation competition?

264
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:52,599
Mr. Eun completely beat Mr. Kang.

265
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:20,960
Is Ro Woon not picking up?

266
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:22,630
Did something happen to her?

267
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:27,529
One is totally drained
after the presentation,

268
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,200
and the other one
is missing in action.

269
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,099
She can now come back
to our team. Where on earth is she?

270
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,470
- The number you have dialed...
- She's not answering.

271
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:39,539
All right, everyone. Attention.

272
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,579
As Sun Bong said, we got the
project thanks to Boss' hard work,

273
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,519
so it's now our turn to work hard.

274
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:46,549
- Let's get to work.
- Okay.

275
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:49,150
We're short-staffed
and don't have enough time.

276
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,960
All right. The press release about
the event needs to go out today.

277
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,589
We need to invite as many
photographers as possible.

278
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,299
Sun Bong and Gyo Ri,
you two should take care of it.

279
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:00,460
- Sure.
- Okay.

280
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,099
Se Jong, I'll put you in charge
of venue rental.

281
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:05,640
- Sure.
- Good.

282
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,539
Let's get moving.

283
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,819
(10 Missed Calls)

284
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,069
What's this?

285
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:12,539
It's a pair of shoes.

286
00:32:13,069 --> 00:32:15,410
- Is it for me?
- Who else do you think?

287
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,140
You got this for me?

288
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,839
You quit musicals
to work at a PR agency?

289
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,319
Are you doing it
to follow Ji Hye's footsteps?

290
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:34,359
So which company is it?

291
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,390
It's...

292
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,859
You wouldn't know
even if I told you.

293
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,440
It's a very small company compared
to where Ji Hye used to work.

294
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:46,569
I see.

295
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,440
It doesn't have to be the best.

296
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:53,079
- Just do your best from where...
- But...

297
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:58,450
I...

298
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:00,880
already quit.

299
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:16,730
Hello.

300
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:19,069
Hello.

301
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:21,140
I heard that Hwan Gi
did the presentation.

302
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,910
Yes. It yielded great results too.

303
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,839
He owes it all to you.

304
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:29,150
There's no way he actually beat you.

305
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:31,950
I'm sure you just let him win.

306
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,250
Or he probably lucked out.

307
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,319
Congratulations.

308
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:40,390
We're actually working on an article
about it being...

309
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,990
a successful case
of in-house venture.

310
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,089
By the way,

311
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,900
do you know Reporter Woo's
pirate broadcast?

312
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,829
From Hwan Gi's scandal to
mortifying clips from presentations,

313
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,799
it seems like he's out to get me.

314
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:57,640
We need a plan on how
we'll handle him.

315
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,480
Yes, I understand.

316
00:34:00,109 --> 00:34:02,650
Hwan Gi is finally coming out
of his shell.

317
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:04,950
You need to step up your game too.

318
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,829
(Aggressive Leader)

319
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,480
Hey, what's up?

320
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,710
Do you want to play
a game of basketball?

321
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,510
What are you talking about?

322
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,719
I'm swamped right now because
of your father's upcoming election.

323
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,789
It'd be good if we can exercise
together like we used to.

324
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,889
You also said that you want
to go back to those days.

325
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:51,630
What are you trying to say?

326
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:54,329
Can you just say it?

327
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,829
I need to go into a meeting shortly.

328
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:03,909
Woo Il.

329
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,809
Let's just...

330
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,179
tell everyone the truth.

331
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,150
- What?
- Chae Ro Woon.

332
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:20,789
Ji Hye's family
has the right to know.

333
00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:22,230
What are you talking about now?

334
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,889
I've hesitated for three years.

335
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:32,900
You're so head over heels
that you don't even care about me.

336
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,739
I want you back.

337
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:38,840
For us to really go back
to how things used to be,

338
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,179
there's only one thing we can do.

339
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,210
We should tell them the truth...

340
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:47,650
- and beg for forgiveness.
- What is the matter with you?

341
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,289
Are you gloating over
beating me at the competition?

342
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,630
Are you now confident
about being in front of people?

343
00:35:56,789 --> 00:35:58,960
- Am I useless to you now?
- Kang Woo Il.

344
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:06,869
The best way to go about it would be
you confessing it to them yourself.

345
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,610
I'll wait
until you're ready to do it.

346
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:11,769
Please do it for me.

347
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,639
The company needs...

348
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,710
Your dad needs me for his election.

349
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,750
Woo Il.

350
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:21,650
Even though
I might be useless to you now.

351
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,800
- I'm glad you're better now.
- Hey, Hwan Gi.

352
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:45,039
Thanks.

353
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,349
I guess Woo Il is busy.

354
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,159
Let's get out of here.

355
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:02,289
Lying down all the time
gave me cabin fever.

356
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,960
All right.

357
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:06,929
The doctor said you should
still be careful. You know, right?

358
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,360
Let's go.

359
00:37:17,139 --> 00:37:18,210
Be careful.

360
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,780
Give it to me.

361
00:37:32,389 --> 00:37:33,489
That necklace.

362
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,489
Why did you take it out?

363
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:41,360
This?

364
00:37:43,269 --> 00:37:46,969
When I want to hurt myself
because I don't like myself,

365
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,710
seeing this necklace
calms me down a bit.

366
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,480
It protects me from harming...

367
00:37:55,579 --> 00:37:56,710
myself.

368
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,079
Yi Soo.

369
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,119
But I wonder if it has
stopped working.

370
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,389
I was wearing this
when I got into the accident,

371
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,989
but I ended up getting hurt.

372
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,230
I was hoping
it wouldn't be the case.

373
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,260
Did you...

374
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,469
run into the road to stop Woo Il?

375
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,980
Let's get you treated properly
at a hospital.

376
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:33,349
I just got discharged.

377
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:36,119
Let's stop hiding it from our
parents and tell them everything.

378
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,519
- Let's also tell Woo Il...
- Then I'll really die.

379
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,619
Eun Yi Soo.

380
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,619
I barely managed to make him
not leave me.

381
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:44,190
Forcing him to stay with you
won't make either of you happy.

382
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,260
I don't care. He's all I need.

383
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,469
Then I wouldn't need any treatment.

384
00:38:49,969 --> 00:38:52,840
I'm confident that I won't
do anything foolish ever again.

385
00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:55,400
I promise.

386
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:58,869
Please trust me.

387
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,320
I want to see him.

388
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,619
Don't.

389
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,789
I won't.

390
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,789
I can't even face him,

391
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,300
but I do miss him.

392
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,969
Just drink up.

393
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:30,639
I don't want to drink.

394
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,239
I miss him this much
even when I'm sober.

395
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,449
I'll miss him even more
when I get drunk.

396
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:39,219
You said he confessed to you
that it was his fault.

397
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:40,780
Forget about him already.

398
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:43,420
He watched over me for three years.

399
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,619
It's obviously because
he felt guilty.

400
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:50,030
What if he's hiding somewhere here
and watching me now?

401
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,699
You were trying to take revenge,
and now you're in love.

402
00:39:55,699 --> 00:39:58,099
This is too conventional.

403
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:03,710
Hey, I think Congressman Eun is on
to me. He started digging.

404
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,739
Leave the rest to me
and stay low for a while.

405
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:26,400
Already?

406
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:30,000
Could you cut a little more?

407
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,269
This side is a little...

408
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,610
He knows how to talk.

409
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,510
I'll say.

410
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:41,940
- He used to always just sit there.
- Yes.

411
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,380
You don't have anything else to cut.

412
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,420
Then...

413
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:51,949
will you shave me?

414
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,260
I just did.

415
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,630
Right. Then...

416
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,769
Can you do my hair like yours?

417
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:33,699
It's finished.

418
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,969
He looks really good like that.

419
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:42,739
He sure does. You shouldn't
wear that hood anymore.

420
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:44,039
I agree.

421
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:51,179
- Thank you.
- Don't worry about it.

422
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,019
You brought
an empty container today.

423
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:06,159
It's on me today.

424
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:08,400
- No, it's okay.
- It's fine.

425
00:42:08,429 --> 00:42:09,929
It's really fine.

426
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:11,699
- Still...
- Put it away.

427
00:42:12,469 --> 00:42:14,039
Put it away.

428
00:42:14,139 --> 00:42:15,869
Just put it away.

429
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:17,239
But...

430
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,780
What? Why are you...

431
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,380
Why are you here?

432
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:29,920
What is this?
Ro Woon, do you know the regular?

433
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,219
- Regular?
- Yes.

434
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:38,460
Does this mean
you've been here before?

435
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:50,769
Hey.

436
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:58,750
Boss.

437
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:00,780
Boss!

438
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:02,650
Boss.

439
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:04,190
Boss.

440
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:13,199
Now that I think of it, he's been
coming here to see Ro Woon.

441
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,969
Me?

442
00:43:16,869 --> 00:43:18,030
Why haven't I seen him?

443
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,699
You're right.
Now that I think about it,

444
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:23,639
he would cut his hair over and over.

445
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,610
He came here so often.

446
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:28,079
He even brought japchae.

447
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,150
He brought japchae?

448
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,079
Why is he taking the trash?

449
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:36,550
The garbage thief.

450
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,920
That was him?

451
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,219
You're right.

452
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:44,590
Since the stairs are steep,
he threw out the garbage...

453
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,300
and cleared the snow for her.

454
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:51,070
What are you doing?

455
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,900
You should ask her
who he is and what he does.

456
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,309
Are we going to a wedding soon?

457
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,929
He didn't just send me flowers.

458
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,929
He was always close by.

459
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,920
Hello?

460
00:44:46,989 --> 00:44:49,789
Boss, what do we do?

461
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,559
What... What should we do?

462
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,469
What is it? Calm down and tell me.

463
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:00,199
I'm sorry.

464
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:04,869
Are you saying we don't have space
for the painting event?

465
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:08,110
I accidentally booked
for next month.

466
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:10,610
The event is tomorrow
and we have to set up today.

467
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,579
Were you too busy
with the fake dating act?

468
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:13,949
How can you make this huge mistake?

469
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:17,519
We should hurry up
and come up with a plan.

470
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:20,920
How can we book somewhere else
at this time?

471
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,159
I reported it to Boss last night.

472
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:26,599
- He said he'd look into it.
- He might be talented,

473
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,699
but he's not so good with
managing crises.

474
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:32,329
Do we have to ask Mr. Kang for help?

475
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,639
I found a place for the event.

476
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:41,510
Really? How?

477
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,579
I asked an acquaintance for help.

478
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,849
It's an atelier they rent out
to artists.

479
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,420
Thankfully it was vacant.

480
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:52,019
Wait, you have acquaintances too?

481
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:02,030
We need to act fast and inform
all the invitees about the change.

482
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:05,030
Make sure you apologize politely...

483
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,570
about the sudden change.

484
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:10,139
Make sure to inform them 2, 3 times
so that there aren't confusions.

485
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:12,170
Boss.

486
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:15,780
Is that really our Boss?

487
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,480
You don't have time for this.

488
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:21,449
You need to call everyone
then set up the event.

489
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,320
- Get moving.
- Okay, Boss.

490
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:24,889
- Okay.
- Okay, Boss.

491
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,019
Boss.

492
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:42,739
Help me.

493
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:45,239
I made a huge mistake
and it's a complete mess.

494
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:54,320
(New York Barbershop)

495
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:57,219
I don't know what happened
between you and Boss,

496
00:46:57,889 --> 00:47:00,920
but stop upsetting him
and give us a hand.

497
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,460
Hey, where are you going?

498
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:08,829
I'm going to go see him.

499
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:12,000
- Hey...
- I'll tell you the details later.

500
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:14,269
Don't go and listen to me.

501
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,739
- You're going to regret it later.
- I don't care.

502
00:47:16,969 --> 00:47:18,469
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.

503
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,110
Hey!

504
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:27,320
He was always watching over me.

505
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,429
When I thought I was alone,

506
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:47,869
he was somewhere in the dark
within the crowd.

507
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,340
When I look at it now,
he was just a few steps behind.

508
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:57,510
And I thought I always thought
I was alone.

509
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:39,960
More than that, he was...

510
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:41,860
right here beside me.

511
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:50,599
Because you're Chae Ro Woon.

512
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:55,639
Because you're Chae Ro Woon
and not Eun Yi Soo.

513
00:48:57,969 --> 00:49:00,780
What was he thinking all that time?

514
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:13,690
- Ro Woon, what took you so long?
- Gyo Ri.

515
00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:17,559
I'm sorry. You all must be tired.

516
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:19,730
Yes, it was crazy.

517
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,469
However, Boss took control
and things are getting into place.

518
00:49:23,769 --> 00:49:26,869
Boss changed.
He's like a different person now.

519
00:49:27,769 --> 00:49:30,710
It must be the power of love.

520
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:32,739
Love?

521
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:36,610
There he is.

522
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:48,619
He says she's a friend
from university.

523
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,190
She's a curator
who works in the US.

524
00:49:51,389 --> 00:49:54,230
We found this venue...

525
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,429
all thanks to her.

526
00:49:58,199 --> 00:49:59,199
I see.

527
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:03,639
Oh, my. Boss is so sweet.

528
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:06,780
He even took off that dreary hood.

529
00:50:06,809 --> 00:50:11,309
Those two look so beautiful
together, don't they?

530
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,920
- They went to university together?
- Yes.

531
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:20,719
When did you start to
wear that hood?

532
00:50:21,489 --> 00:50:22,489
Oh, this?

533
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:25,159
Since I was in university.

534
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:27,199
Why? Did something happen?

535
00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:29,900
Is there a girl involved?

536
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:32,199
Did your first love fail?

537
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,099
Both of them are so tall.

538
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:37,909
They look great together.
I hope they'll get married.

539
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,449
Was it because of a girl
from the past?

540
00:50:51,489 --> 00:50:53,920
You started to wear that hood
because of me?

541
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:57,960
What did I do?

542
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,699
I think guys look sexy
when they wear a hood.

543
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:39,699
Hyun Jin Young has been my idol
since I was a kid.

544
00:51:47,309 --> 00:51:50,110
(Welcome, Yun Jung.)

545
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,320
Yun Jung.

546
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:03,389
I'll be your Hyun Jin Young.

547
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:05,550
Really?

548
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,510
Hwan Gi.

549
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,510
Hwan Gi, where are you going?

550
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,510
After that,

551
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:34,750
I couldn't take off that hood.

552
00:53:35,619 --> 00:53:37,090
I was too embarrassed.

553
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:42,389
You could have just turned me down
if you were feeling uncomfortable.

554
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,630
You didn't have to
humiliate me like that.

555
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:47,099
Hey.

556
00:53:47,929 --> 00:53:49,460
Is that what you thought?

557
00:53:49,829 --> 00:53:52,969
I just wanted to show off.

558
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
So many girls had a crush on you.

559
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:56,869
"See? Hwan Gi is mine."

560
00:53:57,039 --> 00:53:59,769
I wanted to make it official
in front of them.

561
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,409
What...

562
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,980
It's true. You were very popular.

563
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:07,179
You probably didn't know.

564
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,519
No way.

565
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:12,449
Is that why you suddenly
became so cold to me?

566
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:17,130
I thought you lost interest in me
because I became yours.

567
00:54:17,429 --> 00:54:20,329
My pride got hurt,
so I just stopped caring.

568
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:22,860
Gosh.

569
00:54:24,099 --> 00:54:25,230
So that's what happened.

570
00:54:25,369 --> 00:54:27,400
Why didn't you tell me back then?

571
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,500
I wonder that, too.

572
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:34,340
Do you think you're being thoughtful
when you don't say what you want to?

573
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:38,309
By remaining quiet, you're not
being unfair just to yourself.

574
00:54:38,349 --> 00:54:40,579
You're being unfair to others too.

575
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:46,150
You're right.

576
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:48,989
I'm glad you finally told me.

577
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:52,489
I hope...

578
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,960
I'm not too late.

579
00:54:57,929 --> 00:54:59,199
It seems like...

580
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:02,369
something really bad happened
three years ago.

581
00:55:03,639 --> 00:55:05,639
Did something unfair
happen to someone?

582
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:11,949
How's this?

583
00:55:12,949 --> 00:55:15,150
Forget about the injustice that's
been afflicting you so long for now.

584
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,090
Do me a justice first.

585
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:19,519
I'm in a really unfair situation
right now.

586
00:55:19,719 --> 00:55:22,059
I couldn't go out with you because
of a trivial misunderstanding.

587
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,960
Isn't the reason why you've been
keeping your mouth shut...

588
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:32,199
because no one listened to you?

589
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:36,469
I can be a good listener.

590
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:46,349
Here we go.

591
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,349
- In 2, 3...
- Oh, my.

592
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:49,719
That looks good.

593
00:55:50,219 --> 00:55:51,820
Small ones go here.

594
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,590
Put that there. Big ones...

595
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,099
(Chromatic Paint)

596
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,829
- It's good.
- Eat up.

597
00:56:04,869 --> 00:56:06,769
- It looks tasty.
- Let's eat.

598
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:10,610
- Look at this.
- It's so tasty.

599
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:13,369
- Where is this from?
- It tastes very good.

600
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:15,940
Boss isn't coming.

601
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:18,150
They must be on a date.

602
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:26,389
Okay.

603
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:27,960
I'll get in.

604
00:56:33,659 --> 00:56:36,300
It didn't seem like
they were more than friends.

605
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,530
You think so?

606
00:56:38,769 --> 00:56:41,800
By the way, why didn't you
come the other day?

607
00:56:41,869 --> 00:56:42,940
Well...

608
00:56:44,139 --> 00:56:47,079
Something happened to my family.
I'm sorry.

609
00:56:47,539 --> 00:56:48,539
It's okay.

610
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:00,460
You're never absent
for a trivial reason.

611
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:02,219
Something happened, right?

612
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:08,429
Well, the thing is...

613
00:57:09,329 --> 00:57:12,369
I didn't enter this company to work
in the first place.

614
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:14,869
Three years ago,

615
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:17,409
my sister died...

616
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:21,010
at Brain.

617
00:57:21,579 --> 00:57:24,550
Was she...

618
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:26,849
the secretary at the penthouse?

619
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:31,690
Rumors said it was Boss's fault.

620
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,360
I wanted to take revenge.

621
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:37,590
Revenge? Really?

622
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:40,159
Oh, my. Let me see.

623
00:57:40,329 --> 00:57:42,329
Right after you joined the company,

624
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:45,429
the article on Boss's power abuse
was published. Oh, my.

625
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:50,340
That's right. I put Boss in trouble.

626
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:52,369
The thing is,

627
00:57:53,469 --> 00:57:55,579
Boss already knew everything.

628
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:59,980
Even knowing everything,
he just let me get back at him.

629
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:06,550
The bigger problem is that...

630
00:58:06,989 --> 00:58:08,059
I think...

631
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:12,329
I...

632
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:15,300
fell in love with Boss.

633
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:18,730
I shouldn't be like this.

634
00:58:19,099 --> 00:58:21,369
In the end, I even came here
to see him.

635
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:25,610
What's worse is that I'm jealous
after seeing him with someone else.

636
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:29,940
What should I do, Yoo Hee?

637
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:36,920
My body is unwell too.

638
00:58:37,019 --> 00:58:39,219
I feel dizzy.

639
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:40,719
And I feel nauseous.

640
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:43,519
I feel like I'm going to die.

641
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:50,599
Yoo Hee!

642
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:52,829
Wait. Yoo Hee.

643
00:58:52,969 --> 00:58:55,599
- Sun Bong, lift it higher.
- All right.

644
00:58:55,639 --> 00:58:58,070
Be careful. We can't afford to
break it.

645
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,840
- Okay.
- It's heavy.

646
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,440
You're here.

647
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,880
- Okay.
- Be careful.

648
00:59:06,949 --> 00:59:08,079
Okay.

649
00:59:09,949 --> 00:59:12,320
- Thank you for the sushi.
- Thank you.

650
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:15,960
Well, I'd like to ask you a favor.

651
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:18,730
It's about how you address me.

652
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:23,800
I'd like you to call me
by my first name.

653
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:28,940
As you already know, my name is...

654
00:59:30,869 --> 00:59:32,139
Hwan Gi.

655
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:36,239
Eun Hwan Gi.

656
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:46,820
What was that?

657
00:59:48,519 --> 00:59:51,030
Does it even make them throw up?

658
00:59:55,530 --> 00:59:56,630
Hwan Gi.

659
00:59:58,599 --> 00:59:59,730
Eun Hwan Gi.

660
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:03,170
Boss.

661
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:07,880
Ro Woon.

662
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:15,780
Something happened. Please help me.

663
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:18,289
- Open the door.
- I'll open the door.

664
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:20,019
What should we do?

665
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:21,690
1, 2, 3.

666
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:23,489
Gyo Ri, hang in there.

667
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:25,730
Oh, my. Be careful.

668
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:30,369
Sun Bong, hang in there.

669
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,000
- I can walk.
- It's okay.

670
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:35,139
- Don't throw up on me.
- Hurry.

671
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:37,409
- I'll just walk.
- No.

672
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,570
Sun Bong.

673
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,150
- What about you?
- I'm okay.

674
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:49,579
Take them to the emergency room
first.

675
01:00:50,019 --> 01:00:51,150
I'll be right back.

676
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,159
Yoo Hee, hang in there.

677
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:57,989
What is this?

678
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:01,199
Drive safe.

679
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:09,739
It's okay now.

680
01:01:10,469 --> 01:01:12,070
Boss, I think I'm going to die.

681
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,239
What should I do?

682
01:01:14,739 --> 01:01:15,980
Hang in there.

683
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,250
We'll arrive at the hospital soon.
Hang in there.

684
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,610
- We're almost there.
- I'm sorry.

685
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:21,849
- I think Sun Bong is dead.
- Sun Bong.

686
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,619
Sun Bong, hang in there.
We're almost there.

687
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:29,360
No. Don't throw up in my car.

688
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:01,920
Oh, my.

689
01:02:02,989 --> 01:02:04,090
No.

690
01:02:13,369 --> 01:02:14,440
Mom.

691
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:17,139
Ji Hye.

692
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,079
I think...

693
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,949
we'll meet soon.

694
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,469
Ro Woon.

695
01:02:55,809 --> 01:02:57,179
This is strange.

696
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:00,280
Why do I see Boss,

697
01:03:00,949 --> 01:03:02,519
not Mom or Ji Hye?

698
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:06,650
This is no time to
think about Boss.

699
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:07,789
Ro Woon!

700
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:29,940
Why does my heart flutter
in this situation?

701
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:05,679
My goodness.

702
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:09,349
I'm sorry.

703
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:11,789
All of you got food poisoning
because of me.

704
01:04:12,489 --> 01:04:15,690
I eat there often. I didn't know
this would happen.

705
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:20,130
The preparation.

706
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:22,530
The event is tomorrow.
We should get it done by tonight.

707
01:04:22,659 --> 01:04:25,070
Hwan Gi is there. Don't worry.

708
01:04:25,099 --> 01:04:27,739
Didn't he have the same sushi?

709
01:04:27,769 --> 01:04:29,000
He did.

710
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:30,639
Then...

711
01:04:31,809 --> 01:04:33,409
Still, don't worry.

712
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,510
I can worry about him.

713
01:04:38,849 --> 01:04:39,909
Sorry?

714
01:04:39,949 --> 01:04:41,519
I like him.

715
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:42,980
You like him too, right?

716
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:48,360
What should we do?

717
01:04:49,159 --> 01:04:50,789
Should we pull each other's hair
out or something?

718
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:52,230
I'm ready.

719
01:04:55,829 --> 01:04:57,400
Please go to Hwan Gi.

720
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:00,269
I think you're the only one...

721
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:01,769
who can set him free.

722
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:03,340
Sorry?

723
01:05:03,670 --> 01:05:05,409
Save him first.

724
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:07,139
We can fight later.

725
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:19,519
(Paint as You Want)

726
01:05:58,329 --> 01:05:59,829
I knew it.

727
01:06:00,130 --> 01:06:01,860
You're working alone
while no one's watching again.

728
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:06,570
Do you feel better now?

729
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:09,139
You were not just watching.

730
01:06:13,539 --> 01:06:15,739
Now that I look back on it,

731
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:19,949
you were protecting me.

732
01:06:30,789 --> 01:06:32,690
You should go to the hospital.

733
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:34,559
It's okay.

734
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:36,800
I'm not as bad as the others.

735
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:43,369
It's late. Go now.

736
01:06:50,809 --> 01:06:52,250
Can't I stay?

737
01:07:05,059 --> 01:07:06,590
I want to stay with you.

738
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:23,880
I don't deserve it yet.

739
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:28,550
I should apologize properly first.

740
01:07:31,789 --> 01:07:33,019
You've been...

741
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:36,360
suffering alone for three years.

742
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,329
How could you be more sorry
than this?

743
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:45,400
How could you apologize
more properly than this?

744
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:48,769
Still...

745
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,010
I don't know what exactly happened.

746
01:07:53,710 --> 01:07:54,780
But...

747
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:58,679
I'm sure there was a reason.

748
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:01,650
I believe that.

749
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:06,050
You don't know what a coward I was.

750
01:08:06,789 --> 01:08:09,019
I don't, but I still trust you.

751
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:15,599
The part of you
I don't know about...

752
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:22,000
must be much nicer
than the part of you I know.

753
01:08:25,069 --> 01:08:27,479
That's how it's always been.

754
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:06,449
I'm right, aren't I?

755
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:14,989
There's probably a lot I don't know
about.

756
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:32,609
You were watching over me
without letting me know.

757
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:36,180
You were protecting me...

758
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:38,979
without even making me realize it.

759
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:48,359
The weight must have been...

760
01:09:49,819 --> 01:09:52,359
so hard on you.

761
01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:56,760
What kind of other things...

762
01:09:57,670 --> 01:10:00,869
are you trying
to be responsible for?

763
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:04,409
I don't care what they are.

764
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:08,010
I'll support you no matter what.

765
01:10:11,579 --> 01:10:13,510
I'll stay by your side.

766
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:14,670
(My Shy Boss)

767
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,069
Is that your first love?

768
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:18,840
Is that why you were trying
to send me home?

769
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:21,510
That's you?
The Christmas Eve three years ago...

770
01:12:21,539 --> 01:12:23,779
Hwan Gi has been
protecting you ever since then.

771
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:24,850
Isn't Hwan Gi so sweet?

772
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,850
He's thoughtful, gentle,
and even handsome.

773
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,279
He's pretty athletic, too.
He doesn't talk much,

774
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:32,550
but I find that sexy.

775
01:12:32,649 --> 01:12:34,359
Can I sleep over for
one more night?

776
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:36,060
I'll have to stay by his side.

777
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,630
- Yi Soo already knows.
- What?

778
01:12:38,659 --> 01:12:39,989
It's been three years already.

779
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:41,760
It's already over.
What's wrong with you?

780
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,159
It's not over yet.

781
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:44,430
You can sit down.

782
01:12:44,529 --> 01:12:46,300
I won't let you sleep, Boss.

783
01:12:46,329 --> 01:12:48,340
I'm going to eat you up.
