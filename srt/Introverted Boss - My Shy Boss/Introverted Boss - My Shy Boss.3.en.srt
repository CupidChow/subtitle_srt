Move!

2
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,659
What did you say?

3
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,630
- Move!
- I can't hear you.

4
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,439
I can't hear you.

5
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,909
I said, move!

6
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,310
I can't hear you.

7
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,370
- Did you order jjajangmyeon?
- Yes.

8
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,849
- It looks so good.
- Here's your jjajangmyeon.

9
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,150
Thank you.

10
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,489
- What's that man doing?
- Why is he exercising here?

11
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,919
Are you repaying me for
helping you on the rooftop?

12
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,060
Are you all right?
You didn't get hurt, did you?

13
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,759
No, I'm totally fine.

14
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:40,199
The courier arrived.

15
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,530
Courier?

16
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:44,699
By the way,
did these get damaged at all?

17
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,139
Ro Woon! Ro Woon.
Did the courier arrive?

18
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,610
Yes, I have them here. Gosh...

19
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,080
Why is this here?

20
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,449
- Be gentle. Treat it like a baby.
- Yes!

21
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,889
Of course. Sure thing.

22
00:03:02,189 --> 00:03:04,090
This is a lot more valuable...

23
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,189
than me.

24
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,229
Let me see. My goodness.

25
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,430
My gosh.

26
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:16,770
This is...

27
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,780
- Hey, run.
- Here they are.

28
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,340
- You need to apologize, too.
- Here.

29
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,979
- I apologize. I'm so sorry.
- We can resume the shoot soon.

30
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,620
- We'll resume the shoot shortly.
- I'm so sorry.

31
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,979
- We apologize.
- I'm sorry.

32
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,479
- Apologize.
- My deepest apologies.

33
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:35,120
I'm really sorry.

(Episode 3:
I'm Not an Easygoing Person)

36
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,949
You said you'll take
responsibility for this.

37
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,689
You better keep your word.

38
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,100
This can be fixed, right?

39
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,939
I should just think of it
as a gift for myself.

(New York Barbershop)

41
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,329
Did you eat?

42
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,529
Yes.

43
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,709
Ji Hye, the house without you...

44
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,379
is silent.

45
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,389
It's like an empty house
no one lives in.

Our revenge...

49
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:12,339
is just beginning.

50
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,790
Did you hear?

51
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,790
The penthouse will be opened.

52
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:27,689
No way. Are you serious?

53
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,360
- Yes. They started renovations.
- Seriously?

54
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,930
- Who told you?
- Ms. Park.

55
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:34,029
What?

56
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,399
Ms. Park?

57
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,560
You're here.

58
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,199
Why did it have to be here?

59
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,480
It's your father's orders.

60
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,339
This space felt overpowering before.

61
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:22,379
No, not here.

62
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,120
Then do you want to share the space
with the staff downstairs?

63
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,689
That's what we should do.
We'll just get you a partition.

64
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:33,290
It'll still be better for you here.

65
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,160
Thanks for being courageous,
Hwan Gi.

66
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:40,629
I thought you would
keep on saying no.

67
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,240
I'll gladly take the heat.

68
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,139
Take the heat? What heat?

69
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,339
This is a new beginning
and a new challenge.

70
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,050
I made sure to pick elites to keep
the number of your teammates low.

71
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,949
I bet no one applied for it.

72
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,620
It's not like that.
The position is too big for them.

73
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,750
Forget it.
I have a few people in mind.

74
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,360
You do?

75
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:06,060
Do you even know our employees?

76
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:07,730
Sorry I'm late.

77
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,930
Her hobby is being late.

78
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,329
- Your bread is here.
- I want bread.

79
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,699
Her specialty is buying bread.

80
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:15,970
I had to take a complaint from
our client since you weren't here.

81
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:20,709
- I love you, Ms. Jung.
- She's the mom of the office.

82
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:23,240
She values people
and relationships over work.

83
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:31,220
Gosh, this report is...

84
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,580
too schematic.

85
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,220
His hobby and talent
are spoiling the mood.

86
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,919
He's always nagging
from a step behind.

87
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,159
That report is too...

88
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,059
- Gosh, you reek of alcohol.
- Gosh.

89
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,360
- You two...
- Please go away.

90
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:47,500
Both had poor performance for three
years, and will likely be let go.

91
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:50,470
If you are going to fire them,
send them to me.

92
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,070
You have no idea.

93
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:53,909
You don't know our employees.

94
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,740
I love you, Ms. Jung.

95
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,809
She's known as "Yoo Hee Call Center"
at the office.

96
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,649
She always treats everyone
with love and care.

97
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:05,250
She knows her colleagues'
love life, married life,

98
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,350
and even family matters.

99
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,690
Right, don't eat this.

100
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:13,220
It's your ex-boyfriend's wedding
this weekend, right?

101
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,360
You're pretty now,
but lose a bit more weight.

102
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,500
Make sure you dress up.

103
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,200
Before she became a mother
and lost her mind,

104
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,769
her project portfolios
looked promising.

105
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,039
Eat this.

106
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,139
Taking a step back...

107
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:32,309
means that he can see something
others cannot.

108
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,840
This report is...

109
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:36,149
too schematic.

110
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:38,250
You all need to study more.

111
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,350
How can you take money
from the company working like that?

112
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,419
You can't nag someone
without being knowledgeable.

113
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,659
When did you figure all that out?

114
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:52,799
There is one more. Kim Gyo Ri.

115
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,629
Kim Gyo Ri? Ms. Kim?

116
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,500
She first applied as an AE.
Do you not remember?

(Kim Gyo Ri)

118
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,580
I'm a quiet person,

119
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:13,850
but I want to show that a quiet
person can PR in a quiet way...

120
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:19,720
through quiet means. I think?

121
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,590
- Are you set on being an AE?
- Pardon?

122
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:30,399
No. I'll do my best
in whatever you assign me.

123
00:10:36,909 --> 00:10:39,440
Wouldn't it be uncomfortable
for both of you?

124
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,149
This is all a show to quiet down
the criticism about abusing power.

125
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,179
It'll be good for our publicity.

126
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,690
If that's what you want, sure.

127
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,860
I have two people picked out,
so that's five in total.

128
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,690
Three is enough for me.

129
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,730
I have authority over HR.

130
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,230
Come on,
I'm letting you have your way.

131
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,470
You get 3, and I get 2.

132
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,769
- Who are they?
- It's a secret for now.

133
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,399
You can look forward to it.

134
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,350
- You.
- Chae Ro Woon.

135
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:19,419
What are you doing here?

136
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,289
I got hired, too.

137
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:23,419
What is this?

138
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,759
I thought Brain was
the best PR agency in Korea.

139
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,159
It must be a lie
since they hired us.

140
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,659
- Wait, wait.
- Hold on.

141
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:36,700
- Hello.
- Hello.

142
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:38,139
- Hello.
- Which floor are you going?

143
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,169
I told you I'm stalking you.

144
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,139
I'm in your department.
I begged for it.

145
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,470
To whom?

146
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:44,809
To my mom.

147
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,379
Call your mom back...

148
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,019
and tell her
to put you somewhere else.

149
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,279
Why?

150
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,970
Why did it have to be us?

151
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,070
It's their way
of indirectly telling us...

152
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,210
to leave the company.

153
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,850
I didn't know
I'd end up working here again.

154
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,820
Aren't you happy that I'm here?

155
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,690
- Stop it.
- I know you are.

156
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,230
What are you doing out here?
Let's go in.

157
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,870
Now, for the last member...

158
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,840
It's someone we need for
Brain's first in-house venture...

159
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,940
and for the PI project of clearing
Eun Hwan Gi's name.

160
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,679
The only person that can make you
run around like a headless chicken.

161
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,779
- She can't be here.
- I should correct myself.

162
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:01,950
Besides your father that is.

163
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,549
No, not her.

164
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:29,080
You're just in time.

165
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:43,190
Hey, everyone is here.

166
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Here. Come on.

167
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,700
Say hello.

168
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:53,940
What? The delivery man?

169
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:55,970
Do you want me to introduce you?

170
00:13:58,139 --> 00:13:59,940
All right, let me introduce him.

171
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:03,279
He's the boss of our newly launched
Silent Monster.

172
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,379
Eun Hwan Gi.

173
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,230
Hello, nice to meet you.

174
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,299
- Hello.
- Hello.

175
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:26,940
It... It can't be.

176
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:30,980
Mr. Kang, you were there that day.
He came by that motorcycle.

177
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,879
Well, I'm not sure.

178
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,250
I've never seen him on a motorcycle.

179
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,379
That's because it's not allowed to
ride a motorcycle in that park.

180
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,289
That's why he had to run there.

181
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,620
So he...

182
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,389
He then...

183
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,129
What are you trying to say?

184
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:50,929
What did he do?

185
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,629
He tried to...

186
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:57,940
What is this?

187
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,700
I need to talk to you.

188
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:07,309
Sorry. Please get to know
each other first.

189
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,350
Is he our boss?

190
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:12,320
Did something happen between him
and you? What about a motorcycle?

191
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:13,480
No.

192
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,649
I'm surprised, too.

193
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:18,289
He looks better than I expected.

194
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,990
He looks like a typical rich kid.

195
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,330
While his employees are
slaving away,

196
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,629
he's been having this palace
all to himself.

197
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,399
How much money would have
gone into all this?

198
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,970
- Send her away.
- Hey.

199
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:36,940
She just entered the company.
It was just a small mistake.

200
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,480
It's a good enough reason
to fire her.

201
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:41,179
Technically, the one to blame is...

202
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:43,750
the clumsy novice courier.

203
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,480
Anyway, she can't stay.
Especially near me.

204
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,549
Why?

205
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,289
If my cover gets blown,

206
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,820
she might get hurt.

207
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,759
Is there something about her
only you know about?

208
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:56,960
She's loud.

209
00:15:57,659 --> 00:15:58,659
I know.

210
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,799
She's the loud type of person
you hate.

211
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:02,970
But...

212
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,669
she's cheerful and energetic
just like I used to be.

213
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,240
I like her.

214
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:09,909
You like her?

215
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,379
- What do you know about her?
- I could see at once...

216
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,610
that she's just like me.

217
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,720
You don't know
what she's hiding inside her.

218
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,889
Have you two already become close?

219
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:31,659
She's so feisty that she might
make you feel uncomfortable,

220
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,960
but it's just that she likes
people so much like a puppy does.

221
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:37,330
People like her rarely
get hurt by others.

222
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:40,200
She's more hurt than anyone else is.

223
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:44,139
That means she's perfect
for a cat like you.

224
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:48,149
You admit that you easily
hurt others, don't you?

225
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,610
- Still...
- If you're still uncomfortable,

226
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,850
trust me. I'll help her out.

227
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,190
Still, I prefer to be alone.

228
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,820
If you still want her to leave,

229
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,960
tell her yourself.

230
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:04,259
I'm getting off.

231
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,730
- Let me come with you.
- Hold on.

232
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:16,670
She's your employee.

233
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:19,109
You're responsible for her.

234
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:33,960
The clumsy courier
turns out to be...

235
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,859
the psychopath, Eun Hwan Gi?

236
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:39,299
I'm sorry.

237
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,630
I'm sorry.

238
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,799
What were those eyes?

239
00:17:56,349 --> 00:17:59,079
If you still want her to leave,
tell her yourself.

240
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,269
Excuse me.

241
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,210
Why don't we wait
until Mr. Eun says something?

242
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:27,480
What is
this uncomfortable atmosphere?

243
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:29,109
Why isn't anyone saying anything?

244
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:30,680
What?

245
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,880
Gosh.

246
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,930
I shouldn't embarrass her
in front of everyone.

247
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,269
Could you...

248
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,839
give us some room?

249
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,299
- What did he say?
- Room?

250
00:18:54,339 --> 00:18:55,670
- What did he say?
- Can you hear him?

251
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,740
No.

252
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,579
We can't hear you.

253
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,349
Could you leave your desks?

254
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:10,650
- Desks?
- Is there something wrong?

255
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:15,160
I'm afraid we need to...

256
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,460
remove a desk.

257
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,960
What about desks?

258
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,430
I think he wants us to
move the desks.

259
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,130
That makes sense.

260
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,470
He's sitting so far away from us.

261
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,000
We can't hear him well.

262
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:30,369
Everyone, stand up.

263
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:33,180
- Let's move.
- Where should we start?

264
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,609
Let's do it.

265
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:35,950
That's not what I meant.

266
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,950
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

267
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,180
- Here we go.
- Let's go.

268
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,650
Please leave them there.
Leave them there.

269
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,250
Leave them there.

270
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:46,619
- Just...
- One, two...

271
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,460
(100-year-old Finnish birch)

272
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:20,259
He wants to be
closer to his employees?

273
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:23,660
He even reached out first.

274
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:28,170
Is he really the psychopath
who wanted no one near his door?

275
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,569
I can never fire her in person.

276
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,009
Right, I should e-mail her.

277
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,150
Dear Ms. Chae Ro Woon...

278
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,349
(Dear Ms. Chae Ro Woon)

279
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,289
Unfortunately...

280
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:54,890
No. Regrettably...

281
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:59,329
I must say... I'm afraid...

282
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:01,259
Sadly...

283
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:04,670
The company and you seem to
have differing...

284
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,579
Dear Ms. Chae Ro Woon...

285
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,660
Mr. Eun.

286
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:36,369
What is it?

287
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:38,569
I'm sorry to interrupt.

288
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,039
We have some coffee for you.

289
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,210
Since you didn't give us
any instructions, we prepared...

290
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:50,380
a small launching ceremony.

291
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:54,180
Could you be with us for a moment?

292
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,490
We'll take this cake.

293
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,630
- Okay.
- We'll have...

294
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,460
three Americanos, two lattes,

295
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,559
and...

296
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:09,430
What should we get for him?

297
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:12,240
I'm not sure.

298
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:13,940
Don't you know
what kind of coffee he drinks?

299
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,569
Mr. Eun never...

300
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,109
asked me for coffee.

301
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,680
Now that I think of it, he was
probably trying to be considerate.

302
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:25,420
When someone asks you for coffee,

303
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:27,380
it can sometimes
make you feel small.

304
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:30,849
He has surprisingly good manners.

305
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,519
Have you made up your mind?

306
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,390
I don't think he'll like
something sweet.

307
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,329
I'd go for...

308
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,569
three espresso shots.

309
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:44,700
That will do.

310
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,940
Mr. Eun.

311
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:52,440
Could you be with us for a moment?

312
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:54,039
Let me...

313
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,349
finish up what I was doing first.

314
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,849
By the way, shouldn't we decide on
how we'll call each other?

315
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,650
I heard, at ventures,

316
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:07,190
you call each other by
the first name.

317
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:08,559
I'm sure it has good intentions,

318
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:11,029
but it's not something
we're used to.

319
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,430
Don't you think so, Yoo Hee?

320
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,660
Well...

321
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,200
It does make me feel young,

322
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:19,299
Sun Bong.

323
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:22,640
That's American style.

324
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:27,109
We shouldn't call Mr. Eun
Mr. Eun, either.

325
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:31,180
Still, we couldn't call him
by his first name.

326
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,380
She's right. He's the head of
Silent Monster.

327
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:38,049
Let's just call him Mr. Eun.

328
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:40,319
I'm up for calling him
by first name.

329
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:41,960
It'll be awkward,

330
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:45,329
but I think it sounds
more respectful for some reason.

331
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:47,000
Gyo Ri, how about you give it a try?

332
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:49,470
Among all of us, you're probably...

333
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:52,640
the one who's been saying
"Mr. Eun" most often.

334
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,940
Me?

335
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,039
Give it a try, Gyo Ri.

336
00:23:56,509 --> 00:23:59,140
- Yes, do it.
- Be confident.

337
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,079
Hwan Gi.

338
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,630
My gosh, I'm so sorry.

339
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:28,940
Oh, no. He must be mad at me.

340
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,539
See? I said I didn't want to do it.

341
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,809
What should I do now?

342
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,210
He has such a foul temper.

343
00:24:57,029 --> 00:25:01,000
I do always wear black, but it does
not mean I like my coffee black.

344
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:06,210
I only drink caramel macchiato,
caffe mocha with whipped cream,

345
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:09,910
or coffee with a ton of sugar and
cream. Should I tell them my taste?

346
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:14,019
No, no. They probably put a lot
of thought and consideration...

347
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:16,950
into figuring out what kind of
coffee I'd like. It'd be too rude.

348
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,220
(Politeness)

349
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,059
Shall I dump this into the sink
when no one is looking?

350
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:23,660
They went all the way there
and got this for me. I shouldn't.

351
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,400
Shall I put some sugar in it?

352
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,900
Even a whole jar of sugar
won't be enough.

353
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:32,240
I might end up with diabetes, then.

354
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:37,809
But drinking this bitter coffee as
it is will damage my stomach lining.

355
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,750
How about I add some water?

356
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:46,950
(Water and coffee)

357
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,150
Yes, that's it.

358
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:53,160
I should pour out a little bit
and add water to dilute it.

359
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:58,130
Mr. Eun.

360
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:07,269
Is that the coffee I got for you...

361
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,640
How can you do this
right in front of her?

362
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:12,940
I get that she called you
by your name, but this is too cruel.

363
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,039
Don't.

364
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,809
I apologize, Mr. Eun.

365
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:20,819
I got carried away and said
your name without even realizing it.

366
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:23,150
I'm sorry for crossing the line.

367
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:32,859
Everyone's waiting for you.
Please come and cut the cake.

368
00:26:36,069 --> 00:26:37,730
Where's the knife?

369
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,539
Oh, that cabinet is...

370
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,650
It's my personal collection.

371
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,150
My personal collection.

372
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,960
May I...

373
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,329
borrow just one knife?

374
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:05,460
I mean, you have so many.

375
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:13,240
That's the sashimi knife
I sharpened this morning!

376
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:19,279
This will be perfect...

377
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,339
- for cutting cake.
- Be careful!

378
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,079
- What's going on?
- What happened?

379
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:36,789
Please do not touch
my personal collection.

380
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:02,450
Let me see. Are you all right?
You didn't get hurt, did you?

381
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:07,190
I knew it. He's showing his true
colors. He's not Silent Monster.

382
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,190
Shouldn't he be called
Psychopath Monster?

383
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,000
Even cars can shout like this.

384
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:53,039
Why am I like this, seriously?

385
00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:00,240
Hey, Ms. Chae. Come on in.

386
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,849
Your office door is always open...

387
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,750
unlike someone else's office.

388
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,789
I don't like feeling boxed in.

389
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:13,160
Well... There's something
I'd like to ask you.

390
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,559
Good.
I have a favor to ask you as well.

391
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,759
Shall we talk on our way?

392
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:26,569
(Flower Boss,
Flower Delivery Service)

393
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:30,210
Is this really the only way?

394
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:05,380
She's cheerful and energetic
just like I used to be.

395
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,009
I like her.

396
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:41,440
(3 years ago)

397
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,559
Hey, sorry. I'm driving.

398
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:33,859
Hey...

399
00:31:39,069 --> 00:31:40,200
Shall we go?

400
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,359
I lost one of my cufflinks.

401
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,000
I can't wear that just on its own.

402
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,700
Can you try to find the same design?

403
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,170
Yes. I'm sorry, Ro Woon.

404
00:32:17,609 --> 00:32:20,210
I don't think I can make it today.

405
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,480
I'm sorry for missing your musical.
Best of luck with it.

406
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:25,450
I don't need flowers.
I want you here.

407
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,630
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

408
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,819
Hello? This is the flower
delivery service, right?

409
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:24,309
So are you asking
what kind of person Hwan Gi is?

410
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:28,009
You said that you're his only
friend and confidant.

411
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,109
Don't believe those scary,
bizarre rumors about him.

412
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:35,079
The courier guy with sad eyes
is closer to who he really is.

413
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,420
Will you believe me if I say that?

414
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,690
How can I say bad things about him
as his only friend and confidant?

415
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,759
No matter how hard
a friend of his tries...

416
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:48,700
to say that he's a nice man,
no one would believe it.

417
00:33:49,869 --> 00:33:53,970
That's why everyone was reluctant
to join Silent Monster under him.

418
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,869
Since you volunteered to join,

419
00:33:56,309 --> 00:33:58,009
we have high expectations of you.

420
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,480
Gosh, I don't know anything.

421
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,410
Just think of it lightly.

422
00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:07,720
People are what our company
is trying to sell.

423
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:11,190
Do you mean just sugarcoat it?

424
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,489
The cover of a book
isn't everything.

425
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,900
However, if you want to solve
a problem fast,

426
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:20,360
sugarcoating is necessary.

427
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:24,000
Right now we have to package
Hwan Gi...

428
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,070
as an understanding
and easygoing person.

429
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:28,739
I'm not sure if the product
will listen to us.

430
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:30,409
Just trust me and follow along.

431
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,280
We're going on a field trip.

432
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:33,780
Hang on tight.

433
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:47,159
(Actor Hwang Caught Committing
Adultery with a Young Woman)

434
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,030
(Was His Good Public Image an Act?)

435
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:55,630
(Actor Hwang Faces Penalty
for Breach of Contract)

436
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,170
Anyway,

437
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,900
it wasn't adultery.

438
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,710
Then who is this girl?

439
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:05,440
What is your relationship to her?

440
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:12,420
Please, just tell us the truth.

441
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:14,449
You already signed
for a new drama series.

442
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:16,389
What are you thinking?

443
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,559
The broadcasting company
and the producers are making a fuss.

444
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,360
The cancelation penalty sums up to
two million dollars.

445
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:26,599
We can only help
after confirming the truth.

446
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,030
It would be a mess
whether I deny it or admit it.

447
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,440
If I say one word,

448
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,840
they would take it...

449
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:40,980
and gossip with made up stories.

450
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,610
Not taking action is one option.

451
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,119
If we don't do anything,
then we would be admitting it.

452
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,289
They are not in a relationship.

453
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:51,519
Are you sure?

454
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,219
I know him well.

455
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,760
He doesn't like young women.

456
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,869
(Dang Yoo Hee)

457
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,739
I'm sorry...

458
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:12,980
Where are you, Ro Woon?
Hurry back right now.

459
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:15,010
What is it? Did something happen?

460
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,050
He...

461
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:18,510
It's about you-know-who.

462
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,179
Who?

463
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,789
The one we can't call by name.

464
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,989
Tell them you'll call later
since we're in a meeting.

465
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:30,190
I'm with Mr. Kang right now.
Please let him know.

466
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:31,730
Mr. Kang?

467
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:37,269
She's with Mr. Kang right now.

468
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:40,699
- So?
- Pardon?

469
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:42,469
Where is she associated with?

470
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:46,440
Silent Monster, Sir.

471
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:53,349
- What is it this time?
- Things are really bad over here.

472
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:54,880
I'm so sorry.

473
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,650
Ro Woon, we're in trouble.
He's about to explode.

474
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:59,719
How can you leave me here alone?

475
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,789
Hurry back.
Do you want all of us to die?

476
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:05,429
- My goodness, that's my phone.
- Hello? Where are you?

477
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,079
What do you need to tell me?

478
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:23,849
Am I supposed to stand here all day?

479
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:27,619
Where did you go off to
during office hours?

480
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:30,449
I was working.
I had a meeting with a client.

481
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:32,250
Is that true?

482
00:37:32,289 --> 00:37:34,719
Ask Mr. Kang
if you don't believe me.

483
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:36,230
I met Actor Hwang.

484
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:39,000
You know, the one that's
involved in a scandal?

485
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:41,599
He was hiding at a hotel
from the press.

486
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,869
All right, get back to work.

487
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:44,730
Pardon?

488
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,170
That's it?

489
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,840
I ran all the way here
because you said it was urgent.

490
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:55,579
Clean that up.

491
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:01,679
The cake?

492
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:05,349
Did you call me and make a fuss...

493
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,389
because of that?

494
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:08,989
You're dismissed.

495
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:17,199
Does he not have hands and feet?

496
00:38:17,699 --> 00:38:19,639
He could have done it himself.

497
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:22,809
Why did he rush me to clean up
leftover cake?

498
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,639
Gosh. You jerk.

499
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,440
You'll pay for this!

500
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,619
I'm so mad.

(New York Barbershop)

502
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,559
- Did you eat?
- Yes.

503
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:41,760
Hey.

504
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:44,190
I said I ate.

505
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,539
Mr. Smith?

(New York Barbershop)

(I'll wait for your return
to the stage.)

508
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,090
I'll wait for your return
to the stage.

509
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,559
What should I do, Mr. Smith?

510
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,800
I...

511
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:04,309
still have something I must do.

512
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:21,789
Boss.

513
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:25,659
You're not here, right?

514
00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:48,050
What are you doing?

515
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,130
I...

516
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:08,699
I have a meeting with a client.

517
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:10,909
At this hour?

518
00:41:11,409 --> 00:41:12,539
It was someone...

519
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,739
It's someone that can't be seen
by the public.

520
00:41:40,469 --> 00:41:44,469
Mr. Kang told me I should
start working on the PI Project.

521
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,940
In order to PR something,

522
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:50,550
one must know really well
about the product they promote,

523
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:52,380
but I keep on getting confused.

524
00:41:53,019 --> 00:41:57,190
Is this sweaty delivery man
with packages the real you?

525
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:01,619
Or is it the silver spoon
that threw money on the streets?

526
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:06,860
I thought you protected me
from getting hit by a motorcycle,

527
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,630
but on second thought,

528
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:13,039
I think you pushed me
to make me go away.

529
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,039
Understanding,

530
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:21,780
easygoing leader
is the project's keywords.

531
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:26,280
Let's try and understand each other,
okay?

532
00:42:29,289 --> 00:42:31,320
- Find a new keyword.
- Pardon?

533
00:42:31,489 --> 00:42:33,260
I'm not good at communicating.

534
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,989
I'm also far from being easygoing.

535
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:37,630
- Come on, Boss.
- Also, it makes me uncomfortable...

536
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,760
when you call me that.

537
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:45,300
You don't want us to call you "Sir".

538
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:49,239
And you almost cut our throats
for calling you by name.

539
00:42:50,409 --> 00:42:52,440
You have a lot of time before
work starts tomorrow. Go home.

540
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:55,280
Don't make up lies
about meeting clients.

541
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:57,179
What's taking them so long?

542
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,630
Welcome, Mr. Hwang.

543
00:43:19,269 --> 00:43:20,269
Please take care of him well.

544
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:23,340
He's the first official client
of Silent Monster.

545
00:43:33,019 --> 00:43:34,179
Here.

546
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:36,289
Your legs must be tired.

547
00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:38,150
This will help you
recover from fatigue.

548
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,590
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

549
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:46,400
- You're so muscly.
- You look much better in person.

550
00:43:46,429 --> 00:43:48,630
- Your skin is glowing.
- I know, right?

551
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:49,929
Can I have your autograph?

552
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:51,900
I want to be an actor, too.

553
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:55,769
- Is this time for an autograph?
- No, it isn't.

554
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,670
- It isn't.
- Why did you ask him that?

555
00:43:58,809 --> 00:44:01,309
He's still a great actor.

556
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:06,119
- Hello.
- Over here.

557
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,820
Hello, I'm your fan.

558
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,389
- Is it you, Mr. Hwang?
- It's him.

559
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,519
Their food is great.

560
00:44:16,789 --> 00:44:17,860
Have some pickled radish.

561
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,329
Does it taste okay?

562
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:23,130
- Gosh.
- Get him some napkins.

563
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,630
(Genuine Italian sheepskin)

564
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:27,000
It's okay. We can wipe it off.

565
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,840
Get him some napkins.

566
00:44:30,139 --> 00:44:31,739
Why does he have to be here?

567
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:35,010
There are reporters at the hotel.

568
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:37,079
Ms. Chae brought him here
using that as an excuse.

569
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:41,280
She's trying to make him talk.

570
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:42,719
It's okay.

571
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:47,360
Well, would you like
some alcohol, too?

572
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,159
Are you trying to get me drunk...

573
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,130
so that I spill the beans?

574
00:44:53,659 --> 00:44:56,570
No. I just wanted to
offer you a drink.

575
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:59,030
This is strong.

576
00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:02,969
- One more?
- Put that down.

577
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:05,210
- Don't be like that.
- I don't think that will work.

578
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:08,110
"It wasn't adultery."

579
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:11,480
That's all he can say.
He definitely had an affair.

580
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:17,050
He's going to the US tonight.
Please keep him until then.

581
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:19,119
You're so muscly.

582
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,320
You look much better in person.

583
00:45:22,659 --> 00:45:25,889
Enjoy the food and
make yourself at home.

584
00:45:29,929 --> 00:45:31,869
You have a great Chinese restaurant
around here.

585
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,469
- It tastes good, right?
- They're good.

586
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:36,139
It tastes good.

587
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:38,010
- Please take those things off.
- Sorry?

588
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:43,679
Hey.

589
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,920
These are articles about Mr. Hwang.

590
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,590
We might find some clues here.

591
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:53,820
Please go through them.

592
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,389
Pass them around.

593
00:45:57,159 --> 00:45:59,559
Sun Bong. Sun Bong.

594
00:46:10,909 --> 00:46:12,880
Are we going to
waste our time like this?

595
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:17,079
When he doesn't open his mouth,
what can we do?

596
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:20,849
He can't say anything
because he had an affair.

597
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,320
He's not like that.

598
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:24,949
Look at this.

599
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:28,719
He's family-oriented
and he loves his son.

600
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,230
Not everything you see
on reality shows is true.

601
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,659
That's true.

602
00:46:38,469 --> 00:46:39,670
That can't be right.

603
00:46:39,699 --> 00:46:41,440
When you're guilty about something,

604
00:46:41,699 --> 00:46:44,440
it's best to remain silent.

605
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,210
When the one
we can't call by name...

606
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:49,809
was criticized for
abusing his power,

607
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,079
he hid himself behind Mr. Kang, too.

608
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:57,590
By the way, the one we can't
call by name...

609
00:46:58,289 --> 00:46:59,920
didn't even attend the meeting.

610
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:03,559
- Gosh.
- What? What is it?

611
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:06,030
How long have you been
standing there?

612
00:47:07,059 --> 00:47:08,860
- My heart...
- Please take a seat.

613
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,139
Tell us if you have instructions.

614
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:23,409
There must be a reason
why he can't...

615
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:27,150
say anything.

616
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:28,480
I see.

617
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:34,119
That's obvious.
Doesn't he know that?

618
00:47:35,789 --> 00:47:37,860
That's exactly my point.

619
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:40,599
We must find out that reason.

620
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,199
What happened? Where is he?

621
00:47:43,929 --> 00:47:45,130
Is he a ghost?

622
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:49,739
Pick me, pick me, pick me up

623
00:47:49,969 --> 00:47:52,840
I want you to pick me up

624
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,380
I'm sorry to bother you.

625
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:57,679
It's okay.

626
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:59,920
Have you become close
with your employees?

627
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:02,849
How's Mother?

628
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,289
She pretends to be sick
all the time.

629
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:05,920
Don't worry.

630
00:48:06,389 --> 00:48:07,619
I'm so bored.

631
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,929
It'd be nice if you could stop by.

632
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,500
Hey! What are you doing?

633
00:48:16,429 --> 00:48:18,400
I have to go. Bye.

634
00:48:20,739 --> 00:48:22,800
Hey, give that back to me.

635
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,409
What's going on?

636
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,139
How dare you take my phone?

637
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,440
- Why...
- You must have her number.

638
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:30,980
- Why are you giving it to me?
- Don't touch my phone.

639
00:48:33,849 --> 00:48:36,119
You sly brat.

640
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:37,250
Hey!

641
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:41,659
Run, Boss.

642
00:48:41,989 --> 00:48:43,889
What's this? Let go of me! Let go.

643
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,659
- Hey, give me my phone.
- Boss!

644
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,659
- Run.
- Me?

645
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,670
Are you going out?

646
00:48:55,139 --> 00:48:57,909
There will be employees everywhere.

647
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:00,739
As we're a PR agency,
there are many reporters as well.

648
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:02,880
Are you sure you want to
go out there?

649
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,550
Are you okay?

650
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,519
My goodness. He blacked out.

651
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:18,789
Hey. Hey.

652
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:24,699
Amazing.
That's a real actor's voice.

653
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,699
Mister... I mean, Mr. Hwang.

654
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,539
I respect you.

655
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:30,909
You scared me.

656
00:49:46,989 --> 00:49:48,820
(My daughter)

657
00:49:52,929 --> 00:49:55,260
Hwan Gi, what are you
doing out here?

658
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:58,030
Are you here
because it's too crowded in there?

659
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:05,710
Go out and bring my phone back.

660
00:50:05,739 --> 00:50:08,980
Your family members' numbers are
saved on that phone, too, right?

661
00:50:10,449 --> 00:50:13,750
I'm not sure
why you're keeping your mouth shut,

662
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,179
but is it more important
than your family?

663
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,159
Your family must be waiting for you.

664
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,730
Clear up any misunderstandings.

665
00:50:25,059 --> 00:50:27,130
Before your family gets more hurt,

666
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,599
go back to your family.

667
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:30,900
What do you know?

668
00:50:31,099 --> 00:50:33,400
How dare you talk about my family?

669
00:50:33,869 --> 00:50:36,969
You were on a reality show
with your son.

670
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,710
I still remember that.

671
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:41,480
You told your son that
you should always be honest...

672
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:44,449
and you'd forgive him
as long as he's honest.

673
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,219
I don't want to hear any more.
Bring my phone back.

674
00:50:49,019 --> 00:50:52,349
Here. I brought it.

675
00:50:52,989 --> 00:50:55,659
Why are you back here?

676
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:58,929
A family member called.

677
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:02,630
He should answer. It's his daughter.

678
00:51:06,769 --> 00:51:07,940
His daughter?

679
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,510
He doesn't have a daughter.

680
00:51:13,909 --> 00:51:18,280
- It said "My daughter".
- Give it to me.

681
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:22,880
That can't be. He has only a son.

682
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:32,429
Why is she going through all this?

683
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:35,059
You stinking leech.

684
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,769
I told you to leave me alone.

685
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,469
Why do you keep bothering me?

686
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,269
Why?

687
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,369
Why are you trying so hard
to open my mouth?

688
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:48,010
I wonder that, too.

689
00:51:48,579 --> 00:51:51,210
Why is she working so hard?

690
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:56,920
Actually,

691
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:00,460
I feel better now.

692
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:04,659
This is why I like you.

693
00:52:05,659 --> 00:52:09,659
You're always straightforward.

694
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:14,139
You clearly said
you didn't have an affair.

695
00:52:14,869 --> 00:52:16,340
I trust you.

696
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:20,610
That's why I'm clinging to you.

697
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:23,880
I'm sure there's something
more to it.

698
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:27,550
Was she not trying to take me down?

699
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:29,989
Tell me the truth.

700
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:32,920
Please.

701
00:52:33,989 --> 00:52:35,289
The truth?

702
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:40,500
(My daughter)

703
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:47,570
Shall I give you
my honest opinion...

704
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:50,340
as part of my fan service to you?

705
00:52:50,909 --> 00:52:52,440
You said you're
an aspiring actress, right?

706
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:56,440
There's a ton of girls
who are as pretty and young as you.

707
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:59,110
Wake up from your hollow dream.
Just save your monthly salary...

708
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:02,679
and get married as soon as you can.

709
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:06,349
With your mediocre looks,
the best you can do...

710
00:53:06,389 --> 00:53:10,760
is to get married when you're still
young and sellable!

711
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,659
And you know what? Day by day,

712
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,360
your price is dropping.
You better hurry up!

713
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:26,739
Why is everyone so tense?

714
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:29,010
I was just being honest.

715
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:32,250
Isn't this what you guys wanted?
You like honesty.

716
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,250
Everyone, leave.

717
00:53:39,019 --> 00:53:40,090
Leave.

718
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,690
All of you.

719
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:48,429
What are you thinking?

720
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:52,030
We just got him to talk.
Why do you...

721
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:53,099
Leave.

722
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:58,239
Ro Woon, step out for a minute.
I'll sort it out here.

723
00:53:58,340 --> 00:53:59,469
I want you to leave, too.

724
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:02,579
Get out.

725
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:06,679
All right.

726
00:54:07,349 --> 00:54:08,349
Let's go.

727
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:16,989
So you're the abusive boss.

728
00:54:17,329 --> 00:54:18,590
I'm impressed.

729
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:22,760
You sure are very charismatic.

730
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:28,139
That one word you uttered
made everyone crawl in fear.

731
00:54:45,489 --> 00:54:48,219
Are you outright disrespecting me
or what?

732
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,599
Weren't you hoping
for some quiet time?

733
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:00,599
I gave you what you wanted.

734
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:31,530
You must be deliberately
trying to smother me.

735
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,369
Do you think this will make me talk?

736
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,699
Just make yourself at home.

737
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:37,639
I don't want to hear
anything from you.

738
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,679
Hey. Yes.

739
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,250
Oh, the reporters?

740
00:55:50,789 --> 00:55:53,119
They're probably swarming
over the hotel by now.

741
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:54,760
Yes, that's right.

742
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,289
I intentionally directed
their attention there.

743
00:55:57,429 --> 00:56:00,099
I sent you a car.
Don't be scared and just come here.

744
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:05,369
What do you mean? We'll spend time
together, but we have to lay low.

745
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,000
Yes, exactly. I'm fine.

746
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:10,210
Don't worry about me.
All right. See you soon.

747
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:20,119
Don't you want to know
what that phone call was about?

748
00:56:38,969 --> 00:56:42,469
My gosh, your office pantry
looks so fancy.

749
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:50,750
Gosh, why are there so many knives?

750
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:57,150
You're so cheap.

751
00:57:03,159 --> 00:57:04,360
Goodness.

752
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:12,369
Give me some food if you have any.

753
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,269
Try to be a little more
easygoing, will you?

754
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:18,170
I'm...

755
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:21,139
not an easygoing person.

756
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,650
I always make sure to protect
things that are dear to me.

757
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:31,920
You should also protect
what is dear to you.

758
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,159
I won't get in the way.

759
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:38,059
Did you figure it out?

760
00:57:41,059 --> 00:57:44,469
I can see that you're
a very discreet person.

761
00:57:44,769 --> 00:57:47,639
How about you tell me whether
I'm protecting it properly?

762
00:57:51,309 --> 00:57:53,210
Would you like to hear
what I have to say?

763
00:58:21,099 --> 00:58:22,170
What did he tell you?

764
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,409
I...

765
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:31,050
No.

766
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:33,849
I mean, we...

767
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,849
are not...

768
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:42,820
going to say anything.

769
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:43,929
Sorry?

770
00:58:44,389 --> 00:58:46,190
What are you talking about?

771
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:49,159
- We waited this long for that?
- You won't say anything?

772
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:52,070
Are we supposed to wait
until it gets forgotten?

773
00:58:52,099 --> 00:58:53,570
Do you think that's the solution?

774
00:58:54,469 --> 00:58:56,699
Hey, Hwan Gi. Hwan Gi.

775
00:58:59,139 --> 00:59:01,440
Gosh, what is he thinking?

776
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:03,179
- Why...
- He probably bribed him.

777
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,480
Sorry, but can you massage me?
My shoulders are cramping.

778
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,690
- He won't share it with us.
- I know.

779
00:59:12,789 --> 00:59:14,460
There's no need to be anxious.

780
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:17,730
It's not like I came here
because I needed a job.

781
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:20,929
I'm here to destroy Silent Monster.

782
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:24,300
There you are.

783
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:27,099
Mr. Kang.

784
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,340
I'm not sure why you chose
to give up your dream,

785
00:59:31,369 --> 00:59:32,409
but I'm grateful.

786
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:34,809
For what?

787
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:39,909
Thanks to that decision, I got an
employee with a bright future ahead.

788
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:44,820
You trust anyone who has eyes
that look trustworthy to you.

789
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:47,989
When everyone else was saying
that he's a thief,

790
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:49,989
you kept trusting him.

791
00:59:50,829 --> 00:59:53,630
That courier guy didn't turn out
to be whom you thought he was,

792
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,130
but you turned around
only to trust someone else again.

793
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:58,900
When everyone else was
saying it's adultery,

794
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:00,699
you trusted his claim...

795
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:04,510
and ended up getting slapped
in the face.

796
01:00:06,909 --> 01:00:10,880
I know that you'll become the best
PR specialist of Korea.

797
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,309
I believe in you.

798
01:00:16,519 --> 01:00:20,250
You shouldn't trust people
that easily.

799
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,090
You could be backstabbed, slapped,

800
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:25,860
or get punched right in the eye.

801
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:27,860
Let's go to the gathering.

802
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:31,829
You really shouldn't.

803
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:36,570
I'm here for revenge.
You shouldn't trust me like this.

804
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:01,059
Please...

805
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,170
join us for the gathering.

806
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:05,300
Gathering?

807
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:07,440
Mr. Kang is taking us out
for barbecue.

808
01:01:07,469 --> 01:01:09,269
We didn't throw a proper
launching ceremony today.

809
01:01:10,469 --> 01:01:13,170
I... I need some time.

810
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:15,110
Are you busy with something?

811
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:30,590
By any chance,

812
01:01:31,329 --> 01:01:34,230
is there a problem
with our kimchi refrigerator?

813
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:45,840
Goodness.

814
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:49,940
Could you...

815
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:52,409
give me a minute?

816
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:01,260
Let's just go.

817
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:03,360
He asked us to wait for him.

818
01:02:03,389 --> 01:02:05,130
It's our team dinner, you know.

819
01:02:05,159 --> 01:02:07,960
He won't come. I mean, he doesn't
even attend our meetings.

820
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,039
Let's go.

821
01:02:19,139 --> 01:02:20,309
But I must say,

822
01:02:20,679 --> 01:02:24,150
I'm so happy that we have such
a caring boss like you, Mr. Kang.

823
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,880
Did you stop me from opening it
to age the fish properly?

824
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:01,019
To keep the temperature perfect?

825
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:06,449
Would you like
to have some of this with me?

826
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,059
I can't finish it all by myself.

827
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:36,349
Let's go eat barbecue.
I'm so excited.

828
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:37,650
I need to eat to refuel myself.

829
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:38,989
- Will you be all right?
- I'm fine.

830
01:03:39,019 --> 01:03:41,989
You need to exercise.
Start working out, will you?

831
01:03:42,019 --> 01:03:44,059
- Why are you hitting me?
- You embarrass me.

832
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:46,489
- Where are you taking us?
- Eat something nourishing today.

833
01:03:51,469 --> 01:03:53,329
Dad, I'm here.

834
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,699
It's almost time for the flight.

835
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:00,980
Okay.

836
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:03,079
I'm hungry. Hurry up.

(Actor Hwang Faces Penalty
for Breach of Contract)

838
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:08,119
That woman...

839
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:12,289
"Dad"?

840
01:04:19,389 --> 01:04:23,730
- It said "My daughter".
- That can't be.

841
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:25,900
He only has a son.

842
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:30,139
Ro Woon, what are you doing?

843
01:04:31,340 --> 01:04:33,139
Ro Woon, come on.

844
01:04:34,179 --> 01:04:37,010
I'll meet you guys there.
I left something at the office.

845
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:39,610
We'll go ahead and order barbecue.

846
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:41,719
Hey, come with us.

847
01:04:44,849 --> 01:04:46,190
Let's just go.

848
01:04:47,659 --> 01:04:49,989
I wish she could come with us.

849
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:20,789
I don't care
about what people think,

850
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:23,960
but the problem is her.

851
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:27,829
She doesn't want it.

852
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:30,929
It is a very private matter,
you know.

853
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:34,900
She doesn't understand why
other people need to know about it.

854
01:05:36,269 --> 01:05:38,539
She says that she doesn't need
people's approval.

855
01:05:40,679 --> 01:05:43,440
Not everyone wants
to come out of the closet...

856
01:05:43,809 --> 01:05:45,980
just because he or she has chosen
to live outside the norm.

857
01:05:47,619 --> 01:05:49,119
Come out of the closet?

858
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:52,690
Does that mean he has been
keeping silent...

859
01:05:53,889 --> 01:05:55,989
in order to protect his family?

860
01:06:01,159 --> 01:06:04,699
All right.
These are articles about Mr. Hwang.

861
01:06:04,929 --> 01:06:07,300
We might find some clues here.

862
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:08,570
Please go through them.

863
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:10,340

868
01:06:36,429 --> 01:06:40,300
Dad, I'm scared of people.

869
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,239
I think everyone hates me.

870

I'm going to keep you safe,
so don't worry about anything.

871
01:06:57,949 --> 01:06:59,920
- All right?
- The woman in the photo...

872
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:02,019
was his son.

873
01:07:02,789 --> 01:07:05,289
- Don't worry, okay?
- He has chosen to live...

874
01:07:05,329 --> 01:07:07,559
a new life as a woman.

875
01:07:09,099 --> 01:07:12,869
He was in so many reality shows
and TV commercials because of me.

876
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:17,269
He has been in the public eye
since he was very young.

877
01:07:19,139 --> 01:07:21,039
Even a veteran actor like me...

878
01:07:21,409 --> 01:07:24,409
is still not used to public exposure
to this date.

879
01:07:39,329 --> 01:07:40,860
I like that reaction.

880
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:45,400
It's devoid of useless
consolation, pity, or curiosity.

881
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:47,699
You're so nonchalant about it.

01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:57,510
Thanks.

883
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,280
All right, then.

884
01:08:07,219 --> 01:08:09,489
I should go meet my son... No.

885
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:12,889
I mean my daughter.

886
01:08:30,109 --> 01:08:32,350

887
01:08:33,149 --> 01:08:34,949
Who is he, seriously?

888
01:09:31,539 --> 01:09:33,369
Can I ask you something?

889
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:38,880
On the rooftop,

890
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:43,050
you kept apologizing over and over.

891
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:46,819
Whom was the apology for?

892
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:56,229
If there's something
you'd like to say to me...

Her.

01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:00,699
For whom?

895
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,000
What are you so sorry for?

896
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:06,539
I wanted to keep her safe...

897
01:10:07,609 --> 01:10:09,609
so that she doesn't get hurt.

898
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:13,449
Tell me. Please?

899
01:10:14,779 --> 01:10:16,319
I'm sorry.

900
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:21,189
There's someone else...

901
01:10:22,359 --> 01:10:24,119

905

You're getting on my nerves.

I'm the one in charge
of Silent Monster.

907
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:05,489
- I'll take care of my staff.
- How are you going to do that?

908
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:07,560
Are you two arguing right now?

909
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:09,500
Do you actually want to
protect your staff?

910
01:12:09,699 --> 01:12:10,960
Ro Woon.

911
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,729
Or are you just trying
to protect your pride?

912
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:16,100
I'm sorry. I'm heading out
to grab a drink with my staff.

913
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:17,810
Which ones?

914
01:12:18,109 --> 01:12:20,310
- Good work, everyone.
- See you tomorrow.

915
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:24,310
What does he do alone here
after all of us leave?

916
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,850
He only wears black, too.
He's like a cockroach.

917
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,649
When everyone is asleep
and he's alone,

918
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:30,850
he dances.

919
01:12:32,789 --> 01:12:34,119
He dances?
