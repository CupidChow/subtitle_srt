1
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:45,520
There is a way out for us.

2
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,619
We can say...

3
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,619
that Woo Il did it out of
excessive loyalty.

4
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:56,329
- Father.
- He's already gone.

5
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,030
We can say that we found out
and fired him in advance.

6
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,600
Please stop it!

7
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,840
Did you just yell at me?

8
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,670
Do you hear me now?

9
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:10,640
You probably still don't hear me.

10
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:11,909
What?

11
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,109
Why do you want
only your voice heard?

12
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,450
You silence...

13
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,120
other people's voices or moans.
All you care about is...

14
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,489
if your voice is heard.

15
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,590
Do you think I do that
for my own sake?

16
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,560
It's all for your sake.

17
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,500
The world is full of noise.
Being so quiet,

18
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,159
you can never survive.

19
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,170
I know that.

20
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,040
I know that too.

21
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,939
I've wondered what's wrong with me.

22
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:48,209
I've always blamed myself.

23
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:51,819
I've lived in shame.

24
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,549
What about you?

25
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,590
How can you be so shameless?

26
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:29,949
Hwan Gi.

27
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,620
I talked to the press
on my way here.

28
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,060
I asked them to wait until
we announce our official position.

29
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:39,000
Let's stop covering things up
or avoiding problems.

30
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,669
I'll take responsibility
and step down.

31
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,069
What?

32
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,909
To protect the company,
that's the best solution.

33
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:48,610
Let me take responsibility.

34
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,710
I'm the one who's dealt with
all the shady things for Father.

35
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,840
He's my father.

36
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:54,509
Hwan Gi.

37
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,979
I asked you to come...

38
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,449
to hand over the company to you.

39
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:02,650
Who am I to take over the company?

40
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,020
With what right?

41
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,569
I trust you.

42
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,210
You're the only one
who can save the company.

43
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,479
You fool.

44
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:43,920
Go.

45
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:48,230
Where would I go?

46
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,259
I put away the pictures
of your mom and sister...

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,529
because I wanted you to forget about
everything and go your own way.

48
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,399
How would I forget about everything?

49
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,139
Ji Hye and Ro Woon.

50
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:03,310
Even our names are inseparable.

51
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,740
Is that what you've been thinking?

52
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:09,680
I named you Ro Woon...

53
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:13,050
hoping you'd live
an interesting life.

54
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,189
It's not meant to be
put together with "Ji Hye"...

55
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,220
and mean "wise".

56
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,660
Don't get stuck like I did.

57
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,100
Go out to the wide world.

58
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:28,230
Live with people who recognize
your worth.

59
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,199
Dad.

60
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,569
Leave with a smile, not tears.

61
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,209
You look ugly when you cry.

62
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,110
You might be sent back.

63
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,769
Silent Monster...

64
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,370
- Look to the front.
- Right.

65
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,209
- Here we go.
- Be careful.

66
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,279
- A little more.
- Lift it.

67
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,910
Hang in there.

68
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:57,480
Boss must be angry.

69
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,350
Are you okay?

70
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,620
Boss, did you collapse?

71
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:09,259
You're up.

72
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,500
We've decided on what to call you.

73
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:12,529
Sorry?

74
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,600
We're all going to call you Boss.

75
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:49,669
Why do you have to resign?

76
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,940
Leaving doesn't mean
you're taking responsibility.

77
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,309
I'm sorry I couldn't
stay with you...

78
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,980
until the end.

79
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:03,049
Thanks to you all,

80
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:05,480
I could change.

81
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,450
We're the ones who have changed.

82
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,620
You helped us all grow.

83
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,659
After you leave us,

84
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:17,230
who will trust us like you did?

85
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,929
Please don't go.

86
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:23,299
Why would you make
a woman cry?

87
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,740
Please don't do this.

88
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,309
I don't want to become sentimental.

89
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,639
Even Sun Bong is crying.

90
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:32,909
I've been trying so hard not to.

91
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,480
It's the red light.

92
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,450
Don't say anything.

93
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:45,919
The red light is on. All right?

94
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:47,629
Here.

95
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,100
Please don't go.

96
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,269
Please don't leave.

97
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:13,019
Not because you're Eun Yi Soo.

98
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,519
Because it's you.

99
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:01,529
Excuse me. Please get off.

100
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,539
You better not run away
again this time.

101
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:17,980
Are you not going to get off?

102
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:41,970
It looks like it's 100 percent
your fault once again.

103
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,139
How can you drive without even
glancing at what's behind you?

104
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:51,019
No matter how hard I try
to keep a safe distance from you...

105
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,620
I just...

106
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,159
can't keep myself away from you.

107
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,000
He became alone again.

108
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:10,649
Why are you out here alone again?

109
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,590
The red light?

110
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:17,659
The green light.

111
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,429
Then why didn't you wake me up?

112
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,070
Let me tag along, will you?

113
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,970
Don't kick me
when I'm trying to wake you up.

114
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,470
Did I do that?

115
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,090
He was alone
even when we were together.

116
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:49,259
(Episode 16: It's Okay to Be Shy)

117
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:51,860
Boss! Boss, Boss!

118
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,769
Boss! Boss!

119
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:57,399
Boss, Boss, Boss.

120
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,940
Boss, we have a big problem.
Come out.

121
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:03,570
Boss, hurry up. Hurry.

122
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:04,940
We have a huge problem.

123
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:07,240
What's wrong? What happened?

124
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,379
- I'm bored.
- What?

125
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,519
You got me worried. Goodness.

126
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:17,860
To me, it's a really big problem.

127
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:20,419
I might actually die of boredom.

128
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:23,460
You've been stuck in this room.
Do you know how many days it's been?

129
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,629
I came here to be bored.

130
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:28,929
Right, but until when
are you going to keep this up?

131
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,179
Okay, fine.

132
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,710
I'll be bored out of my mind.

133
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,870
How can she eat chips in bed?

134
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,500
From sweet and salty
to spicy flavors,

135
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:08,870
she even got all sorts of flavors
that compliment each other.

136
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:11,279
She hasn't even showered yet.

137
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:14,450
Plus, how can she be rolling in bed
in her outside clothes?

138
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,350
Shall I tell her?

139
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:21,490
No, I can't let such trivial matters
ruin our happy moments.

140
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,720
But I have to sleep
in that bed tonight.

141
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:27,690
The dust from outside, chip crumbs,

142
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,360
and dust mites will be having
a party on that very bed.

143
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:31,799
What should I do?

144
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:35,299
The second I tell her to go wash up,
she'll probably...

145
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:38,399
Should I take a shower? Then...

146
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,039
From head to toe?

147
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,279
(Decollete)

148
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,649
Yes, she's certainly capable
of doing it.

149
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,779
She'll assume
I'm having dirty thoughts.

150
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:58,019
What's up? Is there something
you want to tell me?

151
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,860
Yes, I should lure her elsewhere.

152
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,099
While she's doing something else,

153
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,230
I'll shake off the blanket.

154
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:10,970
You should step out.

155
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,039
It's gotten a lot warmer.

156
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,109
Really?

157
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:20,640
I don't want to. I want to stay
in bed for a bit more.

158
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:24,309
You said you're bored.

159
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,420
You told me to stay bored.

160
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,549
I'm so bored now. It's perfect.

161
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:33,990
That failed.

162
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:44,230
Do you want to play this with me?

163
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,440
The loser will grant the winner's
wish. What do you say?

164
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,460
Yes. Your turn.

165
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,559
Goodness.

166
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,660
Gosh, seriously.

167
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:16,329
Goodness.

168
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,740
That's foul play.

169
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:25,039
Hurry up. We don't have time.

170
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:40,960
Yes.

171
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:44,130
Why are you getting so competitive?

172
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,730
Hurry up. Come on!

173
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,059
Don't!

174
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,400
It'll fall. It's falling.

175
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,539
Yes, yes! Yes!

176
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,880
Are you that happy you won?

177
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:04,309
Yes, I'm happy. I'm thrilled.

178
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,579
All right. What's your wish?

179
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,230
Stay still.

180
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:26,569
There. It's done.

181
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:28,009
Just a second.

182
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,869
Hang on. 1, 2.

183
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:36,779
Let's see.

184
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,519
Okay.

185
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:44,289
You better not post it anywhere.

186
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:47,420
No way. I got my wish.

187
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:50,390
You can wash up now.

188
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,759
My eyes are... Look at my lips.

189
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:56,500
Good. That was natural.

190
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,539
Go wash up.

191
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:03,009
I kind of like it now.

192
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,279
You're good at doing makeup.

193
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,950
I'll just sleep like this today.

194
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,579
- Just like that?
- Yes.

195
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,549
You can't. It'll ruin your skin.

196
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,220
Go wash up. You'll ruin your skin.

197
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,220
It's okay to skip a night. Anyway,

198
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,390
we have to go for another round.
I'll pay you back.

199
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,529
Go.

200
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:57,059
My wish is...

201
00:20:57,829 --> 00:21:00,460
for us to just sleep as we are now.

202
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:05,099
Then tomorrow, we have to go out
as soon as we wake up.

203
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:20,650
Someplace where you can hear
the echo

204
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,119
Let's look for the fall
in the valley

205
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,660
Let us go on a trip

206
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:32,500
This is so much fun.

207
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:39,269
Am I too excited? I'm so hungry.

208
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,809
I better have some snack.

209
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:43,910
Again?

210
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,740
Should I have some chips?

211
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,180
My goodness.

212
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:53,349
Gosh.

213
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,829
What a waste.

214
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,069
What a waste.

215
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,369
I dropped all of them.

216
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:17,210
This is too much.

217
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,609
It's not her bed to sleep alone.

218
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,480
She made our bed a club
for ticks and dust.

219
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,319
And now, my car too?

220
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,190
Does she not know
what cars mean to men?

221
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:31,660
Should I tell her
she can't eat in here?

222
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,359
I'd look too narrow-minded.

223
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:37,289
Also, she's so excited today.

224
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,529
Do you want one?

225
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:40,859
I'm okay.

226
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,539
Is this a red light?

227
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,140
No.

228
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,480
Come on. Just tell me.

229
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:54,079
You have to tell me for me to know.

230
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,650
This won't do.

231
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,420
A chip will help. Here.

232
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:05,859
Open up.

233
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,289
No. I'm driving.

234
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:10,630
This is dangerous.

235
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,130
Eating home food all the
time is boring.

236
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,900
You need to eat snacks
once in a while.

237
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,630
See?

238
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:22,210
When you eat chips,
it gets rid of your stress.

239
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:23,940
Here.

240
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,779
I'll pick you a chip
that looks delicious. Here.

241
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,650
- No.
- Come on.

242
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:34,250
Here, open up. Good. Chew.

243
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,289
- I'm driving, be careful.
- Last one.

244
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:40,289
- It's okay, I don't want it.
- Last one.

245
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,660
Isn't it good? Do you want another?

246
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,759
No, I don't want it. Stop.

247
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:49,130
- A big one?
- I don't want it.

248
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,900
Last one.

249
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:54,140
Wait. Hold on.

250
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:17,430
Boss,
are you going to talk it out now?

251
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,359
Good thinking.

252
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:27,400
- Can I really be honest?
- Of course. Go ahead.

253
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,269
Don't distract me when I'm driving.

254
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,839
I can't focus.

255
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,640
It's dangerous
even for good drivers.

256
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,849
- Safety comes first on the road.
- Okay.

257
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:40,750
I was distracting, right?

258
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:41,849
Also...

259
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:46,089
I don't like it
when people eat in my car.

260
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,390
You wouldn't go in bed
with those greasy hands, would you?

261
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:53,099
Please wash up before bed.

262
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:56,299
If you don't ever shower,
you'll get sick.

263
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,930
It's disgusting.

264
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,140
What? Is there more?

265
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:06,140
Television. Yes.
When we're watching television,

266
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,740
please focus.

267
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,880
Why do you keep asking me
after not paying attention?

268
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,750
Don't watch it, or don't ask me.

269
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,420
At the least, don't be curious.

270
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,490
That feels good. Are there more?

271
00:25:18,589 --> 00:25:21,730
Did you keep all that inside
this whole time?

272
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:24,460
Yes. I held it in
and I'm finally telling you.

273
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:27,859
Do you think I like everything
about you too?

274
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,430
I just didn't say it out loud.

275
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:32,539
What? Tell me.
What's bothering you?

276
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,170
There are lots of things.
Boss, you're always...

277
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,670
- What, what?
- You're always...

278
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:39,680
- What?
- This is annoying.

279
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,609
There's no way you would have
kept something inside.

280
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,619
You talk before you think.

281
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:51,349
Are you saying I just yap
without thinking?

282
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,920
No, no. That came out wrong.

283
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:55,930
That's not what I meant. But...

284
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,160
You can go alone.
I'm not taking your car.

285
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,900
Go by yourself.

286
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,670
I don't know anymore.

287
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,539
Hurry up and stop me.

288
00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:16,710
Stop me. Stop me.

289
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,119
Why isn't he stopping me?

290
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,019
Boss. I...

291
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,029
Hey!

292
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:39,970
You're leaving?

293
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:43,670
What is this?

294
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,299
Did you think I really left?

295
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,400
You did leave.

296
00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:18,440
I couldn't leave
the car parked there.

297
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:21,109
It would bother others. That's why.

298
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,250
You have a lot to worry about.
Lucky you.

299
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,819
Even still,

300
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:32,089
how could you just leave me there?

301
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,630
I only told you because you asked.

302
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,769
Don't get so upset.

303
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,500
Don't cry.

304
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,140
Well, I...

305
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:59,220
I didn't know you were
keeping it all inside.

306
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:01,890
I like everything about you.

307
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:05,490
Even if you ask me, I can't
think of anything I don't like.

308
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,789
I'm the only one smiling.

309
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:11,430
You're not having fun at all.

310
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,369
You were keeping it in
all this time.

311
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,130
I didn't mean it like that.

312
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,670
I'm happy too.

313
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:22,470
I'm so happy that I feel guilty.

314
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:27,680
It's just that
we're different kinds of people.

315
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,079
We can start
to adjust to each other.

316
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:36,650
Still, how could you
leave me behind like that?

317
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,960
I'm sorry.

318
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:44,059
I couldn't leave my car
on the road like that. As I said,

319
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,099
my car is...

320
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,970
This is the first time
we've ever argued...

321
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,869
over something trivial
just like other couples do.

322
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,539
You turn me into...

323
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,680
an ordinary person.

324
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,609
I do?

325
00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:09,049
You look into me
and try to bring the real me out.

326
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:15,559
If I just put up with everything,

327
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:20,829
at least my petty side
wouldn't be shown.

328
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,430
Now you've seen it all.

329
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:28,400
You still don't say what you
really want to and have to say.

330
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:32,210
What else do you want to hear?

331
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,480
Things that you're
really concerned about.

332
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:41,079
People you left behind, maybe?

333
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,490
How long are you going to be alone?

334
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,390
How am I alone? You're with me.

335
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,559
Boss.

336
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,799
I had been alone until I met you.

337
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,069
I always stayed at the same place...

338
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,369
hesitating. But you made me run.

339
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:04,240
I'm here!

340
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,539
You ran towards me
without hesitation.

341
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:11,079
You opened my heart
that had been shut...

342
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,480
and took me out.

343
00:30:16,819 --> 00:30:19,920
It's because you heard me knock.

344
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,730
No, I wasn't knocking.

345
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:29,869
I kicked on the door and shook it
violently and rudely.

346
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,369
I'm sorry.

347
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,640
I'm sorry.

348
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:37,740
I brought you down
in the name of revenge.

349
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:43,609
Even knowing everything,
you let me do all that.

350
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:49,549
Now you finally...

351
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,220
stepped out the door.

352
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,329
So think about just us.

353
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:00,230
Until now,

354
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,099
we've always put others
before ourselves.

355
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,900
Although we've always been alone,

356
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:13,109
we've never been truly on our own.

357
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:19,180
And you're isolating yourself again
because of me.

358
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:22,920
There's only one person
I want to be with.

359
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,559
You just left me alone
on the street...

360
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,660
not to cause other people trouble.

361
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,930
You're that kind of person.

362
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:40,440
You take care of people around you.

363
00:31:42,339 --> 00:31:45,480
Like you said,
I'm different from you.

364
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:49,680
I have to make sure
all the doors are wide open.

365
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:56,650
I'm already putting you in trouble.

366
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:04,660
Over there.

367
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:18,440
Well, I was bored.
I wanted to play with more people.

368
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,210
Hwan Gi, the food tastes amazing.

369
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:54,740
Right, Ro Woon?

370
00:32:58,279 --> 00:32:59,380
Oh, my.

371
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,819
I must have startled you.

372
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,890
I'm sorry. Drink some water.

373
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:17,500
Try some of this. It tastes great.

374
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:22,670
It's okay. I can reach it.

375
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,880
Do you want some more soup?

376
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,009
I'll get you some more.

377
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:45,259
Now I see...

378
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:48,130
your sister is just like you.

379
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:53,640
The only difference is that
Yi Soo managed to change.

380
00:33:55,069 --> 00:33:56,170
Am I wrong?

381
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,719
To be honest, I was very nervous
on my way here.

382
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,090
I didn't know how to face you.

383
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,559
To be honest,

384
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,869
it wasn't easy for me either.

385
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:28,539
I asked you to come for Boss.

386
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,340
I'm sorry.

387
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:36,210
I know there's no point in
saying this now.

388
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:41,320
You're wrong.

389
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:47,219
That's what I've wanted to hear...

390
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:51,159
for the past three years.

391
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:01,900
We won't be able to
become close, right?

392
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:06,579
It'll take some time,

393
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:09,079
naturally.

394
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:12,449
Will you stay with Hwan Gi?

395
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,489
If you feel uncomfortable around me,

396
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:18,920
I'll stay as far away as I can.

397
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,670
I've been sitting here for too long.
My dead skin is coming off.

398
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,769
Yi Soo, can you scrub my back?

399
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:37,869
Sorry?

400
00:35:38,539 --> 00:35:41,940
Was it too sudden?

401
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:45,250
Kind of.

402
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,449
I haven't scrubbed my body
in a while.

403
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:51,550
How...

404
00:35:52,989 --> 00:35:54,320
I mean it.

405
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,590
I've never done this before.

406
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,900
Scrub harder.

407
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:03,199
Is this okay?

408
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,199
How's it going?
Is there a lot that comes off?

409
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:22,949
Yi Soo and I are starting over.

410
00:36:24,889 --> 00:36:25,989
You are?

411
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:30,230
What's with you?
I thought you'd be glad.

412
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,530
You don't have time to be dating.

413
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,460
What about the company?

414
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:38,500
We've lost most of our clients.
We don't have much to do.

415
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:39,900
- What?
- Are you worried?

416
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,409
Then come back.

417
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:50,179
Are you aware that your father
withdrew his candidacy?

418
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:15,300
You can't fall asleep?

419
00:37:16,769 --> 00:37:17,869
I'm sorry.

420
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:19,980
Did I wake you up?

421
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:22,550
No. I've been awake.

422
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,079
Go to sleep.

423
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:31,150
As we can't seem to fall asleep,

424
00:37:32,389 --> 00:37:33,760
should we watch porn?

425
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,960
Sorry?

426
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,630
Porn?

427
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:43,400
Well...

428
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:45,900
What are you...

429
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,840
- You watch that kind of stuff?
- You don't have to watch it.

430
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:56,610
Just so you know, it's a killer.

431
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,190
You're so dirty.

432
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:10,230
What is it that you're...

433
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:12,130
going to watch?

434
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:26,039
This is...

435
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,309
Right?

436
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,380
He's so hot, isn't he?

437
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:33,679
(Eun Hwan Gi's veil is lifted.)

438
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,800
- Do I look good?
- Yes. It's perfect right now.

439
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,340
- Here?
- Move a little to the right.

440
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,070
Okay, good. Hang on a second.

441
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:59,380
1, 2, 3.

442
00:39:02,409 --> 00:39:06,619
The first thing that comes to my
mind when I think about him is...

443
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,719
The chilling first impression?

444
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,650
I have an announcement to make.

445
00:39:13,159 --> 00:39:15,219
Please start preparing
for the presentation.

446
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:18,090
Whom would you like
to be in charge of it?

447
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:22,730
Me?

448
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:28,300
He exudes this kind of aura
that makes him hard to approach.

449
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,840
Whatever.

450
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,940
In short, he's unlikeable.

451
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,679
But he's good-looking. That I admit.

452
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,150
He's seriously so handsome.

453
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:40,050
Gosh, watch your language.
We'll need to edit out your part.

454
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,219
But once you get to know him
a little bit,

455
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,559
you'll be able to tell that he's
a very warm-hearted person.

456
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,460
How about a horror movie theater?

457
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,130
"Visit the worst movie theater..."

458
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:56,500
"for an unforgettable night of
horror that gives you the chills."

459
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,969
- I like that idea.
- There's this one too.

460
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,300
Didn't I do such a good job?

461
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:06,739
He listens to you even when you're
talking about unimportant things.

462
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:08,780
That's how he is.

463
00:40:09,579 --> 00:40:11,780
In our company, we don't use
designated titles.

464
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:14,420
I'm a driver at the moment.

465
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:19,190
He volunteers to be a driver
for his employees.

466
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:27,659
He's a man who knows
how to sincerely...

467
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,929
care about someone.

468
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:41,739
When we're in trouble,
he shows up out of nowhere.

469
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:44,150
Just like a ghost.

470
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:48,219
I keep turning around to look back
even to this day.

471
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:52,150
We feel as though you'd always be
watching over us from somewhere.

472
00:40:52,389 --> 00:40:55,289
Well, everything is going well
even without you.

473
00:40:55,389 --> 00:40:57,889
All of us are working hard
in our positions.

474
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:00,900
Things ended up panning out
exactly the way you wanted.

475
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,769
The company
that doesn't need a boss.

476
00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:05,469
Gosh, stop it.
He'll get the wrong idea.

477
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,869
We're not saying we don't
want you to come back.

478
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:10,440
We just don't want you
to worry too much.

479
00:41:10,539 --> 00:41:14,039
Hurry up and come back before
we forget all about you.

480
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:17,050
- Please come back soon.
- We miss you, Hwan Gi.

481
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,650
- Well...
- Gosh, Sun Bong.

482
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,650
- Please come back!
- We're waiting for you!

483
00:41:22,889 --> 00:41:24,650
- Come back soon!
- Get yourself back here!

484
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,969
We were making promotional
materials for Silent Monster...

485
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,840
and thought we should include
a short introduction about you.

486
00:41:44,139 --> 00:41:46,280
I edited the video.

487
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,650
Everyone
is waiting for you to come back.

488
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,750
This boredom...

489
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:01,159
should end tonight.

490
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:15,670
No, I take that back.

491
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:20,210
Being bored even on the very
last night would be too pathetic.

492
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:22,179
I...

493
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:26,849
I took a shower today.

494
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,599
Yi Soo scrubbed my back for me too.

495
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,260
It's so soft now.

496
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:43,570
Yi Soo?

497
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,599
- Really?
- Yes.

498
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,039
Let me see.

499
00:42:51,309 --> 00:42:54,179
- You're tickling me.
- Come on. Show me.

500
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:55,840
It tickles.

501
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,980
Show me.
Let me see how soft your back is.

502
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,150
Stop tickling me.

503
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:10,059
- Stop it.
- Why?

504
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,670
- Hello.
- Hello.

505
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:28,179
Please come in.

506
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,380
Goodness.

507
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:38,889
I'm Eun Bok Dong.

508
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:43,630
Right, I'm aware.

509
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,960
Father.

510
00:43:45,929 --> 00:43:47,760
- You should step out.
- Sorry?

511
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,030
I said, step out.

512
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,260
I asked him to step out
because I'm too embarrassed.

513
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:20,400
I should've raised
my children better.

514
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,300
I'm...

515
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,099
embarrassed of myself.

516
00:44:28,739 --> 00:44:30,239
I apologize.

517
00:44:31,409 --> 00:44:32,409
Gosh.

518
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,679
Every parent knows
what that feels like.

519
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:41,579
It can feel absolutely mortifying.

520
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:48,019
But from what I've seen, you
should be very proud of your son.

521
00:44:59,469 --> 00:45:01,000
Gosh, that feels nice.

522
00:45:18,489 --> 00:45:20,260
- There.
- Firecrackers.

523
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,519
Oh, right.

524
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:27,000
Guys, he's here!

525
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,500
- Come on.
- Be careful.

526
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:32,230
Hurry up! We have to hide!

527
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,110
We're back.

528
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,380
It feels weird.

529
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:49,380
By the way, it doesn't look
like anyone is here now.

530
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:54,219
Why? Were you expecting to see
firecrackers going off...

531
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,489
and everyone lined up
to welcome you?

532
00:45:56,829 --> 00:45:59,659
Well, that's not really
what I meant.

533
00:46:03,429 --> 00:46:04,929
He's here. He's here.

534
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:09,539
I guess I can no longer have you
all to myself.

535
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:12,139
You were thoroughly mine.

536
00:46:13,579 --> 00:46:14,639
Are you sad?

537
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,550
What if I am?

538
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:20,380
Then will I get a kiss?

539
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:23,719
Kiss... Again?

540
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:27,989
Come on, before everyone comes back.

541
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:32,230
Hang on. Let's do it over there.

542
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,099
Shall we do it now?

543
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,670
- Shall we?
- Now?

544
00:46:36,769 --> 00:46:39,300
- 1, 2, 3.
- Let's go.

545
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:57,719
Go back.

546
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:02,389
Get back here. Sit down.

547
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:06,400
Since when were they that close?

548
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:07,829
They owe it all to me.

549
00:47:07,929 --> 00:47:10,130
That's not true. I was their Cupid.

550
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:13,039
I think we've missed our timing.

551
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:14,139
It'll probably go on for a while.

552
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:16,269
For now,
let's wait a little bit.

553
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,780
No, don't. That's disgusting.

554
00:47:22,179 --> 00:47:23,380
Shall we check?

555
00:47:23,849 --> 00:47:24,909
Let's see.

556
00:47:30,619 --> 00:47:31,820
I'm jealous.

557
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:34,420
I miss my husband.

558
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,800
My legs are asleep,
but this is entertaining.

559
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:45,269
Hang in there.

560
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:47,869
We shouldn't interrupt.

561
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:51,769
They won't go any further, right?

562
00:47:51,809 --> 00:47:53,840
If we're going to watch,
can we watch comfortably?

563
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,840
It's perfect right now. Be quiet.

564
00:47:56,409 --> 00:47:58,050
I think they're going to go far.

565
00:47:58,309 --> 00:47:59,409
Let's stop watching.

566
00:48:07,019 --> 00:48:08,260
(Sorry, it's the red light.)

567
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,789
Another Christmas has passed.

568
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,630
However, not much has changed.

569
00:48:21,769 --> 00:48:25,409
There are still a lot of things
on his mind.

570
00:48:37,489 --> 00:48:38,750
This is...

571
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:43,929
What is he worried about this time?

572
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:47,659
He's writing a letter.

573
00:48:47,829 --> 00:48:51,429
Pardon? The one he started writing
last Christmas?

574
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,539
He's still working on it?

575
00:48:55,869 --> 00:48:58,440
He's writing to clients, press,
and even staff.

576
00:48:58,469 --> 00:49:01,039
That's over 400 letters.

577
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:03,909
The Christmas cards became
a New Year's card.

578
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:06,650
At this rate, it'll be spring.

579
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:10,519
He wants to finish them all today
no matter what.

580
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:16,019
Also, he still continues...

581
00:49:16,059 --> 00:49:18,559
to keep his slow pace.

582
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:27,039
You're getting quite big now.

583
00:49:28,539 --> 00:49:29,570
Yes.

584
00:49:30,739 --> 00:49:32,239
I'm scared.

585
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:36,550
My husband had a vasectomy and
I still got pregnant.

586
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:39,210
Can you even imagine how strong
the baby will be?

587
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,420
Touch it.

588
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:49,219
- Can you feel it?
- There is a new member...

589
00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:50,760
at Silent Monster now.

590
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,530
While one member left.

591
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,440
Let's start our meeting.

592
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:04,840
(Fresh goods are baked daily.)

593
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:05,869
(The aroma will fill the store.)

594
00:50:07,809 --> 00:50:09,010
That's it.

595
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:15,219
Yoo Hee, you have a point card
for this franchise bakery, right?

596
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,920
Of course. I'm a regular.

597
00:50:18,789 --> 00:50:20,489
What do you think about writing...

598
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:23,090
your membership number
at the end of this proposal?

599
00:50:23,429 --> 00:50:25,889
We can show that we ate
their bread more than anyone.

600
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:27,800
I'm sure a lot of companies
will hand in proposals...

601
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:29,559
when they haven't tried their bread.

602
00:50:30,099 --> 00:50:32,329
Sun Bong, how did you think of that?

603
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:37,570
Why don't I ever get ideas like you?

604
00:50:37,739 --> 00:50:40,239
Then I would be able to enjoy work.

605
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,480
Everything I try to do, it's hard.

606
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:46,550
It's supposed to be hard.
You're doing a good job.

607
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:50,019
- Pardon?
- If you think of something easily,

608
00:50:50,949 --> 00:50:53,360
then anyone else
can come up with it too.

609
00:50:53,389 --> 00:50:54,590
Something common.

610
00:50:54,789 --> 00:50:57,159
- Even still...
- Intuition doesn't just come.

611
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:00,429
You need to think and worry
in order to build your intuition.

612
00:51:03,929 --> 00:51:07,599
Sun Bong, I didn't know
that you think a lot.

613
00:51:15,579 --> 00:51:16,710
I have to use the men's room.

614
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,980
I was so charismatic.

615
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:28,820
I hope I didn't bore them.

616
00:51:32,059 --> 00:51:33,500
(Piano Concert, "Memory")

617
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,199
I hesitated for a year.

618
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,199
I'll ask her today.

619
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:39,769
Hurry up, everyone! Se Jong is on.

620
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:41,199
Se Jong?

621
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:45,010
We're with an actor from an
action noir film, "My Shy Brother".

622
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:48,079
It's scene stealer, Jang Se Jong.
Hello.

623
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,309
Hello. I'm actor Jang Se Jong.

624
00:51:50,949 --> 00:51:54,019
Can you explain to us
your role in this film?

625
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:57,619
Sure. In this film...

626
00:51:59,289 --> 00:52:01,420
I didn't know I'd see Se Jong
on television.

627
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:05,460
Me neither. He auditioned for
over 100 times. He finally made it.

628
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:07,829
In this film,
I play a character that's...

629
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,869
We promoted that film.

630
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,130
We basically brought that failure
of a movie back to life.

631
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,670
I heard that you and the actress
look really good together.

632
00:52:17,869 --> 00:52:20,639
A lot of people wonder
if you two are actually dating.

633
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,010
Not at all.

634
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:27,679
Actually, there is someone I like.

635
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,579
Is she your girlfriend?

636
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:31,690
I wish she was,

637
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:34,119
but it's just a crush.

638
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:35,889
What's wrong with him?

639
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:38,360
Is he still out of his mind?

640
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,030
What kind of woman is she?

641
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:46,900
She's someone that helped me...

642
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,739
chase my dreams.

643
00:52:49,699 --> 00:52:52,309
We were on different paths,

644
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:54,380
so we just cheered each other on.

645
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:59,110
If it's not too much trouble,
can I send her a message here?

646
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:00,849
Yes,
do it while looking at the camera.

647
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,619
No, don't! What is he doing?

648
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:06,659
He just started to get popular.
Why is he doing this?

649
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,099
It took me a year...

650
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,800
for me to say this.

651
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:23,269
I like you,

652
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:25,309
Kim Gyo Ri.

653
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:29,480
Se Jong is so cool.

654
00:53:30,409 --> 00:53:33,010
When did you two become like that?

655
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:36,480
No, I didn't know about this at all.

656
00:53:50,929 --> 00:53:52,329
I'm so embarrassed.

657
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,039
Se Jong.

658
00:54:00,409 --> 00:54:01,679
It took me too long, didn't it?

659
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:06,480
Thank you, Se Jong.
It took a long time.

660
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:09,349
Gyo Ri, I like you.

661
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,050
- Pardon?
- What?

662
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:13,989
I'm confessing to her.
What are you doing?

663
00:54:14,019 --> 00:54:16,090
What do you mean?
I was about to confess too.

664
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:17,230
I waited for a year.

665
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:19,489
I'm the one who was grinding teeth
for this day.

666
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,400
I was waiting to show up
after succeeding to surprise her.

667
00:54:23,429 --> 00:54:25,369
Gyo Ri, go to a show with me!

668
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:28,699
No shows! Date me!

669
00:54:28,739 --> 00:54:30,909
- Stop it.
- Go away.

670
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,039
Hold on.

671
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:36,579
Thank you both for liking me.

672
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:38,909
This is all of a sudden.

673
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,849
I'd like to focus on work for now.

674
00:54:42,619 --> 00:54:44,050
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

675
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:49,559
Like Sun Bong said, I should
focus my time on thinking.

676
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:56,800
Goodness. It's the most common way
to decline someone.

677
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,429
She doesn't like either of you.

678
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,239
It's because Sun Bong interrupted.

679
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:05,239
- Dramas ruined you.
- It's your fault.

680
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:08,139
- Why did you do that?
- You're out.

681
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:12,349
- Hey.
- Hwan Gi.

682
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:15,320
I missed you.

683
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:17,250
- Sure.
- Can I call you Hwan Gi?

684
00:55:17,289 --> 00:55:19,550
Yes. Congratulations on your debut.

685
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:23,929
- Let's watch the show together.
- Okay.

686
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:27,630
You should finish up your work
so that we can leave.

687
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:29,559
Right. You're right.

688
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:33,869
You all know what today is,
don't you?

689
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,500
Silent Monster's pride
depends on it.

690
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:40,840
(Sports Day)

691
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:45,480
Se Jong!

692
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:57,889
Come here, the ball is over there.

693
00:55:59,659 --> 00:56:00,760
Hey.

694
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,500
- What do I do? What do I do?
- Pass it that way.

695
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:34,400
Goal!

696
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:45,070
If I wasn't pregnant,
I'd be flying on the field.

697
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,570
Why am I the only one playing?

698
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,849
Boss, what are you doing?
Get your head in the game.

699
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:53,380
- You need to do better.
- Let's go.

700
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:54,550
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

701
00:56:54,579 --> 00:56:56,050
- Total soccer.
- Move away, everyone.

702
00:56:56,519 --> 00:56:59,019
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Go!

703
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:01,559
- Let's go. Let's go.
- You can do it.

704
00:57:01,659 --> 00:57:03,889
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Let's go. Let's go.

705
00:57:03,989 --> 00:57:06,260
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Let's go. Let's go.

706
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,429
Pass it.

707
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,400
What do I do? What do I do?

708
00:57:12,699 --> 00:57:15,139
What do I do?
What do I do?

709
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:16,670
Should I head it?

710
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:19,670
Would the chest be safer?

711
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:25,909
Or more fancily...

712
00:57:30,619 --> 00:57:32,619
If I fail, they'll be disappointed.

713
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:35,619
Wait, what if I succeed?

714
00:57:53,739 --> 00:57:55,980
They'll all look at me.

715
00:58:18,869 --> 00:58:20,000
What is that?

716
00:58:25,909 --> 00:58:27,940
Why? Why?

717
00:58:28,039 --> 00:58:31,050
Why did you do that?

718
00:58:31,179 --> 00:58:34,280
He's cute. He's so cute.

719
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:40,090
It's perfect weather for dying.

720
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,059
It's perfect weather for
scattering ashes.

721
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:52,199
Bring it on.

722
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:53,300
Here we go.

723
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:58,769
Go, Sun Bong!

724
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:06,710
Go, Ro Woon!

725
00:59:06,809 --> 00:59:08,550
- Go, Ro Woon!
- Ready and go.

726
00:59:08,619 --> 00:59:10,789
- Hang in there!
- You can do this!

727
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:11,949
Hang in there.

728
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:13,989
Focus.

729
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:19,389
- Start.
- Go, Gyo Ri!

730
00:59:19,429 --> 00:59:21,230
You're doing great.

731
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,869
- You're almost there.
- Hang in there.

732
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,429
Hang in there!

733
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,670
You can do this!

734
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:34,739
Give up!

735
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:36,539
Give up now!

736
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:40,880
No!

737
00:59:58,070 --> 00:59:59,199
(Second prize)

738
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:03,940
Let me announce the MVP.

739
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:09,809
- Who is it?
- Mr. Kang Woo Il!

740
01:00:10,809 --> 01:00:12,010
(First prize)

741
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:20,789
This event was planned for you.

742
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:25,090
I'm embarrassed I had too much fun.

743
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,199
Still, I appreciate the prize.

744
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:30,630
I'll treat you to dinner in return.

745
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:36,170
(First prize)

746
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:38,409
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

747
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:46,079
- Kiss her!
- Kiss her!

748
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,389
- Kiss her!
- Kiss her!

749
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:51,489
I'm jealous.

750
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:55,860
Go back to your place now.

751
01:00:56,789 --> 01:00:59,059
Before we wrap up,

752
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,730
let's hear from Mr. Eun.

753
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:15,010
It feels weird
to see my sister kiss a guy.

754
01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:21,480
As you all know,

755
01:01:22,949 --> 01:01:24,550
I'm not used to...

756
01:01:26,289 --> 01:01:28,420
speaking in front of many people.

757
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:33,730
Also, I want to say
different things to each of you.

758
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:35,829
That's why I...

759
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:46,139
These are...

760
01:01:46,769 --> 01:01:49,980
Christmas cards I wrote last year.

761
01:01:50,309 --> 01:01:53,010
I'm sorry I'm giving you these
too late.

762
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,019
I'll call your names one by one.

763
01:02:01,019 --> 01:02:02,190
Ms. Park Bo Gyung.

764
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:06,590
- Thank you always.
- Thank you.

765
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:09,030
Thank you for your hard work.

766
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,130
Ms. Dang Yoo Hee.

767
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:15,840
- Thank you.
- Mr. Woo Hae Yong.

768
01:02:16,139 --> 01:02:17,639
Mr. Um Sun Bong.

769
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:26,349
Ms. Jung Yi Yun.

770
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:28,019
Mr. Jo Sung Yong.

771
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:31,719
Mr. Jang Se Jong, Mr. Baek Jun.

772
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:34,389
Ms. Yoo Hyun Joo, Ms. Kim Gyo Ri.

773
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:41,360
Lastly...

774
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:44,269
Ms. Lee So Hee.

775
01:02:46,369 --> 01:02:47,599
That's all.

776
01:02:49,239 --> 01:02:50,840
I didn't get one.

777
01:02:52,539 --> 01:02:54,639
- You didn't get any?
- No.

778
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:58,710
Why didn't I get any? Boss.

779
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:02,320
Boss.

780
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:03,989
Boss.

781
01:03:05,289 --> 01:03:06,690
- Boss.
- It's raining.

782
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,070
Boss.

783
01:03:22,539 --> 01:03:23,599
Boss.

784
01:03:24,409 --> 01:03:26,340
Does my card look different
from the others?

785
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:28,409
Did you want to give it to me
secretly?

786
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:31,280
That's not it.

787
01:03:34,219 --> 01:03:35,349
I didn't write any to you.

788
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,349
You're lying.

789
01:03:38,619 --> 01:03:39,949
You're pulling my leg, right?

790
01:03:40,289 --> 01:03:42,219
I'm not going to be fooled.
Give it to me.

791
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:44,530
Where is it?

792
01:03:57,869 --> 01:03:59,840
You really don't have it?

793
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:07,920
I know you put your employees
before me.

794
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:12,519
You've been focusing on work
for the past year.

795
01:04:12,789 --> 01:04:15,059
You haven't been spending
much time with me.

796
01:04:15,659 --> 01:04:17,159
I've put up with all that.

797
01:04:18,159 --> 01:04:20,489
I know you've been understanding.

798
01:04:21,429 --> 01:04:22,429
I appreciate it.

799
01:04:23,429 --> 01:04:25,929
The company is back on track now.

800
01:04:28,039 --> 01:04:29,340
Am I still...

801
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:31,840
your second priority?

802
01:04:32,769 --> 01:04:34,840
- It's not like that.
- It is.

803
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:39,309
Didn't you see me
get hit by the ball earlier?

804
01:04:39,349 --> 01:04:43,420
Did you expect me to
run to you and comfort you...

805
01:04:43,989 --> 01:04:45,820
in front of all the employees?

806
01:04:45,849 --> 01:04:50,119
What about Mr. Kang?
He even kissed Yi Soo.

807
01:04:50,659 --> 01:04:51,730
That's...

808
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:56,000
Treat me at least fairly.
I'm one of your employees.

809
01:04:56,099 --> 01:04:58,329
How could you not
write to me?

810
01:05:01,539 --> 01:05:02,570
The thing is...

811
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:07,309
I did write one to you.

812
01:05:08,809 --> 01:05:12,179
I put more effort into yours
than any others'.

813
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:17,019
I rewrote it countless times.

814
01:05:19,019 --> 01:05:22,420
I wanted to convey my feelings...

815
01:05:22,989 --> 01:05:26,159
just the way they are.

816
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:30,429
That's just an excuse.

817
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:32,099
Forget it.

818
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:35,900
You just don't love me.

819
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:38,840
- Why do you say that?
- To me, love is not...

820
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:41,480
hesitating or thinking what to do.

821
01:05:41,579 --> 01:05:43,579
It's not something you do
with your head.

822
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:45,849
You have to dive into it
like a crazy person.

823
01:05:46,179 --> 01:05:48,320
I'm not that kind of person.

824
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:52,420
Of course not.

825
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:56,389
You'll get wet.

826
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,059
I'm this kind of person.

827
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:19,309
- Oh, my. Ro Woon, you're soaked.
- Ro Woon.

828
01:06:19,349 --> 01:06:21,119
You'll catch a cold.

829
01:06:21,579 --> 01:06:23,380
- Why did you walk in the rain?
- You're soaked.

830
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:25,090
- What is this?
- Why did you do that?

831
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:26,889
- Oh, my.
- You shouldn't do this.

832
01:06:28,219 --> 01:06:29,889
What is this sound?

833
01:06:30,489 --> 01:06:32,289
Oh, my. Look at that.

834
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,030
- Oh, my.
- Gosh.

835
01:06:35,059 --> 01:06:37,599
- What's going on?
- It's unbelievable.

836
01:06:50,179 --> 01:06:51,179
Oh, my.

837
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:09,030
Ro Woon, I love you.

838
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:10,829
I love you.

839
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:12,900
I love you, Ro Woon!

840
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:18,269
Go.

841
01:07:19,409 --> 01:07:20,840
I love you, Chae Ro Woon!

842
01:07:22,409 --> 01:07:23,639
I love you!

843
01:07:51,309 --> 01:07:52,969
Where did you get hit by the ball?

844
01:07:53,139 --> 01:07:54,679
- Pardon?
- Is it here?

845
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:58,110
Everyone's watching.

846
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:00,050
Wait, is it here?

847
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,250
It must be here.

848
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:07,789
My goodness.

849
01:08:08,219 --> 01:08:09,320
I love you.

850
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,869
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

851
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:22,800
I can't watch.

852
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,180
That's enough now.

853
01:08:34,109 --> 01:08:36,149
Get a room, you two.

854
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:47,159
(Thank you for watching
My Shy Boss.)

855
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:15,819
(My Shy Boss)

856
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,430
- My Shy Boss, let's go.
- Let's go!
