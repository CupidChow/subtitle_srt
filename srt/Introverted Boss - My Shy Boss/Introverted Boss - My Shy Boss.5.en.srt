1
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,310
Only 20 percent of
your marketing budget.

2
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:45,380
Just that 20 percent will be enough.

3
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,390
This was Kang Woo Il from Brain.

4
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,619
(The ideal boss, Kang Woo Il)
That's impressive of you.

5
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,060
But I heard a strange rumor.

6
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:53,689
The top floor of your office.
What is he like?

7
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:56,159
(The mysterious boss, Eun Hwan Gi)

8
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,630
He usually just stays in his office
all night.

9
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,429
(Who is he?)

10
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,130
Whatever goes in there...

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,840
never leaves that room.

12
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:07,109
(He cooks alone,)

13
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,609
(eats alone,)

14
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,879
(and exercises alone.)

15
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,049
(He dances alone?)

16
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:22,750
(I do everything alone.)

17
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:27,230
Hello, everyone. I'm a new member
of the Brain family as of today.

18
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,560
I'm the newly hired Chae Ro Woon.

19
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,260
Nice to meet you all!

20
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,030
(A suspicious-looking new hire,
Chae Ro Woon, approaches Hwan Gi.)

21
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:35,129
Mr. Eun?

22
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,730
I'll take all of them down,

23
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:40,209
including that psychopath's dad who
put a silver spoon in his mouth.

24
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,109
Oh, it's him.

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,939
Is it true that you were
abusive toward your secretary?

26
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,109
(Hwan Gi is in a bind due to what
Ro Woon disclosed to the media.)

27
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,150
Please say a few words.

28
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,750
I have a disorder
that prevents me from interacting...

29
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,750
I mean, I have extreme difficulty
interacting with people.

30
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,790
I'm really sorry...

31
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:02,230
for giving you a hard time.

32
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,959
Regardless...
Regardless of my intention,

33
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,530
I ended up hurting someone.

34
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:10,469
I can do it. I have to.

35
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,699
I can do it.

36
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:16,569
Why did you come down here?

37
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,210
I'll admit my fault...

38
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,979
- honestly.
- It might...

39
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:21,849
bring what happened
three years ago to light.

40
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,819
Will you be honest about that, too?

41
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:25,580
Is that what you're scared of?

42
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,919
Just by watching,

43
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,259
you can't protect anyone.

44
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,729
(The Unspeakable Secret
of 3 Years Ago)

45
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:48,930
(The Unspeakable Secret
of 3 Years Ago)

46
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,340
Aren't you uncomfortable here?

47
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:03,379
I feel at ease when I'm with people
whom I don't care much about.

48
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,889
When I'm with people
whom I care about,

49
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:12,620
I get more uncomfortable.

50
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:21,899
Here.

51
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:32,910
Then...

52
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,779
shall we go now?

53
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,649
Already?

54
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,290
If you're okay with it,

55
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,819
I'd like to have coffee.

56
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,459
Oh, right. If that's the case...

57
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,540
I'll get caramel macchiato.

58
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:13,689
Well... Next time...

59
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,620
Next time...

60
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,089
"Next time", "later",
and "some other time".

61
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:24,930
I hate using such vague expressions.

62
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:28,430
How can I show her that I'm serious
and that this isn't just empty talk?

63
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,199
Shall I open up my diary
and start moving my schedule around?

64
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:34,769
No, I shouldn't.

65
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,240
That will make her uncomfortable.

66
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:42,050
Please go on.

67
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,189
When you're free, let's...

68
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,360
How about movies...

69
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,029
It's almost time.

70
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:02,800
You should get going, Mr. Eun.

71
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,870
I must've looked like a fool.

72
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,410
No.

73
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,050
It was also great that you ordered
the type of coffee girls like.

74
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,180
I got this because I like it.

75
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,050
When you ask her out for a movie,

76
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,959
try not to put
too much meaning into it.

77
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,889
Do it casually.

78
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,189
That way,
she'll feel less uncomfortable.

79
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,360
Casually.

80
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:33,600
Okay.

81
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,100
I shouldn't wear this, right?

82
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,639
Just wear what you feel
most comfortable in...

83
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:44,540
if you care about the person
you're going to meet.

84
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,810
Oh, really?

85
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,879
All right, then.

86
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,420
Well, those flowers...

87
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,759
It might be a bit too much.

88
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:12,139
Take it.

89
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:15,069
Thank you for your help.

90
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:17,910
Oh, no problem.

91
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,439
You still wear that?

92
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:03,120
It's been so long,

93
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,220
Yun Jung.

94
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,560
You haven't changed one bit.

95
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,829
Since you're always wrapped
in those blackout curtains,

96
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,560
you probably get no exposure
to UV rays.

97
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:21,170
What shall we get?

98
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,110
Caramel macchiato?

99
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,110
I want americano.

100
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,579
Really?

101
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,720
Me, too.

102
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,789
Did you come empty-handedly?

103
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,000
I thought you'd at least show up
with flowers.

104
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,299
Flowers...

105
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,269
You had a crush
on me back in college.

106
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,580
- I did?
- Am I wrong?

107
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,009
Never mind, then.

108
00:09:02,049 --> 00:09:03,379
I liked you.

109
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:12,789
It can be this easy. I don't know
why I played so hard to get.

110
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:16,889
Hang out with me once in a while.

111
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,230
All my friends got married
while I was in the US.

112
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,799
I have no one to hang out with.

113
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:26,100
You have no one except Woo Il,
as always, don't you?

114
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:27,870
Right.

115
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,909
Should we...

116
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,509
- go to a movie...
- Instead of a movie,

117
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,379
buy my paintings.
You have a lot of money.

118
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,779
What?

119
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,320
Stop by at my gallery some time.

120
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,629
All right. I'll do that.

121
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,120
You're back, Mr. Eun.

122
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,039
I'm sorry.

123
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,710
Well...

124
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:38,980
My shoes are worn out.

125
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,179
They've been making too much noise.

126
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,080
I was worried it'd bother you.

127
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,250
I thought nail polish might
reduce the noise.

128
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:49,019
I'm sorry.

129
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:57,559
Did you meet her?

130
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,700
Yes.

131
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,799
Thanks to you.

132
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,190
Did you meet Yun Jung?

133
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,590
I did.

134
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:08,330
Hey.

135
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:11,799
Didn't you make a fool of yourself?

136
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:14,139
- Make a fool of myself?
- Did you do anything embarrassing?

137
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:15,639
- What?
- I'm jealous.

138
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:17,639
Can I borrow Ji Hye?

139
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,639
That's absurd.

140
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:21,850
Why do you call her Ji Hye?

141
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:23,679
It's her name.

142
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,679
She's not my secretary. You're not
letting me borrow her, either.

143
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,389
Why are you glaring at me?

144
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,590
I need a dating coach
to make your sister happier.

145
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,460
It bothers me that you think
you can borrow her.

146
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,129
She's a nice person.

147
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,340
I know.

148
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,870
She puts up with you.

149
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,580
It's 14 to 14.

150
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,769
Hwan Gi was very thankful.

151
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,809
You must have given him
some good advice.

152
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:27,879
I didn't do much.

153
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:32,950
I think your advice will be
more helpful.

154
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,620
Hwan Gi never listens to me.

155
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,830
Woo Il.

156
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:43,830
Mother.

157
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,600
I've been waiting for you.

158
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,129
Really?

159
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:51,769
Let's go up.

160
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,409
What brings you here?

161
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,379
You just wait. I have big news.

162
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,580
Big news?

163
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:03,149
- Have some tea.
- Okay.

164
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,850
Propose to her.

165
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,929
- Sorry?
- Propose to Yi Soo...

166
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,100
properly.

167
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:21,399
Girls care about formalities.

168
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:23,669
I don't know what you're...

169
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:27,669
Her father gave his permission.

170
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:30,610
He was not sure because
you're from an orphanage,

171
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,840
but I used my beauty
to persuade him.

172
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,379
Give me a compliment.

173
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,750
So suddenly?

174
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:40,850
Everyone knew that you two
will get married eventually.

175
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,250
It was just a matter of time.

176
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,490
What is this?

177
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,830
I thought you'd love it.
You seem unmoved.

178
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,570
It's just that
I'm feeling a bit puzzled.

179
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,000
Are you Hwan Gi?

180
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:04,279
We're finally becoming a family.

181
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,149
It's so pretty.

182
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,360
I'd love to wear it
on Christmas Eve.

183
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,590
It's going to be a special day.

184
00:15:25,929 --> 00:15:28,299
Propose to Yi Soo...

185
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,269
properly.

186
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,350
I'm home.

187
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,519
You're back.

188
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,259
Did you buy new shoes?

189
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,529
Well, yes.

190
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:57,960
Let me try.

191
00:15:58,259 --> 00:15:59,460
There you go again.

192
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,870
You'll break your sister's stuff
again.

193
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,580
Then...

194
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,279
buy me this one instead.

195
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:16,980
What?

196
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,149
Isn't it so pretty?

197
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,250
I have a really important audition
after this performance.

198
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:26,259
If I wear this to the audition,
I think people will...

199
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:28,460
recognize my worth.

200
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,789
Stop the nonsense.

201
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,960
When are you going to grow up?

202
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,830
Why did you give her all the good
genes in the first place?

203
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,539
With my mediocre looks,
I need to put a lot of effort...

204
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,240
to make people barely notice me.

205
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,039
She works for a big company.

206
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:49,149
She can buy new shoes
whenever she wants.

207
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,750
Buy me this, will you?

208
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:56,990
Please.

209
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,820
Will you?

210
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,090
I'd love to.

211
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:03,259
I'll definitely buy it for you
some time...

212
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,029
when I can afford it.

213
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,900
Fold it.

214
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,839
All right.

215
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,759
Let's see.

216
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:47,940
It looks good on you.

217
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,049
Isn't the color too showy?

218
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,079
Go for it. Don't hesitate.

219
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,029
There.

220
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,099
Let me come close.

221
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,569
Okay.

222
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:59,109
Go for it. Don't hesitate.

223
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:03,950
It's americano.

224
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:07,119
Hey.

225
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,589
I'll take this one.

226
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:14,759
Just because I asked you
to buy a painting,

227
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:16,559
you actually did it?

228
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,700
I feel bad now.

229
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,529
No, I really like it.

230
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:24,269
Send it to my office.

231
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,710
Let's take it slow.

232
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,549
Isn't your head cold?

233
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,160
Make some time for me
two days from now.

234
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:50,630
It's Christmas Eve.

235
00:19:50,829 --> 00:19:53,059
Buy me wine. I'll buy you dinner.

236
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,599
What is it? Am I too forward?

237
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,609
I learned with age...

238
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:04,539
that being forward
with what I want as a woman...

239
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,880
is the easiest and fastest way.

240
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:10,349
You want to see me...

241
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,220
on Christmas Eve?

242
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,549
Buy me a present, too.
Something that's not too expensive.

243
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,119
But it has to be pretty.

244
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,259
The flowers are pretty.

245
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,869
Is this the one you picked?

246
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,140
Yes.

247
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,180
Please pack it well
since he will propose with it.

248
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,210
Yes, Ma'am.

249
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,950
Do you need anything else?

250
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:46,180
No, I'm all right.

251
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,200
Sir.

252
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,230
- You're here.
- Yes.

253
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:05,000
It's nothing particular,
but it's Christmas soon.

254
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:06,670
Is there anything you want?

255
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:09,140
No, Sir.

256
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,069
It's not like that.

257
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,380
It must be hard to assist
the penthouse ruler.

258
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,980
This is a reward
for doing a great job.

259
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:18,750
Tell me.

260
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,049
Well, then...

261
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:24,490
Give me money.

262
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,289
- Money?
- Yes.

263
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,559
Money. Give me a lot of it.

264
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,730
What will you use it for?

265
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:36,470
I'll give it to the orphanage.

266
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,539
- Orphanage?
- Yes.

267
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:42,369
White Cloud Orphanage.

268
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:01,589
I'm home.

269
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,130
What about dinner?

270
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,259
What about you? Did you eat?

271
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:09,029
Your eldest is a saint.

272
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,470
She's looking out for you first.

273
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,299
Of course she is.

274
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,539
She's always looking after
the orphans, too.

275
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,410
Gosh.

276
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,980
It's so cold.

277
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:26,380
Here comes the noisy
and distracted one.

278
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,680
- I'm cold.
- Are you?

279
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,289
- What about dinner?
- I'm hungry. Give me food.

280
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,359
Mom, give me food.

281
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,460
Gosh.

282
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,789
Are you sure they're both yours?

283
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,000
Were you two
talking behind my back again?

284
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,029
Gosh.

285
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:46,640
Don't be rude to them.

286
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,109
What kind of father
lets his daughter talk like that?

287
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,140
Your sister is too nice
to say anything to you.

288
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,210
Where did you learn your manners?

289
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:56,049
That hurts. I'm sorry.

290
00:22:57,049 --> 00:22:59,779
No, she's cute and pretty.

291
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,289
You're pretty. You are.

292
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,930
They said I'm pretty.

293
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:10,829
Gosh.

294
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:20,400
What are you drawing?

295
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,410
Of what someone is looking at.

296
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,150
Someone?

297
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,480
Did you get a boyfriend?

298
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:35,089
What?

299
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:37,220
No way.

300
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:39,390
It's just...

301
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,630
someone at work.

302
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,799
You're dating someone at work?
Is he hot?

303
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,700
I said it's not like that.

304
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:50,230
Gosh.

305
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,240
Come watch my show together.

306
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:56,539
Since you're too nice,
I have to check him for you.

307
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,779
It's the last show on Christmas Eve.
You know that, right?

308
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:06,619
I even have lines this time.

309
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,220
You have to come.

310
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,589
Our names together mean "Wise".

311
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:14,589
I'm nothing without you.

312
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,359
You know that, right?

313
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:18,730
- Please come.
- Okay.

314
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,359
- Please.
- That tickles.

315
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,099
All right, all right.

316
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,839
I'll go even if it's by myself.

317
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:27,569
Here.

318
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,369
- I promise.
- You promised.

319
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,509
Happy?

320
00:24:33,609 --> 00:24:37,609
I'd like it better
if you brought your boyfriend.

321
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,950
I told you it's not like that.

322
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,420
You're lying.

323
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,519
I'm not. Stop tickling me.

324
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,819
Come here.

325
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,190
- All right, I'm sorry.
- Come here.

326
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,039
Hello, Sir.

327
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,279
Sir. Wait.

328
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,190
My sister is performing
at W Art Hall.

329
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:21,160
Tomorrow is the last performance,
so I should go.

330
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:23,859
I see. You can leave early tomorrow.

331
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,839
It's Christmas Eve.

332
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,410
Buy me wine. I'll buy you dinner.

333
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:39,839
Alone with me...

334
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,910
on Christmas Eve?

335
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,720
Yes! Yes! Yes!

336
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:58,730
Yes!

337
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:16,079
I'm... I'm sorry.

338
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,619
We'll get a painting...

339
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:28,960
delivered from a gallery
in the morning.

340
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,160
I see.

341
00:26:30,829 --> 00:26:32,960
The gallery where she works at?

342
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:34,130
Yes.

343
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:40,569
It's Christmas Eve tomorrow.

344
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,309
We're going to meet.

345
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:47,980
What kind of present would be good?

346
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:51,079
I'll look into it
and get you a list.

347
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:54,420
- Thank you.
- Okay.

348
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,349
Continue...

349
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,490
Did you see?

350
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,599
Did she see me?

351
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,220
Mr. Eun,

352
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:38,329
can I see you at the lounge?

353
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:52,640
Hello. Is he inside?

354
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,809
Yes.

355
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:57,410
Did something good happen?

356
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,150
I'm...

357
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:02,150
getting married.

358
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:06,119
Congratulations.

359
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:08,319
With whom?

360
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:10,160
It's a secret for now.

361
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,329
I'll make sure
to send you an invitation.

362
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,539
It's finally tomorrow.

363
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:23,339
I'm so nervous.

364
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,279
Are you that happy?
You've known him for 20 years.

365
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:30,210
Of course I'm happy.

366
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,819
I've been head over heels for Woo Il
for almost 20 years.

367
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,190
I even have
the entire date planned out.

368
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:40,519
We're going to watch
a musical at W Art Hall,

369
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,529
and he'll propose to me afterwards.

370
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,759
Hey, calm down.

371
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,039
W Art Hall?

372
00:28:56,309 --> 00:29:00,539
My sister is doing a musical
at W Art Hall.

373
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,710
W Art Hall...

374
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,549
What are you thinking about?

375
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,019
- I heard someone's in that musical.
- Who?

376
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:12,059
Just someone my acquaintance knows.

377
00:29:17,329 --> 00:29:18,599
What's the matter with you?

378
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:31,470
This will look
too much like a joke, right?

379
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,420
Shall I just show him anyway?

380
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:52,829
No, I shouldn't.

381
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,299
It might make him uncomfortable.

382
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:59,039
You keep fiddling with that.
What is it?

383
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,210
What's inside? I'm curious.

384
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:04,970
It's nothing.

385
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:06,910
It's really nothing special.

386
00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:08,380
Then I can see what's inside, right?

387
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,029
Did you draw this yourself?

388
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:28,529
Yes.

389
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,369
I just doodled a little.

390
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,240
- Can I have this?
- Pardon?

391
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:37,269
No, you can't.

392
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:38,680
Is this for someone?

393
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:40,140
Not at all.

394
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:43,309
That's not the case, but...

395
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:45,250
Then let me have it. I want it.

396
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,119
It's not good enough
to be given to anyone.

397
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,319
I'm sorry.

398
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:55,960
I sent your Christmas gift
to the orphanage.

399
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:59,700
I think I deserve a gift
for doing a good deed.

400
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,369
I just really like this.

401
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,200
Well... Mr. Kang.

402
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:15,650
It's nothing. Never mind.

403
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,119
Then you're giving this to me,
right?

404
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,349
This is such a great drawing.

405
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,730
Where did you wander off to
during your work hours?

406
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,500
I had to meet with a reporter.

407
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:40,200
Do you think it's okay
to idle around and slack off...

408
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,339
now that I've given you
permission to marry my daughter?

409
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,150
I want Hwan Gi to get married first.

410
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:54,619
The girl he's seeing these days.
What does she do?

411
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,650
I heard she went to college
with you guys.

412
00:31:58,289 --> 00:31:59,619
Pardon?

413
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,289
How do you know that?

414
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,930
Well, I heard it from Yi Soo.

415
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,299
I don't think she knows.

416
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:13,039
Hwan Gi wanted
to keep it from his family.

417
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,839
Are you interrogating me or what?

418
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:21,809
You come from nothing. I see
that you've gotten all big-headed.

419
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:26,680
At this rate, you'll want
to eat up Brain in no time.

420
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:32,490
Listen. Don't forget that I'm
keeping a watchful eye on you.

421
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,519
Okay.

422
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,660
I want a report
on the girl Hwan Gi is seeing.

423
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:37,960
Yes, Sir.

424
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,829
You don't need to see me out.
Don't bother.

425
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:01,819
Hey, Hwan Gi. By any chance,
did you tell Yi Soo...

426
00:33:17,069 --> 00:33:18,369
I'll call you back later.

427
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:31,549
Listen. Don't forget that I'm
keeping a watchful eye on you.

428
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,299
Mr. Kang, are you all right?

429
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:52,970
You made it.

430
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,779
I can't really drink.

431
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,219
Did something bad happen?

432
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,699
It's a bug.

433
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,900
I found it
underneath my office desk.

434
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,340
Even when everyone ridiculed me...

435
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:36,150
and said that it's only a strategic
relationship created out of need,

436
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:40,280
I kept insisting
that they're my family...

437
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:45,989
and that our relationship
is nothing but genuine.

438
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:30,630
Mr. Kang,
I think you should go home now.

439
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,400
My home?

440
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:36,739
Shall we?

441
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:41,409
Can you take me home?

442
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,880
I'm sure you know where it is.

443
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,650
I heard you've visited many times.

444
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,190
White Cloud Orphanage.

445
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,829
It's been so long since
I said the name out loud.

446
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,639
I was never ashamed of my home.

447
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:16,110
I wanted to be able to talk about it
proudly without any shame.

448
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:22,690
Why did I become so ashamed of it?

449
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:29,030
Could it be because I haven't
been able to talk about it?

450
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,730
Or...

451
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,969
did I choose not to talk about it
because I was ashamed of it?

452
00:36:58,219 --> 00:36:59,659
Mr. Kang.

453
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:13,800
Mr. Kang...

454
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:35,960
Ji Hye.

455
00:37:40,699 --> 00:37:43,230
There's something
I want to give you.

456
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,500
How could someone like me...

457
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,039
How could I...

458
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:33,980
It's an unbelievable mistake.

459
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,780
I think I made a huge mistake.

460
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,420
Don't say that.

461
00:40:19,389 --> 00:40:20,989
(Yi Soo)

462
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,059
Yes?

463
00:40:31,469 --> 00:40:32,500
Hey.

464
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:37,969
I'm sorry,

465
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:41,579
but I don't think I can give you...

466
00:40:43,409 --> 00:40:45,710
- the necklace.
- The necklace?

467
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,420
I never asked you
to give me a necklace.

468
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:52,860
I just wanted to look pretty
in front of you in it.

469
00:40:52,889 --> 00:40:54,559
I never asked you to buy it for me.

470
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:57,389
Why would I pressure you like that?

471
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:02,130
I just came to buy that necklace
for myself.

472
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:04,570
I'll propose to you myself.

473
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,199
I'm going to be as pretty
as I can be today,

474
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:09,340
so you better be ready for it.

475
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,829
Can I look at this necklace?

476
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:35,329
The man that came with you before...

477
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,699
bought the necklace
saying he will propose.

478
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:38,829
Pardon?

479
00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:41,739
You two came together
a few days ago, right?

480
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,670
I remember you because
you two looked so good together.

481
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,179
He came to buy it the day after.

482
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:51,150
I don't think I can give you
the necklace.

483
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,619
That's impossible.

484
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:55,119
You must be mistaken.

485
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,210
I'm sorry to interrupt.

486
00:42:20,409 --> 00:42:23,750
If you don't have anything else
for me, I'll get...

487
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,809
Come in.

488
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,349
Sir...

489
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,219
Is there something
you want to say to me?

490
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,000
My sister is performing
at W Art Hall.

491
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,400
Tomorrow is the last performance,
so I should go.

492
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,010
I even planned out our date.

493
00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:25,739
We'll watch a musical
at the W Art Hall,

494
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:28,739
then I'll officially propose to him.

495
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,750
You seem to be feeling down today.

496
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:43,090
Did I do something wrong?
If you would tell me...

497
00:43:51,769 --> 00:43:53,699
I lost one of my cuff links.

498
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:55,469

Excuse me.

666
01:07:03,489 --> 01:07:04,590
Who...

667
01:07:05,659 --> 01:07:07,289
Who sent these?

668
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,059
I'm not allowed to tell you.

669
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:11,469
I'm sorry.

670
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:13,469
Wait.

671
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:14,699
On behalf of the one who's left,

672
01:08:15,159 --> 01:08:17,100
I've been watching her
for three years.

673
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:19,500
But...

674
01:08:23,470 --> 01:08:26,539
If you just stand there and watch,

675
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,180
nothing will happen.

676
01:08:36,819 --> 01:08:38,819
Just by watching,

677
01:08:41,789 --> 01:08:44,229
you can't protect anyone.

678
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,869
I'm tired.

679
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:29,699
That's what I should say.

680
01:09:38,909 --> 01:09:41,550
While trying to take revenge,

681
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:44,520
I caused other people trouble.

682
01:09:45,989 --> 01:09:48,619
I didn't mean to.

683
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:53,529
I did take revenge in the end.

684
01:09:54,529 --> 01:09:57,670
I think I did.

685
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:02,770
But it doesn't feel right.

686
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:07,779
It wasn't very satisfying.

687
01:10:07,909 --> 01:10:10,380
I don't feel good at all.

688
01:10:11,109 --> 01:10:12,909
How should I put it?

689
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:15,949
I feel very...

690
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:20,189
Very...

691
01:10:22,659 --> 01:10:24,390
sorry.

692
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:40,140
I'm sorry.

693
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:52,090
That's what I should say.

694
01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:31,460
(My Shy Boss)

695
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:34,600
- Workshop?
- The team members will...

696
01:11:34,729 --> 01:11:36,960
turn Mr. Eun into an ideal leader.

697
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,329
- Change Eun Hwan Gi.
- I'm not going.

698
01:11:39,369 --> 01:11:41,439
- Mr. Kang...
- Stop it!

699
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:43,140
Can I really change?

700
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:46,869
If all I have to do is move my body,
I might be able to do it. Let's try.

701
01:11:46,909 --> 01:11:49,909
Wrong. We're running out of time.
Next question.

702
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:54,520
Wrong. Sadly, wrong again.

703
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:56,420
Boss, do you love me?

704
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:00,050
No, I don't like her.

705
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:03,119
I just worry about her.

706
01:12:03,859 --> 01:12:05,189
I like you.
