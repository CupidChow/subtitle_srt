1
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:03,030
Well, then shall we...

2
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,040
start talking?

3
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,140
You two have been just
staring at each other.

4
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,540
Well...

5
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,450
Will you say I have a grudge again
now that I don't speak?

6
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,650
Did I upset you?

7
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,120
Did you hold grudges again?

8
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,599
I don't talk...

9
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,060
because I'm considerate.

10
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,170
Do you get it?

11
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:38,340
It's because I'm considerate.

12
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,370
Do you know
what being considerate means?

13
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:43,480
I try to understand others that they
might have...

14
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,739
their own reasons and
they might stop someday.

15
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,879
I endured and waited.

16
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,519
Then I went through a lot...

17
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:58,459
to start talking like this.

18
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,290
I want you to know that.

19
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:04,659
Hwan Gi!

20
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,270
Do you think I say
all I want to say?

21
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,199
- I think you do.
- No.

22
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,770
- No?
- No!

23
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:13,939
Gosh. I doubt it.

24
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:16,610
I talk more than you just because...

25
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,840
I have much to say.

26
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,009
I barely get to say
what I really want to say.

27
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,280
I hesitate too.

28
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:29,150
I also think carefully...

29
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,520
and hold back. Do you know that?

30
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,430
No, you don't.

31
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:38,400
You think and hold back?

32
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,569
I can understand both of you.

33
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:45,900
Shall we start talking about
what you really want to say?

34
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:47,870
- Let me start first.
- Hey.

35
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:51,840
Wait. How dare you start first?

36
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,849
Where is my alcohol?

37
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:57,580
My alcohol is gone. Where is it?

38
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,020
- We need more drinks now.
- I'll go get it.

39
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,590
- I'm okay.
- I'll bring some more.

40
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,430
You just stay here.
You better not run away.

41
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,699
There you go!

42
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:18,740
I won!

43
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,039
We are here.

44
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,409
We are almost there.
Please move a bit more.

45
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,180
- Shall we go?
- No.

46
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,280
I'm too tired.

47
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,250
There, there.

48
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,990
- Please untie this.
- Do you want to untie that?

49
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:38,159
Are you stuffy?

50
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,590
- Yes, I am.
- Okay.

51
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:42,860
It's done now.

52
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,599
- Thanks.
- No problem.

53
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,740
Gosh...

54
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,039
I have one more to carry.

55
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,780
Are you crying?

56
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,590
She's so ugly.

57
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,529
- Oh, my goodness.
- I do look so ugly.

58
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:22,730
That totally sobered me up.

59
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,439
I won.

60
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,439
I'm injured, but I still won.

61
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,480
Does it still hurt?

62
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,230
Your photo was...

63
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:53,459
so funny.

64
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:55,699
Go on. Laugh as you want!

65
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,339
You didn't laugh
when I wanted you to do so.

66
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,040
We're here.

67
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,019
Oh, boy.

68
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,319
Almost there.

69
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,069
She's so ugly.

70
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:23,220
I didn't know he could laugh
so much like this.

71
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:29,959
He looks beautiful.

72
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:41,569
(Episode 9, If You Listen)

73
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:46,480
Where did Ro Woon go?

74
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,009
She promised to go on
a tour together.

75
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,519
Ro Woon!

76
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,490
Ro Woon! Ro Woon!

77
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,069
Move your leg away.

78
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:15,910
I am sorry.

79
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:22,379
Move your head.
You're using my arm as pillow.

80
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,519
- I'm not.
- You are.

81
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,149
I said to move your leg. It's heavy.

82
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:28,449
I did it.

83
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,889
Whose leg is this then?

84
00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:34,759
Get off me. Seriously.

85
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:38,160
What are you talking about?

86
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,949
- Put her head away.
- What?

87
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,519
Do it gently.

88
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,759
Hurry up!

89
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,110
Gosh.

90
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:43,429
Do you want some coffee?

91
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,070
She's so odd.

92
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,009
With her, we might be able to go
back to how things were before.

93
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,440
Thanks to her,

94
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,750
we fought, argued,

95
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,250
and laughed just like in the past.

96
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,919
I want things to be like that
in the future as well.

97
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:10,889
For that to happen,

98
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:13,820
I'd better not...

99
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,730
marry Yi Soo.

100
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,529
I say this to you honestly...

101
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,440
because I don't want to lose you.

102
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,240
It could be my greed,
but I hope you understand me.

103
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,740
You've never brought out...

104
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:36,509
what happened
three years ago, right?

105
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,669
How can someone like me...

106
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,240
How can I...

107
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,210
I think I made...

108
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,080
a terrible mistake that
I should've never made.

109
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,750
Please don't say that.

110
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:32,500
I feel too guilty for her
to stay with Yi Soo.

111
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:36,570
It's also not right...

112
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,809
to stay with her feeling like this.

113
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:42,549
I realized only after
sending her like that.

114
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,019
The biggest mistake I made was...

115
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,789
not choosing her.

116
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,590
I don't want to...

117
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,090
repeat the same mistake.

118
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:57,460
I'm not going to repeat
the same mistake either.

119
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,899
I'm not going to hesitate anymore.

120
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:04,039
What do you mean?

121
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,039
The one you're about to choose is...

122
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:12,179
Ms. Chae's little sister.

123
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,309
- What?
- Chae Ro Woon is...

124
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,919
Chae Ji Hye's little sister.
Do you understand?

125
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,750
What are you talking about?

126
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:26,960
Are you sure?

127
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,429
Why didn't you tell me?

128
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:34,100
I told you to fire her.

129
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,269
Were you aware of it
from the beginning?

130
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,799
Why didn't you...

131
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:41,710
Wait.

132
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,580
Why did Ro Woon enter
our company in the first place?

133
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,279
Leave her...

134
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,519
be.

135
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,879
What?

136
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,350
- Don't do anything to her.
- What are you...

137
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:58,659
I can't...

138
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:03,860
let her go now.

139
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,100
Why are you coming out of
Boss's room?

140
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,500
What?

141
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:15,169
It's not like that.
I just came to look for him.

142
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,100
That's not true. I saw you
coming out of there.

143
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:19,440
No.

144
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,309
It's not like that.
I'm just looking for him.

145
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,639
Why this early in the morning?

146
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:27,480
Breakfast.

147
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:29,580
He should have breakfast.

148
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,049
Just to say that
he should have breakfast,

149
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,450
you hurried here
as soon as you woke up?

150
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,019
You haven't even washed your face.

151
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:41,830
Your hair is a mess.

152
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,590
Stop it.

153
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:50,799
Gyo Ri, you're sharing a room
with Ro Woon, right?

154
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,399
Hey.

155
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,340
- I was wondering if you slept well.
- Gyo Ri.

156
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,509
- Gyo Ri.
- Where are you now?

157
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:01,250
- Okay, I'll be right there.
- Hey.

158
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,809
- Okay.
- Wait.

159
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,519
Hey, stop.

160
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:09,190
Wait.

161
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:15,429
I can't understand a word
of what you're saying.

162
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:17,289
She's here to take revenge.

163
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:20,429
She's the one who published
the article on my power abuse.

164
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,730
Is that true?

165
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,639
Why did you...

166
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,509
- keep it to yourself?
- I thought she could get hurt.

167
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:29,769
That's why I didn't tell you.

168
00:14:29,809 --> 00:14:33,639
- If Father finds out...
- So let's keep it from him.

169
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,549
Don't say anything to Ro Woon.

170
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,679
She doesn't know
that I'm aware of it.

171
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,159
Se Jong, let me explain, okay?

172
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,460
- Come here.
- It hurts.

173
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,730
Se Jong.

174
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,929
I'm getting even more suspicious
because you're stopping me.

175
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,870
There's nothing to be suspicious of.
What are you talking about?

176
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:59,600
- Is that so?
- Wait.

177
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:03,110
Stop!

178
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:06,409
Why are you so fast? Hey!

179
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,210
Stop right there!

180
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:09,779
I want to...

181
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,389
protect her this time.

182
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:19,159
If you're feeling guilty
about what happened to Ms. Chae,

183
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,360
protect her by all means.

184
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:41,980
Very good. Let's do a cat pose now.

185
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,750
Come down. Breathe.

186
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:49,250
Breathe out.

187
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,860
And come back up.

188
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,730
That'd be it.

189
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,500
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

190
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,230
Gyo Ri.

191
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,740
Ro Woon didn't come to the room
last night, did she?

192
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:12,740
I don't know.

193
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:17,509
- I went to bed early last night.
- You would have noticed her.

194
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,419
She snores so loud.

195
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,590
Gyo Ri.

196
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,259
- Hey.
- Tell me the truth.

197
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:35,330
Who did you sleep with last night?

198
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:37,970
Boss? Mr. Kang?

199
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,840
Or both?

200
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:41,940
You're amazing.

201
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:44,980
That's right. I slept with him.

202
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:46,710
I slept with Boss.
Are you happy now?

203
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:49,309
See?

204
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:51,379
You like Boss.

205
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,289
We just slept.

206
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,720
He got drunk,
so I took him to his room.

207
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:01,629
And then I fell asleep.

208
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,759
Do you expect me to believe that?

209
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,400
Fine, don't believe it.
That's great.

210
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,670
Now, you could finally stop
harassing me.

211
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,069
Do you think
I'm trying to harass you?

212
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,910
You keep crossing the line
making others uncomfortable.

213
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,180
You're just fooling around with me.

214
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,480
I'm fooling around with you?

215
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,279
I looked for you everywhere
all night.

216
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,720
I wanted to show you fireflies.

217
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,089
I stayed up all night
waiting for you.

218
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,460
Do you still think
I'm fooling around with you?

219
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:41,529
Se Jong.

220
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:03,450
Boss.

221
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:06,619
- Where's Mr. Kang?
- He went back.

222
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,859
Did something come up?

223
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,730
I'm sorry.

224
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,900
I fell asleep in your bed.

225
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,509
In addition, I got caught.

226
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:30,309
By Se Jong, the big mouth.

227
00:18:31,349 --> 00:18:33,519
I should have kept my mouth shut,

228
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:35,720
but he was so persistent.

229
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,650
Also...

230
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,759
I'm not supposed to tell anyone,

231
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:46,900
but you're good at keeping secrets.

232
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,130
It's only between you and me.

233
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,369
The thing is,

234
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,269
Gyo Ri has a crush on Se Jong.

235
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:00,839
I thought it might help Se Jong
give up on me.

236
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,150
He says he likes me all the time.

237
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,319
I feel so sorry for Gyo Ri.

238
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,289
You laughed so much last night.

239
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:16,029
You turned into an adolescent boy
overnight.

240
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,170
I have no idea
what's going through your mind.

241
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:25,640
Speaking of which,

242
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:29,869
I've been thinking about
how to communicate with you.

243
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,910
What is this?

244
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,609
Stay still.

245
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,319
Ta-da.

246
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,920
There you go.

247
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,029
- It's a signal light.
- Sorry?

248
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,130
You communicate your mood
using different colors.

249
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,460
When you don't want to be
bothered by anyone,

250
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,970
turn on the red light.

251
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,440
When you're available for urgent
matters, turn on the yellow light.

252
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:05,079
When you're feeling ready for
all kinds of discussion,

253
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,910
turn on the green light.

254
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:11,880
This is too... I'm okay.

255
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,650
You might feel awkward at first,

256
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,190
but you'll get used to it
eventually.

257
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,460
Here.

258
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:25,430
Right now, it's the red light.

259
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,759
Isn't it?

260
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,200
I'll stop talking.

261
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,009
Just relax.

262
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:49,450
How can she say such a thing?

263
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,920
How dare she belittle me like that?

264
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,009
I'm not fooling around with her...

265
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,180
I wanted to look cool
in front of Ro Woon,

266
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,019
so I even got these limited-edition
sneakers yesterday.

267
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:32,200
Right. She might think
that I'm too stylish for her.

268
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:33,599
Yes, that must be it.

269
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,829
It's all because of my good looks.

270
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,500
That's why she can't see how sincere
I am and doesn't take me seriously.

271
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:41,740
I don't need these stupid sneakers!

272
00:21:45,109 --> 00:21:48,180
That was the reason!
My good looks were to blame!

273
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,480
My sneakers! Oh, no. My sneakers...

274
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:55,849
What is he doing?

275
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,089
Is he being like that
because of Ro Woon?

276
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:01,059
Se Jong!

277
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,029
Se Jong!

278
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,130
Oh, no. My sneakers...

279
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,930
- Se Jong!
- Let go.

280
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,500
Don't go. It's dangerous.

281
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:11,569
No, I can't let it go like that.
I really can't.

282
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:14,400
Please don't be like this.
Don't be so hung up.

283
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,009
Just let it go already.

284
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:18,779
No, I can't.
My limited-edition sneakers.

285
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,309
I went through hoops to get them.

286
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,480
Gosh, my shoes...

287
00:22:24,579 --> 00:22:25,650
Oh, was it about...

288
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,789
I thought you hate me now
or something.

289
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,359
Why would I hate you?

290
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:43,869
You've been distant
ever since you found out...

291
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,640
who my grandfather is.

292
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,109
Well, that's...

293
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:50,569
It's okay. That's normal.

294
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,480
Everyone changes a little
when they find out about it.

295
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,079
They either treat me better
or start hating me.

296
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:02,390
Anyway, I guess things can't be
the same as before.

297
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,250
It's not like that.

298
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,319
But there's one person...

299
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,259
who hasn't changed at all around me.

300
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,769
Is it Ro Woon?

301
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:15,970
Right.

302
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,140
Her belittling attitude toward me
does annoy me a bit, though.

303
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,410
- Thanks for this.
- Don't mention it.

304
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,380
By the way, can I ask you something?

305
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:39,519
Why did Mr. Kang go back already?

306
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,599
Okay, fine. I'll keep my mouth shut.

307
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,299
- By any chance...
- The red light is on.

308
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:52,670
You're defeating the purpose
of the signal light.

309
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,170
Please let me ask you
just one question.

310
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:02,109
Did I...

311
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,049
snore by any chance?

312
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,220
I did, didn't I?

313
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,990
Are you extra sensitive today
because you couldn't get any sleep?

314
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:13,220
Was my snoring that bad?

315
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,529
Enough to make both of you
run out of the room?

316
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,529
Is that also why Mr. Kang
went back to Seoul early...

317
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,369
Come on.
That's not what happened, right?

318
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,470
It mustn't have been that bad.

319
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,970
By the way, that flower
really suits you. Do you know that?

320
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,250
I want to go back.

321
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,589
- Shall we go back?
- Really?

322
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,789
(Welcome, Yun Jung.)

323
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:50,359
(Welcome, Yun Jung.)

324
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:52,759
(10 years ago)

325
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,069
(Welcome, Yun Jung.)

326
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,269
(Welcome, Yun Jung.)

327
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,420
(Welcome, Yun Jung.)

328
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,710
Hwan Gi.

329
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:40,839
When did you start
wearing that hoodie?

330
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:42,579
Oh, this.

331
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,150
When I was in college.

332
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,079
Why? Did something happen?

333
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,819
Was it because of a girl?

334
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:52,220
A heartbreak from your first love?

335
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,990
Gosh, that must've been
what happened.

336
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,890
What was she like?

337
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,799
Any tear-invoking stories
you want to share?

338
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,259
Tell me.

339
00:26:02,069 --> 00:26:03,329
It's none of your business.

340
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:09,269
I think it's him.

341
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:13,339
Hello.

342
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:17,250
(New York Barbershop)

343
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,130
It doesn't look
like his daughter is back yet.

344
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:39,039
She didn't even leave a note.

345
00:26:39,069 --> 00:26:41,839
How many days has it been
since she just took off?

346
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:00,160
Goodness.

347
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:11,799
He must be so worried.

348
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,109
- There she is. She's back!
- What?

349
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,109
Yes, she's back.

350
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,259
I guess we'll get
to hear him yelling this time.

351
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:34,190
He's been too lenient with her.

352
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,789
He really should
teach her a lesson this time.

353
00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:37,930
Absolutely.

354
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,829
Yes! Good. Way to go.

355
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:43,869
Be a man.
Show her how scary you can be!

356
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,839
Have you eaten yet?

357
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,809
Yes, I have.

358
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:03,349
What did he say?

359
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,289
He asked her if she's eaten.

360
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:19,569
I've eaten as well.

361
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,009
You remind me
of someone I used to know...

362
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,579
even though you two
aren't really similar.

363
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,559
Yes, Mr. Park.

364
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:51,500
(New Year Message
for the Brain Family)

365
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:54,140
(Mr. Kang Woo Il and my daughter
are getting married.)

366
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,009
He's getting married.

367
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:57,910
He wasn't going to be mine anyway.

368
00:28:58,009 --> 00:28:59,710
But this is so sudden.

369
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:02,680
I can't believe it.

370
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:05,819
The founder of Brain wrote
this message himself...

371
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,720
for all of the employees.
It's obviously not some gibberish.

372
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:14,920
So he announced it like this.

373
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:17,890
I thought you were aware of it.

374
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,829
Mr. Kang.

375
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:25,640
Congratulations on your engagement.

376
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:27,640
Congratulations.

377
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,509
- Mr. Kang, congratulations.
- Congratulations.

378
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:33,109
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

379
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,480
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

380
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:38,519
You're here.

381
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,630
You announced my engagement.

382
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:53,200
I went out of my way
to make you proud.

383
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,700
You didn't say anything to me.

384
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,039
And I was away.

385
00:29:59,069 --> 00:30:01,269
- You can leave now.
- Okay.

386
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:06,710
I've been a little cold to you
lately.

387
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,910
It's not because I hate you.

388
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,980
It's because I trust you.
I feel comfortable around you.

389
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,849
I rely on you
more than I do to my own son.

390
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,460
My son achieved an okay result
this time,

391
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,990
but he still has a long way to go.

392
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:26,630
Please help him come to the front...

393
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:28,930
and lead the company.

394
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:33,200
You've been carrying
so much burden by yourself.

395
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:34,869
Am I wrong?

396
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:38,039
You want Hwan Gi to stand out...

397
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,140
more than I do, right?

398
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,450
I just slapped you in the face once.

399
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,079
Are you still holding a grudge?

400
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:47,720
I wish...

401
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:51,019
you were my son...

402
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,319
a dozen times a day.

403
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,430
I'm even giving my daughter to you.

404
00:30:56,529 --> 00:30:59,630
- Father, I appreciate that, but...
- Still,

405
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,369
don't get too excited
about your wedding.

406
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,900
Don't neglect the election
or the company.

407
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:10,569
We still don't know who released the
article on Hwan Gi's power abuse.

408
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:18,819
Woo Il.

409
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,619
You were surprised, right?

410
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:26,319
Mom was worried you were not
interested in marrying me.

411
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:29,390
She was making a fuss
saying she has a bad feeling.

412
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:32,529
While trying to defend you,
things got out of hand.

413
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,160
- I'm sorry, but...
- That's what I want to say.

414
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,500
I can't postpone our wedding
any longer than this.

415
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,009
Yi Soo.

416
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:46,779
Stay with me.

417
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,180
That's the only thing...

418
00:31:51,579 --> 00:31:52,950
I ask of you.

419
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:01,190
He caught me off guard.

420
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,029
I knew how controlling he can be,
but I didn't expect this.

421
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,930
Ro Woon is giving me
enough headaches.

422
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,869
Now, a wedding announcement?

423
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:15,710
Let's fire Ro Woon.

424
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:19,079
That'll be best for her too.

425
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:23,509
- Let's not take any action...
- We should have earlier.

426
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,049
If she's planning something
in addition to that article...

427
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:27,680
She won't do anything more.

428
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:31,250
Then why is she still here?

429
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,789
She must be trying to dig into
what happened three years ago.

430
00:32:35,089 --> 00:32:36,960
If she finds out...

431
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,400
Is that what you're going for?

432
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:45,130
That's my biggest weakness.
Is that why you...

433
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,240
- Are you saying I'm...
- Then?

434
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:49,710
You said you want to protect her.
Why are you keeping her here?

435
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,170
It just doesn't make sense.

436
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:55,180
Give me some time.

437
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,380
Why?

438
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,019
What are you thinking about
all alone now?

439
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:06,289
It's me. You can talk to me.

440
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,589
Wasn't keeping her identity from me
all this time enough?

441
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,569
Only my secrets are found by you.

442
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:26,180
You see through me.
Why can't I see who you are?

443
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,579
Can't I know what's on your mind?

444
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:45,660
Yoo Hee wants Boss.

445
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,829
She's starting a meeting.

446
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,970
- It was a mistake.
- A mistake?

447
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,140
You know guys can make a mistake.

448
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:56,670
What's going on between...

449
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:10,420
Mr. Kang.

450
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,159
Boss, did something happen?

451
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,710
The war has begun.

452
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:32,079
What do you mean?

453
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,679
Mr. Kang's wedding
has been announced.

454
00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:37,079
He's going to be
the founder's son-in-law.

455
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:39,920
The son and the son-in-law will
fight over the management rights.

456
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,250
This is the beginning
of that cruel battle.

457
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:43,789
Here you go.

458
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:46,420
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

459
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:48,260
It's hot.

460
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:51,090
It tastes good.

461
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,929
I don't believe they argued
over such a thing.

462
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,139
You never know.

463
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,139
My mom fights with her sisters
all the time too.

464
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,239
- That's the way it is.
- Is this battle even possible?

465
00:35:09,949 --> 00:35:11,510
Exactly.

466
00:35:11,949 --> 00:35:14,219
Mr. Kang has shown so much so far.

467
00:35:14,949 --> 00:35:17,920
Mr. Eun doesn't have resources.

468
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,389
- I feel sorry for him.
- So do I.

469
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,230
What could Mr. Eun do
without Mr. Kang?

470
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:26,030
Sun Bong, come over here, will you?

471
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,869
No. We better decide our positions
carefully now.

472
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,070
- Bye.
- Wait.

473
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,280
Sun Bong, where are you going?

474
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:43,250
We should help him.

475
00:35:48,449 --> 00:35:50,550
This is an old, small theater.

476
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:54,219
They want to renovate this place
into a theater for movie lovers.

477
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,659
Mr. Kang's team is working on
a project related to theaters too.

478
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,599
This is our chance
to prove ourselves.

479
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,730
Are we going to set the theme
ourselves as well?

480
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:08,199
Do you think marketing
is all about...

481
00:36:08,269 --> 00:36:10,809
sitting at the desk
writing a few articles?

482
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,840
You have to try the whole process...

483
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,809
from planning to marketing
yourself...

484
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:19,679
to get an idea of how PR works.

485
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:23,920
Ro Woon, go check the place
with Boss.

486
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:25,250
Can't I go?

487
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:29,489
I think Ro Woon should go.

488
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,130
Okay.

489
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,409
Can't I know what's on your mind?

490
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,389
You fell in love with someone
you shouldn't love, didn't you?

491
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:03,630
She's your employee,
and she's another employee's girl.

492
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:17,510
Do you see?
The red light means "stop".

493
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,409
The yellow light means he's
available only for urgent matters.

494
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,380
- The green light is...
- Does the green light ever turn on?

495
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,480
Gosh.

496
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:28,019
I'll leave for the theater first.

497
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:30,690
Let me go with you.

498
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,519
No. The red light is on.

499
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:36,260
Sort out your thoughts.

500
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:38,530
Come when the green light is on.

501
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,530
Go.

502
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,869
Take your time.

503
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,539
- Go.
- I'm going.

504
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:54,610
A red light.

505
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,690
I realized I should stop.

506
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,210
Still, I...

507
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:33,650
Gosh.

508
00:38:49,699 --> 00:38:53,369
Is the green light on yet?

509
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:40,820
I'm sorry.

510
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:42,619
Hey, Hwan Gi.

511
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:51,190
Did you not see me?
Or are you just pretending?

512
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:54,000
You were all I could see
even from across the street.

513
00:39:55,969 --> 00:39:57,000
Yun Jung.

514
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,440
Every time I see you,
I feel like it's been so long.

515
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:08,139
Please leave a message
after the tone.

516
00:40:08,179 --> 00:40:09,949
I'd appreciate it
if he at least picks up.

517
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:13,380
Come to think of it, I've never
talked to him on the phone.

518
00:40:14,349 --> 00:40:16,849
Oh, that's right.

519
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:19,219
He has telephone phobia.

520
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,150
I actually saw you at the airport
a little while ago.

521
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:45,110
That was you, wasn't it?

522
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:48,780
Oh, the airport? Right.

523
00:40:49,389 --> 00:40:51,820
Even on that day, you walked away
as if you didn't see me.

524
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:56,730
Right, you probably didn't have
the guts to face me...

525
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,889
after standing me up
like that three years ago.

526
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,900
I've developed trauma
about Christmas.

527
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:08,840
- I'm sorry. Back then, I was...
- Forget it.

528
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,869
I actually wrote a ton
of mean comments...

529
00:41:11,909 --> 00:41:15,139
on the articles about your being an
abusive boss, so let's call it even.

530
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,880
No, that's actually not enough.

531
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,250
How about you buy me
a cup of coffee?

532
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,590
Coffee?

533
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,889
I have to get going now, though.

534
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,159
You're in trouble.

535
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,000
You won't be able
to run away this time.

536
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,909
And here's a cup of coffee.

537
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:18,769
That's for someone else.

538
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:23,980
I'm sorry. I already had a sip.

539
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:26,349
I was going to give it to Ro Woon.

540
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:29,179
- I'll visit you at work soon.
- What?

541
00:42:29,619 --> 00:42:31,719
I want to talk to you about doing
PR work for the new exhibition.

542
00:42:31,989 --> 00:42:35,820
You won't stand me up if I'm
meeting you as your client, right?

543
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:39,130
About three years ago...

544
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,230
I had a bit of a situation.

545
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,730
I know. It was probably something
you couldn't tell me.

546
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,409
Otherwise, you would've told me
the reason three years ago.

547
00:42:52,909 --> 00:42:54,710
But I'm serious about the work.

548
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,809
I was actually on the lookout
for a PR agency.

549
00:42:57,309 --> 00:42:58,480
Help me out.

550
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:00,179
All right, then.

551
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:04,190
I'm going to boss you around.
Brace yourself.

552
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:28,239
Is it still the red light?

553
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,650
I wanted to be
by her side like this...

554
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:19,760
for just a little longer.

555
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:06,000
Would it be okay for me to stay
by her side if I keep this distance?

556
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:11,739
("Don't Forget Me")

557
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:21,449
You didn't meet him at the theater?

558
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:28,090
He said he was headed there
as he was leaving yesterday.

559
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,690
Did something else pop up?

560
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:32,860
I guess he met
another girl or something.

561
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:48,010
He's been smirking too.
He seems to be in a good mood today.

562
00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:52,849
Then...

563
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,849
is it the green light today, Boss?

564
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:59,690
If that's the case, do you mind
taking a look at my proposal?

565
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,190
To get on with the trend,

566
00:47:01,389 --> 00:47:04,489
I thought we could use "virtual
reality cinema" as our theme.

567
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:06,599
Yes, I've read your proposal.

568
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:08,900
But...

569
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:13,340
It'd be different for games,
but there isn't enough content.

570
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:15,000
The trend isn't there yet.

571
00:47:15,769 --> 00:47:16,940
He's right.

572
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,539
Sun Bong,
you're being cynical again.

573
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:21,639
Also,

574
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,880
prolonged use of VR headsets...

575
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:27,550
can induce motion sickness or
headaches. How will you tackle that?

576
00:47:27,579 --> 00:47:30,320
What will you do if people complain
about blurred vision or eye fatigue?

577
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:33,090
Do you have a plan for how you will
deal with such problems?

578
00:47:34,289 --> 00:47:36,590
Those are issues
that we can't overlook.

579
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:39,360
Sun Bong, do you have an idea then?

580
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,199
Something unique that can appeal
to the target group.

581
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:45,230
- No, I don't.
- See?

582
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:46,469
What is wrong with you?

583
00:47:46,769 --> 00:47:49,400
You have no clue either.

584
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:52,409
Boss, please let us know
what you think.

585
00:47:57,679 --> 00:47:59,579
I need some time to think.

586
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:03,489
We need to act fast so that we can
become the first one in Korea.

587
00:48:03,789 --> 00:48:05,489
Yes, I know that. But...

588
00:48:11,329 --> 00:48:13,460
The best, the biggest,
and the first.

589
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,730
I must say Korean people
can be so lame.

590
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,070
The just love those superlatives.

591
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:20,739
They think that's what
PR work is all about.

592
00:48:20,769 --> 00:48:21,969
How simple-minded.

593
00:48:22,969 --> 00:48:26,280
That was blunt, but he's not wrong.

594
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:29,909
I'll take some time
to think about it.

595
00:48:37,449 --> 00:48:38,989
He loves taking time.

596
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:41,360
I guess
the red light is on again today.

597
00:48:43,429 --> 00:48:45,289
About the signal lights...

598
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:47,960
Don't you think the idea
is a bit too childish?

599
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:50,630
A full-fledged adult is walking
around with colorful stickers.

600
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:52,900
What is that seriously? Is he
a pervert or what? How embarrassing.

601
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:56,369
Plus, he's our leader,

602
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:59,739
yet he communicates with us
only when he wants to.

603
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,579
What kind of nonsense is that?

604
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:04,980
Stop ruining it.

605
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,849
I was going to stop.

606
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:26,199
Gyo Ri.

607
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:28,769
Why are you dolling up?

608
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:31,110
Do you have a date?
I'm sure you don't.

609
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:34,380
- Why don't we go for...
- Gyo Ri.

610
00:49:34,909 --> 00:49:36,550
- Should we go on a date?
- Sorry?

611
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:40,050
- Are you asking me?
- Yes.

612
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:42,780
I'd like to treat you
to a nice dinner.

613
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,349
You look especially pretty today.

614
00:49:49,889 --> 00:49:51,460
(VR Movies)

615
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,760
That's so random.

616
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,329
Just the two of you?

617
00:49:56,599 --> 00:49:58,900
Yes. I have something to tell her
in person.

618
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,900
- Let's go, Gyo Ri.
- Okay.

619
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:04,639
- Let's go.
- Okay.

620
00:50:05,269 --> 00:50:06,340
Let's go.

621
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,639
Let's go.

622
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:11,880
What do you want to eat?

623
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,719
Anything is fine.

624
00:50:14,849 --> 00:50:16,119
What about steaks?

625
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,389
Yoo Hee, why don't we have
some spicy food and soju?

626
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:25,260
I need to go home and feed my kids.

627
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,099
Your sons will leave you
for other girls after all.

628
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,400
Live your life.

629
00:50:30,429 --> 00:50:34,000
Stop observing
and laughing at others.

630
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,170
Live your life, okay?

631
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:51,389
My goodness. Do you still have
hope for the VR cinema?

632
00:50:51,889 --> 00:50:54,119
I can give you some advice
if you buy me dinner.

633
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,420
I'm okay.

634
00:50:55,719 --> 00:51:00,199
I have to do some more research
on VR theaters.

635
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:02,900
I'll get going.

636
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,099
- Wait.
- Sorry.

637
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,769
I'm leaving.

638
00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:13,539
Why does it feel like
there's someone behind me?

639
00:51:31,929 --> 00:51:34,159
He seems to need someone
to have dinner with.

640
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:36,360
Should I ask him
if he wants to eat with me?

641
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:40,739
But if it's just the two of us,
he'll feel uncomfortable.

642
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,769
As I'm his boss,
he won't be able to say no.

643
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:46,639
Should I turn on the green light?

644
00:51:47,179 --> 00:51:50,050
It means I'm ready to go along
with him as long as he wants.

645
00:51:50,949 --> 00:51:53,679
But Mr. Um said
the signal light thing is childish.

646
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:55,050
He has a point.

647
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,989
It's embarrassing for a grown-up
to put colorful stickers on himself.

648
00:51:59,019 --> 00:52:00,090
(Embarrassed)

649
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:03,860
But sometimes,
childish gestures break the ice.

650
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:07,130
Ms. Chae made these for me.
I should pluck up the courage.

651
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,349
Mr. Um?

652
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:28,250
Mr. Um.

653
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,719
Mr. Um.

654
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,460
How can he never buy me any meal?

655
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:41,800
We had a shared destiny once.

656
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,199
Everything's pointless.

657
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:47,699
Gosh, it's hot.

658
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,909
What a waste.

659
00:52:57,949 --> 00:53:00,019
VR movies surpass the boundary...

660
00:53:00,449 --> 00:53:03,219
between imagination and the reality
and the limits of space.

661
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:07,659
VR movies will set a new paradigm...

662
00:53:07,719 --> 00:53:09,559
in the 120-year-long history
of movies.

663
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:10,730
Oh, my.

664
00:53:10,929 --> 00:53:13,800
We're taking the innovative step
into the new world...

665
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,869
before anyone else in the country.

666
00:53:17,329 --> 00:53:20,070
I'm co-CEO of Brain, Kang Woo Il.
Thank you.

667
00:53:27,139 --> 00:53:28,239
Oh, my.

668
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:34,880
I knew it.

669
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:38,250
We won't be the first ones anymore.

670
00:53:39,019 --> 00:53:41,920
You said it was lame
to strive for superlatives.

671
00:53:44,059 --> 00:53:47,000
The upper management needs to
make quick decisions...

672
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:48,559
for things to move forward.

673
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:52,369
We're spending forever
to just wait for the approval.

674
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,699
The power struggle between the son
and the son-in-law. Round one.

675
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:58,139
- Mr. Kang won.
- Yes.

676
00:53:58,309 --> 00:54:00,639
Ro Woon, your idea was great.

677
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,809
You worked so hard.
You must be disappointed.

678
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:05,949
Thank you.

679
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,389
Thank you.

680
00:54:11,489 --> 00:54:14,789
I'm sure Boss has an idea.

681
00:54:15,289 --> 00:54:17,289
I'm sure he has another plan.

682
00:54:18,489 --> 00:54:20,659
You have no idea?

683
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:23,130
You've been thinking all this time.

684
00:54:24,329 --> 00:54:28,000
I thought you turned on the red
light because you were thinking.

685
00:54:28,969 --> 00:54:31,340
Let's think together from now on.

686
00:54:55,929 --> 00:54:58,530
It's creepy here.
I'm scared ghosts will appear.

687
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:00,840
It's very old-fashioned.

688
00:55:00,869 --> 00:55:02,769
It smells funny.

689
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:12,980
My bottom and back will
start to ache.

690
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:16,320
The seats are too close
to each other.

691
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:17,889
I like it.

692
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:21,389
I can sit close to my baby.

693
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:27,760
This way. It's here.

694
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,070
Since when are they so close?

695
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:32,900
The rich boy is playing around,

696
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,840
and an innocent girl fell for it.

697
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,349
What happened?

698
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:49,320
Are you two really dating?

699
00:55:50,219 --> 00:55:51,949
The thing is...

700
00:55:53,889 --> 00:55:56,019
He wants us to pretend
to be together.

701
00:55:56,059 --> 00:55:57,559
Sorry?

702
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:01,329
He wants you to feel jealous.

703
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:04,730
He wants to show you
how he can make a girl happy...

704
00:56:04,969 --> 00:56:08,869
and how nice he can be to a girl.

705
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:17,280
Why don't you tell him how you feel?

706
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,250
Not everyone can be...

707
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:24,650
honest about their feelings
like you are.

708
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:27,960
Everyone says...

709
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:31,289
you should be confident so easily.

710
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:35,699
But that's only possible
when you have someone listening.

711
00:56:37,369 --> 00:56:38,500
I have no one...

712
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:42,269
willing to listen to me.

713
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:45,769
Why do you say that?

714
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:47,639
Can't you just pretend not to know?

715
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,780
Se Jong is trying to make me happy.

716
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:55,150
Who else would be...

717
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:57,619
so nice to me?

718
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:03,889
Gyo Ri.

719
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:12,500
Without a theme
as unique as VR movies,

720
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,469
it'd be hard to attract customers.

721
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:18,139
Exactly. What a shame we missed it.

722
00:57:18,469 --> 00:57:20,809
It would have attracted attention
as it's a new thing.

723
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:26,880
Among the cheesy superlatives,

724
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,250
we've lost the best, the first,
and the biggest.

725
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:34,789
But there's one perfect word left.

726
00:57:35,559 --> 00:57:36,619
What is it?

727
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,860
The worst.

728
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:43,400
- What's wrong with you?
- My gosh.

729
00:57:44,429 --> 00:57:47,769
It's not the biggest in Korea, and
the service isn't the best either,

730
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,139
so let's come up with something
buzzworthy to make it memorable.

731
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:53,940
There's no need to waste money
on renovations.

732
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:00,349
How about a horror movie theater?

733
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:03,050
"Visit the worst movie theater..."

734
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:07,719
"for an unforgettable night of
horror that gives you the chills."

735
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,260
- Horror movies?
- "Coming soon." Ta-da.

736
00:58:10,289 --> 00:58:11,289
That sounds good.

737
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:15,059
- Pardon?
- Sorry?

738
00:58:16,929 --> 00:58:18,099
I like that idea.

739
00:58:19,469 --> 00:58:22,369
Let's go with Sun Bong's idea.

740
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:24,869
What idea?
You mean what I just said?

741
00:58:25,809 --> 00:58:29,239
Gosh, I wasn't serious about it.
I was just being sarcastic.

742
00:58:30,579 --> 00:58:34,780
It's a great idea that twists
conventional strategies.

743
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:38,750
- Goodness, I was just joking.
- He just said it to make us laugh.

744
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:40,420
We can't use that idea.

745
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:42,659
To make us laugh...
Yes, it was funny.

746
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:46,860
Mr. Um, you have great wits
and an outstanding sense of humor.

747
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,760
Me? I do?

748
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:52,000
Gosh, what was that about?
Does that mean...

749
00:58:52,099 --> 00:58:54,469
he's taking what Sun Bong said
seriously?

750
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,800
My gosh.

751
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,639
I'm flustered.

752
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:00,139
Sun Bong, tell us again.
What did you say?

753
00:59:00,679 --> 00:59:03,949
The green light is finally on.

754
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:29,039
I've come up with an idea
for the promotional slogan.

755
00:59:29,869 --> 00:59:31,369
I thought that women...

756
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:35,309
would hate to have dates at a place
known as the worst theater.

757
00:59:36,409 --> 00:59:40,110
How about we say the chairs will
help them test their boyfriends'...

758
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:41,349
back strength?

759
00:59:41,949 --> 00:59:43,619
I see. Right.

760
00:59:43,849 --> 00:59:46,960
We do need to appeal
to female consumers.

761
00:59:47,159 --> 00:59:48,320
I like the idea.

762
00:59:48,389 --> 00:59:52,590
Great. There's this one too.

763
00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:54,929
You know those man-spreaders, right?

764
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,670
The chairs will teach them manners
by making them close their legs.

765
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,340
He smiled.

766
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:07,239
There's another one.

767
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:11,150
- There's another version.
- Is there?

768
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:13,679
As you know, we'll market it
as the worst theater...

769
01:00:16,219 --> 01:00:17,719
Everyone says...

770
01:00:18,889 --> 01:00:22,059
you should be confident so easily.

771
01:00:23,789 --> 01:00:27,000
But that's only possible
when you have someone listening.

772
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:36,539
What has gotten into him?

773
01:00:51,449 --> 01:00:53,019
What is wrong with him?

774
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:55,590
He hasn't even budged from his desk
for hours.

775
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:57,289
He looks so cool now.

776
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:05,730
You got this.

777
01:01:06,469 --> 01:01:10,469
Boss was a good listener.

778
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:13,940
The worst movie theater
in the world.

779
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:19,679
It'll be sure to disappoint you
more than you can ever imagine.

780
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:22,150
You're welcome to kick
the seat in front of you.

781
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,719
You can certainly leave
your phone on the whole time.

782
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:26,949
You may drink and dance away
inside the theater.

783
01:01:27,019 --> 01:01:30,119
If an ugly monster
shows up on the screen,

784
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:32,329
you can go ahead
and throw your popcorn at it.

785
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:34,760
- That's hilarious.
- You're doing a good job!

786
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,429
Ladies and gentlemen, until when...

787
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:41,469
do we have to live according
to the society's rigid standards?

788
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:44,369
Forget the biggest, the best,
and the first.

789
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:46,840
The worst day ever
can also be enjoyable.

790
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,110
- That's right.
- Good!

791
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,349
William Shakespeare said this.

792
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:55,880
"The worst is not so long as
we can say this is the worst."

793
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,550
The truly worst moment...

794
01:01:57,619 --> 01:02:01,360
is when we don't even have
strength to say so.

795
01:02:02,059 --> 01:02:04,690
We still have the energy to overcome
what we think is the worst.

796
01:02:04,829 --> 01:02:07,900
You, you, and you!

797
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:12,300
Please get the most out
of the worst experience.

798
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:16,469
The worst horror movie theater
in the entire world.

799
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:19,969
The real horror starts now!

800
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:21,809
You did it!

801
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:23,510
- Amazing!
- That was awesome!

802
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:25,550
- You did it.
- You did such a good job.

803
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:28,150
The reason why
he has always been so quiet...

804
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:29,780
- Don't cry!
- Don't cry!

805
01:02:31,989 --> 01:02:33,989
It wasn't because
he didn't want to talk.

806
01:02:34,590 --> 01:02:36,889
He probably wanted to listen.

807
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,349
What was that about?

808
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:03,019
- Just a high five.
- High five?

809
01:03:03,889 --> 01:03:05,320
- On my back?
- Give me five, then.

810
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:08,420
See?
This is why I did it on your back.

811
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:14,000
Help me organize this.

812
01:03:38,489 --> 01:03:40,019
In 1, 2, and 3.

813
01:03:51,769 --> 01:03:52,869
Look at the camera.

814
01:04:07,579 --> 01:04:08,619
My goodness.

815
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:11,349
I hope you're not here
to steal our idea again.

816
01:04:13,690 --> 01:04:16,320
- What are you talking about?
- The VR cinema.

817
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:18,590
We came up with that idea
a long time ago,

818
01:04:19,159 --> 01:04:21,699
but Boss took his sweet time
and ended up not approving it!

819
01:04:22,199 --> 01:04:25,030
There isn't much content
for VR cinemas yet,

820
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:27,599
so a single-screen theater like this
won't be able to maintain business.

821
01:04:28,369 --> 01:04:30,300
Hwan Gi made the right decision.

822
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,010
Work probably isn't his priority now
because of Ro Woon.

823
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:38,380
- What did you just say?
- He's turned into a romantic.

824
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:41,079
I guess you didn't know
he's been flirting with Ro Woon.

825
01:04:51,789 --> 01:04:53,329
Do you have anything to say to me?

826
01:04:54,159 --> 01:04:55,429
Just finish it up quickly.

827
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:01,239
"My gosh, you're really good."

828
01:05:01,969 --> 01:05:03,840
"Where did you learn
how to do this?"

829
01:05:03,869 --> 01:05:06,610
"Thanks for helping us
reduce the expenses."

830
01:05:07,239 --> 01:05:11,110
Just for your information, those are
what others said to me.

831
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:14,280
Don't put too much blood on me.

832
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:16,579
I don't want to scare people.

833
01:05:17,989 --> 01:05:22,420
Your black hoodie is already
scaring everyone enough.

834
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:25,860
I want to see myself in the mirror.
You're making me anxious.

835
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:28,059
- Hand me a mirror.
- Please close your eyes.

836
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:29,730
I need to do the eye makeup now.

837
01:05:31,699 --> 01:05:32,730
Goodness.

838
01:05:33,769 --> 01:05:34,800
I'll use this color.

839
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:49,119
Oh, gosh...

840
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:53,320
Please close your eyes. I need
to put this over your eyelids.

841
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:05,869
What's up with you? I can't believe
you took that off yourself.

842
01:06:32,659 --> 01:06:33,829
What is with you?

843
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,960
You're not avoiding eye contact.

844
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:39,099
I am avoiding it.

845
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,400
Are you...

846
01:06:45,469 --> 01:06:47,269
not going to close your eyes?

847
01:06:48,039 --> 01:06:49,440
I'm doing my very best...

848
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:52,010
to avoid it.

849
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:06,960
Is this...

850
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:11,800
a staring match or what?

851
01:07:13,769 --> 01:07:15,639
Are we doing this because...

852
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:20,110
turning away or closing eyes first
means losing?

853
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:24,480
Close your eyes, please.

854
01:07:26,179 --> 01:07:28,550
What will you do
if I poke your eyes?

855
01:08:55,470 --> 01:08:58,170
(My Shy Boss)

856
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:00,270
- Boss.
- Don't stay by my side.

857
01:09:00,310 --> 01:09:01,609
You thanked me...

858
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,279
- for being by your side.
- Just a second!

859
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:04,750
Did I do something wrong?

860
01:09:04,779 --> 01:09:07,380
- One of my employees bothers me.
- One, two.

861
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:09,020
- One, two.
- Bring it back.

862
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:11,090
- Run, run.
- It's not Chae Ro Woon.

863
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:13,420
- She's gone.
- Boss?

864
01:09:13,689 --> 01:09:15,060
Ms. Chae.

865
01:09:15,090 --> 01:09:17,529
- Either bring her back,
- The red light?

866
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:19,659
- Ms. Chae?
- or don't show it.

867
01:09:19,689 --> 01:09:22,130
- Yi Soo needs you now.
- What are you doing now?

868
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:24,729
- Get lost.
- Excuse me.

869
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:27,170
Will you really be able
to do the presentation?

870
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:28,800
- I will.
- Not the presentation.

871
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:30,369
- You won't be able to do it.
- What if I do it?

872
01:09:30,569 --> 01:09:31,939
I want Ro Woon back.
