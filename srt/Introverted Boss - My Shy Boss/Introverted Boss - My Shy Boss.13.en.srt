1
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,420
I've always thought,

2
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:46,950
without him, I can't exist.

3
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,320
Don't do this.

4
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:52,090
- It was just a mistake.
- Woo Il...

5
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,960
wouldn't make such a mistake.

6
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:04,069
It means...

7
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,609
It means...

8
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,140
It means...

9
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:21,590
Stay away!

10
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,129
I'm going to hate you.

11
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:30,760
I can't hate Woo Il.

12
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,430
Whatever he did,
I can never give up on him!

13
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,140
If you're really sorry,

14
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,670
don't pretend to be so innocent
and just disappear.

15
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,609
Please.

16
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:10,199
You look so pale.

17
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,870
I'm sorry,

18
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,370
but let's see the exhibition
some other time.

19
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,310
Sure. No problem.

20
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,610
I think you should see a doctor.

21
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,699
Oh, Mr. Kang.

22
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,469
Boss is taking Yi Soo to a doctor.

23
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:44,639
She looked so pale.

24
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:50,039
Right. Yi Soo invited me
to your wedding.

25
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,280
I'd like to do something...

26
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,449
Is he embarrassed?

27
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:07,560
Ro Woon, you're here.

28
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,500
Hi, Yun Jung. Well,

29
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,199
I think I'll have to see
the exhibition by myself.

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,300
Was Hwan Gi here just to see me?

31
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:24,310
No way. I don't think so.

32
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,110
He'll keep standing you up for me.

33
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,479
Enjoy the exhibition and cheer up.

34
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,080
Paintings calm you down.

35
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:33,050
I'll show you around.

36
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,400
When you talked about
Ms. Chae's family,

37
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,310
did you mean...

38
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,879
Chae Ro Woon?

39
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,650
That's right.

40
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,419
She's Ms. Chae's little sister.

41
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,860
Can you stop the car?

42
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,250
Are you okay?

43
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,050
Chae Ro Woon.

44
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:48,459
Are you aware that
she once stirred up Woo Il?

45
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,699
Do you know why
I pretended I had no idea?

46
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:57,100
I was so scared I'd lose Woo Il.

47
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,170
I did my best to hide that I know.

48
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:06,480
I didn't want the same thing
to happen again.

49
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,810
And she's her little sister?

50
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,850
What a strange coincidence.

51
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:21,730
Could she have been aware?

52
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,259
Could she have tried to take Woo Il
from me on purpose?

53
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,670
She has no idea.

54
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,439
Also, Woo Il was swayed
only for a short while.

55
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,339
Wait.

56
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:37,709
You knew about it too?

57
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,750
Then why did you have to...

58
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:46,379
What does Ro Woon mean to you?
What is she?

59
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:49,350
Why do you have to
put me in a corner like this?

60
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,620
Tell me!

61
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,589
Do you love her or something?

62
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,759
Are you stupid?

63
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,829
You two can't be together anyway.

64
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,370
You probably want to
reveal everything for her.

65
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,810
But once everything's revealed,
you won't be able to be with her.

66
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,579
So you give up.

67
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,819
I'm sorry, but please give up.

68
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,589
Gosh.

69
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,319
What is this?

70
00:06:57,819 --> 00:06:59,819
It was supposed to be
our first date.

71
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,829
He chose his sister over me.

72
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:08,329
He's getting late
without saying anything.

73
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:10,569
Wait.

74
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,269
I can't let him gain the upper hand
already.

75
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,480
I'm not going to call him first.

76
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:21,149
I'm never going to call him
before he calls me.

77
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:45,939
No.

78
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,370
I won't.

79
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,060
(Chae Ro Woon)

80
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:09,560
Where are you?

81
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,600
Did something happen?

82
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,370
I won't try anything.

83
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,399
I'm scared to be here all alone.

84
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:24,079
Why aren't you leaving?

85
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,310
I'll wait until Mother comes.

86
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,950
Are you scared I might
do something...

87
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,450
if you leave me alone?

88
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:33,580
Are you stupid?

89
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,909
You two can't be together anyway.

90
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:58,600
(Episode 13: Confession)

91
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:06,879
What am I going to do?

92
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,480
What is it? What's the problem?

93
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,490
You were able to get a hard-to-reach
artist to come on board,

94
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,049
and our client signed off on it.

95
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,659
I did. It was great until then.

96
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:24,759
The problem comes after that.

97
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,740
Have some coffee,
and we'll talk it out.

98
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:34,440
Latte or americano?

99
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,009
Thank you. Latte.

100
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:39,940
No, americano. No, latte? Americano?

101
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,750
This is exactly the situation
I'm in right now.

102
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:47,419
I'm stuck in between,
and I don't know what to do.

103
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:01,629
Your work is convoluted.

104
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:04,700
Some are worried it'll be hard
to appeal to the public.

105
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,210
Don't worry too much.

106
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:12,110
I've done
a lot of commercial projects.

107
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,379
By the way,

108
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:22,490
isn't the purpose of this project
to bring the arts together?

109
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,659
Our company's purpose
is to sell the product.

110
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,289
That's what makes money.

111
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,159
- Right, Gyo Ri?
- Well...

112
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,000
That's not...

113
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,070
It's too convoluted.

114
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:40,700
Gosh. What is all this?

115
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,610
I don't like it.

116
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,840
Ask her to make it prettier.

117
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,779
Pretty? Pretty how?

118
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:52,879
If you can be more specific,

119
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:55,389
it'll be easier for us to work.

120
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,759
What I mean is,

121
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,789
make it pretty.

122
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,990
Pretty in what way?

123
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:06,360
Gosh, look at the way he talks.

124
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,970
I can understand both sides,

125
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:13,940
but that drives me even crazier.

126
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:16,539
I can't take a side.

127
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,879
Then...

128
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:21,149
just drink both.

129
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:23,149
- What?
- I'll just make myself another one.

130
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,679
Really? Thank you.

131
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,500
They're both good.

132
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:44,269
See? I told you it wouldn't be easy.

133
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,470
Gosh.

134
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,110
Where is the person
that suggested this idea?

135
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,409
I'm right over here.

136
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,179
Gosh, welcome.

137
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,789
I'm sure he's still good
at talking to people freely.

138
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,120
The thing is,

139
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,960
I talked too freely
and said what I wanted.

140
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,490
Both sides hate me now.

141
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,860
That's why I have to go
to all the meetings alone.

142
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:16,269
I'm afraid this project
will get dropped.

143
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:18,070
We can't let that happen.

144
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,370
I'll meet with both sides
and help mediate.

145
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,279
Really? Thank you so much.

146
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:26,409
No.

147
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,809
I'd like you to be responsible
for what you're assigned to.

148
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,389
But they don't have
enough experience yet.

149
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:38,289
It'll be a good chance
for them to build up experience.

150
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:46,200
Yes, Boss. I mean, Hwan Gi.

151
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,580
My goodness.
She didn't change anything at all.

152
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,279
Not only will this lower
our product's value,

153
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,980
there's hardly any artistic value.

154
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:10,720
Just look at it.
Would you want to buy these?

155
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,230
Do you want to wear it
if your boyfriend buys it for you?

156
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,200
It sure is a bit unique.

157
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,629
Gosh.

158
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,139
It's empty.

159
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,639
I'll buy you another one. Hold on.

160
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,419
At least I can talk to you...

161
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:40,250
unlike your colleague.

162
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,090
Really? I'm glad.

163
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,490
- Gosh.
- My goodness, it's raining.

164
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:49,090
I left my car at the office.

165
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:51,029
I'll quickly go buy an umbrella.

166
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,529
Why are you here?

167
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,169
It was getting late,

168
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,570
and I heard
there will be a sudden shower.

169
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:01,870
Who is he?

170
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:05,210
- He's our...
- We don't have titles at work.

171
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,909
For now,
I'm playing the role of a driver.

172
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,649
Pardon?

173
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,779
Let's go.

174
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,759
Gosh, you didn't have to.

175
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,000
No. Gyo Ri.

176
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,639
Pardon? Me?

177
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:32,769
It's not for me?

178
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,509
You can take this with you.

179
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,009
You're just giving me an umbrella?

180
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:40,840
Do you need help hailing a taxi?

181
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,450
No, our office is right here.

182
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:46,779
Then please take care.

183
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,889
- Get in.
- But...

184
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,019
Go on.

185
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:53,620
What?

186
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:16,210
What is this? It feels so strange.

187
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:20,750
Gosh.

188
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,919
Is it all right to do this?

189
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:27,490
Shouldn't we take care
of our client?

190
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:30,490
I thought your meeting was finished.

191
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:32,559
Yes, but...

192
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:35,700
I don't deserve this treatment.

193
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,840
You were meeting him on behalf of
Silent Monster.

194
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,710
You played the role of a CEO, so you
deserve to be treated like one.

195
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,879
No, not at all.

196
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,509
This is making me uncomfortable.

197
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,450
Could you pull over
so I could come sit at the front?

198
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:57,490
Well, that...

199
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,620
would make me uncomfortable.

200
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:11,140
Why was it that I found you
so difficult before?

201
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,839
It turns out
that you're such a cute person.

202
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,609
I was being too sensitive.

203
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,109
It's because you are able
to feel a lot more than others.

204
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:25,980
I can?

205
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:29,819
That's why you feel more nervous
and sad.

206
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,720
It's difficult on your part,

207
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,359
but being able to sense
what others can't...

208
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,630
is a huge strength.

209
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,869
No one has ever said it like that.

210
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,140
People just tell me that I'm weak.

211
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,380
To catch the feelings of others
that most people don't notice...

212
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,380
It's something only you can do.

213
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:02,690
Boss... I mean, Hwan Gi.
You're better at it than I am.

214
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,289
By the way, how much longer...

215
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,130
are you going to call me
that way?

216
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,559
Pardon?

217
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:19,440
I'll make it short from now on,

218
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:21,140
Hwan Gi.

219
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:24,309
Good.

220
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:26,880
Yes, Hwan Gi.

221
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,750
Make it pretty?

222
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:36,319
If you're looking for commercial
value, you have the wrong person.

223
00:18:36,819 --> 00:18:38,519
Like I said last time,

224
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,960
aren't we trying to bring
different arts together?

225
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,829
Of course. The arts.

226
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:48,730
Your designs already have
enough artistic value.

227
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,039
But the thing is...

228
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,240
Gosh.

229
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:00,109
If you keep this up,
I'll have to cut down the budget.

230
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,250
I completely agree.

231
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:06,349
The company's main purpose
is to sell the product.

232
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,650
But the thing is...

233
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,660
Unique designs are
what's popular these days.

234
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:19,529
Everyone has desire to own
something others don't.

235
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,829
Don't you also want to give
your girlfriend...

236
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,640
something pretty and unique
as a gift?

237
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:29,740
- A little.
- Right?

238
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:42,289
Gyo Ri, Gyo Ri. Did you really
manage to persuade both sides?

239
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,990
What did you tell them?

240
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:48,730
I didn't say much.
I mainly just listened.

241
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:51,430
You told me you were struggling
to find a middle ground.

242
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,930
I'm impressed, Gyo Ri.

243
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,730
Gosh, I didn't do it by myself.

244
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,400
I actually owe it all to Hwan Gi.

245
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:17,619
Where are you going now?

246
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,289
I heard you gave Gyo Ri
a ride home last night.

247
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,630
Whom are you going
to spend time with tonight?

248
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:31,670
I feel as though I have a boyfriend
who's cheating on me.

249
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,470
I told you to go home.

250
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:43,009
Are you meeting up
with Yun Jung by any chance?

251
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,059
It looks like he is.

252
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,470
Smile.

253
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,180
Why do you want
to take photos suddenly?

254
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,109
We look sweet in them.

255
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:17,680
I'll send this one to Ro Woon
and brag about it.

256
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:19,549
Gosh, stop fooling around.

257
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:21,849
I'm not. I'm just pretending.

258
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,160
You might collapse to the ground if
I cling onto you and burden you too.

259
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,269
Just come to me if you find
all of this too stressful, Hwan Gi.

260
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:38,640
Yun Jung,

261
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:42,869
- I...
- Why do we keep missing each other?

262
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,839
Frankly, I'm upset as well.

263
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,740
But...

264
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:49,079
I'm thinking this is
how it's meant to be.

265
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,250
I can listen to you now.

266
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,180
I'm grateful.

267
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:56,849
I should thank you.

268
00:21:57,819 --> 00:22:01,359
You listened to the things that
I haven't been able to tell anyone.

269
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,730
If we had actually gone out
when we were younger...

270
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:07,259
and ended up hurting each other
because we didn't know any better,

271
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:10,500
we wouldn't have been able to
have deep conversations like this.

272
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:12,740
- Don't you think so?
- That's true.

273
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:18,309
- Let's continue to be friends...
- No, what I'm saying is...

274
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:22,950
you shouldn't draw a line because
you never know what can happen.

275
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,819
I'll leave you alone
if I don't think it'll go anywhere.

276
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,490
I obviously have that much tact.

277
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,990
The same goes for Ro Woon.

278
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,859
You may not have much time left
to spend with her.

279
00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:44,569
Stay with her while you can.

280
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:46,170
Do it for her when you can.

281
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:05,690
(Yun Jung)

282
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,319
I'm out on a date with Hwan Gi.

283
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,059
It looks like I beat you today.

284
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:12,400
Gosh, seriously.

285
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,200
Is she my enemy or ally?

286
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,440
I honestly can't figure her out.

287
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,549
The

288
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:41,589
The day when white snow
becomes happiness

289
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:49,269
The day when white snow
becomes sadness

290
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:55,009
White snowflakes fall down

291
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:57,509
Like flower petals

292
00:23:57,609 --> 00:24:02,680
And bless our love

293
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,069
I thought you were completely
clueless and inexperienced...

294
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,799
when it comes to dating.

295
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,339
I'm surprised.

296
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,869
You're still here?

297
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:37,309
No, I take it back.
You are completely clueless.

298
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,849
You had wine with a gorgeous girl
like Yun Jung...

299
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,250
and came back here alone.

300
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,190
Why are you holding the guitar?
Can you play it?

301
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,759
Well... Yes, a little.

302
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,230
What about you?

303
00:24:58,769 --> 00:24:59,839
Give it to me.

304
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:30,099
Chubby piglets

305
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:35,970
Want some milk, oink, oink, oink

306
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:41,750
- The mommy pig says
- What's...

307
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:44,450
- What is this song?
- Okay

308
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,450
They want some milk,
oink, oink, oink

309
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:49,019
What is this song?

310
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:51,349
This song? Don't you like it?

311
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:54,019
I sang it for you.

312
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:56,289
Are you saying I'm a piglet?

313
00:25:56,329 --> 00:25:57,359
Yes.

314
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,299
Gosh, give it to me.

315
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,970
I'm not a piglet.

316
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:03,869
I was just kidding.

317
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,970
Gosh, your fingers are so chubby.

318
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:08,309
- They aren't.
- I'm sorry.

319
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:14,410
- All right. I'll play something.
- Okay.

320
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:17,309
I'm not that good though.

321
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:25,819
I want my hot lips

322
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:31,859
To touch your soft lips

323
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,329
So that my love can be

324
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:41,369
Delivered to your heart

325
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:48,950
If you still don't know

326
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:54,380
How I feel about you

327
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:01,059
More than anyone else in the world

328
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,559
I will love you

329
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:11,769
I will love you always

330
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,599
I will love you

331
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,039
Just like how I love you now

332
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,950
More than anyone else in the world

333
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:32,119
I will love you

334
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,480
You weren't supposed
to see this, Mr. Kang.

335
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:00,579
To tell you the truth,

336
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:04,589
I've been practicing this song
to sing it at your wedding.

337
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:24,170
Are you going out again?

338
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,980
Boss has gotten so popular.

339
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:34,650
He used to be antisocial and lonely.

340
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:36,950
That's strange.

341
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,089
(Image-making Strategy
for the Mayor Election)

342
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,980
If I had chosen...

343
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,450
Ji Hye over Yi Soo three years ago,

344
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:14,190
you would have disowned me, right?

345
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:19,799
Part of the reason why I couldn't
choose Ji Hye was you.

346
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,730
And you're choosing
Ro Woon over me?

347
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:27,369
You don't have to take
responsibility for everything alone.

348
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:30,039
Like I said, I'll do it with you.

349
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,440
Whatever result it brings,

350
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:37,180
I'll be with you.

351
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,380
As long as you decide to come clean.

352
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:48,960
How much...

353
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:53,200
does Yi Soo know?

354
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:54,960
Everything.

355
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:02,440
Yi Soo is...

356
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,740
hiding something from you too.

357
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,150
- What is it?
- Ask Yi Soo instead.

358
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,519
I covered up everything for you,
but you should open the door.

359
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,849
Both Yi Soo and you should.

360
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,089
Are you telling me
to confess what I did?

361
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:25,599
In any case, I won't ask you
to stay with Yi Soo anymore.

362
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:28,400
I shouldn't have done that.

363
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:34,000
I wrongly believed I could
protect Yi Soo and you that way.

364
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,039
I'm so sorry.

365
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,279
You don't have to feel
guilty about staying with her.

366
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,250
I don't deserve Yi Soo.

367
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:49,519
I'm not sure
what she's hiding from me,

368
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,559
but I'm sure it's not
as disgusting as my secret.

369
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,190
She was aware that I betrayed her.

370
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,430
She even knew that you took
the blame for what I did.

371
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:09,410
Still, she was smiling
in front of me.

372
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:13,680
It's like her.

373
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,319
You've suffered enough.

374
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:31,460
Let go of everything now, will you?

375
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:20,180
Gosh, this is so annoying.

376
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,980
When did you get here?

377
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,349
My pencils.

378
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,089
- What happened?
- Well...

379
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,559
I needed to calm myself down.

380
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:35,660
I thought I'd try your way.

381
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,960
It's only making me feel worse.

382
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,869
Just use a pencil sharpener.
Give it to me.

383
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,069
Wait.

384
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:47,170
Can you show me how you do it?

385
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,380
It keeps ending up this way.

386
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:58,779
Adjust the angle
between the cutter and the pencil.

387
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,720
Push the cutter softly.

388
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,119
Like this?

389
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,049
No, not like that.

390
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:08,019
Hold the cutter near its end
and relax your body.

391
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,329
Don't use too much force.
Push it softly.

392
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:12,230
Like this.

393
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:15,230
I'll relax my body and try again.

394
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,569
- Like this?
- No.

395
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:23,069
Gosh.

396
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,119
Push it softly like this.

397
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:45,859
By the way, when did you
come so close to me?

398
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,039
I don't think this will work.

399
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:03,480
To calm ourselves while maintaining
the distance between us,

400
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,779
there's only one way.

401
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,320
What do you mean?

402
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,750
There's this thing.

403
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:14,920
Yes! Let's see.

404
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:18,130
I'm done.

405
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,559
It's 3 points plus 8.

406
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,030
- One go.
- One go?

407
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,130
One go.

408
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,210
Are you done?

409
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,880
I hope you'll get a kiss
even though I can't.

410
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,650
Here we go.

411
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:53,000
Yes! Again!

412
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:55,869
Are you cheating?

413
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,000
- Put it down.
- We're not done yet.

414
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,539
I have some cards left.

415
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,250
- It's all ruined.
- That's a shame.

416
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,250
That was so close.

417
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:14,650
Here it is.

418
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,820
Yes!

419
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:21,920
I win.

420
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,159
Now you should grant me a wish.

421
00:35:24,929 --> 00:35:28,500
Like I said, you can't take off
my clothes or touch me.

422
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:31,800
Don't ask me for anything that
goes against common sense.

423
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,510
There's something I want to see.

424
00:35:38,309 --> 00:35:42,809
The thing you do late at night
all by yourself.

425
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:48,679
The thing I do late at night
all by myself?

426
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,590
I saw it all.

427
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,849
You saw it?

428
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,820
Yes.

429
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:01,429
Here we go! You look cool.

430
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:08,570
Come on.

431
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,320
Come on.

432
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,150
What's that?

433
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,389
Put more effort into it.

434
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,389
Do it like when you're alone.

435
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:35,929
Put some heart in it.

436
00:36:37,969 --> 00:36:40,340
What about a dance battle?

437
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:04,059
- Here we go.
- Let's go.

438
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,420
Gosh, I'm tired.

439
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:37,030
My stomach hurts.

440
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:41,760
My goodness.

441
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:01,349
(Woo Il)

442
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,420
Excuse me.

443
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:09,130
Hey, Woo Il.

444
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,190
I'm getting bridal makeup.

445
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,070
Shouldn't the groom
come get his hair done?

446
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,139
You're already here?

447
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,369
Yi Soo.

448
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,710
Do you want to go somewhere with me?

449
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,550
Where are we going?

450
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,579
I'm not sure. Where should we go?

451
00:39:06,449 --> 00:39:08,119
Do you want to go anywhere?

452
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,389
- What?
- Or is there anything you want?

453
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,590
I want to give you a present.

454
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:18,960
There is only one thing I want.

455
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,500
But it's so expensive,
I don't dare ask.

456
00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:24,869
It's okay.

457
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:29,440
You should think it through.
It's not refundable.

458
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:30,940
Just tell me.

459
00:39:33,309 --> 00:39:34,710
Kang Woo Il's time.

460
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:39,010
It's already expensive,
but it's more expensive to me.

461
00:39:40,449 --> 00:39:42,179
Until the wedding,

462
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:46,219
stay with me and don't go anywhere.

463
00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:49,530
That's all I want.

464
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,670
Look at what's happening.

465
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:01,800
You're kidnapping a bride
on her wedding day.

466
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:05,539
However, the kidnapper is her groom.

467
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:08,079
This is interesting.

468
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,980
I know where I want to go to.

469
00:40:12,949 --> 00:40:14,949
- How about the amusement park?
- Amusement park?

470
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,550
My neighborhood playground?

471
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,659
This isn't the amusement park.

472
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:26,329
Your ribs are still healing.
We have to be careful.

473
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,639
Here.

474
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:40,010
- Aren't you cold?
- This is your free pass.

475
00:40:40,579 --> 00:40:41,739
Wear it tightly.

476
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,780
If you lose it,
you can't go on any rides.

477
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,519
This is the pirate ship.

478
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:51,719
Do you want to sit in the middle
or at the end?

479
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,690
- In the middle.
- Middle? Okay.

480
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,730
Welcome to Woo Il World.

481
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,000
Your ride will start now.

482
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:02,429
You have to imagine
that it's a ship.

483
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,099
Let's sit in the back. Let's try it.

484
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,969
It's too high. It's too high.

485
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:15,079
This is the roller coaster.
Do you think you can ride it?

486
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,050
I don't think you can.

487
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:20,449
It's fun,
but there are no safety equipment.

488
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,119
5, 4, 3...

489
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,300
Gorilla.

490
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,170
You're good.

491
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:42,539
Are you a baboon? A monkey?

492
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:44,869
- No.
- You can do it.

493
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:46,840
Show me an animal.

494
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:48,239
Give me a piggyback.

495
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,880
Come on.

496
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,650
Hold on tight.

497
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:54,449
- What is this?
- What...

498
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:56,050
What animal is that?

499
00:41:56,789 --> 00:41:58,590
- This is the merry-go-round.
- This?

500
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,489
They usually have poles.

501
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:03,530
Hold onto your pole
and go like this.

502
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,829
- It's exactly the same.
- No, it's not like it at all.

503
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:10,329
It really feels like it
if you close your eyes.

504
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,380
What are we doing now?

505
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,119
It's the highlight
of an amusement park date.

506
00:43:07,989 --> 00:43:09,090
The Ferris wheel.

507
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:25,440
Being here with you...

508
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:28,340
feels like we're back
to being kids again.

509
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,349
I miss it.

510
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:44,159
I wish we could go back too.

511
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:48,059
That's why...

512
00:43:50,699 --> 00:43:52,099
I should...

513
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:57,340
stop before it gets too far.

514
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:07,880
Let's go back.
It's time for the wedding.

515
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:12,489
Be careful, Yi Soo.

516
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,539
Stop acting like...

517
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,340
you're all right.

518
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:37,110
You don't have to
tolerate and understand...

519
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:40,949
a coward like me.

520
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,789
You already knew everything.

521
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:53,360
What were you thinking
letting me go on?

522
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:56,570
It wasn't your fault.

523
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:00,570
I did something I cannot turn back.

524
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:02,940
I did wrong to you...

525
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,409
and to her as well.

526
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:08,710
You're right.

527
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:10,880
Like you said,

528
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:14,219
it already happened and
you can't turn it back now.

529
00:45:14,849 --> 00:45:16,219
We should let bygones be bygones.

530
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,789
For the last three years,

531
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,159
that was the excuse I gave myself.

532
00:45:23,989 --> 00:45:25,429
But I've decided to stop.

533
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,469
Go home.

534
00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:32,570
I'll talk to your parents.

535
00:45:34,769 --> 00:45:35,800
Don't.

536
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:38,210
Don't tell them.

537
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,710
Don't say anything.

538
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:45,380
I need you.

539
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,420
How do I look?

540
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,860
It's your sister's wedding tonight.

541
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,000
You don't have to come. Don't come.

542
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:38,130
Pardon? I even practiced a song
to sing for them.

543
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,599
It's a family gathering.

544
00:46:46,809 --> 00:46:47,809
What was that?

545
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:52,110
Is he telling me not to come...

546
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:55,849
because it's a family gathering?

547
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,989
What about the wedding gift I got?

548
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,869
Why is this here?

549
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:52,769
What are you drawing?

550
00:47:55,309 --> 00:47:58,650
Of what someone is always
looking at.

551
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:00,050
Someone?

552
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,119
Did you get a boyfriend?

553
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:08,019
What? No, not at all.

554
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:12,530
It's just someone from work.

555
00:48:17,469 --> 00:48:19,030
Was that Mr. Kang?

556
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,349
Marriage is the most important event
in one's life.

557
00:48:37,449 --> 00:48:39,960
How can this dinner replace
a wedding ceremony?

558
00:48:39,989 --> 00:48:42,519
I absolutely can't approve of this.

559
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,329
Simple, humble weddings
are the trend nowadays.

560
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,099
You approved only because
of your election.

561
00:48:48,329 --> 00:48:51,929
You love vain formalities
as much as I do.

562
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:55,599
- Hey.
- Hey.

563
00:48:57,710 --> 00:48:59,780
Why did you come alone?
Where is Yi Soo?

564
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:02,110
I'm afraid...

565
00:49:03,809 --> 00:49:05,280
that Yi Soo won't be coming.

566
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:10,519
Gosh. See?

567
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:13,219
Woo Il, you must also think
that this is wrong.

568
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:16,389
Yi Soo was trying to be considerate
of you because you have no family,

569
00:49:16,429 --> 00:49:18,889
but marriage
is a once-in-a-lifetime event.

570
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:20,159
That's not why.

571
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:23,800
I can't...

572
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:27,940
marry Yi Soo.

573
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,940
What are you talking about now?

574
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:34,280
I've been fooling the two of you...

575
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,980
with shameful lies over the years.

576
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,050
The secretary who jumped
to her death three years ago...

577
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:45,289
She actually...

578
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:50,460
died because of me.

579
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:55,329
- What?
- What do you mean?

580
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:59,030
Are you saying
it wasn't Hwan Gi's fault?

581
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:03,340
He took the blame to protect me.

582
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:07,039
- What on earth did you do?
- I had...

583
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:11,050
feelings for her.

584
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:15,019
I betrayed Yi Soo and chose her.

585
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:20,460
But I ended up
betraying her as well.

586
00:50:21,659 --> 00:50:24,059
My gosh. I'm speechless.

587
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:26,659
You piece of... How could you...

588
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:33,269
You've kindly given me
many things over the years.

589
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:37,440
I'll give it all up and leave
the company.

590
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:46,110
How could you do this to me?

591
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:51,250
I've given you so much...

592
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:56,989
Thank you for being my family.

593
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:02,030
I tried my best to become someone
who can fit in,

594
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,940
but I don't deserve...

595
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,710
to be your family.

596
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:32,159
Gosh. Hey. Wait.

597
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:36,059
How can he just walk off
after throwing this bomb at us?

598
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,829
Honey, are you going
to let him just walk away like that?

599
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:44,210
Yell at him and teach him a lesson.
Please do something, honey.

600
00:51:44,409 --> 00:51:46,710
Honey! My goodness.

601
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:48,409
I'm completely speechless.

602
00:51:49,949 --> 00:51:51,480
What's Yi Soo going to do now?

603
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:21,340
Ro Woon.

604
00:52:34,389 --> 00:52:35,460
This drawing...

605
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:40,000
It's my sister's drawing, isn't it?

606
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:44,670
I'm...

607
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:47,469
Chae Ji Hye's sister.

608
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,539
I know.

609
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:00,849
- I was on my way to see you...
- What was your relationship?

610
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:06,090
Did you love Ji Hye?

611
00:53:09,929 --> 00:53:12,360
Then why...

612
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:16,199
Why did she...

613
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:23,039
What on earth did you do to her?

614
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,179
I have the exact same necklace.

615
00:53:38,789 --> 00:53:39,889
Do you?

616
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:44,030
It has a special meaning for me.

617
00:53:46,929 --> 00:53:48,099
Let's go.

618
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,570
I want to see
Hwan Gi before we go...

619
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,039
By any chance, is this necklace...

620
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,210
Did you give her this?

621
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:08,380
I'm sorry.

622
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:12,949
I had no idea.

623
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:16,760
I hurt her.

624
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:20,829
I'm deeply regretting it.

625
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:24,670
Did you...

626
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,170
abandon Ji Hye?

627
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:32,769
What did you do to make her...

628
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:36,010
You must've done it...

629
00:54:37,409 --> 00:54:38,750
in a very cruel...

630
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:41,480
and hurtful way.

631
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:47,119
I wanted to be with her.

632
00:54:49,389 --> 00:54:50,559
But she made...

633
00:54:53,059 --> 00:54:56,300
that decision thinking
that I abandoned her.

634
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:21,760
Is that what happened?

635
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:27,159
To protect your family...

636
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:32,329
My family...

637
00:55:36,139 --> 00:55:39,539
I begged Hwan Gi for help.

638
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:47,119
I told your parents everything.

639
00:55:48,619 --> 00:55:50,190
I told Yi Soo too.

640
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:53,789
Why did you do it alone?

641
00:55:55,789 --> 00:55:57,289
I said we should do it together.

642
00:55:57,789 --> 00:55:59,929
You've been carrying the burden
all by yourself.

643
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:02,730
It's my turn now.

644
00:56:03,969 --> 00:56:05,300
That's the right thing to do.

645
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,400
Where is Yi Soo?

646
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:11,610
I dropped her off at home.

647
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:14,210
- She's probably at home...
- By herself?

648
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:21,019
Boss.

649
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:34,960
I'm sorry.

650
00:56:37,329 --> 00:56:38,800
I have to go to Yi Soo.

651
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,710
Please pick up, Yi Soo.

652
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:32,949
The number you have dialed is not
available.

653
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:36,460
Please leave a message
after the tone.

654
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:46,230
What?

655
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,550
How...

656
00:58:05,389 --> 00:58:07,659
How could you...

657
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:09,219
How could you...

658
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:14,460
How could you do that? How...

659
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,269
How... How could you do that?

660
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:33,949
How could you...

661
00:59:34,179 --> 00:59:36,340
(Yun Jung)

662
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,190
Why are you so shy? You haven't
been to a sauna before?

663
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:46,590
Come here.

664
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:49,389
- Well...
- Sit down.

665
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,900
You probably didn't have dinner.
Let's eat something first.

666
01:00:08,539 --> 01:00:11,409
Yun Jung, I'm sorry,

667
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,380
but I'm really not in the mood.

668
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,389
I heard from Hwan Gi.

669
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:22,159
Hwan Gi asked me to check on you.

670
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:27,360
Why did I...

671
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:31,630
fall in love with him
in the first place?

672
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:35,900
That's what I want to say.

673
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,610
I mean, I'm his first love.

674
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:41,480
This is like asking his ex to take
care of his current girlfriend.

675
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:44,210
Can you believe him?

676
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:50,550
There you go.
Laugh it off like that.

677
01:00:51,349 --> 01:00:54,090
Instead of crying,
just sweat your sorrows away.

678
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,460
After filling your stomach, that is.

679
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:10,000
My sister would have been
frustrated to see this.

680
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:15,539
I once even felt attracted
to Mr. Kang. It's so stupid of me.

681
01:01:16,909 --> 01:01:19,110
I cherished the necklace
Mr. Kang gave my sister...

682
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:23,550
thinking she left it for me.

683
01:01:26,219 --> 01:01:27,289
I'm so stupid.

684
01:01:28,019 --> 01:01:29,320
If your sister is watching,

685
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:34,030
she'd feel so thankful
and proud of you.

686
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:37,329
Without you, the truth would have
remained hidden.

687
01:01:39,469 --> 01:01:41,469
It's Boss that revealed the truth.

688
01:01:42,139 --> 01:01:45,739
He's probably the one who
persuaded Mr. Kang too.

689
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:48,880
You don't seem to be resenting
Hwan Gi.

690
01:01:49,179 --> 01:01:51,710
Three years ago, he chose to
protect his sister.

691
01:01:51,849 --> 01:01:54,650
This time, he literally left you
for his sister.

692
01:01:55,219 --> 01:01:57,989
Of course I resent him.

693
01:02:01,289 --> 01:02:02,320
But...

694
01:02:04,289 --> 01:02:06,960
I can't help but suspect
there must be another reason.

695
01:02:08,429 --> 01:02:10,900
What's really scary and sad is this.

696
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:13,670
That this might...

697
01:02:14,769 --> 01:02:16,800
not be the end of it.

698
01:02:18,309 --> 01:02:22,809
No matter how many doors I open,
there might be more doors.

699
01:02:24,909 --> 01:02:26,679
Hwan Gi is like that.

700
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:29,679
It just feels impossible
to get close to him.

701
01:02:29,849 --> 01:02:32,619
When you think you know him,
he becomes a different person.

702
01:02:34,619 --> 01:02:36,219
Loving someone like him...

703
01:02:37,429 --> 01:02:38,659
is not easy.

704
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:47,269
I think it's about time
you tried to persuade me...

705
01:02:47,469 --> 01:02:49,469
to give him up.

706
01:02:51,469 --> 01:02:52,570
Exactly.

707
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:56,280
He's too difficult
for a baby like you.

708
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:29,010
Thank you, Yun Jung.

709
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:10,719
If you're going to throw it,
can I have it?

710
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:40,750
Can I take a look at
your guest list?

711
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:42,820
It's you, Mr. Eun.

712
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:45,090
- What's the matter?
- Yi Soo...

713
01:04:46,019 --> 01:04:48,289
I'm wondering if Yi Soo is here.

714
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:51,590
Ms. Eun? She went up a moment ago.

715
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,769
I was...

716
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:05,969
supposed to have that necklace.

717
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:13,210
You look like
you found out about everything.

718
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,260
Are you happy now?

719
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:30,300
In the end,

720
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:34,000
your sister took Woo Il
away from me...

721
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,639
even after she died.

722
01:05:39,809 --> 01:05:42,739
I know you're a victim too.

723
01:05:48,849 --> 01:05:49,920
Chae Ji Hye.

724
01:05:53,019 --> 01:05:54,519
I killed her.

725
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:59,059
Don't blame Woo Il.

726
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:01,300
He's innocent.

727
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,070
What...

728
01:06:06,269 --> 01:06:07,369
No way.

729
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:10,809
Ji Hye didn't...

730
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:14,579
commit suicide?

731
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,409
Stay away.

732
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:22,619
I just...

733
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:27,250
want what's mine back.

734
01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:46,809
Don't be scared.

735
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:50,880
I won't hurt anyone.

736
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:59,849
There is only one person...

737
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:06,690
I want to hurt.

738
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:10,769
No!

739
01:07:11,130 --> 01:07:12,800
- No!
- Let go.

740
01:07:12,829 --> 01:07:14,900
Let go, or you'll get hurt too.

741
01:07:15,269 --> 01:07:17,469
- Don't do this!
- Let go!

742
01:07:17,809 --> 01:07:20,139
I'm the one that killed your sister.

743
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:22,710
I'll die the same way I killed her.

744
01:07:23,309 --> 01:07:24,480
Let go!

745
01:07:58,650 --> 01:08:01,480
(My Shy Boss)

746
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:04,019
I'd like to request
a one-on-one meeting.

747
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:05,920
You know it's
Valentine's Day tomorrow, right?

748
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:07,559
I got you chocolates
for Valentine's Day.

749
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:10,219
I guess Ro Woon doesn't intend on
confessing to you.

750
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:13,489
I had too much to drink.
We're closed today.

751
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:15,829
I need you to lead the company.
You're on your own now.

752
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:17,399
I can't do it without you.

753
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:18,970
- Have you eaten?
- Not yet.

754
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,229
Do you want to eat together?

755
01:08:20,670 --> 01:08:22,399
Do you want to come tomorrow?

756
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,569
He must have a lot on his mind.

757
01:08:24,609 --> 01:08:27,140
Shouldn't we be helping him?

758
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:28,909
He put it back on.

759
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:31,250
Can't you take off the hoodie?

760
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:34,109
This is my Valentine's Day gift
to you.

761
01:08:34,149 --> 01:08:35,750
Did you want to kiss?
