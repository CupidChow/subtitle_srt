1
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:48,189
What was that?

2
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:51,359
It just...

3
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:54,659
felt...

4
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,359
so warm.

5
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,099
It's cold.

6
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:07,870
I'm so cold.

7
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:11,180
Gosh, my toes. They're freezing.

8
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:15,909
So cold.

9
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:23,890
What was it?

10
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,430
My stomach is so upset.

11
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:38,140
Good morning, everyone.

12
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,140
I see that all of you
are as hungover as I am.

13
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,579
Oh, boy.

14
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,579
Ro Woon, are you the one who sorted
everything out and got us home?

15
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,049
All of us blacked out last night.

16
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,290
None of us remember how we got home.

17
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,219
Do you remember, Ro Woon?

18
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:01,659
Not really.

19
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:05,859
But...

20
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,400
I think Boss came by.

21
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:13,240
Didn't he get cabs for all of us?

22
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,169
Who? She must've been
the most drunk one out of all of us.

23
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,340
Was I?

24
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,120
Where's Boss by the way?

25
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,680
He probably doesn't even want
to deal with the world after...

26
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,719
humiliating himself.

27
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,689
But I must say, covering himself
like that makes him look scarier.

28
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,740
Why are you wearing your
sunglasses indoors?

29
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:48,569
You came by the bar last night,
right?

30
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,110
- No.
- You did.

31
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:52,180
You got cabs for all of us.
Aren't I right?

32
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,449
No, I didn't.

33
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,949
Was I mistaken?

34
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,360
That's odd.
I remember that something...

35
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,930
felt very warm.

36
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,360
He's wearing sunglasses because
he doesn't want to make eye contact.

37
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,560
Goodness.

38
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,469
I clearly remember
the smell, though.

39
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,699
What smell?

40
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,409
The smell of peppermint candy.

41
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,620
Are you okay?

42
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,189
You cockroach!

43
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:17,560
- Gosh.
- I know you picked on my sister.

44
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:18,959
Hold on. Just a second.

45
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,699
What did you do?

46
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:25,540
What kind of nasty, mean things
did you do to her?

47
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:28,139
You psychopath. Tell me!

48
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,639
Please don't do this, Ms. Chae.

49
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,310
You.

50
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,750
I'm going to teach you
a serious lesson today.

51
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,750
You piece of trash!

52
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:44,790
Please calm down.

53
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:49,790
You'll hurt yourself.

54
00:04:58,899 --> 00:04:59,970
Boss?

55
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,370
Why are you here, Boss?

56
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,680
Why?

57
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,579
You filthy cockroach!

58
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:24,660
Does it hurt?

59
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:36,769
Gosh, you startled me.

60
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,449
Boss, my stomach is a little upset.

61
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,480
Sorry?

62
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,379
My stomach is upset.

63
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:48,019
Your stomach?
Okay, we're almost there.

64
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:50,350
No, no. You're almost home.

65
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:52,560
No, don't. Please.

66
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:55,560
No, don't do it. My goodness.

67
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,829
- My stomach is so upset.
- No, don't. Please don't.

68
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,069
No, wait. Don't do it.
Try to hold it.

69
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,540
Hold on a minute.

70
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:08,910
I clearly remember
the smell, though.

71
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,579
The smell of peppermint candy.

72
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,579
Ms. Chae, please don't.
You can't do it here.

73
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,649
- Please don't do it.
- Don't shake my head.

74
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,220
- Sorry, I'll be gentle.
- My head is spinning.

75
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,350
- I'll be gentle.
- My head...

76
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,990
- Don't be like this. Please don't.
- My head is spinning.

77
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:25,189
- Don't shake my head.
- Okay, I won't.

78
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,129
Here, put your seat belt on.

79
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,829
Where are we now?

80
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:35,470
We're almost there.
You'll be home in no time.

81
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,040
Good. That's it. That's great.

82
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:40,300
Get some sleep. Good.

83
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,550
She did this to me,

84
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,279
yet she doesn't remember a thing.

(Episode 6: How Can Love Change?)

86
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,629
(Episode 6: How Can People Change?)

87
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,170
With a hopeless dream
to change the world,

88
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,310
do you plan on spending
more than half...

89
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:16,370
of your PR budget on my friend?

90
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,449
The world cannot change,
nor should you try.

91
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:23,009
There is no reason to do that.

92
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:27,290
All we have to do is gather
160,000 people to fill the seats.

93
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,920
Forget those grandiose strategies
and superficial events.

94
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,389
Do you see now...

95
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,259
on whom and how you should spend...

96
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:38,129
your marketing expenses?

97
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,470
That was amazing.

98
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,009
Did you see that?

99
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:53,110
It was a legendary presentation
by Mr. Kang.

100
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:56,410
How could we possibly do
as good a job as that?

101
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,180
Only Mr. Kang can do that.

102
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:04,019
That's why we should all
work together. Let's give...

103
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,019
the upcoming presentations our all!

104
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,160
Let's do this!

105
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:13,160
Yoo Hee, you seem so motivated.

106
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,829
It's because I feel guilty.

107
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,240
I should make up for
the presentation for Yong Ramyeon.

108
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,410
All right, let's do this.

109
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,269
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

110
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,180
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

(Woo Gi Ja)

112
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:36,850
- Mr. Woo?
- Why didn't you tell me?

113
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,159
I mean the video clip.

114
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:44,960
If you had a gem like this,
you should have given it to me.

115
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,700
A video clip?

116
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:50,639
- A gem?
- Didn't you upload it?

117
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:52,399
He can't speak.

118
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,940
- What are you watching?
- Why can't he speak?

119
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,169
Is that...

120
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:59,509
Mr. Eun?

121
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,679
I...

122
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,909
I...

123
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,480
I...

124
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,450
I...

125
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:08,590
On this show, I once...

126
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,019
accused a co-CEO of a PR agency
of power abuse...

127
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,860
before anyone else did.

128
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:16,360
This time,
his competency is being questioned.

129
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:18,159
I...

130
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,799
The only word that came out
of his mouth was...

131
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,200
"I", "I",

132
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,830
and "I".

133
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,070
Nothing else.

134
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,409
There was no "you" or "we".

135
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,379
His world is full of himself.

136
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:34,549
He proved himself that...

137
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,750
he's a self-centered narcissist.

138
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,320
In addition, the father of
this obnoxious narcissist...

139
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:43,450
turns out to be...

140
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,860
congressman Eun Bok Dong,

141
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,460
who is predicted to be
the next mayor of Seoul.

142
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:54,600
I'm occupied with preparing
my candidacy announcement.

143
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,169
How much longer do I have to
look after my grown-up son?

144
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,190
Die. Just die.

145
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:25,629
Die.

146
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:28,429
Boss.

147
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,639
- Die.
- Mister, what are you doing?

148
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:35,340
- Die.
- What's going on?

149
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,409
Who are you?

150
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:40,139
Who am I?

151
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,419
I'm afraid I'm too embarrassed
to tell you who I am.

152
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,820
Father, why are you doing this?

153
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:49,019
Why am I doing this?

154
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:51,320
Mr. Park.

155
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:59,230
- I...
- "I", "I", "I".

156
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:03,700
You should just have
at least spoken like a child.

157
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:06,639
You pathetic idiot!

158
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,470
Father, the thing is...

159
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,840
Well...

160
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,809
Please stop it.

161
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,179
Gosh.

162
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,649
- Are you okay?
- My goodness.

163
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,590
Are you okay?

164
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,090
I'm okay.

165
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:33,159
Why are you Eun Hwan Gi,
not Kang Woo Il?

166
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:37,269
I placed Woo Il right next to you...

167
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,200
so that you'd speak like him,

168
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:40,769
think like him,

169
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:43,309
eat like him, and breathe like him!

170
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:48,610
Be at least as good as
a pore on his foot.

171
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:51,519
Be like Kang Woo Il,
for goodness' sake!

172
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,159
Please... Please stop.

173
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,799
Don't do this. Please don't.

174
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,570
My goodness.

175
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,580
What is this?

176
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:25,580
How could he be my son?

177
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:27,620
What did I do to get a son like him?

178
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,559
Trace the IP address of the scum...

179
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:39,759
who made that video clip go viral.

180
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:45,700
As it's an anonymous forum,
the user information is encrypted.

181
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,509
It's impossible
to trace the address.

182
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,340
Then fire the person
who was at the...

183
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,039
No.

184
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,639
Fire the whole staff!

185
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:17,769
Silent Monster is only
starting to settle down.

186
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,539
A rash change in personnel
might cause...

187
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,440
You should first calm down and...

188
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,009
Sorry, Sir.

189
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:27,710
It's the third time.

190
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:30,210
I sincerely apologize.

191
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:43,929
It's for something I did.

192
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,169
Well...

193
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,509
Boss.

194
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,450
This is...

195
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:24,659
Boss.

196
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,830
You're in there, right?

197
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,769
Boss.

198
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,080
Please open the door.

199
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:50,149
Boss.

200
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,960
Please open the door.

201
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,759
Open up.

202
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:58,159
Boss.

203
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:01,029
Open the door.

204
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,440
- Stop it.
- There you go.

205
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,700
Just a second. Excuse me.

206
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,110
Well, Boss.

207
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:11,139
Boss.

208
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,379
It's something important. Boss.

209
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,220
Can you look at me, Boss?

210
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,419
Boss? Boss?

211
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:23,750
Boss, look at me.

212
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,960
This won't do.

213
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:32,100
Boss,
then I'm going to come over there.

214
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:36,169
Okay? Hold on. Here I go.

215
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,840
What are you doing?

216
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,799
What are you...

217
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,710
I was in a rush.

218
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,340
- About Mr. Kang...
- I said, stop it!

219
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:55,990
I'm... I'm sorry.

220
00:16:58,659 --> 00:16:59,860
Sorry.

221
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,269
I thought you didn't have
anyone above you,

222
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,240
but you were feeling inferior
to your friend.

223
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,009
What do you mean?
It's not like that.

224
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,059
It's the presentation
he did that became a legend.

225
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,000
It's actually your work, isn't it?

226
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,170
The key idea is to know your target.

227
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,609
It's all in this picture.

228
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,140
Really?

229
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:53,779
The audience we have to gather
is 160,000.

230
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:56,950
If we invite 20 people per company,

231
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,220
we can assume about 10 people
will make it.

232
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,289
That means we should tell
at least 500,000 people.

233
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,160
He made the ramyeon presentation
last time, too.

234
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:10,059
He must have been working alone
in the back.

235
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:18,470
Why didn't you say so?

236
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,839
You should boast around.

237
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:24,740
At the least, you could scream
like you did just now.

238
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,839
Otherwise, people won't know.

239
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:29,880
Tell us what you're thinking...

240
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,549
while watching us from behind.

241
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,220
Why is she doing this to me?

242
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:37,589
I don't think you're a bad man.

243
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,519
You just look hurt.

244
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:55,569
Hey. What is this smell?

245
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,309
Is it peppermint candy?

246
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,880
Peppermint candy? No.

247
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:04,279
It is. It's peppermint candy.

248
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,349
It's not peppermint candy.

249
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,990
It's mint.

250
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,619
I was right.
You came to the bar that time.

251
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,529
I remembered correctly.

252
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:22,799
Am I right?

253
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:25,740
Did you drive me home? Am I right?

254
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,710
Why are you running away?

255
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:30,640
What is it?

256
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,309
What? Why are you embarrassed?

257
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,309
Did anything else happen
other than getting us cabs?

258
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:41,650
The founder of the agency requested
Silent Monster to disband,

259
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,450
but I was able to get it postponed.

260
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,089
However, there is a condition.

261
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,460
You must transform Eun Hwan Gi.

262
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,829
Pardon?

263
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,160
You will become king makers.

264
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:54,730
You have to turn Mr. Eun
into an ideal leader.

265
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:56,430
Us?

266
00:19:56,569 --> 00:20:00,069
An ideal leader? That means
he has to become someone like you.

267
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,579
- How is that possible?
- How can people change?

268
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,509
Are there detailed missions
we must accomplish?

269
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,650
Let's start with a presentation
for food delivery application.

270
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:13,480
It's a small project,
so it'll be a warm-up.

271
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:18,289
Does this mean we have to put
Mr. Eun at the podium again?

272
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,329
It'll be easier to find a new job.

273
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,089
Will anyone take you?

274
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,130
I feel like your words are sharp.

275
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,859
- Of course they are.
- What?

276
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,970
Do you have anywhere to go?

277
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,500
- What do we do?
- Where?

278
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:33,069
It was me who pushed Boss
to present.

279
00:20:33,869 --> 00:20:36,470
Everyone might get fired
because of me.

280
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:41,240
All right. At times like these,
you must take it easy.

281
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,750
What you need at Silent Monster
is teamwork.

282
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:47,349
Let us go on a trip as a workshop.

283
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,720
A workshop?

284
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:55,529
Do I have to pick up after him
on the weekend?

285
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,390
I just signed myself up
for English classes.

286
00:20:57,829 --> 00:21:01,000
I need to build up my experiences
to find myself a new job.

287
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,640
It's been years since our family
went on a trip together.

288
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,740
Why did it have to be this week?
Gosh, it's hot.

289
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,069
I have to get groceries
then prepare the games.

290
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,339
It's all going to be on me.

291
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,250
I'm going on a trip with Ro Woon.

292
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,660
I'm not going.

293
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:32,630
Does he think we want to go?

294
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:37,400
Yes. He says he won't go.

295
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:41,069
Pardon? Yes, Sir.

296
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:44,440
Mr. Kang says he will come with us.

297
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:46,039
That will work.

298
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:47,339
- Let's go.
- Okay.

299
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,650
Sir. We'll get going.

300
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:53,279
Bye.

301
00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:00,359
What if we come back
and all of our desks are gone?

302
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,289
He has no intention to change.

303
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,059
Consider it our farewell trip
before we get fired.

304
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,930
Mr. Kang says he will come with us.

305
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,470
- What about your staff?
- I'll protect my own staff.

306
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,869
How will you protect them?

307
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,940
Just by watching,

308
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,609
you can't protect anyone.

309
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,299
Will I be able to change?

310
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:44,029
All I can think about is barbecue.

311
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:46,039
- Let's eat a lot of good food.
- Let's go on a trip.

312
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:47,569
- I'll prepare it first.
- Let's go.

313
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,140
I love barbecues...

314
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:50,769
- What?
- What is it?

315
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,509
I suddenly got a chill.
It must be the weather, right?

316
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,609
What's gotten into him?

317
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,349
Let's go inside.

318
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,650
Go, go.

319
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,599
Thank you for coming.

320
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,369
It's been three years
since we went on a trip together.

321
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,009
All right, gather around!

322
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,119
Come here.

323
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,490
Let's go.

324
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,289
Okay, now greet your opponents.

325
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,920
- I look forward to it.
- Let's play fair.

326
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,730
I've had some experience on stage.
To stand in front of others,

327
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:47,029
you need to relax your body
not just your mouth.

328
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:50,269
That's true. Body language
is important during presentations.

329
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:52,069
That's why I prepared this game.

330
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:54,299
"Talk with Your Body".

331
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:56,069
All right, get ready.

332
00:23:57,009 --> 00:23:58,109
(Basketball)

333
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,140
This is too easy.

334
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,309
- Basketball.
- Okay.

335
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:03,480
Correct.

336
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,349
- Bowling.
- You can't do that.

337
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,650
- Come on.
- That's correct.

338
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,049
Correct.

339
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,690
This one will be hard.

340
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:17,630
They won't get this.
Don't worry, they won't get it.

341
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,099
- What is that?
- Yes, this is hard.

342
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,799
- Hurry, hurry.
- Thumbs up?

343
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,700
Here.

344
00:24:24,569 --> 00:24:26,269
- Swings. Swings.
- Yes.

345
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,500
Swings.

346
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:31,339
- What is that?
- Levitation?

347
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:32,509
Yes.

348
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:35,549
- A trapeze!
- Okay, you got it!

349
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,319
A dinosaur.

350
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,079
Tyrannosaurus?

351
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,319
An anteater.

352
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,519
He's amazing.

353
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,589
- Was he in musicals before?
- A camel.

354
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:46,819
My goodness.

355
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:48,690
- A camel.
- He was born to do this.

356
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,589
- Why did you tell them?
- He looks like one.

357
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,529
- Last one.
- What is it?

358
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:57,529
What is it, Mr. Kang? Hurry. Hurry.

359
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:00,440
Hurry up.

360
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,089
I know! Back hug!

361
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,589
Correct!

362
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:25,599
We got all of them.

363
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,569
We answered them all.

364
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,640
- We got it all, right?
- Yes, you did.

365
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,779
Next is Mr. Eun's team.

366
00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:41,279
Yes. He's already up.

367
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:43,079
Please go on.

368
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:45,579
- Let us start.
- We can do it.

369
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,880
Boss, you can be like Mr. Kang, too.

370
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:49,190
Good luck.

371
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,059
You can do it. Go.

372
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:53,720
You can do it.

373
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:58,529
Yes. If I don't have to speak,
I might be able to do it.

374
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,059
Let's try it.

375
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,700
Okay.

376
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:05,299
Okay, get ready.

377
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,970
Good luck!

378
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,069
- Let's go.
- You can do it.

379
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:11,269
Start.

380
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,980
An eagle?

381
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,910
It is the king of the sky.

382
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,680
Those birds can intimidate others
with their piercing eyes alone.

383
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,289
- A superhuman.
- Laser beams.

384
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,119
And they have majestic wings.

385
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:31,190
The way they fly is characterized by
a sense of unmatchable grandeur.

386
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,859
Are you trying to provoke me?

387
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,569
What's he trying to tell us?
I'm so frustrated.

388
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:39,700
Please make your gestures bigger.

389
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,410
If I imitate their piercing eyes...

390
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:44,309
and the majestic way they fly,

391
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:46,640
they'd be able to
guess the answer easily.

392
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,680
Open your heart.
Just get it all out.

393
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:50,910
- Time is up.
- Stop doing...

394
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,920
Time is up. We have to move on.

395
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,779
- What's the answer?
- It was "eagle".

396
00:26:55,289 --> 00:26:57,349
- That's too bad.
- The answer was "eagle".

397
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,619
Eagles fly like this.

398
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,490
- We don't have time.
- Why can't you do this?

399
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,390
- We need to move on. Next question.
- Gosh, my back hurts.

400
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,859
This one will be difficult.

401
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,299
Like Mr. Kang,

402
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:10,700
try to do it in an accurate,
simple way. Go ahead, Boss.

403
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:12,500
- You can do it.
- Good luck!

404
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,039
- Okay.
- Hatch out of your shell.

405
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:15,109
Start.

406
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,579
For the last one,
I wasted too much time on thinking.

407
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,779
I must decide quickly this time.

408
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:25,150
Popcorn is inanimate, so I should
try to look into its inner world.

409
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:27,119
Popcorn, popcorn, popcorn.

410
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,319
It's crouching like this
inside its hard shell.

411
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:33,819
When it's heated, it reveals its
white flesh as if it's blossoming.

412
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:35,789
This is it.
The inner world of popcorn.

413
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,859
I should express
such passion of popcorn...

414
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,460
using my entire body.

415
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,369
- A tadpole?
- A missile?

416
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,799
Oh, fireworks. It burst like this.

417
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,710
Rage.

418
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,440
Vomiting?

419
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,940
"Planet of the Apes".

420
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,380
Time is up! You failed again.

421
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,410
You used up your time.
This was an epic fail!

422
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,519
- What was the answer?
- It was "popcorn".

423
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:01,680
You should've done this to express
popcorn. Why does popcorn...

424
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,119
- Why didn't you do this?
- Did it burn or something?

425
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,519
- Was it too difficult?
- It burned.

426
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,720
- You make it too difficult.
- It's too difficult.

427
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:10,160
- Is it that hard?
- Popcorn. A grain of corn pops.

428
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,200
- Like this.
- That was close.

429
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,130
You did well, though.

430
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,720
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

431
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:36,690
- Thank you, Mr. Kang.
- Thank you!

432
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:37,890
No problem. Eat up.

433
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,759
- This is so nice.
- Seriously.

434
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:41,519
We're surrounded by
the ocean and mountains.

435
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:43,789
- I can't stop drinking.
- I love being near the ocean.

436
00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:46,200
- Isn't it so beautiful?
- Yes, it's so nice here.

437
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,029
- I'll do it.
- Pour me a drink.

438
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,700
All right, then.
I'll leave it in your hands.

439
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,140
We're surrounded by the
mountains. Look.

440
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,509
- It looks like the Garden of Eden.
- Shall we have beer?

441
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,750
- Yes. Please make a toast.
- Thank you.

442
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:03,779
Please make a toast.

443
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:06,750
Here's to the teamwork
of Silent Monster!

444
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:08,849
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

445
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:14,519
I shouldn't be greedy and think
that I can change overnight.

446
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:18,029
I should start step by step with
the little things that I can do.

447
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:22,500
I'll win their hearts and thank them
for their hard work with this meat.

448
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:26,339
- He's preparing the barbecue.
- I see.

449
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:29,369
The second they put the perfectly
grilled meat into their mouths,

450
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:32,579
the juice from the meat
will explode...

451
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,650
and help them forget
about their stress and fatigue.

452
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,079
- Isn't it pretty?
- I love talking about this stuff.

453
00:29:38,849 --> 00:29:41,349
Gosh, I'm so happy right now.

454
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,089
- The barbecue is ready!
- Mr. Eun brought us the meat.

455
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:47,920
There you go.

456
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,730
It looks amazing.

457
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:51,559
- Please try it.
- You're the best.

458
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:54,200
Mr. Eun, I didn't know
that you had a side like this.

459
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,970
- It's seriously so good.
- I'm glad you like it.

460
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:58,839
- It's so juicy.
- Really?

461
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,000
Mr. Eun, we love you.

462
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:03,069
- Eun Hwan Gi! Eun Hwan Gi!
- Gosh, stop.

463
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:05,839
- I want to give this to you. Here.
- Don't worry. I'm okay.

464
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:08,039
- I've already eaten a lot.
- Come on. Please eat this.

465
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:09,680
- Why are you all being like this?
- I'll fan you.

466
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:15,079
All right, everyone. Here's to
Silent Monster's amazing future!

467
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:17,289
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

468
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,190
It's so delicious.

469
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,190
- I know. It's really good.
- Why didn't you go there?

470
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:25,660
- Isn't it so nice here?
- Oh, my.

471
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:27,059
- It is.
- I'm so glad we came here.

472
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:28,829
- Yes, totally.
- It is really nice here.

473
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,539
Who brought this kimchi?

474
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:35,309
It's delicious.

475
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:38,339
I'm not sure.
It was in the refrigerator.

476
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,109
I made the kimchi.

477
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:43,279
It's my kimchi. I made it.

478
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:46,150
I made the kimchi. I made it myself.

479
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,720
Here, try it.

480
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:53,259
I don't eat kimchi.

481
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:55,059
I don't like it.

482
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,930
Are we getting more meat?

483
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,759
It'll be ready soon.

484
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:02,599
Boss must be hungry, too.

485
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,069
Just eat this.

486
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,539
Mr. Eun.

487
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:08,500
Mr. Eun.

488
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,039
Mr. Eun, hand over the baton to me.

489
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,440
You should go eat.

490
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:15,849
- It's okay. I'll do it.
- Don't worry. I'll do it.

491
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,910
- All right. I should do this.
- That's...

492
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,420
You're making the juice
in the meat seep out.

493
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:33,230
That juice must be more
important than teamwork.

494
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,630
He loves to embarrass us,
which is incredibly off-putting.

495
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,339
I'll pack up as soon as I get back.

496
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:05,829
Great.

497
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,569
Se Jong, what's all this?

498
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,470
I want to surprise Ro Woon
with a special event.

499
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:18,509
I didn't know you and Ro Woon
were close like that.

500
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,839
I'm trying to make our relationship
develop in that direction.

501
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,680
I want to get it done as soon as
possible. Can you give me a hand?

502
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,450
Sure.

503
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:35,690
Just so you know,
girls don't like such events.

504
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,460
Expensive gifts won't work on her...

505
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,799
because she's so impractical.

506
00:32:42,869 --> 00:32:45,839
I was wondering if childish stuff
like this would work.

507
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,269
What if she rejects you?

508
00:32:48,369 --> 00:32:50,109
It'll happen in front of all of us.

509
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,910
Well, I guess I'll be known
as a complete loser.

510
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:55,750
I don't care. I don't have time
to worry about what others think.

511
00:32:56,009 --> 00:32:57,980
I'm busy enough trying
to win Ro Woon's heart.

512
00:32:58,849 --> 00:33:01,349
You must like her a lot.

513
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,519
Ro Woon is the only one
who doesn't see that.

514
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,319
I really hope she gets touched
by this event.

515
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:13,329
It will be very touching.
If it were me...

516
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:14,700
Hold this for me, please.

517
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:16,799
Okay.

518
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:25,269
We can get this done quickly
if we gather our strengths.

519
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,339
Hold on. Will it look good here?

520
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,349
Shall we put it there?

521
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:42,829
I'll help you.

522
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,730
I can do it by myself.
Just get some rest.

523
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,109
Why do I keep seeing them together?

524
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,480
Do you have something to tell me?

525
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,950
Well...

526
00:34:08,789 --> 00:34:10,949
About the PI project...

527
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:12,619
(PI utilizes CEO's identity
to promote company's brand image)

528
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,219
What can I do
to do a good job on it?

529
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:17,360
I'm just wondering.

530
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:21,559
Will I be able to do a good job?
What do you think?

531
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,599
I think someone has to help Boss...

532
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:31,809
for him to change.

533
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,880
That didn't work.

534
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:43,989
Be careful.

535
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:54,159
It sounds like
your attitude has changed.

536
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,329
Did something happen?

537
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:57,869
No, it's just...

538
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:00,800
It's not really for him.

539
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:05,579
It's for other people.

540
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,340
Oh, because the team members'
jobs are at stake?

541
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:10,550
I am worried about my team members.

542
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,750
Also...

543
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,019
Everyone around Boss...

544
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:23,230
must have the wrong idea about him
like I did.

545
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:27,400
"He's cold, difficult,
and hard to approach."

546
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,340
Being misunderstood
is surely distressing,

547
00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:36,070
but being on the other side...

548
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,280
is equally distressing
and uncomfortable.

549
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,409
Boss probably doesn't mean
to come across like that.

550
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,559
It worked.

551
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:17,750
Are you okay?

552
00:36:26,659 --> 00:36:28,559
I'm okay.

553
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:31,630
It's so hot.

554
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,500
I almost got a burn.

555
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,739
I'm hungry.

556
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,360
Hey, what are you doing
hiding there?

557
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,900
I wasn't hiding.

558
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:14,940
Try to get close
to the team members.

559
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:17,539
Don't be such a loner even here.

560
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,280
They all came here for you.

561
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:23,110
You're here for Silent Monster, too.

562
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,880
- Right?
- What?

563
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,190
What are you trying to say?

564
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,519
Forget it.

565
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,090
Hey, warm yourself by the fire.

566
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,880
Pull yourself together.

567
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,619
Wake up.

568
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:08,590
Scarves are on the left side
in the second drawer.

569
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:11,260
Masks and underclothes are
in the top drawer.

570
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:15,829
Make sure the kids wear them
even if they don't want to.

571
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:21,340
Well, Honey,

572
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,610
I might...

573
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:27,440
get fired.

574
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,519
I miss the kids so much!

575
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:35,719
I miss them!

576
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,329
I need an employee,

577
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,789
not a mom.

578
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:47,900
Well, I have to go.

579
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:49,630
Bye.

580
00:38:56,969 --> 00:39:00,210
I'm sorry. I'm not on a picnic.

581
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:06,719
Being misunderstood is painful,

582
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,150
but it's uncomfortable
and difficult...

583
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,059
for those who misunderstand him,
too.

584
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,630
I'm sorry.

585
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,269
Pardon?

586
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:35,309
You must have felt
embarrassed earlier.

587
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,349
I'm sorry.

588
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:41,280
I felt...

589
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,150
it'd be a shame if you only...

590
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:47,389
played the role of a mom.

591
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,159
I understand.

592
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,960
You need an employee, not a mom.

593
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,659
A careless and irresponsible mom...

594
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,429
put you in trouble.

595
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:01,070
Your being a mom is not the problem.

596
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,309
The real problem is...

597
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:06,539
that you think of being a mom...

598
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,949
as a weakness.

599
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:12,849
These taste great.

600
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,280
As I'm just a mom,
I should treat the others to food.

601
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,050
As I'm just a married woman,
I should leverage my friendliness...

602
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,059
rather than my capabilities.

603
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:27,059
I'm sure there are things you
can do well because you're a mom.

604
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,469
Don't deny yourself.

605
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,869
Protect it.

606
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,210
That's the kind of employee I need.

607
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:43,210
Mr. Eun, I didn't know
you were thinking that way.

608
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:51,320
Well...

609
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:55,489
Can I tell you something?

610
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,329
You don't have to
give presentations.

611
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,730
Sorry?

612
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:06,739
You don't have to stand in the front
just because you're a leader.

613
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:10,840
Let someone who's good at it do it.

614
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:14,139
Although you might not be satisfied,

615
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:16,980
we're...

616
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:21,179
on the same boat now.

617
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:37,199
These are quite heavy.

618
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:49,039
I think Ro Woon will do a good job.

619
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,550
Why don't you let her do it?

620
00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:52,110
Ms. Chae?

621
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,820
It seems like she's the one
you like the most among us.

622
00:41:58,289 --> 00:41:59,489
Me?

623
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,420
My goodness.

624
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,760
That's not true.

625
00:42:03,329 --> 00:42:07,000
I can sense it because I'm a mom.

626
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:17,010
Do I have feelings for her?

627
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,710
Do I even deserve to?

628
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:22,710
Did I fail to hide my feelings?

629
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,510
Did I even let others see it?

630
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:26,719
That's impossible.

631
00:42:26,849 --> 00:42:30,519
I can hold back and hide feelings
better than anyone.

632
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,309
What is it?

633
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,909
What are you up to?

634
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,280
- Stop.
- Gosh.

635
00:42:55,309 --> 00:42:57,849
I'll cover your eyes from here.

636
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,320
Gosh.

637
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:02,889
- I told you not to get cute.
- Hey.

638
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:06,219
When a guy tries to surprise you,
just play along...

639
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:09,059
and pretend you're surprised.
Is it that hard?

640
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:11,159
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

641
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:15,860
Wait. What's that?

642
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,730
What?

643
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,579
Wait.

644
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,050
I'm sure I can hold back and hide...

645
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:36,750
my feelings.

646
00:43:39,889 --> 00:43:43,090
Boss, do you love me?

647
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,630
Why are you standing there?

648
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:50,769
I just happened to press this,

649
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,570
- and it suddenly...
- Why did you press it?

650
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:55,170
Turn it off right now.

651
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,909
Okay. I'm sorry.

652
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:59,739
No, don't press anything.

653
00:44:00,139 --> 00:44:01,639
Just get out of there.

654
00:44:05,949 --> 00:44:07,949
- No.
- That's so pretty.

655
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:09,949
No. No!

656
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:19,030
- No!
- It's amazing.

657
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:21,030
It's beautiful.

658
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:24,829
It is, but it's not supposed to
start yet.

659
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:27,840
This is not okay.

660
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:32,909
It's beautiful.

661
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:34,909
- Why did you do that?
- This is nice.

662
00:44:39,579 --> 00:44:41,980
Is he just going to run away
after ruining my plan?

663
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,989
Seriously.

664
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:50,429
No, I don't like her.

665
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:55,429
No, it's okay.

666
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:59,329
Ta-da! It's stopped! It's over.

667
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,809
- Ro Woon, I prepared this.
- All right.

668
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:06,880
- Cheers. Thank you for today.
- Cheers. Thank you.

669
00:45:06,909 --> 00:45:09,139
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

670
00:45:10,449 --> 00:45:13,650
Yoo Hee, you went on many
class trips back in college, right?

671
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:15,920
Please sing a song
you used to sing on class trips.

672
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:17,789
I'm not a good singer.

673
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,719
- Sing for us.
- Go, Yoo Hee.

674
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:45,980
I just...

675
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:48,949
worry about her.

676
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:50,550
The fire is flaring up.

677
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:54,320
- Se Jong, sing for us.
- I'm tone deaf.

678
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,659
Then dance for us.
You're a good dancer.

679
00:45:55,690 --> 00:45:58,230
If Gyo Ri sings, I'll dance to it.

680
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,760
- I'm not a good singer.
- Come on.

681
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,960
You look like a singer. Sing for us.

682
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,730
- I'm really bad at singing.
- It's okay.

683
00:46:05,769 --> 00:46:07,500
I'll dance. Gyo Ri,

684
00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:09,639
please sing "Magic" by Secret.

685
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:10,769
Yes, I like that song.

686
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:13,110
- It's such an old one.
- Let's go in one beat

687
00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:16,039
Let's go in 2 beats, in 3 beats

688
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:17,610
One, two, three, four

689
00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:20,349
My magic, magic, magic

690
00:46:20,449 --> 00:46:23,090
- My magic, magic, magic
- You're a good dancer.

691
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:26,050
You'll be surprised

692
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:28,460
- My, my
- You sing well too.

693
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,789
No, I'm not very good.

694
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:31,989
She isn't...

695
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:35,630
here for revenge any longer.

696
00:47:00,989 --> 00:47:03,360
- I had fun today.
- Me too.

697
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,829
It was more fun than I thought.

698
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:08,130
Gosh, it's good.

699
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,199
I'm surprised Sun Bong said
that he had fun.

700
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:11,829
- I agree.
- I like having fun too.

701
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,039
- What did you like the most?
- "Talk With Your Body".

702
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:15,599
Ro Woon, what are you looking for?

703
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,539
Have you seen my notebook?

704
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:20,940
I can't let others see it.

705
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:23,380
Why not? What's in it?

706
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,110
She must have doodled
the face of her crush.

707
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:29,719
No, it's not like that.

708
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,860
I sent your Christmas gift
to the orphanage.

709
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,599
I think I deserve a gift
for doing a good deed.

710
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,099
I just really like this.

711
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:55,940
I'll go and see
if I dropped it somewhere.

712
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,619
Are you looking for this?

713
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:01,449
Give it to me.

714
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:06,260
- Let me look at it.
- Hey, give it back!

715
00:48:06,389 --> 00:48:08,059
- Who's in it?
- What are you doing?

716
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:09,760
- Hold on.
- Don't be like that.

717
00:48:09,789 --> 00:48:11,190
- This is...
- What is it?

718
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:13,960
- This is...
- It's...

719
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:15,460
- What is it?
- Wait.

720
00:48:16,099 --> 00:48:17,170
Who...

721
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,469
is this?

722
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,940
It's ugly. It has to be Se Jong.

723
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:27,280
What? I hoped it would be me,
but I'm not that ugly.

724
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,079
No. This man has round eyes...

725
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:31,949
that are long and lopsided.

726
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:33,719
I think it's Mr. Eun.

727
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:36,420
No way. The nose is too wide.

728
00:48:36,449 --> 00:48:39,489
Look at how wide it is.
And the nostrils match Sun Bong.

729
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:41,590
- What are you talking about?
- This is definitely you.

730
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:44,530
Ro Woon, who is this really?

731
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,000
It's no one.

732
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:28,170
He has a fiancee.

733
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,869
What are you talking about?

734
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:35,440
Who do you mean?

735
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:37,980
The man you drew.

736
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:42,820
Who is it that I drew?

737
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:45,989
You don't even know.

738
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:47,590
Kang Woo Il.

739
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,289
What?

740
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:54,360
No way.

741
00:49:55,099 --> 00:49:58,300
Just because I told you
to become like him,

742
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,969
it doesn't mean I like him as a man.

743
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:05,010
No way. Never.

744
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:07,739
Gosh.

745
00:50:12,349 --> 00:50:13,380
But...

746
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:16,150
does he really have one?

747
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:20,590
Is he really getting married?

748
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,360
Try...

749
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,559
doing a presentation.

750
00:50:29,829 --> 00:50:31,630
Pardon? A presentation?

751
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:33,739
Me?

752
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,469
I'll give you all the time you need.

753
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:43,380
Let's...

754
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:46,949
work together.

755
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:49,750
Together?

756
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,429
Okay.

757
00:50:59,429 --> 00:51:00,530
I'll do it.

758
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:04,199
The reason she's staying...

759
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,039
is because she's sorry.

760

(Development in Shares of
Three Major Delivery Applications)

761
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,550
Okay.

762
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:20,750
Shall I give it a go?

764
00:51:23,389 --> 00:51:24,389
All right.

765

Ordering food by the phone
has come to its end.

766
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:33,760
People hardly have time
to get lunch.

767
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:35,699
No.

768
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:38,730
Yes.

769
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:42,000
It's a waste going back and forth
from the restaurant.

770
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:45,840
What came after that?

771
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:50,480
Yes. Get it in your head.

772
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:54,980
What was it?

773
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,849
I can't memorize it.

774
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:03,119
No.

775

She's trying to fix what she did.

778

You over there in the back.

786
00:52:37,989 --> 00:52:39,329
Do you have your phone with you?

787
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:41,099
- Me?
- Yes.

Me?

790

We'll see what is faster
between a phone order...

00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:55,780
and a delivery application.
Let us have a race.

Start.

794
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,789

Jjamppong rice.

803
00:53:26,539 --> 00:53:28,010
One jjamppong rice.

804
00:53:28,179 --> 00:53:29,909
One jjamppong?

- No.
- Was it jjajangmyeon?

No, not that.

I see. I'll get you one jjamppong.

809
00:53:40,059 --> 00:53:41,320
No, not that.

810
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:45,360
I don't prefer noodles
because they can get soggy.

811
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:46,559
It's hard to digest too.

812
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:49,429
I understand. I'll deliver it fast
so that it doesn't get soggy.

- No...

for you to pick one,

00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:57,739
we have a half and half special.
It's delicious.

817
00:53:58,469 --> 00:53:59,610
Hello?

818
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,579
What are you doing, Boss?

819
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,019
Why would you do this
during a presentation?

820
00:54:10,389 --> 00:54:14,260
I want to prove that the application
is faster than calling.

821
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:18,559
Boss. Have you never called...

822
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:21,929
a Chinese place to order food?

823
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:23,900
No.

824
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,900
You've never done it?

825
00:54:25,969 --> 00:54:27,539
Not even once?

826
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:30,409
- It's possible.
- I'm jealous.

827
00:54:30,969 --> 00:54:34,780
His taste is too exquisite
for oily food like that.

828
00:54:38,849 --> 00:54:39,949
Let's give up.

829
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:44,420
This isn't a joke. It's not child's
play. You call this a presentation?

830
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:46,619
Also, what is with the costume?

831
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,420
A panda?
Are you going to do kung fu?

832
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:50,860
You need to have an impactful punch.

833
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,889
Who would present like this?

834
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:57,429
Who told a newbie to present
in the first place?

835
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:01,639
I'm sorry.

836
00:55:02,869 --> 00:55:03,909
I'm sorry.

837
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:06,010
What are you sorry about?

838
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,500
Do you have any idea?

839
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:36,269
What's wrong...

840
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:39,570
with my presentation?

841
00:55:44,179 --> 00:55:45,849
You said we'd work together.

842
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:57,929
Let's say
giving a presentation is...

843
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:01,829
like asking someone out.

844
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:05,599
You prepare grandiose,
romantic words.

845
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:08,269
You perfectly memorize them.

846
00:56:08,769 --> 00:56:12,639
You promise the person you'd
get him even stars or the moon.

847
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:14,710
Does it sound sincere?

848
00:56:14,909 --> 00:56:16,480
To attract the person's attention,

849
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,780
you overdress yourself.

850
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,820
How would it look?

851
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:29,489
Predictions can always be wrong.

852
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:32,230
A race between a phone order
and a delivery application?

853
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,860
What if the judges...

854
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,530
don't have their phones with them?

855
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,570
What if they have
a phone phobia?

856
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:47,539
Was that it?

857
00:56:48,309 --> 00:56:49,940
A phone phobia?

858
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:53,619
It wasn't because
you don't like delivery food?

859
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:57,789
I wouldn't say I have a phobia.
It just makes me...

860
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,219
uncomfortable.

861
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:06,460
In addition to having trouble
looking people in the eye,

862
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:09,230
you feel uncomfortable talking
on the phone.

863
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:12,000
And you're telling me
how to ask someone out?

864
00:57:13,699 --> 00:57:14,940
So?

865
00:57:15,969 --> 00:57:18,469
How should you tell someone
how you feel about him or her?

866
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:27,980
I like you.

867
00:57:29,719 --> 00:57:30,789
Sorry?

868
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:38,690
That's what you should say.

869
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,159
I mean,

870
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:43,429
if you were asking someone out.

871
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,800
That's too plain and boring.

872
00:57:50,909 --> 00:57:52,570
Do you think that will work?

873
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:56,139
How much faster was the application
than a phone order?

874
00:57:56,780 --> 00:58:00,380
It's much faster. It takes
at least 2 to 3 minutes less.

875
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:03,019
Is that 2 to 3 minutes
really important to you?

876
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:05,889
What can you do instead
with that time?

877
00:58:08,889 --> 00:58:11,730
Do you want to obsess over time
like that?

878
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:13,860
Seriously?

879
00:58:17,769 --> 00:58:19,599
Just say what you really think.

880
00:58:20,369 --> 00:58:22,639
Instead of thinking of what to say,

881
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:25,070
just say...

882
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:28,780
what's on your mind.
That's enough.

883
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,949
Say rough but truthful words.

884
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,750
That's what's like you.

885
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,179
They must be busy around this time.

886
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,090
Did you eat?

887
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:13,449
If you didn't,
have some jjajangmyeon with us.

888
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,289
We're about to order.

889
00:59:15,619 --> 00:59:16,960
I ate.

890
00:59:20,329 --> 00:59:22,159
Hello.

891
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:24,369
This is New York Barbershop.

892
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:27,039
I'm calling you because...

893
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:31,340
we'd like to order
two bowls of jjamppong...

894
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:34,739
and for me...

895
00:59:35,309 --> 00:59:38,150
Let's see...

896
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:40,579
Please hurry up.

897
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:44,690
I'll have jjamppong too.

898
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:47,559
Three bowls of jjamppong, please.

899
00:59:48,219 --> 00:59:49,389
Thank you.

900
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:51,460
You don't like spicy food.

901
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:53,329
They sounded so busy.

902
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:57,500
Still, you cry
when you eat spicy food.

903
00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:00,440
It's sweat, not tears.

904
01:00:00,469 --> 01:00:03,000
There's someone like him here too.

905
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:05,809
Phone phobia.

906
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:09,380
More people than you think
suffer from it.

907
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:14,250
Some experts believe that
smartphones...

908
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,880
brought about phone phobia.

909
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:19,449
I have a different opinion.

910
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,090
I'll have jjamppong too.

911
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,190
Three bowls of jjamppong, please.

912
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,059
Thank you.

913
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,059
You don't like spicy food.

914
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:30,630
They sounded so busy.

915
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:34,300
I think they just care about
other people a bit too much.

916
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:46,179
Put down your phones.

917
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,349
Let's look each other in the eye
and talk.

918
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:53,719
The one who touches his or her phone
will pay for the food.

919
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,420
- Okay.
- Put it down.

920
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:56,690
Put it down.

921
01:00:58,659 --> 01:01:00,800
Do you think people can't
take their hands off their phones...

922
01:01:00,829 --> 01:01:02,960
because they're addicted to them?

923
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,599
- What about your mother?
- What about her?

924
01:01:06,769 --> 01:01:08,039
- How is she?
- Try it like that.

925
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:09,369
- Hey.
- Eat up.

926
01:01:12,309 --> 01:01:14,380
- What?
- It's a client.

927
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:16,610
If I don't pick up,
he'll throw a tantrum.

928
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,449
Take it.

929
01:01:19,179 --> 01:01:20,880
Hello.

930
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:24,550
It's a journalist.

931
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:28,460
- Hello.
- My goodness.

932
01:01:32,659 --> 01:01:34,630
- What?
- It's my ex-boyfriend.

933
01:01:34,659 --> 01:01:35,960
Are you going to take it?

934
01:01:37,269 --> 01:01:39,630
The one who makes a phone call
is said to have more power...

935
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:42,440
than the one who takes it.

936
01:01:42,469 --> 01:01:44,539
You guys pay for the food today.

937
01:01:44,809 --> 01:01:47,039
It's the first time my juniors
are paying for food.

938
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:50,110
The freedom to get away
from your phone?

939
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:53,920
It takes power to have that.

940
01:01:54,019 --> 01:01:57,219
(Mr. Kang Woo Il)

941
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:01,760
Hello, Mr. Kang.

942
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:03,989
Yes.

943
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,260
Okay.

944
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:11,400
They just have to
cling onto their phones...

945
01:02:11,699 --> 01:02:13,170
to survive.

946
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,340
"Getting away..."

947
01:02:15,369 --> 01:02:18,139
"from the discomfort and
tiredness phones give you".

948
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:20,639
It is Silent Monster's PR keyword...

949
01:02:20,809 --> 01:02:23,639
that will comfort people who are
tired of phone calls.

950
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:25,849
Thank you.

951
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:38,789
Good job.

952
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:20,400
Sorry. I'm sorry.

953
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:34,480
Yes, this is Silent Monster.

954
01:03:36,949 --> 01:03:39,050
I'm so glad you liked it.

955
01:04:12,619 --> 01:04:14,119
I heard it didn't go well.

956
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:20,360
Personally, I liked it very much.

957
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:22,900
But as it has an uncommon approach,

958
01:04:22,929 --> 01:04:26,670
we're not sure if it'll appeal
to the public.

959
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:30,670
In any case, I wanted to tell you
I really enjoyed your presentation.

960
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,139
You did a great job.

961
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,579
They don't usually even say that.

962
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:41,219
It was just a practice.
Don't be too hard on yourself.

963
01:04:42,579 --> 01:04:44,420
It'd be a big problem if you
become even stupider.

964
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,739
Woo Il.

965
01:05:05,409 --> 01:05:06,570
Hey, Yi Soo.

966
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:12,980
Oh, say hello.

967
01:05:13,110 --> 01:05:15,349
This is one of Silent Monster's
staff, Chae Ro Woon.

968
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:19,920
Hello. I'm Hwan Gi's sister.

969
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:21,489
My name is Eun Yi Soo.

970
01:05:21,519 --> 01:05:23,760
I didn't know Boss had a sister.

971
01:05:24,489 --> 01:05:26,460
And you're so beautiful.

972
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,630
I'm Chae Ro Woon.

973
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:30,730
What brings you here?

974
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,630
I'm just stopping by to drop off
Hwan Gi's Christmas gift.

975
01:05:34,769 --> 01:05:36,500
I'll give you yours in the evening.

976
01:05:36,539 --> 01:05:37,940
You haven't forgotten
about it, right?

977
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:39,710
No.

978
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:41,639
He has a fiancee.

979
01:05:51,849 --> 01:05:53,190
I see.

980
01:05:54,889 --> 01:05:55,989
Pardon?

981
01:05:57,329 --> 01:05:58,630
It's nothing.

982
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:03,000
I was just admiring the two of you
because you look so lovely together.

983
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:15,139
Hey.

984
01:06:15,909 --> 01:06:18,679
Ta-da. Merry Christmas!

985
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:19,980
What is this?

986
01:06:22,349 --> 01:06:25,289
I'm sorry.
I didn't get you anything.

987
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,389
Then just cook me a meal.

988
01:06:28,889 --> 01:06:31,690
I'm craving your kimchi stew.

989
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:33,860
You're going out for dinner.

990
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:35,659
You're staying in, though.

991
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:41,340
I don't want you to eat alone on a
day like this. I'm being thoughtful.

992
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:46,010
I'll be fine.

993
01:06:49,579 --> 01:06:51,780
Go have something delicious
with Woo Il, Mom, and Dad.

994
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:55,420
Your kimchi stew is the most
delicious dish in the whole world.

995
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:57,449
Just make it for me, please.

996
01:06:57,489 --> 01:07:00,090
I'll only eat a little
as an appetizer. Please?

997
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:03,690
- Please.
- Please?

998
01:07:03,789 --> 01:07:04,889
Come on.

999
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:08,730
I'll think about it.

1000
01:07:17,239 --> 01:07:19,610
Hwan Gi, have you ever cooked
for your employees?

1001
01:07:19,639 --> 01:07:23,079
- For my employees?
- They'll fall in love with you.

1002
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:26,179
No. They don't even know
that I cook.

1003
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:28,420
- Really? Are you serious?
- Yes.

1004
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:32,289
- Did you not have lunch?
- No, I didn't.

1005
01:07:33,489 --> 01:07:35,619
The kimchi stew smells so amazing.

1006
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,230
Hwan Gi, can you also make me
some omelet?

1007
01:07:39,329 --> 01:07:40,590
- Omelet?
- Yes.

1008
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:42,130
Make it super thick.

1009
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:43,559
All right. Give me a few minutes.

1010
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,530
Toast some dried laver for me too.

1011
01:07:45,869 --> 01:07:48,900
I'm so used to what you make that
I can't eat other toasted laver.

1012
01:07:50,869 --> 01:07:52,809
Just a moment, okay?

1013
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:53,940
Hurry up.

1014
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:55,179
Wait.

1015
01:07:56,079 --> 01:07:57,309
I can't.

1016
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:01,219
- I should taste it.
- It's not done yet. Just wait.

1017
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:02,519
Hold on a moment.

1018
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:12,159
Do you want to taste it?

1019
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:19,229
How is it?

1020
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:21,270
Does it taste weird?

1021
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:25,939
- I think it's too bland.
- A little bit.

1022
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:33,050
Boss loves his sister so much.

1023
01:08:34,579 --> 01:08:36,050
Just like someone I know.

1024
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,020
Can I help you with anything?

1025
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:40,619
- Get me the frying pan.
- Okay.

1026
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:44,529
Is it still too bland?

1027
01:08:45,289 --> 01:08:46,989
(Dad)

1028
01:08:50,199 --> 01:08:51,399
What else should go in here?

1029
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:54,270
Hello?

1030
01:08:54,369 --> 01:08:55,739
Have you eaten yet?

1031
01:08:58,869 --> 01:09:00,210
(Go, Team Silent Monster!)

1032
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:06,380
Are you busy?

1033
01:09:07,619 --> 01:09:10,479
- Today...
- I'll let you go if you're busy.

1034
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:27,130
What am I doing right now?

1035
01:09:27,569 --> 01:09:29,340
Thinking that I must
avenge Ji Hye's death,

1036
01:09:29,939 --> 01:09:31,840
I'm causing unnecessary trouble.

1037
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:41,550
All right.

1038
01:10:15,449 --> 01:10:17,180
Taxi!

1039
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:20,989
Where did they all go?

1040
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:30,899
Boss?

1041
01:10:38,439 --> 01:10:39,539
Are you not getting in?

1042
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,479
I will. I will get in.
Just a second.

1043
01:10:50,850 --> 01:10:52,050
Get off.

1044
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:55,720
You just told me to get in.

1045
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,119
Not there.

1046
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:38,630
Can you spend your time like this
on a day like today?

1047
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:42,399
It's not like I'm your sister.

1048
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:52,479
To tell you the truth, Mr. Kang
did make my heart flutter a little.

1049
01:11:52,779 --> 01:11:54,319
But that's really all.

1050
01:11:56,079 --> 01:11:57,520
You don't have to tell me.

1051
01:11:58,619 --> 01:12:02,260
You're the one who told me
that I should be honest...

1052
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,289
- with myself.
- That was about the presentation.

1053
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:07,699
I did all that to teach you
how to get work done.

1054
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:10,130
You put in all that effort
to teach me.

1055
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:16,500
I guess my sincerity
isn't good enough.

1056
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:21,979
An uncommon approach that
can't appeal to the public.

1057
01:12:23,479 --> 01:12:26,479
People who are scared of
talking on the phone.

1058
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:29,220
I guess they are uncommon.

1059
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,020
Even I am this frustrated.

1060
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:34,149
What will other people think of me?

1061
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:47,029
Thanks for the ride.

1062
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:49,439
You should get going.

1063
01:12:54,010 --> 01:12:55,810
Aren't you going to leave?

1064
01:12:57,909 --> 01:13:02,020
Well... Is there anything
I can help you with?

1065
01:13:02,579 --> 01:13:04,520
Is it because
today is Christmas Eve?

1066
01:13:04,619 --> 01:13:06,449
What's up with you today, Boss?

1067
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:09,060
You're acting like Mr. Kang.

1068
01:13:11,159 --> 01:13:14,600
- Will you be okay?
- Don't worry. Just get going.

1069
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,430
I'm not your sister.

1070
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:20,630
Why don't you zip me up, then?

1071
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:32,979
My sister loved me so much just like
how you're with your sister.

1072
01:13:34,409 --> 01:13:35,720
Actually,

1073
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:39,289
my sister used to do volunteer work
at this orphanage.

1074
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,859
She always came here
on days like today.

1075
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,529
She went somewhere far away,

1076
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:50,630
so I came in her place.

1077
01:13:52,930 --> 01:13:55,640
I miss my sister.

1078
01:13:56,539 --> 01:13:59,909
Today, I miss her even more
than usual.

1079
01:14:03,909 --> 01:14:05,180
What are you doing?

1080
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:07,710
The kids are waiting.

1081
01:14:15,189 --> 01:14:18,130
This is just... Don't mind me.

1082
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:21,430
It's nothing. It's just...

1083
01:14:22,529 --> 01:14:23,829
Take it off.

1084
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:27,029
Pardon me?

1085
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,310
What are you doing right now?

1086
01:14:31,569 --> 01:14:33,140
- Take it off.
- Gosh...

1087
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:36,479
Goodness. Why should I take it off?

1088
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:42,319
Are you going to wear it?

1089
01:14:43,149 --> 01:14:45,890
No way. You're not actually
going to do it, right?

1090
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,859
Gosh. Why are you...

1091
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:53,890
What on earth
are you doing right now?

1092
01:14:54,529 --> 01:14:57,760
It won't fit you.
The costume won't suit you at all.

1093
01:14:58,569 --> 01:14:59,829
Seriously...

1094
01:15:01,939 --> 01:15:03,800
You're so weird today.

1095
01:15:04,369 --> 01:15:06,369
Why have you changed so much?

1096
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:10,979
Because you're Chae Ro Woon.

1097
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:13,079
Pardon?

1098
01:15:13,409 --> 01:15:14,920
You're Chae Ro Woon,

1099
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,279
not Eun Yi Soo.

1100
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:28,460
Wait.

1101
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,869
Boss, hold on. That's...

1102
01:15:32,430 --> 01:15:34,000
Hold on!

1103
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,699
Boss!

1104
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:40,310
Wait for me.

1105
01:15:40,409 --> 01:15:42,779
You can't do that.

1106
01:15:43,779 --> 01:15:45,310
(Merry Christmas!)

1107
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:49,350
Wow, a panda.

1108
01:15:53,619 --> 01:15:54,920
Isn't it cute?

1109
01:15:54,989 --> 01:15:56,489
- Yes!
- Yes!

1110
01:16:00,659 --> 01:16:03,029
It's okay
because my face is covered.

1111
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,739
It's okay because they're kids.

1112
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:19,579
The adults
are unexpectedly enjoying it too.

1113
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:31,430
I've changed.

1114
01:16:36,529 --> 01:16:39,399
(My Shy Boss)

1115
01:16:39,729 --> 01:16:41,970
- Where is Ms. Chae?
- The monkey took the bag.

1116
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,340
- It snatched it.
- When? Where did it go?

1117
01:16:44,369 --> 01:16:45,609
- Why are you following me?
- I'm not.

1118
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,239
I'm here to find Ro Woon.

1119
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:48,409
- What?
- Hey!

1120
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:51,909
There must be a way
to communicate with Boss.

1121
01:16:51,949 --> 01:16:52,979
Don't change.

1122
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:54,579
Are you still not settled
with Woo Il?

1123
01:16:54,609 --> 01:16:56,279
Why are you so shy?

1124
01:16:56,319 --> 01:16:59,390
What's wrong with the boss
looking after his staff?

1125
01:16:59,649 --> 01:17:00,989
My camera. Have you seen it?

1126
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:02,819
Did you see the pictures inside it
or not?

1127
01:17:02,859 --> 01:17:04,729
If he looks like he has a lot
on his mind,

1128
01:17:04,829 --> 01:17:07,960
he needs time and space alone
to sort it out.

1129
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:10,659
That's when Hwan Gi comes closer.
