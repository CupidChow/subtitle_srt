1
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:22,049
I can't believe
you're making japchae alone.

2
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,420
You make it look as easy
as cooking instant noodles.

3
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,689
I thought someone might visit me.

4
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,459
Here. Try some.

5
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:31,700
Use these chopsticks.

6
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,810
I want the recipe for this.

7
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,950
Just visit me when you have cravings
for it. I'll make it for you.

8
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,409
Don't be so difficult.

9
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,319
Give it to me as a wedding gift.

10
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,920
I want to make it for my husband.

11
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,590
Do you...

12
00:01:58,659 --> 00:01:59,819
have to marry him?

13
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,099
I will marry him.

14
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:07,200
I want to.

15
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,699
- Yi Soo.
- And...

16
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:13,569
I want to be congratulated.

17
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:17,639
If you don't congratulate me on it,

18
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,509
I'll be very sad.

19
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,050
Woo Il.

20
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:28,520
Come with me
to the broadcasting station.

21
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:32,919
It's for a radio show,
but they'll film it as well.

22
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,860
I want to make sure
Dad's outfit looks good.

23
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,030
And if you have time,

24
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,530
can we stop by somewhere
before that?

25
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,969
I'm asking you out on a date.

26
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,310
I'm sorry. There's something
I have to take care of at work.

27
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:50,509
All right then.

28
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,710
See you at the broadcasting station.

29
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,280
What is with you?

30
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,379
You're not avoiding eye contact.

31
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:33,689
I am avoiding it.

32
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:37,819
Are you...

33
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,659
not going to close your eyes?

34
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,930
I'm doing my very best...

35
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,400
to avoid it.

36
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,939
Close your eyes, please.

37
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,050
What will you do
if I poke your eyes?

38
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,949
You said something came up at work.

39
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:35,779
Is this where you work?

40
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,980
Is this where you wanted to stop by?

41
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,350
Right, this is work for you.

42
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,350
All right, do your work.

43
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:44,259
I'll enjoy my date.

44
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,019
I was just about to leave...

45
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,629
You came together.

46
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,560
Thank you for coming.

47
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,399
Congratulations
on the successful grand opening.

48
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,069
I'd like to congratulate you two
on getting married.

49
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,500
Thank you.

50
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,410
That necklace.

51
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:31,040
I have the exact same necklace.

52
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:35,870
Really?

53
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:40,339
This has a special meaning to me.

54
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,980
Let's go.

55
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,720
I want to see Hwan Gi
before we leave.

56
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:52,319
Did I say something offensive?

57
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,959
Goodness.

58
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,829
Oh, boy.

59
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,529
- Hello.
- Please have a seat here.

60
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,199
- Hello, Mr. Kim.
- Oh, hello.

61
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,600
He'll only be asked the questions
he has agreed to answer, right?

62
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,709
- Of course.
- Please take good care of him.

63
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,910
Thank you for all of your help.

64
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:13,009
- Please make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

65
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,519
You're the best.

66
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,399
As you know, the Seoul mayoral
election is just around the corner.

67
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,560
Today, we have the candidate,
Congressman Eun Bok Dong here...

68
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,629
to discuss his major promises
as well as youth policies.

69
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,670
Hello, Congressman Eun.

70
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:43,240
You're known for the legendary
success of your PR agency.

71
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:48,910
In the old days, you could actualize
your dream even if you had nothing.

72
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:51,350
I'm fully aware of the fact
that things are very different now.

73
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,250
Youth unemployment rate
is especially...

74
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,259
But didn't you
pass the company down...

75
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,060
to your son?

76
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:10,839
My son used to be
one of the two co-CEOs.

77
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:12,899
He has left the position, though.
Someone else is running...

78
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:15,569
I am aware.
He's your future son-in-law, right?

79
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,910
Anyway, the fact that you're passing
it down to your family member...

80
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,310
will anger many people who are
not from such privileged families.

81
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:29,620
He does not come from
a privileged background at all.

82
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,490
He grew up in an orphanage.

83
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,430
Rich people who set up their
children together strategically...

84
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:41,170
to increase their wealth
really irk me.

85
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,540
I'm always rooting for talented
people who come from nothing.

86
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,069
I've financially supported
such capable young people.

87
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,009
I think there are 4 or 5 in total.

88
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:54,009
- Talent and hard work are...
- Is this why he expedited...

89
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:56,509
- announcing our wedding?
- the most important things, right?

90
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,059
Woo Il, you must be angry
because of my dad.

91
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:40,519
That question was unexpected,
so he was probably flustered...

92
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,830
I'm going to be away for a while.

93
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,500
I'll tell your parents.

94
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,029
What do you mean?

95
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,870
Where are you going?

96
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,509
I can't face you.

97
00:08:57,809 --> 00:08:59,580
I can't go on like this.

98
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,879
- Woo Il.
- You've done nothing wrong.

99
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:05,679
I...

100
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,649
I'm sorry.

101
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,139
Where is he?

102
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:27,200
Woo Il!

103
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,490
No.

104
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,899
Don't go.

105
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,309
I can't face you.

106
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,610
I can't go on like this.

107
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:18,289
Should we call an ambulance?

108
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:27,830
Cheers.

109

Was it Steve? Or Smith?

116

You said you'd dig into the truth.

117
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,200
Right. Mr. Smith.

118
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:05,139
Come to think of it, I haven't got
any flowers in a while.

119

What are you doing these days
at Brain?

120
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:12,309
Are you going to stay there forever?

121
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,940
Aren't you ever going to
perform again?

122
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,220
What's wrong with me?

123
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:31,100
Mr. Smith hasn't sent me
any flowers in a while,

124
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,659
and I don't feel anything.

125
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,799
I didn't even notice it.

126
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,039
Looking for Mr. Smith
was just an excuse.

127
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:45,740
What was I doing?

128
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,320
Did I want to...

129
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,519
be complimented by him or something?

130
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:58,960
It's a signal light.

131
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,830
You communicate your mood
using different colors.

132

A red light means "stop".

133

When you're available for urgent
matters, turn on the yellow light.

134
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,700
Come when the green light is on.

135
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:13,200

Just a high five.

139
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,850
Do you have anything to say to me?

140
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:26,679
"My gosh, you're really good."

141
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:28,850
"Where did you learn
how to do this?"

142
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:32,519
"Thanks for helping us
reduce the expenses."

00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,460
she should stay in hospital
for a week.

168
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,360
The problem is
that we found several scars...

169
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:31,659
on her thighs
during the examination.

170
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,000
I think she tried to injure herself.
Did you know about it?

171
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,340
Yes, I did.

172
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,169
Please don't tell...

173
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:46,539
anyone else.

174
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:00,620
I told her I'd move out.

175
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,960
Yi Soo got shocked...

176
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,769
and followed me.

177
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,099
She might have jumped
in front of the car on purpose.

178
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:17,240
I feel like it's my fault.
It breaks my heart...

179
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,640
and I feel guilty, but...

180
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:21,650
Please stay...

181
00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:25,349
with Yi Soo.

182
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:30,390
I know I shouldn't...

183
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:33,890
ask you for this.

184
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,359
But please.

185
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:40,500
No matter how I'm feeling,

186
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:44,200
do you want me to stay with her?

187
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:46,839
Yi Soo needs you right now
no matter what.

188
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,210
Please.

189
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:51,740
Will you do me a favor in return?

190
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,750
Fire Chae Ro Woon.

191
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,339
At first, I wanted to
open this door...

192
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,309
by all means.

193
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,349
At some point,

194
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,019
I started to wait
in front of the door...

195
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:36,390
instead of knocking on it.

196
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:38,319
I won't try to change you.

197
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:40,890
I thought it was okay even if the
door was closed sometimes.

198
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:42,630
Don't change.

199
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,960
I hoped the door would open someday.

200
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,569
And finally...

201
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:49,730
And...

202
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,869
thank you...

203
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,000
for staying by my side.

204
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,839
Unexpectedly, he opened the door...

205
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,779
from the inside.

206
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,250
Will it be okay...

207
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:14,390
if I go through this door?

208
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,130
Well...

209
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,769
May I come in?

210
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,769
Well...

211
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,109
No. You can't.

212
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,220
Ro Woon, they reassigned some staff.

213
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,250
Pardon?

214
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,289
Didn't you know, Ro Woon?

215
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,490
Hold on.

216
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,730
I packed up your things already.

217
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:28,230
What do you mean reassigned?
I don't understand...

218
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,140
Boss!

219
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,809
You've been reassigned
to downstairs.

220
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,640
You know your way down, right?

221
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,650
Hey, hold on.

222
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:45,049
Boss!

223
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,750
Wait!

224
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,490
Did I do something wrong?

225
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:54,359
It's not your fault. It's mine.

226
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:58,059
What do you mean?
Can you at least explain?

227
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,299
If you can't send her away, I will.

228
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,599
Silent Monster needs her.

229
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,099
It's you who needs her,

230
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:08,440
not Silent Monster.

231
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,809
You tell me to stay with Yi Soo,

232
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,180
but you're trying to keep the one
you want by your side.

233
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,180
I don't mind showing my weakness,

234
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,480
but what about your sister?

235
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,349
If you keep her with you, she'll
keep facing Yi Soo.

236
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:27,359
Then Yi Soo will find out.

237
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,230
I have the exact same necklace.

238
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:34,670
What do you plan on doing with her?

239
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:37,029
I don't dare...

240
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,740
- I won't do anything to her.
- I know.

241
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,069
You won't do anything.

242
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,039
You'll act ignorant.

243
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,809
All you'll do is watch,
not knowing what to do.

244
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:49,380
That's why I'll do it.

245
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,750
I'll kick her out.

246
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:57,019
- How...
- I'll figure it out.

247
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,819
All you have to do is step back...

248
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,190
like you have always done.

249
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:20,180
Why is it you?

250
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:24,650
I didn't sense anything.

251
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:28,019
- Even last night...
- Did something happen?

252
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,420
He called me.

253
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,230
So what?

254
00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:37,430
It's pretty common,

255
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,730
but I've never received a call
from Boss before.

256
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:41,799
- He called me too.
- Pardon?

257
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,769
Come to think of it,
he called me as well.

258
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:46,900
You too?

259
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,170
What is all this mess?

260
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,339
Gosh.

261
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,150
My goodness.

262
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,380
Hello? Who is this?

263
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:03,220
Who?

264
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,960
Yes, Boss. What is it?

265
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,390
Yes. Pardon?

266
00:23:09,829 --> 00:23:12,259
I know it already, and I am...

267
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:15,430
I can't hear you.
Can you talk louder?

268
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,230
What I mean is...

269
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:19,269
Not again!

270
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,470
I have never called you before.

271
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:26,279
Me too!

272
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,849
I'm sorry, but now is not a good...

273
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,150
Hey! No!

274
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,619
Gosh. I told you to stop.

275
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,920
Why do you keep drawing on the wall?

276
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,220
Come here. Stop it.

277
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:44,190
Tell me. Tell me why.

278
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:47,230
Gosh. My goodness.

279
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:03,750
I see. Boss called everyone,
and not just me.

280
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,579
What did he say to you?

281
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:14,019
I was preoccupied with the kids...

282
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:16,430
We didn't talk much.

283
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:18,930
We just hung up after a boring talk.

284
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,730
Right?

285
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,599
- To me, he said...
- He said I did well.

286
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,240
That's why I went around
by foot for market research.

287
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:31,940
Boss, it's about the new paint PR.

288
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:34,809
We need to take a completely
different approach.

289
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,410
If we do it the same way,
we'll all die.

290
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,980
We need to make our own signature.

291
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:41,480
- Boss, are you listening?
- Yes.

292
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,750
Shall I make a video call?
Let's talk face to face.

293
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:45,990
I'm listening to you.

294
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,829
- I'm listening.
- Boss, there are a lot of paints.

295
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:50,890
There are oil and acrylic.
There are so many kinds.

296
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,829
You all received compliments.

297
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:57,230
To me, that wasn't all.

298
00:24:57,269 --> 00:24:59,839
What is it? Did he thank you
for being with him?

299
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:03,509
What? Did he say that to you too?

300
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,509
Did he say the same thing
to everyone?

301
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:08,680
Se Jong, where have you been?

302
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:10,950
Where is Gyo Ri?

303
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:14,990
My girlfriend is busy
getting dressed up.

304
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,650
It's a goodbye party for Ro Woon.

305
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,019
We should send her off beautifully.

306
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:22,829
Honey?

307
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,779
Who are you?

308
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:43,779
My goodness,
did you buy new clothes?

309
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:45,779
Your makeup is strong.

310
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,480
You look good today.

311
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,990
Se Jong did it for me.

312
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,160
Come and sit down, honey.

313
00:25:55,829 --> 00:25:57,960
- Okay.
- Sit down.

314
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,670
Gyo Ri, did Boss call you as well?

315
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,970
Are you talking about...

316
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,009
his thanking us? That call?

317
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:14,309
What is this? He really did
say the same thing to everyone.

318
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:18,750
All right. Honey, open up.

319
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:23,720
Good.

320
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,619
Here.

321
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:30,589
Is Boss not going to show up?

322
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:36,569
Hello.

323
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,740
What was the reason?

324
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,769
Why?

325
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,140
Why?

326
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:59,359
Would Mr. Kang know?

327
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,000
Your desk isn't this way.

328
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,829
I just wanted to see Mr. Kang.

329
00:27:08,869 --> 00:27:10,400
We at Brain...

330
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,869
follow a ranking
and reporting system.

331
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:16,869
You can't just barge into
the CEO's office.

332
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,380
If you need to report,
go through us first.

333
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,150
I see.

334
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,279
Follow me. I'll show you your seat.

335
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,869
No one's here yet
since we worked late last night.

336
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:50,569
I'm the first one today.

337
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,109
Shall I moisturize my face
before I start my day?

338
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:01,579
This is the best for my dry skin.

339
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,440
Boss?

340
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,509
Ro Woon.

341
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,589
Ro Woon.

342
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,829
My goodness, I'm sorry.

343
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,539
I'm sorry.

344
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,109
Boss, do you need something?

345
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:03,210
You know how to clip articles,
right?

346
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,849
(Clipping involves collecting
articles relevant to clients.)

347
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:08,990
By the way, all by myself?

348
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,390
Collect articles and list them up.

349
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,660
It needs to be sent
to our clients in this morning.

350
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:20,799
Are you telling me to go through
all articles by myself?

351
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:22,829
Good luck.

352
00:29:27,869 --> 00:29:29,210
Is it a red light again?

353
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,410
Ro Woon.

354
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:36,849
It's me again.

355
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,980
My goodness.

356
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,849
If you miss her so much,
bring her back.

357
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,920
Or just don't show it.

358
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:47,390
Ro Woon wasn't much of help,

359
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:49,859
but it does feel empty.

360
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,200
Why did you send her?

361
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:57,369
Will the rest of us be sent
one by one...

362
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,299
like Ro Woon?

363
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,839
The eco-friendly paint producer
sent an RFP.

364
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:06,440
Oh, right. Okay.

365
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:10,650
I'm thinking of visiting a client
after lunch.

366
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:12,920
Do that. Thank you.

367
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,789
Would you like to have lunch
with us?

368
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:23,990
I'm meeting someone.

369
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,960
Thank you for asking me.

370
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:28,500
Enjoy your lunch.

371
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,299
Let's go.

372
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,269
Let's go have lunch.

373
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:41,140
What should we eat?

374
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:50,950
I'm done.

375
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,359
Ms. Lee. Ms. Jung.

376
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,930
Why don't we go for...

377
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,099
Have they already left?

378
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,740
Excuse me.

379
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:19,420
I'm here to meet Mr. Eun Hwan Gi.

380
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,869
(Kindergarten)

381
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,920
(Kindergarten)

382
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,630
Boss.

383
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,730
She's not Chae Ro Woon.

384
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,299
She's not here.

385
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,720
Why do you look so blank?

386
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:31,789
Yun Jung.

387
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:36,289
My makeup looks nice today.

388
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,160
Did it make you speechless?

389
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,599
Does Boss have
such a cool female friend?

390
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,599
Or is she his girlfriend?

391
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,980
Why are you here?

392
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,980
I wanted to have lunch with you.

393
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,289
Are you having lunch together?

394
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:06,920
I brought lunch too.

395
00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:10,289
No. I'm going to eat
with my colleagues.

396
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,130
Boss and I...

397
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,599
only exchange superficial greetings.

398
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,339
I'm just one of
the five team members.

399
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,940
I'm not even that anymore.

400
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:36,190
Enjoy your...

401
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:38,819
lunch.

402
00:34:11,789 --> 00:34:15,219
I wanted to have lunch with you.

403
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,429
She didn't have anyone
to have lunch with her.

404
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:24,769
Is this how you treat your client?

405
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,440
Sorry?

406
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,440
You seem distracted.

407
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,980
If you're like this, how will I
get over what happened on Christmas?

408
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,610
I'm sorry.

409
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,880
Tell me.

410
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,320
You seem to be torturing yourself
over nothing again.

411
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,190
Who knows if I'll give you
a solution?

412
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:51,130
I'm concerned about
one of my employees.

413
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,559
- You are?
- Yes.

414
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:55,199
Send that employee
somewhere else then.

415
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:57,929
I already did.

416
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,300
But I'm still concerned.

417
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,099
I see.

418
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:04,469
Then...

419
00:35:05,909 --> 00:35:07,510
bring the employee back
in front of you.

420
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:10,150
How does that sound?
It's simple, right?

421
00:35:14,219 --> 00:35:15,920
Is it the girl I saw earlier?

422
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:18,050
The one who called you Boss.

423
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,699
You're doing better than I expected.

424
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:29,699
You even have an employee
who's so important to you.

425
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:32,969
After reading articles about you
in the States, I worried about you.

426
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,710
I was worried you'd
go into hiding again.

427
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,880
You said you wrote
a hateful comment.

428
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,039
Yes, I did. I wasn't joking.

429
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:47,920
Anyway, if you want her back,
don't hesitate too long.

430
00:35:48,949 --> 00:35:51,949
Look at me. Hitting on someone
too late doesn't work so well.

431
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:58,360
I'm planning an exhibition.

432
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:01,659
About the PR of the exhibition...

433
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,800
It doesn't have to be done by me,
right?

434
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,769
What do you mean?

435
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,309
My team is small.

436
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:12,170
We can't work on
many projects at the same time.

437
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,239
I see.

438
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,420
All right. Introduce me
to another team.

439
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,050
I'll talk to Woo Il about it.

440
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:27,019
I'll use personal reasons to get
close to you instead of work then.

441
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,130
- Sorry?
- How are you going to get away now?

442
00:36:37,969 --> 00:36:39,469
Someone must have
left their phone here.

443
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:47,510
It's rung many times, but I didn't
want to intrude on her privacy.

444
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,909
It must be something urgent.
Take it for her.

445
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:51,780
Should I?

446
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:59,059
(Kindergarten)

447
00:37:03,929 --> 00:37:07,300
Hello. This is
Ms. Dang Yoo He's phone.

448
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,500
Is her son sick?

449
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,599
Ro Woon.

450
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:16,510
Yoo Hee.

451
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,440
It's so nice to see you.

452
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,349
Great job.

453
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,550
Things are much better
than in the old days.

454
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:33,260
When I just started work,
I had to go through newspapers...

455
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:34,920
until my hands became black.

456
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,329
I've been so cold and lonely,
demoted alone to this tiny room.

457
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,599
Demoted? This is a favor.

458
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,039
Who are you?

459
00:37:49,409 --> 00:37:53,880
I'm his mom's...

460
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,210
boss at work.

461
00:37:57,849 --> 00:37:59,679
- Are you her boss?
- Yes.

462
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:02,849
Did she really ask you
to pick him up?

463
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,119
No, she didn't ask me.

464
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,019
I can't hand over the kid
to someone unidentified.

465
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:09,590
I'm sick.

466
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,099
Silent Monster was
nothing more than a campaign...

467
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:19,599
to cover up the power abuse issue
anyway.

468
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,070
I guess...

469
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:25,110
the team will be dissolved
eventually.

470
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:29,679
It's not your fault.

471
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,150
It's my fault.

472
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,789
He must have had a reason...

473
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:41,489
to send you here.

474
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,260
Was it...

475
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,730
for me?

476
00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:55,469
Yes, Boss.

477
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,170
Yoo Hee?

478
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:02,710
Yes. Her son is sick,
so he has to see a doctor.

479
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:05,280
Can you tell the teacher
that I'm not someone suspicious?

480
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:06,480
Here.

481
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,190
Yes, ma'am.

482
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,320
- Do you really know him?
- Mom!

483
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,159
Gosh, what's wrong?

484
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:16,489
You checked, right?

485
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:20,059
Hey, excuse me!

486
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:22,469
He wouldn't say where it hurts.

487
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,900
He keeps on asking for his mom.

488
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,869
I think he's faking
because he doesn't want to present.

489
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,670
Yes, you're on speakerphone.

490
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,610
Your son's listening to you.
Please calm him down.

491
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,750
Il Ho, I'm coming.

492
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:41,250
Mom, I'm hurting.

493
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,949
Where does it hurt? Is it your head?
Or your stomach?

494
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,320
We have to know where it hurts
to fix it.

495
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,429
Mom.

496
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,900
Now that I hear his voice,

497
00:39:56,469 --> 00:40:00,900
I think it's really serious.
What do I do?

498
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,639
Il Ho.

499
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:06,679
- Calm down. It's not that serious.
- My goodness.

500
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,909
I think it's a bowel problem.

501
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,710
Are you talking about poop?

502
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:13,750
Il Ho.

503
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:18,050
Il Ho. Il Ho.

504
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,920
Il Ho.

505
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:24,360
Il Ho.

506
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,500
Mom, I'm okay.

507
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,630
What's wrong with him?
Is it serious?

508
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:34,269
He has constipation.
His stomach is very gassy.

509
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,809
I see.

510
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:38,940
We'll take an x-ray
and give him an enema.

511
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:45,780
- Mom.
- It's okay.

512
00:40:46,449 --> 00:40:47,519
It's okay.

513
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,090
How did you know?

514
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:53,059
You keep such a distance
from other adults,

515
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,360
but do you speak in telepathy
with kids?

516
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,760
I just experienced
something similar before.

517
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:03,670
I was too embarrassed
to go to the washroom at daycare.

518
00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:06,969
Thank you.

519
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,610
Thank you so much.

520
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:12,210
It's nothing. Don't worry.

521
00:41:19,849 --> 00:41:21,449
(Woo Il)

522
00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:23,219
I'll make a quick visit.

523
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,289
- I'm coming up now.
- Now?

524
00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:00,420
Why are you out here?

525
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:04,159
Yi Soo.

526
00:42:06,699 --> 00:42:07,730
Yi Soo.

527
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,500
What are you doing?
You need to be in bed.

528
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,909
Get away from me.

529
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,679
What's wrong with you?

530
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:21,510
Don't come near me.

531
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:25,349
Get away from me. Please.

532
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:29,590
All right.

533
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,250
If you don't want to see me,
I'll leave.

534
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,019
But I need to put you back in bed.

535
00:42:35,289 --> 00:42:37,329
- If you go around like this...
- No!

536
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,170
I didn't wash my hair today.

537
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:50,710
What is this?

538
00:42:51,809 --> 00:42:54,409
Did you try to run
just because of your hair smell?

539
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:19,500
Hold on.

540
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:24,639
- Am I doing this right?
- Yes.

541
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,510
Okay.

542
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,250
Do you feel better?

543
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,489
I told you to leave.
You didn't have to.

544
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:39,760
Do we still have to be
careful around each other?

545
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:42,360
We grew up together.

546
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:45,159
I know that.

547
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,630
I know you don't see me as a woman.

548
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,170
That's why I have to try harder.

549
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,679
I'll do my best,

550
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,480
so just marry me.

551
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:09,849
I know you're being nice to me...

552
00:44:10,289 --> 00:44:12,019
because you want to leave me.

553
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,719
But I can't let you go.

554
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:23,599
Yi Soo.

555
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:25,829
Since my dad uses you,

556
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,269
you should use our marriage too.

557
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:32,110
If you can't love me,

558
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,380
marry me for the company.

559
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,610
I'd be fine with that.

560
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:45,289
Let's go back. You'll catch a cold.

561
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:47,159
Okay.

562
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,000
Here.

563
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:56,769
Me too.

564
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,130
- Okay.
- Here.

565
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,309
- Is it good?
- Yes.

566
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,409
Good.

567
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,510
This is hard to believe.

568
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,780
Boss is at my house.

569
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:15,920
You asked him to come eat
at your place,

570
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,949
and your sons were begging him
to come.

571
00:45:17,989 --> 00:45:22,190
Even still, he picked them up
and even went to the hospital.

572
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,400
He's even making food in my kitchen.

573
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:30,400
- Could this be the power of love?
- Love?

574
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,510
If I was rude, I can go home now...

575
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:39,809
No, it's not like that.

576
00:45:39,909 --> 00:45:42,739
Mister, don't go.

577
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:45,280
- Don't go.
- What?

578
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,480
- Don't go.
- Don't go.

579
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:50,519
- Please don't go.
- Don't go.

580
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:54,019
- Please.
- Please.

581
00:45:54,289 --> 00:45:55,489
Okay, okay.

582
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,730
I guess Il Ho likes him very much.

583
00:45:57,829 --> 00:46:00,159
They are similar for certain.

584
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,199
You probably noticed,

585
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:06,099
but he couldn't even say
that he needed to go to the toilet.

586
00:46:06,269 --> 00:46:08,340
He was suffering with
all that was piled up inside.

587
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:11,869
You made
all these vegetable dishes...

588
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:15,880
so that Il Ho won't get sick again.
Thank you so much.

589
00:46:16,449 --> 00:46:18,880
It's better than your cooking.

590
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:21,349
I'm mad. Eat a lot.

591
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,449
Okay.

592
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:27,860
Shall us adults have some beer?
Cheers.

593
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,329
- Cheers.
- I'll just raise my glass.

594
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:31,690
I drove here.

595
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,429
You can leave the car here.

596
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,030
You'll drive her home, right?

597
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:46,840
It's done by the kids...

598
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:50,349
The place is messy, isn't it?

599
00:46:52,579 --> 00:46:55,219
He must have drawn
the presentation day.

600
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,119
No way.

601
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:01,260
It's just a heap of yarns
in my eyes.

602
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:02,559
Gosh.

603
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,500
That's Mom.

604
00:47:08,699 --> 00:47:09,769
That's Il Ho.

605
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,170
I think there's something
he wants to say.

606
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:23,849
Why do you keep drawing on the wall?

607
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,219
Come here. Stop it.

608
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:29,849
Tell me. Tell me why.

609
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:33,090
Gosh. My goodness.

610
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,300
Is that true?

611
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,329
Yes.

612
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,769
I thought you were just doodling.

613
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,210
You want your mom to come
when you present, don't you?

614
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:54,110
Yes.

615
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,880
Unfortunately, that day...

616
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:03,219
is the presentation day for
the eco-friendly paint.

617
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,349
I'll do it. I can.

618
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:08,420
You're not in our team anymore.

619
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:12,030
I'm the only one that can do it.

620
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,010
I see.

621
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:28,510
No, no.

622
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,050
I feel bad
about the last presentation too.

623
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:33,880
This time, I'll definitely do it.

624
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,760
You won't do anything.

625
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,559
I'll do it.

626
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:48,099
Pardon?

627
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:51,969
I'll do it.

628
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,010
Are you sure?

629
00:48:57,639 --> 00:48:59,210
You'll do it yourself?

630
00:49:05,179 --> 00:49:08,280
Does that mean
you can come to our kindergarten?

631
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,519
Amazing!

632
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:13,090
- Yes!
- Can I really go?

633
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:14,789
My gosh.

634
00:49:15,389 --> 00:49:16,659
Yes!

635
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:18,789
Give Mommy a kiss.

636
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,760
One more kiss. Gosh, my baby.

637
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:24,170
Come here.

638
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:25,570
You guys should thank him.

639
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,639
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

640
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:33,809
Could this be the power of love?

641
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:44,889
Boss, do you love Yoo Hee?

642
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:48,489
Sorry? What are you talking about?

643
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:51,190
That's the only
plausible explanation.

644
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,800
I mean, you volunteered
to do the presentation yourself.

645
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,570
What are you going to do now?

646
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,369
That's what love does to people.

647
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,610
It makes you do useless things
out of the blue.

648
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:09,480
The person who makes me do
useless things...

649
00:50:10,949 --> 00:50:13,119
- is someone else.
- So it's not Yoo Hee?

650
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,519
No.

651
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:15,719
Then...

652
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:20,960
Is it the lady who visited you
at work the other day?

653
00:50:23,289 --> 00:50:25,760
No. Not now.

654
00:50:27,329 --> 00:50:30,300
Not now? Does that mean things
might work out in the future?

655
00:50:30,329 --> 00:50:33,070
Or is she your past love?

656
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:36,239
In any case, it's not her.

657
00:50:44,349 --> 00:50:45,510
Okay.

658
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:00,000
Then who is it?

659
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,230
Who keeps making you do
useless things?

660
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,230
Is it someone I know?

661
00:51:06,969 --> 00:51:09,869
What will you do
if it's someone you know?

662
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:11,369
Well, I'm just...

663
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:14,079
I'll thank the person first.

664
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,449
For taking care of you even though
you still have so much to learn.

665
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,489
I should pretend
I didn't see it, right?

666
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:27,289
I didn't see anything.
I can't see anything.

667
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:29,889
But no matter how hard
I try to ignore it,

668
00:51:29,929 --> 00:51:32,630
I cannot stop staring at it.

669
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,699
Her red lips make
the refreshing green color...

670
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:38,800
stand out even more.
How can I not look at it?

671
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:40,639
This is so difficult.

672
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,139
Should I tell her?

673
00:51:43,739 --> 00:51:47,579
It doesn't bother me,
but what if someone else sees it?

674
00:51:48,739 --> 00:51:51,750
She's smiling like that
because she has no clue.

675
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:53,579
Somebody has to tell her.

676
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,320
Why does it have to be me, though?

677
00:51:56,719 --> 00:51:58,920
I wish it was stuck in my teeth,
not hers.

678
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:02,690
Is there a way to tell her
without embarrassing her?

679
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,730
No way. Is it me?

680
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,039
Well...

681
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,079
It's the green light.

682
00:52:23,909 --> 00:52:25,210
The green light?

683
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:31,789
Boss.

684
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:45,130
You mean, right now?

685
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,309
- Right here?
- I won't look.

686
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:52,769
Hurry up.

687
00:53:33,619 --> 00:53:35,079
This is wrong.

688
00:53:36,019 --> 00:53:39,590
You're the one who confessed.
Why are you asking me for a kiss?

689
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:42,690
My feelings for you
aren't there yet.

690
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:46,599
Sorry? What do you mean?

691
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,969
And who confessed?
What are you talking about?

692
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,469
And what about a kiss?

693
00:53:51,699 --> 00:53:54,170
Well... You were...

694
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,369
staring right into my eyes
just now and said...

695
00:53:59,809 --> 00:54:01,610
that it's the green light.

696
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,579
Well...

697
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:07,650
It looks like... Gosh.

698
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,489
I think you got the wrong idea.

699
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,420
What I meant was...

700
00:54:17,389 --> 00:54:18,530
Smile.

701
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,530
Do it.

702
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:33,940
Ro Woon, I wasn't going to look.

703
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,139
Ro Woon.

704
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:38,780
Ro Woon!

705
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:40,150
Wait, Ro Woon!

706
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,019
What just happened?

707
00:54:46,889 --> 00:54:48,559
Was she going to kiss me?

708
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:51,659
Me? A kiss?

709
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,059
A kiss?

710
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:08,610
Well, this is... This is wrong.

711
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:11,809
You're the one who confessed.
Why are you asking me for a kiss?

712
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:15,619
My feelings for you
aren't there yet.

713
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:19,949
Not there yet?
Then where are they now?

714
00:55:21,789 --> 00:55:23,690
I don't have an answer to that,

715
00:55:27,159 --> 00:55:28,530
but it means it's coming along.

716
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:31,800
That's right.

717
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:35,199
I'm dizzy.

718
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:37,070
I'm crazy.

719
00:55:37,909 --> 00:55:41,110
I'm so crazy. I must've been
completely out of my mind.

720
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,679
- I'm...
- What are you doing now?

721
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:57,690
Hey, I heard you told your dad
that you've found another job.

722
00:55:57,789 --> 00:55:58,989
Well, that's...

723
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:02,360
I need to finish up
what I've started.

724
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:05,530
Boss is saying that he'd do
the presentation himself...

725
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:06,739
Do you like Eun Hwan Gi?

726
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:15,039
That must be why you keep
using Mr. Smith as an excuse.

727
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:19,579
Do you want to make sure that he's
not responsible for Ji Hye's death?

728
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:22,920
Do you need permission
that you can like him?

729
00:56:24,989 --> 00:56:26,150
He is...

730
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:30,489
the one who drove
your sister to death.

731
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,429
Mr. Smith never even existed.

732
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:40,900
There is no alternative truth.

733
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:47,309
So please...

734
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,250
get him out of your life, okay?

735
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,190
(Letter of Resignation)

736
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:13,269
In order to highlight the pros
of using eco-friendly paints,

737
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,639
I thought it'd be good
to use images of the nature.

738
00:57:17,269 --> 00:57:18,309
I like it.

739
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:21,210
Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt,

740
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,650
but as far as I know,
Silent Monster...

741
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:26,820
is supposed to participate
in the bidding.

742
00:57:27,019 --> 00:57:28,250
We're aware.

743
00:57:28,349 --> 00:57:30,489
Mr. Eun will do
the presentation himself.

744
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:32,389
We know that as well.

745
00:57:33,389 --> 00:57:36,929
That's precisely why
Mr. Kang needs to get involved.

746
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,800
How can you take our project
without even consulting me?

747
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:49,500
That company has had
a long-term contract with Brain.

748
00:57:49,739 --> 00:57:51,309
I couldn't turn a blind eye to it.

749
00:57:53,409 --> 00:57:56,039
The client said
they want us to participate.

750
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:58,150
They probably haven't watched
the clip of your presentation.

751
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:02,579
I'm not trying to talk you down.

752
00:58:02,949 --> 00:58:05,320
I know how capable you are
more than anyone else.

753
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:08,460
But not the presentation.
You can't do it.

754
00:58:10,429 --> 00:58:11,489
What if I do it?

755
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:13,489
You'll present in front
of all the people?

756
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,199
I've been doing it for you for
20 years because of your phobia.

757
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:18,570
But what if I do it?

758
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,300
What if I pull it off...

759
00:58:24,469 --> 00:58:25,510
without you?

760
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,179
I don't like the sound of that.

761
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:33,309
Are you saying that I've been
a roadblock for you or what?

762
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:36,619
Do you think I've been doing it
for selfish reasons?

763
00:58:37,719 --> 00:58:39,389
Don't you care
about the company's reputation?

764
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:42,190
Just stay in your office
as we've been doing...

765
00:58:42,219 --> 00:58:43,730
I want Ro Woon back.

766
00:58:43,989 --> 00:58:44,989
What?

767
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:47,159
If I pull it off...

768
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,500
If Silent Monster wins a contract,

769
00:58:51,269 --> 00:58:53,170
send her back to my team.

770
00:58:54,099 --> 00:58:56,070
Do you not know why
I sent her to the clipping room?

771
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:58,409
I know that you don't think
I can pull it off.

772
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:06,750
All right then.

773
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:08,949
Do it.

774
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:12,489
But you know what?

775
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:14,389
You'll have to beat me too.

776
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,900
Do we have to compete...

777
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,969
for the same project when
we're in the same company?

778
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,969
Think of it as a backup option.

779
00:59:29,070 --> 00:59:32,510
It's for the company's long-term
client. I can't let them down.

780
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,110
Why are they fighting over Ro Woon?

781
00:59:39,949 --> 00:59:42,719
Does he care about her that much?

782
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:55,159
You'll be competing against
the master of public speaking,

783
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,130
Mr. Kang.

784
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,670
I'm still going to do it.

785
01:00:00,099 --> 01:00:03,099
Will you really be able
to do the presentation?

786
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:04,340
I will do it.

787
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:08,909
"I won't say anything."

788
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:12,179
"I won't meet anyone." He has been
saying those things all along.

789
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:14,380
What does he want to do
the presentation so much this time?

790
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,800
I'm Eun Hwan Gi from Silent Monster.

791
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:31,099
Eun Hwan Gi. Hwan Gi.

792
01:00:38,269 --> 01:00:39,510
I'm Eun Hwan Gi.

793
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,039
Silent Monster...

794
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:44,809
Eun Hwan Gi... I'm Eun Hwan Gi.

795
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,880
My name is Eun Hwan Gi. Hwan Gi...

796
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,690
Even ants won't be able to hear you.

797
01:00:54,219 --> 01:00:55,289
Gosh, you startled me.

798
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,130
Put this on and meet me outside.

799
01:01:08,199 --> 01:01:09,500
"I'm Eun Hwan Gi."

800
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,150
"I'm Eun Hwan Gi."

801
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:21,719
Gosh, seriously.

802
01:01:21,949 --> 01:01:24,250
I said you have to run. Run!

803
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:26,590
- It's cold.
- Run. Come on!

804
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:30,289
One, two, one, two.

805
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:34,159
Run. One, two.

806
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:38,099
Come on. Run.

807
01:01:43,969 --> 01:01:45,210
Run.

808
01:01:45,739 --> 01:01:48,380
Run. One, two.

809
01:01:48,409 --> 01:01:49,909
That's it.

810
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,820
Why are you staring at me like that?

811
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:07,599
Run. Come on.

812
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:14,800
Run.

813
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:18,539
- Go on.
- One, two.

814
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,210
One, two.

815
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:22,409
Stand straight and tall.

816
01:02:23,809 --> 01:02:26,579
Make sure your spine
and neck are straight.

817
01:02:27,219 --> 01:02:29,280
What are we doing now?

818
01:02:29,719 --> 01:02:33,420
Keep your eyes aligned
with the horizon.

819
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:35,989
- Chin up.
- Ro Woon, what is this about?

820
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:40,360
Flex your legs and stand firmly.

821
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:44,130
Make sure you won't falter
even if someone pushes you.

822
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:45,599
What are we doing at this hour?

823
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:48,769
- Okay?
- There.

824
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,300
What on earth
are you doing right now?

825
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,070
Goodness.

826
01:03:21,969 --> 01:03:23,039
You startled me.

827
01:03:23,969 --> 01:03:25,570
What do you think I'm doing?

828
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:28,409
I'm trying to help you, Boss.

829
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:33,980
I've never liked...

830
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:37,619
being called Boss.

831
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:41,989
I didn't think
I deserved that title.

832
01:03:43,659 --> 01:03:47,929
"Trust me and stay by my side."
I didn't think...

833
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,329
I deserved to ask anyone
to stay beside me.

834
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:55,340
Is that why you kicked me out?

835
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:58,639
I knew it.

836
01:03:58,739 --> 01:04:00,139
So please stop...

837
01:04:01,309 --> 01:04:03,809
- wasting your time by my side...
- What is wrong with you?

838
01:04:04,349 --> 01:04:08,449
Don't talk down to yourself. That's
why everyone belittles the team.

839
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:12,550
Didn't you thank me
for being by your side?

840
01:04:15,289 --> 01:04:17,119
I was also thankful...

841
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:20,599
to be a member of your team.

842
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:29,940
And this is my last gift to you.

843
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:42,780
I'm on a different team now,

844
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:45,489
but I'll help you after work.

845
01:04:46,889 --> 01:04:48,519
That kind of help
will be okay, right?

846
01:05:04,369 --> 01:05:07,280
All right then. Try to stand
straight and tall again.

847
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:09,380
I'll teach you how to breathe
through your stomach.

848
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:11,650
Do we really have to do this...

849
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:13,909
in this open space?

850
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:18,590
You must overcome the embarrassment
offstage to go onstage.

851
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:20,820
Have you forgotten
that I'm a musical actress?

852
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:24,130
I'm an expert
when it comes to these things.

853
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:25,230
All right.

854
01:05:25,789 --> 01:05:27,599
Let's start
with abdominal breathing.

855
01:05:27,699 --> 01:05:32,000
Flex your stomach and breathe in.

856
01:05:34,739 --> 01:05:36,239
Silent Monster...

857
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:38,969
- Look straight ahead.
- Oh, right.

858
01:05:40,139 --> 01:05:42,480
- Representing Silent Monster,
- Stand firmly.

859
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:45,280
- I'm Eun Hwan Gi.
- Stand strong. If someone...

860
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:51,289
I'm Eun Hwan Gi from Silent Monster!

861
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:55,219
I think it's good.
Including this will be...

862
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:58,429
- Oh, the battery is low.
- I'm sorry.

863
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:06,329
(Your battery power is low.)

864
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:07,739
All right.

865
01:06:11,269 --> 01:06:13,610
Representing Silent Monster...

866
01:06:13,639 --> 01:06:14,980
A little louder.

867
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:20,650
I'm Eun Hwan Gi from Silent Monster.

868
01:06:20,679 --> 01:06:23,449
You were much better than this
during practice. You can do it.

869
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:25,719
In order to highlight the pros
of using eco-friendly paints...

870
01:06:26,219 --> 01:06:28,860
which are completely
free of toxic chemicals,

871
01:06:30,789 --> 01:06:34,500
we'd like to suggest making
the only wall art in the world.

872
01:06:35,429 --> 01:06:36,400
Yes.

873
01:06:36,429 --> 01:06:38,099
- Here.
- You startled me.

874
01:06:38,269 --> 01:06:41,199
Have this coffee
and power through it.

875
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:43,039
One more time. Go!

876
01:06:43,139 --> 01:06:45,809
They are completely
free of toxic chemicals.

877
01:06:46,909 --> 01:06:50,710
We'd like to suggest making
the only wall art in the world.

878
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:54,519
Good job.

879
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:01,019
He's so passionate at night,

880
01:07:01,619 --> 01:07:03,860
yet he turns into a shy introvert
as soon as the sun comes up.

881
01:07:18,809 --> 01:07:21,480
(Final rehearsal
for the presentation competition)

882
01:07:35,659 --> 01:07:36,989
I'm Eun Hwan Gi...

883
01:07:38,989 --> 01:07:40,130
from Silent Monster.

884
01:07:54,010 --> 01:07:55,440
And?

885
01:07:56,110 --> 01:07:57,750
They are completely...

886
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:02,079
Free of...

887
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:04,349
toxic chemicals...

888
01:08:06,119 --> 01:08:07,219
Well...

889
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,760
This eco-friendly paint...

890
01:08:25,739 --> 01:08:26,869
A mom...

891
01:08:27,909 --> 01:08:29,479
and a child can...

892
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:32,710
Can... Well...

893
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:34,010
Paint...

894
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,420
Well...

895
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:46,930
Eco...

896
01:09:46,689 --> 01:09:48,489
It's almost time.

897
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:03,500
I'm sorry.

898
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:07,810
You worked so hard.

899
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:11,310
I don't think...

900
01:10:13,149 --> 01:10:14,350
I can do this.

901
01:10:15,619 --> 01:10:16,819
Is that right?

902
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:27,359
Then...

903
01:10:30,329 --> 01:10:32,069
I guess this is it.

904
01:10:34,569 --> 01:10:36,939
It's a shame we're saying goodbye
in the bathroom.

905
01:10:40,039 --> 01:10:43,880
Actually,
I wrote a resignation letter.

906
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:47,180
I was going to submit it
after the presentation.

907
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:48,449
What are you talking about?

908
01:10:52,289 --> 01:10:53,420
Why?

909
01:10:55,189 --> 01:10:57,520
I think I opened...

910
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:00,289
a door I shouldn't have opened.

911
01:11:05,329 --> 01:11:06,500
For one last time,

912
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,000
will you do me a favor?

913
01:11:14,579 --> 01:11:16,180
Regardless of the result,

914
01:11:17,949 --> 01:11:19,880
I'd love to see you...

915
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,149
speaking in front of people.

916
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:41,500
If you feel too nervous,
fix your eyes on me.

917
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:46,470
Imagine no one except me is
in the room.

918
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,029
Come on.

919
01:12:10,729 --> 01:12:13,369
I'm begging you.

920
01:12:39,189 --> 01:12:41,060
You won't do anything.

921
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,800
All you have to do is step back...

922
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,069
like you have always done.

923
01:13:37,479 --> 01:13:40,250
(My Shy Boss)
