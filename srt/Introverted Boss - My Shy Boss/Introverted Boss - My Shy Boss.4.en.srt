1
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:40,830
She left without her shoes.

2
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:46,340
She wasn't even wearing any shoes...

3
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:50,740
when she was...

4
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:52,639
going...

5
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,620
so far away.

6
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:31,419
(Episode 4: I Won't Meet Anyone)

7
00:03:31,449 --> 00:03:36,719
(Episode 4: I Won't Meet Anyone)

8
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,389
It's still dark outside
because the sun isn't up yet.

9
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:45,129
Where does he wander
at this early hour?

10
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:49,300
He rarely leaves the penthouse,

11
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,500
but it looks like he goes
somewhere every morning.

12
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,280
I think he's obsessive
about repeating his morning routine.

13
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:00,310
He takes a shower,

14
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,150
cleans,

15
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:06,080
sharpens his pencils,

16
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:10,990
puts on some music,

17
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,159
and dances.

18
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,830
What?

19
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,459
He dances?

20
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,509
What was that?
Was that a hallucination?

21
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,250
Am I still half asleep?

22
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,230
Good morning.

23
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,069
Gosh.

24
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,439
There's no way he was dancing.

25
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,579
That cold psychopath
never even says hi back.

26
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,920
Did she see it?

27
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,689
Let's have lunch.

28
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,129
What will we be having today?
Will it be pork cutlets?

29
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,189
- Hurry.
- Let's go.

30
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,800
It's yukgaejang today.

31
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:00,870
- It's yukgaejang every day.
- I had it yesterday.

32
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,230
Should we eat out?

33
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,740
He never eats with his employees.

34
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,310
It seems like he does eat
by himself.

35
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,319
Whatever he eats,
the kitchen is always cleaned up.

36
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,120
There's no smell, either.

37
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,819
There must be some traces left.

38
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,730
I found it.

39
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,439
Does it smell like kimchi?

40
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,740
- Good work today.
- Good work, everyone.

41
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,610
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

42
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,810
It's so cold these days.

43
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,680
Wait for me.

44
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,290
After everyone leaves,

45
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,860
what does he do here all alone?

46
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:04,060
Tomorrow morning,
he'll sneak out again...

47
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,399
like a cockroach.

48
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,779
Here we go.

49
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,040
He exercises?

50
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,149
He's surprisingly good.

51
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,290
I thought he was a loner
who never gets out.

52
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,990
Nice.

53
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,730
What a surprise!

54
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,029
You're very good.

55
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:15,730
It's so unexpected.

56
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,439
Why are you here?

57
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,870
I'm here to work out.

58
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:20,910
Are you a member here, too?

59
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,139
It's so nice to see you here.

60
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,980
Are you leaving?

61
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,450
I actually want to learn how to
play squash. Can you teach me?

62
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:35,389
Why are you ignoring me?

63
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,919
I'm just happy to run into you.

64
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,330
Isn't it about time
we became closer?

65
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,059
Let's work out together...

66
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,899
and drink something cold
together later.

67
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,440
I work out alone.

68
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:00,409
Of course you do.

69
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,889
Is it about Ms. Chae again?

70
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:17,799
If she makes you that uncomfortable,
she'll have to go.

71
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,460
- I'll take her then.
- What?

72
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:22,470
I want to teach her a lot.

73
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,639
- I'll keep her near me and...
- You can't do that.

74
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,509
Why not?

75
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,440
I'd like to...

76
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,340
kick her out of
the company for good.

77
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:36,379
- If she stays here, she'll...
- What?

78
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,120
She'll get on my nerves.

79
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:42,990
You can't fire someone
because of that.

80
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,190
You know we can't fire
people that easily.

81
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,990
The ministry is keeping an eye on us
after the power abuse issue.

82
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,759
I'm sorry, Hwan Gi.

83
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,139
I'm sure she's been
sticking around you because of me.

84
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,940
I told her to do that.

85
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:03,409
It was an assignment
regarding the PI project.

86
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,009
I told her to analyze
what kind of person you are.

87
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:10,919
She's observing whatever you do
with affection.

88
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:15,149
Stop being so cold
and treat her nicely.

89
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,789
With affection?

90
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,360
Why is this so funny to me?

91
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,460
She's giving you such a hard time.

92
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,830
Eun Hwan Gi has met his
perfect match.

93
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,470
It all starts from
hating each other.

94
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,669
Give it some time, and tell me
if it's still too hard for you.

95
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:37,809
I'll be more than happy to take her.

96
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,879
No. She can stay with me.

97
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,389
What I mean is...

98
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,259
What you mean is...

99
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,100
We have no choice.
Just let her stay.

100
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,690
Mr. Kang.

101
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:32,500
I'm here.

102
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,669
I've been waiting for you. Let's go.

103
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,690
They're together again.

104
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:01,389
Where are they going together?

105
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,360
I've finished my assignment.

106
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,960
You have?

107
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,399
Where's your report paper?

108
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,100
I didn't have much to write about.

109
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:14,309
Mr. Eun can be...

110
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:17,139
defined with one word.

111
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,879
I'm all ears.

112
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,179
A cockroach.

113
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,379
A cockroach?

114
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:27,419
Late at night, when everyone's
asleep and no one is watching,

115
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:30,590
he becomes active.

116
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:33,090
He's always dressed in back, too.

117
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,230
He's just like a cockroach.

118
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:40,029
He never gives any instructions,

119
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,230
or hold any meetings.

120
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,669
He only spends the hard earned money
his employees make.

121
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,679
Silent Monster is like
an empty shell.

122
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,210
It's all just a show to pretend
the abusive boss has changed.

123
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,250
That's harsh.

124
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:02,789
All his employees are anxious.

125
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,090
They wonder if it's really okay
to be doing nothing.

126
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,389
At least, you're working hard.

127
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,899
I don't do much.

128
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,029
I just follow you around,
have good food,

129
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,600
and meet people.

130
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,669
Do you think we meet people
just to have fun?

131
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,980
Giving presentations is
a big part of PR agencies' jobs.

132
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,879
It's, in essence, meeting people
and persuading them...

133
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,509
to get on our side.

134
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,350
I believe knowing a good person
is a lot more important than...

135
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:37,450
reading a book both for your work
and for your life.

136
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,289
Today, an executive of
a major food company will be here.

137
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,299
For the 30th anniversary project
of Yong Ramyeon,

138
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:47,159
there will be a bidding soon.

139
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,029
Do you understand what I mean?

140
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,399
Are we bribing him?

141
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,070
We're just asking him to
let us enter the competition.

142
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,909
You'll soon figure it out,

143
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,350
but they're not corrupt people.

144
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:09,250
Mr. Kang, you're already here.

145
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:11,419
Hello, Managing Director Jin.

146
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,090
Hello.

147
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,460
Who is this beauty?
Is she your girlfriend?

148
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,330
She's an employee
I think very highly of.

149
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:20,730
She's my secret weapon.

150
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,100
I'm Chae Ro Woon.

151
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:26,669
Nice to meet you.

152
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,610
Please take a seat.

153
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,039
Sure. Let's sit down.

154
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:34,509
He was supposed to
pass the ball to his team,

155
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:37,149
but he ended up scoring an own goal.

156
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:38,250
That's so funny.

157
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,679
We haven't even had any drink,

158
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,419
but this is so much fun.

159
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,519
Is it?

160
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,629
Do you know
what the secret to my success is?

161
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:52,860
Your insight into the future?

162
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:54,299
A global mindset?

163
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,929
You're going too far.

164
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:00,169
The right answer is health.

165
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,870
Around my age,

166
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:06,080
many of the competitors fall down...

167
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:08,110
because of health issues.

168
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:11,120
In addition to being competent,

169
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,519
you're modest, too. My goodness.

170
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,289
She's an employee
I think very highly of.

171
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,230
I'm being recognized.

(New York Barbershop)

173
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,769
She's my secret weapon.

174
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,470
Secret?

175
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:37,169
My sister ended up dead...

176
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,110
at that company.

(New York Barbershop)

178
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:52,590
What will Dad say if he finds out?

179
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,399
(Three years ago)

180
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:02,129
- Gosh, it's so cold.
- Be careful, Mom.

181
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,039
Gosh, why are you
wearing those heels?

182
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,669
What happened to the pair
I bought at the department store?

183
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,580
Those are too expensive.

184
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,080
Who cares if they get a bit dirty?

185
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:20,450
Your father used half of
the shoe polish on them yesterday.

186
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,389
Even dirt will slide right off.

187
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:32,129
Is your eldest...

188
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,059
going to work at this hour?

189
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:35,629
Yes, hello.

190
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,899
She works for the best company
there is in the industry.

191
00:16:40,269 --> 00:16:41,940
She serves the big boss...

192
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:44,580
at that amazing company.

193
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,909
Of course she is busy.

194
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,149
Just leave

195
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:55,750
My life alone

196
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:57,759
Do not

197
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:00,860
- Get in my way
- That little...

198
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,029
- Mom.
- Anymore

199
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:06,460
- I will live my way
- Gosh.

200
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,829
Your youngest is just getting home.

201
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,569
Are you all out waiting for me?

202
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,539
I'm so touched.

203
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,809
- You punk. Look at the time.
- Mom.

204
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,579
Today,

205
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,380
I...

206
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,920
Wait, it was yesterday.

207
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,390
I passed the audition yesterday.

208
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:33,789
I was so happy.

209
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:38,299
Guys, I'm going to be on a musical.

210
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,460
Will you come watch?

211
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,730
Are you the lead this time?

212
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,799
I'll be a scene stealer...

213
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:48,410
that walks all over
the lead character.

214
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,740
I'll be playing 18 roles.

215
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,380
That means
I'll play 18 different characters.

216
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:59,079
You will be running in and out
of the stage.

217
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,650
It must be very hectic.

218
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:03,089
That won't be all.

219
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:06,289
She will be talking a lot.
It'll be so noisy.

220
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,230
It's not just one or two.

221
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,130
I'll play 18 roles.

222
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,970
Transformation complete.

223
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:16,970
Gosh.

224
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,670
It's hard to believe
these two are sisters.

225
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,079
My goodness.

226
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,049
Oh, gosh.

227
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,609
Chae Ro Woon, those shoes...

228
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:32,519
Aren't those your sister's?

229
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:36,319
She lent them to me for good luck.

230
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:40,089
Thank you, Ji Hye.

231
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,630
After giving me great luck,

232
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,630
these shoes have died.

233
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,440
Ro Woon, come over here.

234
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:55,410
- Mom.
- Come over here.

235
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,039
- Come right here.
- Calm down.

236
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,650
I'll buy her another pair.

237
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,980
I'll make money
and then buy her new ones.

238
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,779
I'll buy her nicer
and prettier ones.

239
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:09,650
- Look at her yapping.
- Mom.

240
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,559
- You better come over here.
- No.

241
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,289
- She's going to get it today.
- Mom.

242

(New York Barbershop)

243
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,269
I wonder...

244
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,710
if Mom is watching me.

245
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,220
(New York Barbershop)

246
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,369
- Did you eat?
- Yes.

247
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,400
It was great.

248
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,470
It was really delicious.

249
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,549
What's gotten into her?
Her answer got longer.

250
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:15,950
Did something good happen?

251
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,359
I bet she's drunk again.

252
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,819
She looks fine to me.

253
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,589
Gosh.

254
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,099
Ever since her sister died,

255
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,299
the cheerfulness in her also died.
She hardly talks now.

256
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:34,000
Do you think
she'll start talking again?

257
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:51,720
In one's life,

258
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:55,059
some encounters are
imperatively necessary.

259
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,559
On the other hand,
some are unnecessary,

260
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,559
I have an instruction...

261
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,269
to give.

262
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,740
- What's gotten into him?
- Are we getting yelled at?

263
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:10,440
We're done for.

264
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,380
I hope it's not a hassle.

265
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,779
What is it? Tell us, Boss.

266
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:27,420
Do not meet anyone.

267
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,630
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

268
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:31,759
What is he...

269
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:34,099
Is this a series?

270
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,269
It's the sequel to
"We won't say anything."

271
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,200
"Do not meet anyone."

272
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,609
Could it be directed at me?

273
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,349
Does he think
I'll meet with the press?

274
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:53,019
Is he suspicious of me?

275
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,920
Did he find out that I applied
for a different position?

276
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,289
Is he telling me to focus on work
instead of my family?

277
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,960
My goodness.

278
00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:05,829
I'm not allowed to date
someone at the office?

279
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,099
But I barely got started.

281
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:20,710
Mr. Jin,

282
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:22,380
did you get in all right last night?

283
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,650
Yes.

284
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:28,890
Of course. I'll run over
if you ask for me.

285
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:33,589
Yes, sure.
I'll see you tomorrow then.

286
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,759
Bye.

287
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,089
- My goodness.
- Who was that?

288
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,829
The person I met yesterday.

289
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,569
Exactly who are you meeting
all the time?

290
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,240
There will be a bidding for
Yong Ramyeon's anniversary project.

291
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:47,599
The person in charge of PR...

292
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,940
Mr. Kang made you do
things like that?

293
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,910
It wasn't anything weird.

294
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,880
We had a 30-dollar-dinner.

295
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,549
We paid our own bills.

296
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:02,150
Managing Director Jin loves sports,
so he doesn't even drink.

297
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,890
I noticed last time
that you play sports, too.

298
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:06,789
Why don't you two play together?

299
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,059
Instead of chasing people around,
do your work at your place.

300
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,730
That way, you'll have 100 people
that know you,

301
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,529
instead of you knowing 100 people.

302
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,470
But...

303
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,309
I don't know where my place is.

304
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:28,779
I don't even know
what I should be doing.

305
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,420
You never taught me anything.

306
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,460
You'll come with me tomorrow, right?

307
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:45,130
No. You shouldn't go either.

308
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,700
Don't be like that.

309
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,500
- It's for the team. As a boss...
- Never.

310
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:52,500
I don't want to go.

311
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,569
I guess he really doesn't want to.

312
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,210
If he hates it so much...

313
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,049
Yes, Mr. Jin.

314
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,150
About the meeting tomorrow...

315
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:13,390
What do you think about going
early in the morning?

316
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,509
Boss, you're here.

317
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,410
Managing Director Jin
is a member here as well.

318
00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:37,980
It looks like Silent Monster...

319
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,880
is fated to work with Yong Ramyeon.
Don't you think?

320
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,650
What do you think you're...

321
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:50,460
I always wondered who came here
earlier than me.

322
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:51,700
It was you.

323
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:54,529
Let me introduce you.

324
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:56,869
This is Managing Director Jin
of Yong Ramyeon.

325
00:24:57,569 --> 00:25:00,700
This is Silent Monster's boss,
Eun Hwan Gi.

326
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,339
Say hello.

327
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:06,880
There you go.

328
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:09,380
You should greet each other.

329
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,410
Hello.

330
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:13,619
Mr. Kang told me about you.

331
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,859
It's nice and cool. Drink up.

332
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,500
Okay, thank you. Right.

333
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,829
I heard you're
pretty good at squash.

334
00:25:29,869 --> 00:25:32,170
No, not really. I'm not good.

335
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,740
He's seriously so good.

336
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:36,269
He's a pro.

337
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,740
Really?

338
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:40,480
Let's play a game.

339
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:44,549
I'm sorry. I like to exercise alone.

340
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:48,019
Gosh, why? There's no fun in
playing against a wall by yourself.

341
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:50,650
She's saying you're good. Teach me.

342
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,559
When someone's looking at me...

343
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:54,660
I always make mistakes.

344
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:57,460
Mistakes? That's totally fine.

345
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:59,059
Mistakes are what makes us human.

346
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,329
All right. Come on.
Let's play a game, okay?

347
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:04,970
I'll take this.

348
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,640
Good.

349
00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:12,009
Here. Take this.

350
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:13,779
I clearly said I don't
want to do this.

351
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:17,910
I'll be a referee.

352
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,579
All right.

353
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:25,259
Allow me to serve
since I'm older than you.

354
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:31,490
What are you doing?
Why aren't you playing?

355
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,930
It's 1 to 0!

356
00:26:35,829 --> 00:26:37,569
Yes. Right.

357
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,599
Here we go.

358
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:50,579
It's 2 to 0!

359
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,980
What are you doing right now?
Do you think I'm a joke?

360
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,680
You don't even want to deal with me?

361
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,720
I think my staff was a bit
overly driven...

362
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,259
to get Yong Ramyeon's
30th anniversary project.

363
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:02,960
This is not how I get things done.

364
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:08,059
What did you just say?

365
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:12,900
I'll see you at the bidding
with our proposal.

366
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,299
Just a second.

367
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,740
I see that you're good
at making a fool out of people.

368
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:21,509
Tell me. Did I ask you
to dance around in underwear for me?

369
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:23,950
Or did I ask you for money?

370
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,750
I just wanted to play
a game of squash with you.

371
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,950
Definitely. My boss must've
misunderstood something.

372
00:27:31,089 --> 00:27:34,220
Did you misunderstand
my intentions, Ms. Chae?

373
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,329
You asked me to come here
at this early hour.

374
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:39,529
And why did you show up
with your boss?

375
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,269
- Do you have a hidden agenda?
- Not at all.

376
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:46,099
Then you hold this racquet...

377
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,869
and tell this guy to leave!

378
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,869
Me?

379
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,539
Let's go.

380
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,950
I've always wanted to learn
how to play squash.

381
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,150
Will you teach me?

382
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,549
I'm a fast learner.

383
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,779
Please give it to me. Thank you.

384
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,690
- Like this?
- All right. Yes.

385
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,420
Don't move your whole upper body
when you swing the racquet.

386
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,759
Hold it like this...

387
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,059
- and do this. That's it.
- Like this?

388
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:14,529
All right. Let's play a game.

389
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:17,099
What? You're still here?

390
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,700
Ro Woon, get out. I'll do it.

391
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,500
Swing the racquet like this.

392
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:24,670
You're so stiff.
Relax your shoulders, okay? Good.

393
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,279
All right, give it a try.

394
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,240
You're so tense.

395
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:29,680
You'll get hurt like this.

396
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,819
All right. Relax your body first.

397
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,819
My gosh,
why is your upper body so mushy?

398
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:37,390
I guess you don't
exercise your upper body.

399
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,859
I mean, I saw how flexible
your legs are.

400
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,789
- Gosh, your body is so mushy...
- Please, Mr. Jin...

401
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:08,849
I told you.

402
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,349
I make mistakes
when someone is looking at me.

403
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,029
Boss.

404
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:34,980
My gosh. I'm so sorry.
This might help relieve the pain...

405
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,019
I sincerely apologize. Are you...

406
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:44,250
I'm going to sue him.

407
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,990
He obviously did it
intentionally to hurt me.

408
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,789
I absolutely won't settle.

409
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:52,730
Things just got a little intense
while you were exercising.

410
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,599
What?

411
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,000
Take a look at my CT and MRI
scans when they're out.

412
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:59,000
It was definitely more
than "a little intense".

413
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,039
Please don't get so worked up.

414
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,309
While collecting statements
about the incident,

415
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:09,210
the fact that you were hitting on
our employee will be revealed.

416
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,319
What?

417
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,619
My apologies.
I got a little worked up there.

418
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,289
She's an employee
I think very highly of.

419
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,859
I take it that you don't want
to work with me.

420
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,930
What are you talking about?

421
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:31,269
This is for your hospital expenses.

422
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,009
Please forgive him,
and don't turn it into a big deal...

423
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,809
for my sake.

424
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,900
What did he say?

425
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:03,029
Does he not want us
to participate in the bidding?

426
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,170
I managed to get his permission
for the presentation.

427
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:10,309
You didn't even do anything wrong,

428
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:12,740
but you had to apologize to him.

429
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:15,039
This is nothing.

430
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:16,680
Let's go.

431
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:28,859
I don't want to.

432
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,200
Hey, how can you say that when
I did all that work to sort it out?

433
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,670
I don't want to work
with someone like that.

434
00:31:38,569 --> 00:31:39,839
I'm sorry to tell you this,

435
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,809
but you're not in any position
to be picky at the moment.

436
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,140
You should be asking companies
to work with you.

437
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,880
He's obviously expecting
something more than that.

438
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:49,380
He won't evaluate
our presentation fairly.

439
00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:51,480
Let's just give it a try.

440
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,619
For our employees' sake. No.

441
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,849
For my sake.

442
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:00,119
There you go again.

443
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,890
Cut him some slack for my sake.

444
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:09,170
Ms. Kim, please hang in there
for my sake.

445
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,269
Please forgive him,
and don't turn it into a big deal...

446
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,339
for my sake.

447
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:14,869
"For my sake."

448
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:17,970
He makes it sound like
he's sacrificing himself.

449
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,839
Mr. Kang,
please look at this camera.

450
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,309
But he's also unwittingly
expressing his desire for attention.

451
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,980
The right side of my face
looks better on camera.

452
00:32:26,019 --> 00:32:27,779
Please take photos
of my better side.

453
00:32:27,819 --> 00:32:29,920
I'm not saying enjoying
attention is bad.

454
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:32,920
- What does Silent Monster mean?
- It's just that I'm not like him.

455
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,660
I've been wholeheartedly
thankful that he always...

456
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:38,759
volunteers to be in the spotlight
on my behalf.

457
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,730
- We just took the first step,
- But...

458
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,400
so please show us your support
and look forward to it.

459
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,670
You once said that Mr. Eun
stays behind the scenes...

460
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,740
because you're more handsome
than him. Is that true?

461
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,980
You haven't met
Mr. Eun in person, have you?

462
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:54,009
- No.
- No.

463
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:56,450
If that's the case,
I can tell you in full confidence.

464
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:59,950
I'm about 20 times
more handsome than him.

465
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,289
So you're admitting that you're
better looking than him, right?

466
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:09,829
The problem is that
he overly attracts attention...

467
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:12,859
to the point that it's dangerous.

468
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:15,000
Did you get any
plastic surgery done?

469
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:16,769
- Pardon?
- Did you get any plastic surgery?

470
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:25,039
Hey, what are you trying to say?

471
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,910
Do you think I'm doing these things
because I want the attention?

472
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,450
You're too greedy.

473
00:33:35,789 --> 00:33:37,690
That's hurtful and discouraging.

474
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:40,089
I'm putting off what I have to do...

475
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:43,259
to do my best
to help Silent Monster.

476
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:44,390
I respect the way you do things,

477
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,500
but I'm the one who's
in charge of Silent Monster.

478
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,869
Take your hands off of this project.

479
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,000
Hey, then what about our employees?

480
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,569
I'll protect my own staff.

481
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:55,869
How are you going to do that?

482
00:33:56,309 --> 00:33:59,839
By blowing our chance to
participate in the bidding?

483
00:34:00,109 --> 00:34:02,009
By wasting their time...

484
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,609
when they should be learning
and building up experience?

485
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,619
Listen up.

486
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:10,550
If you don't do this, no one will
give Silent Monster any work.

487
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,019
I know how competent you are,
but no one else does.

488
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,289
You don't want to play
dirty, petty tricks?

489
00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:20,260
I said I'll do them for you.

490
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,929
I'll do anything it takes
to get the ball rolling,

491
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,269
so just do it your way...

492
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,869
and show people what you can do.

493
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,469
Does that sound good enough?

494
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,679
Do you actually want to
protect your staff?

495
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,719
Or are you just trying to
protect your pride?

496
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,389
(Eun Hwan Gi)

497
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,829
I'll protect my own staff.

498
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,469
How are you going to do that?

499
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,239
By wasting their time...

500
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:34,969
when they should be learning
and building up experience?

501
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:37,739
Taking the bus and
getting a ride from me...

502
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:40,539
- They're the same thing.
- Stop it.

503
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,750
Are you late as well, Sun Bong?

504
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,380
Yes.

505
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:48,650
I went to a job interview
this morning.

506
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:50,590
There is nothing to do
even if we come in early, anyway.

507
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:51,690
I'll say.

508
00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:53,519
That's true.

509
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:56,960
Yong Ramyeon's bidding is tomorrow.

510
00:35:57,329 --> 00:36:00,159
Everyone is busy finishing up
the presentation,

511
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,730
- except for us.
- I'll say.

512
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:05,269
There is nothing we can do.

513
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:07,340
He doesn't share anything with us.

514
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,539
I'll say.

515
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,070
Let's go.

516
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:16,010
Wait for me!

517
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:20,619
Good morning.

518
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:26,989
Am I not that late today?

519
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:29,690
Or is everyone late?

520
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:30,929
I'm on a diet.

521
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,920
(The Korean ramyeon market...)

522
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:01,090
(Spot the differences between the
old and new packagings)

523
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:13,900
Are you late, too?

524
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:16,909
I was on time, but...

525
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:19,179
I had to go somewhere urgently.

526
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,510
Do you have enteritis again?

527
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:22,949
Oh, no. Are you all right?

528
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,710
- Hey...
- What is this?

529
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,780
Are all five of us late then?

530
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,650
Sorry we're late.

531
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:48,969
See? He couldn't care less.

532
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:51,110
We should have come after lunch.

533
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,639
I have an instruction to give.

534
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,179
Prepare for the presentation.

535
00:37:58,449 --> 00:38:01,019
Who are you referring to, Boss?

536
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,340
Me?

537
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:25,980
That will be all.

538
00:38:34,349 --> 00:38:36,989
Sir, I'm not ready at all.

539
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:40,190
- I do not have any materials.
- Check your email.

540
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,360
I can't go tomorrow.

541
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:46,230
I haven't presented in a while.

542
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:47,900
I had two maternity leaves,

543
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:49,530
and took a long time off.

544
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,900
- I haven't presented once since...
- Still, you've done it before.

545
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,070
Gosh.

546
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:01,340
It's so warm.

547
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,750
You have to line up for these...

548
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:05,250
I'm all right.

549
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,750
Couldn't you present just this once?

550
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,090
You prepared everything,

551
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:15,929
so you must know best
about what to focus on.

552
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,570
What I mean is...

553
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:30,469
It must have been a lot of work
to prepare alone.

554
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:34,510
Everyone, let's give the CEO
a round of applause.

555
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,780
Gosh. You must be stressed out.

556
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,599
It's employees I need.

557
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:02,769
Pardon?

558
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,880
Not a mother.

559
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,530
He's abusing his power.

560
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:25,159
He didn't say a thing until now,

561
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,960
and now he wants you to
do the presentation?

562
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:30,030
I better do as I'm told.

563
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,769
Mr. Kang said that Silent Monster...

564
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,099
won't have rigid hierarchy.

565
00:40:34,469 --> 00:40:36,840
He hardly communicates with us.

566
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:39,440
He's a tyrant
just doing whatever he wants.

567
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,280
If I were him, I would have gone.

568
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:44,280
He should set an example
if employees is what he needs.

569
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,650
Will you go instead?

570
00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:48,949
My mother is always looking after
my kids,

571
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,690
but she's planning a trip...

572
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,460
Unfortunately, I'm taking
tomorrow off.

573
00:40:55,989 --> 00:40:57,230
I have a job interview.

574
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,300
It's with a major company this time.

575
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,630
I'll do it.

576
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,840
Have you presented before?

577
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,570
We've all done it at school,
haven't we?

578
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,409
No. What if things go wrong?

579
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:15,340
We should do as he says.

580
00:41:16,949 --> 00:41:19,619
She's right. He even warned me.

581
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:24,250
When he told us not to meet anyone,
he was talking to me.

582
00:41:24,489 --> 00:41:26,960
He's telling me to focus on work
instead of my family.

583
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,360
I'll try to do this myself.

584
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:36,070
Tell me if you need anything.

585
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:39,130
- I'll help if I can.
- Me too.

586
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,570
Thank you.

587
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:43,969
You have bad knees, anyway.

588
00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:46,280
Can you go on a trip another time?

589
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,780
I'll send you somewhere nice
next time.

590
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:54,019
When? When your knees are better.

591
00:41:56,449 --> 00:41:59,659
I know. I know it's because you...

592
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:05,730
Sorry, Mom.

593
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,960
I'm really sorry. Yes.

594
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,440
Mom, I will...

595
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:15,469
wire you some money.

596
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:20,110
Instead of chasing people around,
do your work at your place.

597
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:23,480
Does he think it's fine
as long as he works at his place?

598
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,019
What a joke.

599
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:34,090
(Three years ago)

600
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:36,190
Our deepest condolences.

601
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,599
This isn't even close to
the gravity of your loss, but...

602
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,699
I knew it.

603
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:50,670
Are you trying fob us off
with that money?

604
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:52,840
So something really did happen
at her work, didn't it?

605
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:56,980
The company also looked into it,
but we did not find...

606
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:59,010
That's why it's more suspicious.

607
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,179
Someone died,

608
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:05,389
but there is no reason.
There is no explanation.

609
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:09,590
She killed herself at work, but not
a single news article got written.

610
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:11,960
After that, all they say...

611
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,159
is that she had depression.

612
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,829
How does this make sense?

613
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,099
Keep it down.

614
00:43:21,139 --> 00:43:22,239
Take it and leave.

615
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:24,070
We can't just let him go.

616
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:27,710
No one from her work came,
and they won't meet with us.

617
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:29,849
They finally came to us.
Why would you send him back?

618
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:32,150
Take it and leave.

619
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,690
What are you doing, Dad?

620
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:41,690
Are you just going to sit there?

621
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:46,059
Social life is hard for everyone.

622
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:49,059
What did you say?

623
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,170
Everyone struggles,
but they continue to power through.

624
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,800
She should have done the same.

625
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,070
Dad.

626
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:06,880
If you won't do it, I will.

627
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:10,489
I will go and get
at least Ji Hye's shoes back.

628
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:13,119
Stop making a scene and sit down.

629
00:44:13,989 --> 00:44:16,130
I can't do that!

630
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:21,699
My heart is about to burst.

631
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:08,780
(I'll wait for your return
to the stage.)

632
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:14,880
(I'll wait for your return
to the stage.)

633
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,420
Mom.

634
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,179
Mom. He's here.

635
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:52,119
What? He's here?
What's gotten into him?

636
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,260
Mother, I'm here.

637
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,929
It's you, Woo Il.

638
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,500
I thought it was Hwan Gi.

639
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:03,070
Shouldn't you change
the way you call Woo Il?

640
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,900
We didn't even get married yet.

641
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:06,769
Although you haven't had
a wedding yet,

642
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:08,769
you're living together.

643
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:12,170
I'll call you Mother
after we get married, too.

644
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,440
That will be confusing.

645
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,280
When you have kids, things will
become even more complicated.

646
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:20,750
I was worried it might give you a
headache, so I got you something.

647
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:24,750
Oh, my. Woo Il.

648
00:46:24,789 --> 00:46:26,050
You're the best.

649
00:46:26,989 --> 00:46:30,630
You've been whining all day.
Now you smile.

650
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:33,329
That's because Woo Il is here.

651
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:35,630
Mother, aren't you tired?
Let me give you a massage.

652
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:36,800
- Are you sure?
- Can you lift your legs?

653
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:39,329
You're the best.

654
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:41,139
Did you have dinner?

655
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:42,500
No, I didn't.

656
00:46:42,539 --> 00:46:43,940
Why not?

657
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:47,139
Hwan Gi hasn't come home
for days. I'm on a strike.

658
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:49,610
I'll tell him to come home.

659
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,079
- Really?
- Yes.

660
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,679
It feels so nice.

661
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,230
We're in trouble.

662
00:47:10,429 --> 00:47:13,900
Yoo Hee just called,
and she's still home.

663
00:47:15,739 --> 00:47:17,610
She woke up late.

664
00:47:20,539 --> 00:47:22,239
Let me call her.

665
00:47:23,449 --> 00:47:24,909
Why isn't there
anything else to wear?

666
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:27,119
It's suffocating.

667
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,480
Is this not going to fit?

668
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:31,420
(Ro Woon)

669
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:36,389
Hi, Ro Woon.

670
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:40,260
This is an unexpected chance
to take revenge.

671
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,039
I don't think
she'll get here in time.

672
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,170
Do you want to talk to her?

673
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:55,110
I just gave my kids their pills.

674
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,449
Hey!

675
00:47:59,349 --> 00:48:01,650
Why are you throwing it back up?

676
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:03,150
It's too bitter.

677
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,949
Wait. Don't throw up.

678
00:48:06,519 --> 00:48:09,630
Swallow it. There you go.

679
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:27,239
Wait. Where are you going?

680
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,280
Where are you going?

681
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,320
You should give the presentation.

682
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,650
Me?

683
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,989
Do you expect us to do it?

684
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:40,289
You're the only one who can do it.

685
00:48:40,659 --> 00:48:44,159
Silent Monster, everyone is waiting.
Please hurry.

686
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:47,360
The thing is...

687
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:50,829
I'm not dressed properly.

688
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,239
- Also...
- No.

689
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:56,039
Your progressive style
makes you look creative.

690
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:57,670
It's perfect.

691
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:01,679
The hidden emperor under the veil.

692
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:04,980
The glorious debut
of the mysterious Eun Hwan Gi.

693
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:08,019
This is a perfect opportunity
to make a name for yourself.

694
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:10,989
Let's go.

695
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,119
Let's go.

696
00:49:16,389 --> 00:49:17,889
Show them what you've got.

697
00:49:17,929 --> 00:49:19,760
Neat hands.

698
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,530
Stylish hair.

699
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:23,769
There you go.

700
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:27,139
Let's go.

701
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:28,840
We should go, too.

702
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:54,230
Sorry. Sorry, we're late.

703
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:55,929
My gosh.

704
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,000
Here.

705
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:05,070
Good luck.

706
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,610
Here.

707
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:17,619
Now, Silent Monster will...

708
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:19,489
give a presentation.

709
00:50:19,889 --> 00:50:22,619
Please start the presentation.

710
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,730
What if he does a good job?

711
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:35,070
Excuse me, please start.

712
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:40,110
- What's going on?
- What is he doing?

713
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:43,039
Excuse me, what are you waiting for?

714
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:45,780
Well...

715
00:50:56,059 --> 00:50:58,159
I'm...

716
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:02,630
I'm...

717
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:05,300
Silent...

718
00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:11,570
- What's wrong with him?
- We don't have much time.

719
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:12,940
Please get started.

720
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:21,420
Well, I'm...

721
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:28,960
- I'm...
- Speak!

722
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,130
Speak! Come on!

723
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:38,599
Speak!

724
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:45,940
Just do whatever you want.

725
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,579
Is that all you can say?

726
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,480
Why do you let others decide
how your hair should look?

727
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:57,349
You can't even
express your opinions clearly.

728
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:59,690
Why are you so shy?

729
00:52:01,389 --> 00:52:02,789
Fine.

730
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:06,130
If you can't say anything,
I'll speak for you.

731
00:52:07,429 --> 00:52:08,730
- Hey, Curly.
- Curly.

732
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:15,039
- Where are you going, Curly?
- Where are you going?

733
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:17,269
- Are you an old lady?
- It looks ridiculous.

734
00:52:19,739 --> 00:52:20,880
Silent...

735
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:25,010
Excuse me,
the judges' time is precious.

736
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:27,219
- Please get started.
- I'm...

737
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:28,750
I'm...

738
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:31,849
Everyone fears being stared at
to some extent.

739
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:07,690
- What is he doing?
- Say something!

740
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:13,659
Let's just move on.

741
00:53:13,699 --> 00:53:15,599
It looks like he came here
with no preparation.

742
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:18,000
It looks like you're
feeling a bit nervous.

743
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:20,199
Please try to relax...

744
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:22,139
and start the presentation.

745
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:26,809
I'm...

746
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,219
(Judges)

747
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,670
I'm sure I at least...

748
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:56,500
satisfied one person.

749
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:05,079
- Is this a joke or what?
- What does he think he's doing?

750
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:06,849
Gosh.

751
00:54:08,019 --> 00:54:09,019
Did my revenge...

752
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:11,420
succeed?

753
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:15,019
But why is it not gratifying at all?

754
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:18,489
This is not what I wanted.

755
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:48,119
Hwan Gi.

756
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:51,630
Open the door. Please?

757
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,869
I think...

758
00:55:03,539 --> 00:55:05,369
we should give him some alone time.

759
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:18,449
There will be other opportunities,
so don't be too disappointed.

760
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:22,920
Good work, everyone.

761
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:25,130
You can leave early today.

762
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,280
Are your kids okay?

763
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,480
The fever went down.

764
00:55:46,349 --> 00:55:49,820
My husband took a day off from work,
and he's with them now.

765
00:55:58,829 --> 00:56:00,400
We could use something
to cheer us up.

766
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:02,329
Let's go grab a drink.

767
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,699
Yes, let's go.

768
00:56:04,329 --> 00:56:05,369
Let's go.

769
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,099
Shall we?

770
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:25,650
I'll protect my own staff.

771
00:56:26,619 --> 00:56:27,920
How are you going to do that?

772
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:49,940
That presentation
was an eye-opener for me.

773
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:54,380
The person whom I was
so scared of...

774
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:56,650
was actually a huge coward.

775
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:00,389
How disheartening.

776
00:57:00,489 --> 00:57:01,519
Gosh.

777
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:04,829
Are you sure you can drink more?

778
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:09,400
Of course.

779
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,869
For goodness's sake.

780
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,139
Do I work for Brain...

781
00:57:15,739 --> 00:57:17,869
or not?

782
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,210
What a mess.

783
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:22,380
Sun Bong, what's the matter?

784
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,010
Did the job interview...

785
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,380
not go well?

786
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:34,760
Because I technically
work for Silent Monster now,

787
00:57:36,389 --> 00:57:38,590
no one wants to hire me.

788
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:54,579
I'm sorry, everyone.

789
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,809
It's my fault
for not doing the presentation.

790
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:01,079
It's not your fault, Yoo Hee.

791
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:02,650
It's not.

792
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:05,650
I...

793
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:08,260
I thought...

794
00:58:08,659 --> 00:58:13,190
that Mr. Eun should
do the presentation himself...

795
00:58:14,329 --> 00:58:17,400
instead of dumping it on one of us.

796
00:58:18,199 --> 00:58:23,340
But he even wrote
a detailed script for me.

797
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:28,780
I just had to memorize it
and do the presentation.

798
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:32,949
It also had a surprisingly
heart-warming theme.

799
00:58:38,289 --> 00:58:41,059
To celebrate Yong Ramyeon's
30th anniversary,

800
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:42,760
Silent Monster prepared...

801
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,989
a social media photo contest.

802
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,059
"Ramyeon That Doesn't Change".

803
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,929
Yong Ramyeon has been there
for us for 30 years.

804
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,030
Share the moments
you spent with Yong Ramyeon...

805
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,400
with us.

806
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,500
Mom.

807
00:58:57,239 --> 00:58:58,369
I feel sick.

808
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:02,639
Mom, my nose is runny.

809
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,280
You can post a photo...

810
00:59:04,309 --> 00:59:06,550
- from your old photo album.
- Mom...

811
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:12,550
Or you can reenact the moment...

812
00:59:13,019 --> 00:59:14,860
captured in one of your old photos.

813
00:59:14,889 --> 00:59:17,929
- Mom, I'm sick.
- Get some sleep now.

814
00:59:18,829 --> 00:59:20,829
Prepare for the presentation.

815
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,730
Who are you referring to, Boss?

816
00:59:30,039 --> 00:59:31,909
Warm family affection.

817
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:33,039
(AE Dang Yoo Hee)

818
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:36,809
That strand of noodle
must be from her kid.

819
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:39,750
Whenever she picks up snacks
for the team,

820
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:43,920
she buys those old-school pastries
that we all used to eat growing up.

821
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:47,690
She's the perfect person to express
the old-school sentimentality...

822
00:59:48,019 --> 00:59:49,860
this project is seeking.

823
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:52,989
Me?

824
00:59:53,929 --> 00:59:57,099
It'd been long since I
got actual work done.

825
00:59:57,130 --> 01:00:00,639
It made me think of when
I was single, and I was all excited.

826
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,010
After all,

827
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:08,380
I'm just a mom
who picks up snacks for the team.

828
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:19,619
No, I shouldn't even
call myself a mom.

829
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:23,690
I didn't even take my kids to get
the flu shot on time,

830
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:26,889
and I yelled at them
knowing that they're sick.

831
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:31,969
I'm neither an employee...

832
01:00:33,099 --> 01:00:34,769
nor a mom.

833
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:38,639
What am I?

834
01:00:55,289 --> 01:00:57,559
(Kang Woo Il)

835
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,670
(Chae Ro Woon)

836
01:01:11,139 --> 01:01:12,469
(11 Missed Calls)

837
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,739
Do you actually want to
protect your staff?

838
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,010
(12 Missed Calls)

839
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:19,380
(Chae Ro Woon)

840
01:01:19,949 --> 01:01:21,849
Or are you just trying
to protect your pride?

841
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,289
(Chae Ro Woon)

842
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:38,030
(Chae Ro Woon)

843
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:44,739
- Hello?
- Are you...

844
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,440
the boss?

845
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:49,909
I have your staff members here.

846
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:52,550
Get cash ready.

847
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:04,530
It's cold.

848
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,409
It's 101 dollars.

849
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:28,719
I'm sorry.

850
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:32,320
The card reader is broken.
Please give me 101 dollars in cash.

851
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:40,260
Another bottle of soju, please.

852
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,300
I'm sorry.

853
01:03:09,019 --> 01:03:10,559
I want to drink more.

854
01:03:10,889 --> 01:03:12,159
I don't want to go home.

855
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:14,760
It hurts.

856
01:03:18,199 --> 01:03:19,570
I don't want to get in.

857
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:22,369
- I don't want to go home.
- Please go to Heukseok-dong.

858
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,539
Areum Villa, Room 203.

859
01:03:24,869 --> 01:03:26,739
I don't want to go.

860
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:30,039
Mister, drink with me.

861
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:33,579
It's nice to meet you.

862
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:39,320
What?

863
01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:42,389
When did you get all so
grown up, Son?

864
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,030
Room 907, Jinsang Apartment,
Myeonmok-dong.

865
01:03:52,199 --> 01:03:54,139
Come here! Where are you going?

866
01:03:54,769 --> 01:03:56,840
Son!

867
01:03:56,869 --> 01:03:58,809
Room 203, Secret Villa,
Bulgwang-dong.

868
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:02,039
- Please drive carefully.
- Have a drink with me.

869
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:04,480
- Bye.
- I can drink more.

870
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:06,280
Let's drink.

871
01:04:08,519 --> 01:04:09,920
Drink with me.

872
01:04:10,690 --> 01:04:13,019
- I can still drink.
- Sir, excuse me.

873
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:16,820
Let's go.

874
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,389
Here we go.

875
01:04:19,429 --> 01:04:20,530
Let's go.

876
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,769
Get up. Let's start walking.

877
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,699
There you go.

878
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,099
Here. Take it.

879
01:04:30,539 --> 01:04:32,539
Sir, please go to Hannam-dong.

880
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:36,579
You're my girl.

881
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:00,969
You said you're not
an easygoing person.

882
01:05:04,269 --> 01:05:06,309
What are you doing
at this shabby bar?

883
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:13,050
You know
all your employees' addresses.

884
01:05:14,019 --> 01:05:15,449
Have you been watching us
the whole time?

885
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,219
Why?

886
01:05:18,989 --> 01:05:21,960
Why do you secretly
observe people from behind?

887
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:29,960
Why are you never
in front of people?

888
01:05:37,769 --> 01:05:39,139
Is it because you can't?

889
01:05:42,179 --> 01:05:45,949
I thought you looked down on people.

890
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:49,179
Are you...

891
01:05:51,019 --> 01:05:52,289
scared of people?

892
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:57,559
When people stare at you,

893
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:02,230
do you make mistakes or something?

894
01:06:07,869 --> 01:06:12,570
I know people like you very well.

895
01:06:14,539 --> 01:06:16,739
You hide where there's no one else.

896
01:06:17,409 --> 01:06:20,510
You quietly keep your place.

897
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:26,789
Someone in my family is like that.

898
01:06:28,519 --> 01:06:29,690
No.

899
01:06:30,659 --> 01:06:32,090
Apart from me,

900
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:35,360
everyone in my family is like that.

901
01:06:37,469 --> 01:06:38,630
Dad,

902
01:06:40,099 --> 01:06:41,340
Mom,

903
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:45,739
and my sister.

904
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:58,219
But let alone a hundred people,

905
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:01,519
not a single person noticed.

906
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:06,159
If you just stand there and watch,

907
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,159
nothing will happen.

908
01:07:17,739 --> 01:07:19,570
Just by watching,

909
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:24,780
you can't protect anyone.

910
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:32,010
(My Shy Boss)

911
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:34,220
It felt warm.

912
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:36,449
I said I'm sorry.

913
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,649
- I'm the one who should say that.
- He held you in his arms?

914
01:08:38,689 --> 01:08:40,350
I just vaguely remember the smell.

915
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:41,659
It smelled like peppermint candy.

916
01:08:41,689 --> 01:08:45,029
What Silent Monster needs right now
is not work, but teamwork.

917
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:46,729
Why don't we have a workshop
to build up teamwork?

918
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,560
Will it be an overnight trip?

919
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,260
Why doesn't he tell people
that he's engaged?

920
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:51,569
Are you stopping him
from doing that, too?

921
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:53,869
I can never lie to you.

922
01:08:53,899 --> 01:08:55,539
A video clip?

923
01:08:55,569 --> 01:08:57,069
I really don't understand
what you're talking about.

924
01:08:57,710 --> 01:08:59,170
- What are you watching?
- He's not saying anything.

925
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:00,539
Is that Mr. Eun?

926
01:09:00,569 --> 01:09:03,710
I'll try to make Mr. Eun
become like Mr. Kang.

927
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:06,409
That's absurd. It'll be impossible.

928
01:09:06,449 --> 01:09:08,149
I'm sure Hwan Gi will change.

929
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:09,380
He's capable of doing that.

930
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:13,119
I hope this workshop will
help Hwan Gi change.
