1
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,850
Chae Ji Hye.

2
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,619
I killed her.

3
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,159
Don't blame Woo Il.

4
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,329
He's innocent.

5
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,170
What...

6
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:03,469
No way.

7
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,840
Ji Hye didn't...

8
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:10,680
commit suicide?

9
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,409
Stay away.

10
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,579
I just...

11
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:23,319
want what's mine back.

12
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,799
Don't be scared.

13
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,870
I won't hurt anyone.

14
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,849
There is only one person...

15
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,659
I want to hurt.

16
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,459
No!

17
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:03,530
- No!
- Let go.

18
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,799
Let go, or you'll get hurt too.

19
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,300
- Don't do this!
- Let go!

20
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm the one that killed your sister.

21
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,610
I'll die the same way I killed her.

22
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,810
Let go!

23
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:18,310
- Don't do this!
- Let go!

24
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:20,879
Let go!

25
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,680
Let go!

26
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,550
Let go!

27
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,750
Don't do this, Yi Soo.

28
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,460
- Please.
- I want to end everything.

29
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,490
Please stop.

30
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,229
- Let me put an end to everything.
- Don't!

31
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,699
Let go! Please.

32
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:40,099
Please.

33
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:43,969
Let go.

34
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,110
Yi Soo, please.

35
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:52,009
Please.

36
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:28,479
Thank you.

37
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,689
Without you, Yi Soo would have...

38
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,689
Can you...

39
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,129
tell me everything now?

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,069
She said...

41
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,270
she killed...

42
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,669
my sister.

43
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:58,939
Is it true?

44
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:04,550
I'm the one...

45
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,150
who should have saved her.

46
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,139
Yi Soo.

47
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:33,339
Why are you...

48
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,949
- Hwan Gi.
- Yes?

49
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:45,519
Yi Soo.

50
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,389
What happened?

51
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:52,959
Please.

52
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,000
Please.

53
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,470
Please pick up.

54
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,370
Please.

55
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:10,720
Please.

56
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,439
(Chae Ji Hye)

57
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,939
I'll wait in your office.

58
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,350
(Chae Ji Hye)

59
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,420
(Kang Woo Il)

60
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,319
Woo Il, where are you right now?

61
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,160
- Where are you?
- Hwan Gi.

62
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,769
Yi Soo.

63
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:05,339
Are you okay?

64
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,040
Why were you there?

65
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,750
Please don't say anything...

66
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:17,449
to Woo Il.

67
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:23,420
Did you hear everything?

68
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,430
Yi Soo.

69
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,300
I... I don't want anyone...

70
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,899
to see me like this.

71
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:42,740
I only hurt myself.

72
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,879
It's not like I do anyone any harm.

73
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:53,420
Please don't tell Woo Il.

74
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,589
Look at yourself.

75
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,319
Is that what you want to say
right now?

76
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,899
I could pretend it was a mistake.

77
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,399
I could cover it up.

78
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,509
Wouldn't that work?

79
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,310
Yi Soo.

80
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,139
(You have a new message.)

81
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:33,259
(Chae Ji Hye)

82
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,129
I really wanted to see you
one last time.

83
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,129
I'm sorry.

84
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,509
If I had gotten there earlier...

85
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,379
Before that,

86
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,389
if I had listened to her...

87
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,419
Instead of stopping her...

88
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:42,230
from going to your performance
that day,

89
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,429
I should have told her.

90
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,440
I thought I could bury
everything away all by myself.

91
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,269
I thought it'd be okay.

92
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,940
I made a mistake of thinking
that's how I could protect everyone.

93
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:01,610
That's why I ended up
hurting everyone.

94
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:41,090
Ji Hye's shoes...

95
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:51,830
I gave her this pair of shoes
as a gift.

96
00:09:57,669 --> 00:09:59,299
In her final moments,

97
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:03,409
the person whom she resented
the most...

98
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,240
was probably me.

99
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,220
I think that's why she left this...

100
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:14,250
here.

101
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:22,460
I know it's late,
but I'd like to give it back.

102
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:13,779
(Episode 14: My Funny Valentine)

103
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,070
I brought...

104
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,009
Ji Hye's shoes.

105
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,789
Now, I finally feel like she's home.

106
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,799
Yi Soo.

107
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,009
What on earth have you been doing?

108
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:27,250
You should've told me.
You are my son after all.

109
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:32,389
I can't believe you.
I resent you more than Woo Il.

110
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:35,559
I'm sorry.

111
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,700
I buried everything.

112
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:42,000
If that was the case,

113
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,639
you should've made sure
it doesn't leak.

114
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:48,240
Sorry?

115
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,779
Your dad isn't mad because
of the fact that he's been fooled.

116
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:55,379
He's worried about his election
even in the midst of all this.

117
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:58,480
Men can be distracted by other
women. It's not even a big deal.

118
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:00,379
They aren't even married.

119
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,690
That's how magnanimous
your father is.

120
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,690
I don't agree with him at all.

121
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:12,830
As Yi Soo's brother, how can you
turn a blind eye to what he did...

122
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,799
and try to help them get married?

123
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,230
The deceased is the one to blame.

124
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:20,669
How can she give up her life...

125
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,940
just because a guy betrayed her?

126
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:25,279
Please don't speak
so carelessly.

127
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,049
Yi Soo also...

128
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,549
She nearly lost her life too.

129
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,049
What do you mean?

130
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,889
Three years ago,

131
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:45,129
Yi Soo made a suicide attempt
in front of Ms. Chae.

132
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:48,769
- What?
- Yi Soo did what?

133
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,610
After lashing out
at Ms. Chae, she...

134
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,240
slit her wrist.

135
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,250
Ms. Chae is tender-hearted,
so the shock from witnessing it...

136
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,620
must have clouded her judgment.

137
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:12,320
That is crazy.

138
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,759
There's no way Yi Soo
would've done such a thing!

139
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,159
The two of you need to know now.

140
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,059
Stop only seeing
what you want to see.

141
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,299
It's all because
of Kang Woo Il.

142
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,299
He completely ruined my daughter.

143
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,840
No.

144
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,850
It's not Woo Il's fault.

145
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:38,950
Yi Soo, are you all right?

146
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,690
How did you...

147
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,789
At first,

148
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,129
I got scared whenever Dad
yelled at Hwan Gi.

149
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,409
That's why I started
slitting my wrist intentionally...

150
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,070
and spilling hot soup on myself.

151
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,980
That used to end everything.

152
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:10,080
It became quiet.

153
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,379
What?

154
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:17,759
You were the only thing
I was proud of.

155
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,659
Even when Hwan Gi upset me,

156
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,399
I could still smile because of you.

157
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,799
That's why I smiled.

158
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:31,139
Even when I was sick or sad,
I kept a smile on my face.

159
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,769
But then, I got all confused.

160
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,779
I was obviously sad...

161
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,309
and hurt,

162
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:45,779
but my face was smiling.

163
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,649
I felt like someone inside me...

164
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,690
kept telling me to get rid of me,

165
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:57,029
to kill me.

166
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:03,700
Yi Soo...
Are you really my daughter, Yi Soo?

167
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,769
Yes.

168
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:12,039
This is me.

169
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,110
I hate myself so much too.

170
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,419
I didn't want anyone to find out
about this.

171
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:22,690
Stop.

172
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:24,990
Stop, please.

173
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,259
- I'm sorry...
- Yi Soo...

174
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:47,950
There's big news, everyone.
Gather here.

175
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,480
- What is it?
- What's going on?

176
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,480
You remember the secretary
who died three years ago, right?

177
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,750
I heard that she actually...

178
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,860
took her own life
because of Mr. Kang.

179
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:02,259
Apparently, he cheated on her.

180
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,759
The wedding has been called off
and he got kicked out because of it.

181
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:06,859
My goodness.

182
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,369
Why did it come up
to the surface now though?

183
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,970
Has the power struggle
turned into a messy war?

184
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,509
- Possibly.
- I see.

185
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:16,170
I feel bad for Mr. Kang.

186
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,880
Hearing that he cheated on his
fiancee got me all disappointed,

187
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:24,079
but no one can be more competent
than him. Aren't I right?

188
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:27,990
Who says that? You obviously
know nothing about Hwan Gi.

189
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:29,289
- Hwan Gi?
- Hwan Gi?

190
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,460
Once you get to know him, you'll
realize how competent Hwan Gi is.

191
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,859
He's a cool guy. I give him that.

192
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,460
- You need to experience his charms.
- You sure do.

193
00:17:40,829 --> 00:17:43,430
You lucked out and ended up on the
right side. Good for you.

194
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,440
Yes, we're so excited.

195
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,809
Hurrah!

196
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,039
Attention, everyone.

197
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,410
- Let's talk in the meeting room...
- There's no need.

198
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:00,420
You can just listen
where you are now.

199
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,599
Well...

200
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:24,369
- Mr. Eun.
- Sorry. Yes.

201
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,680
Mr. Kang...

202
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,250
will come back to the company soon.

203
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,859
So stick to
your position...

204
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:44,130
and be responsible for your role
voluntarily.

205
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:47,970
Please do your work voluntarily.

206
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:02,980
That's it?

207
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:06,480
When is Mr. Kang coming back?

208
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:08,119
Do we just sit and wait?

209
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,589
We should do our job voluntarily
in our own seats.

210
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:14,789
What is that? He's just telling us
to take care of our own jobs.

211
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:17,660
Gosh.

212
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,359
Was your team always neglected?

213
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,099
No. He must have a plan.

214
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,440
There's a deep hidden meaning
behind that short speech.

215
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:30,569
Of course.

216
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:34,650
- And what could that be?
- Well...

217
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:43,990
I'm not sure.

218
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,130
- Let's get back to work.
- Okay.

219
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:50,890
Okay.

220
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,500
Let's work.

221
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:58,970
He's comfortable around us now,

222
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,769
but maybe he got nervous
because there are too many people.

223
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,470
Whenever the employees
get nervous like this,

224
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:07,079
we need someone like Mr. Kang...

225
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,579
that can lead us with confidence.

226
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:13,680
Hwan Gi's shy leadership strategy
will take root one day.

227
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,119
It took us a while
to get warmed up too.

228
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:18,819
That's the unfortunate part.

229
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,460
It takes way too long.

230
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:26,299
Why did Ro Woon take a day off
on a day like this?

231
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,599
Leave her alone for a while.

232
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,339
Okay.

233
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,079
- Go ahead.
- I'm all right.

234
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:48,119
I was being nice bringing you here.

235
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:51,289
Then...

236
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:54,460
I'll take this one.

237
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,259
Is one enough?

238
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,160
It's your first Valentine's Day
present to Hwan Gi.

239
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,769
Who?

240
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,569
You're not buying it for me?

241
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:09,410
Since it's almost Valentine's Day,
I brought you here for a fair game.

242
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,809
I guess you don't
intend on confessing to him.

243
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,279
Then I'll get him the most beautiful
and expensive one.

244
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,849
This one looks expensive.

245
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:26,259
I confessed to my first love
on a Valentine's Day too.

246
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:29,789
I made chocolates
and wrote a corny letter.

247
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,859
It was cute.

248
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,000
How can I do that right now?

249
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:36,329
You already know
I'm in no position to do that.

250
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:39,039
Who said that my first love
was Hwan Gi?

251
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:41,369
Hwan Gi's first love was me,

252
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,369
but my first love
was a boy from church.

253
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:47,440
He was a good singer
and a good pianist.

254
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,750
He was so hot.

255
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,009
I see.

256
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,390
Is Hwan Gi all you think about?

257
00:21:56,019 --> 00:21:59,119
You're in no position to do that.
How can you think about him?

258
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:04,289
You're really...
Stop making fun of me.

259
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,900
It's like "Romeo and Juliet".
I don't want to watch...

260
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,500
this tragic love story.

261
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,670
You two are desperate
for each other.

262
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,839
I'm jealous of your dramatic love.

263
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:18,140
It's not like that.

264
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,180
You heard that Hwan Gi
is leading the company alone, right?

265
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:30,990
Are you really going
to give up like this?

266
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,390
Can't you forgive him?

267
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,500
Well...

268
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:41,230
It's not that I can't forgive him.

269
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,140
I can.

270
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:47,940
I mean, I already did.

271
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,079
However,
I still shouldn't go to him yet.

272
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,509
Hwan Gi still has...

273
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:01,549
someone he has to protect
aside from me.

274
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,359
We got too friendly today. Let's go.

275
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,490
Do you want to look at paintings?

276
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:12,630
Yes.

277
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,799
Didn't Yun Jung...

278
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,109
want to show me paintings?
Where is she?

279
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:44,130
(Yun Jung)

280
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,259
It's a rare painting I got
as a curator.

281
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,529
Take your time to enjoy it.

282
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:02,440
Turn around just once.

283
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:04,910
Just once.

284
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,569
I'm sorry.

285
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,200
Could you stay as you are
just for a moment?

286
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:35,670
So I can at least see you like this.

287
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,589
- What's the time, Mr. Wolf?
- Go outside to play.

288
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,890
- Gosh.
- Let's go.

289
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,130
(Let's grow our dreams.)

290
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,230
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

291
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:07,599
Clean it properly. It's so dirty.

292
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,910
Gosh.

293
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,309
What are you doing?

294
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,880
Why are you here? What about work?

295
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:16,609
You left all of us behind.
Why are you worried all of a sudden?

296
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,950
I wanted to see how well you do
without me.

297
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,890
Did you run away already?

298
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,059
Frankly, I was a bit flustered.

299
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,690
Your absence is hard to fill.

300
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,529
I'm glad.

301
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,660
It's about time you realize it.

302
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:38,200
Not anyone understands me
like you.

303
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,299
You're the only one...

304
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:43,309
that can convey my messages.

305
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:45,839
Look at that.

306
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,450
Are you treating me like a shell?
Are you the only CEO?

307
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:50,779
I didn't do that.

308
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,849
You're just feeling guilty.

309
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,319
Guilty?

310
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,990
It must have been tough for you...

311
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:05,130
to listen to someone
as stubborn as me...

312
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:07,829
and to stand in front of others.

313
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:10,930
What I'm saying is...

314
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,170
If it wasn't for you,

315
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,710
I couldn't have come this far.

316
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,710
I'm thanking you.

317
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,549
Do you realize
that this is your first?

318
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:32,759
You never thanked me before.

319
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,490
- Really?
- Was that so...

320
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,700
Was it that hard to say?
What took you so long?

321
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,099
What? Does it mean so much?

322
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:47,799
Why would you be so moved?

323
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:51,140
What are you talking about?
I wasn't moved.

324
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,549
In any case, I can't go back.

325
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,650
Come out.

326
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:05,819
There's another person
who wants to see you.

327
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,890
I feel bad...

328
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,390
to see you like this.

329
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:43,130
Why? I like it.

330
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,900
- I feel relieved.
- You do?

331
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,769
That's good.

332
00:28:54,869 --> 00:28:58,579
I was a burden to you, right?

333
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:02,410
- That's not what I meant.
- It's okay.

334
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,380
I finally start to see myself.

335
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:12,660
I finally start to
have the courage to.

336
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:17,660
It used to be so hard for me
to face myself.

337
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:28,000
There's a part of me I've been
hiding from you by all means.

338
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:31,670
I'll show you now.

339
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:35,680
I...

340
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:41,619
hurt myself for a long time.

341
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:46,690
I had to do that to live.

342
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:52,059
What do you mean?

343
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,269
Three years ago,

344
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,000
I was the one...

345
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,539
Ms. Chae saw last.

346
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,950
I told her I'd kill myself
if I lose you.

347
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:14,380
You told her that?

348
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:21,819
Please don't say anything to Woo Il.

349
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,259
Was your...

350
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,470
wrist injury from...

351
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,440
You might have been the one
who took out the gun,

352
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,750
but I must have been the one...

353
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:45,380
who pulled the trigger.

354
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:54,890
Free yourself now.

355
00:30:57,529 --> 00:30:59,700
It's okay to stop feeling guilty...

356
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:02,500
about Ms. Chae.

357
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,400
I mean...

358
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:08,500
I'm just finding it hard to believe.

359
00:31:11,609 --> 00:31:15,250
Why would you do such a thing? Why?

360
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:21,880
I've been just watching you suffer.

361
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,220
I'm so sorry...

362
00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:28,119
I couldn't tell you earlier.

363
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:32,029
Is it because of me?

364
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:35,730
Is it because I make you suffer?

365
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,509
You can free yourself from me now.

366
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:48,009
Free yourself from my dad too.

367
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,450
Be who you really are.

368
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:58,349
This place is not for you.

369
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:37,089
Now that I told him everything,

370
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:40,730
it feels like nothing.

371
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,339
It's okay.

372
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:50,109
Everything will be all right.

373
00:32:56,049 --> 00:32:59,319
I mean it.

374
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,390
I feel so relieved.

375
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,329
Revealing everything...

376
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:12,700
and letting go of myself...

377
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,599
turns out to be so relieving.

378
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,480
Good job.

379
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,450
Good job, Yi Soo.

380
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,730
You're all alone again.

381
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,000
Pour me one.

382
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,539
Gosh.

383
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:04,680
Let me pour you one then.

384
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,049
Here...

385
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,920
Did you eat?

386
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:13,920
No.

387
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:16,389
Do you want to have dinner with me?

388
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,670
I'll prepare it.

389
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,710
I'm sorry.

390
00:35:10,449 --> 00:35:13,820
I had a little drink. I can't...

391
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,730
Here.

392
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,739
Well, I'll...

393
00:36:40,969 --> 00:36:45,269
After Ji Hye left,
do you know what I thought?

394
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:50,110
"She should have hung in there."

395
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,949
"She should have put up with it."

396
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,550
That's what I thought.

397
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:00,519
I didn't know what really happened.

398
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,159
I just thought she made
a stupid decision...

399
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,559
because she had too much work.

400
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:10,269
"Everyone puts up with it.
Why couldn't you?"

401
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,570
I blamed her.

402
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:18,269
It's not even like I didn't know
what kind of person she was.

403
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:23,750
She always put up with things.

404
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,190
I guess she shouldn't have tried to
hang in there this time.

405
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:35,389
She kept everything to herself
and put up with it.

406
00:37:40,429 --> 00:37:43,199
Had I known she was hurt,

407
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,699
she wouldn't have left like that.

408
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:55,380
- I'm sorry.
- No.

409
00:37:56,349 --> 00:37:57,849
I'm the sinner.

410
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,619
After letting my eldest go,

411
00:38:01,849 --> 00:38:06,090
I told my younger one
to endure and stand through it.

412
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,159
That's what I told her.

413
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,789
It's my fault.

414
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,739
Thank you.

415
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:00,739
Thank you for telling us the truth.

416
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,280
No, sir.

417
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,380
I'm really sorry.

418
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:14,820
Here.

419
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:37,309
I mean, it's happened to us before.

420
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,679
What is it? Did something happen?

421
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:43,289
Brain's client is facing
an unfavorable situation.

422
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,989
It's Bravo Liquors.
It's a beer company.

423
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,860
Their beer bottles exploded.

424
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,260
Their bottles exploded? Why?

425
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:56,800
Liquor companies
recycle beer bottles.

426
00:39:56,969 --> 00:39:59,300
They have to dispose them
after five times,

427
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:01,340
but they use it over 50 times.

428
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:04,469
They'll save more money
the more they recycle.

429
00:40:04,809 --> 00:40:08,010
If they add nitrogen
and close the lid on such bottles,

430
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:11,949
they get bigger and the pressure
makes it go...

431
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,219
A bar owner...

432
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:16,719
got hit in the eye
and lost his sight.

433
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:21,059
You're saying something like this
will happen again?

434
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:24,590
Well, we get a case or two per year.

435
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:27,059
Mr. Kang acted fast
whenever such a thing happened.

436
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,929
He prioritized making settlements
with the victims.

437
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:33,070
Paying settlement money
once or twice a year...

438
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:35,809
is cheaper than exchanging
all the bottles.

439
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:38,510
Is that why you want to
cover it up and turn a blind eye?

440
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:43,309
What about
the company's responsibility?

441
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,280
We need to admit honestly
and face the truth.

442
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,449
It will help promote the company
as well.

443
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:51,889
Sir.

444
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:54,590
I'm not sure if the client...

445
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,659
will agree to paying
the extensive costs.

446
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,929
We have to persuade them.

447
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:02,300
Bravo Liquors is only asking for
Mr. Kang who is their main contact.

448
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:05,130
He's no longer here.

449
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:07,369
Who will...

450
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,610
It's not Bravo Liquors
that's in trouble.

451
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,039
It's us who's in trouble.

452
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:49,110
A headhunter keeps on suggesting
I change jobs.

453
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:51,449
The position is good,
and the pay is not bad.

454
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,550
I'm thinking of moving to
the PR department of a big firm...

455
00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:56,650
to get some in-house experience.

456
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:57,949
In-house?

457
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,289
That's not a bad idea.

458
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:27,119
He has the hood on again.

459
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,349
He does.

460
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,650
He must have a lot on his mind.

461
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:33,019
Shouldn't we help him?

462
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:36,090
Yes, I already called for
the miracle cure.

463
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:38,489
- She should be here by now.
- Miracle cure?

464
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:40,960
Excuse me.

465
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:45,530
Can you gather the employees
in the meeting room?

466
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,699
Are you planning to talk
in front of them again?

467
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,369
- Yes.
- Okay, sure.

468
00:42:52,809 --> 00:42:54,079
Let's go down.

469
00:42:55,179 --> 00:42:56,679
Come on.

470
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,449
(Chae Ro Woon)

471
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,070
What is this?

472
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:21,099
Can't you take off your hoodie?

473
00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:23,130
What?

474
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:28,869
That's only if you don't plan on
being Yun Jung's personal rapper.

475
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,980
I heard all about your sweet past.

476
00:44:36,809 --> 00:44:37,809
I see...

477
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:41,579
She was bugging me so much
by talking about the past.

478
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:45,289
At least while you're with me,
don't wear the hoodie.

479
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:47,190
It makes me jealous.

480
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:58,070
I heard you're gathering everyone.

481
00:44:58,699 --> 00:44:59,900
What are you thinking of?

482
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:06,480
Everyone is lost and confused...

483
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,679
because Woo Il isn't here.

484
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:16,150
Are you trying to be charismatic
like Mr. Kang?

485
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:22,420
I thought I told you this already.

486
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,400
Don't change.

487
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,769
Don't try to become Mr. Kang.

488
00:45:32,969 --> 00:45:36,639
How about you communicate with them
in your own way?

489
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,920
However, you should still take off
this hoodie.

490
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:51,389
- Come on.
- My arm.

491
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:54,119
To be honest, it doesn't suit you.

492
00:45:58,159 --> 00:45:59,260
Anyway, should we...

493
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:03,400
We can talk about ourselves later.

494
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:08,039
You should take care
of your staff first.

495
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:28,760
(Meeting process,
description, timeline)

496
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,760
To employees of Brain,

497
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,500
I suggest open meetings.

498
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,170
What is this?

499
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:41,300
Meetings?

500
00:46:42,769 --> 00:46:44,909
- What's that?
- Meetings?

501
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:52,110
You can choose
how the meeting will be held.

502
00:46:52,449 --> 00:46:54,849
- You must be hungry.
- Yes.

503
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,420
- I'll do it.
- It's okay.

504
00:46:57,449 --> 00:46:58,949
I'll do it. Stay seated.

505
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,619
- It's bean sprout soup.
- I see.

506
00:47:02,659 --> 00:47:04,090
I hope you'll like it.

507
00:47:05,329 --> 00:47:06,429
Thank you.

508
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,630
The meeting can be held over lunch.

509
00:47:14,269 --> 00:47:17,269
We can have a little drink too.

510
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:23,880
- Do you want some more?
- I'll do it.

511
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,110
I can do it.

512
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:31,519
Cheers.

513
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,590
Cheers.

514
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:38,989
To have an active discussion,
I prefer seeing...

515
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:40,860
up to three people at a time.

516
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,670
- It tastes good.
- It's very tasty.

517
00:47:43,699 --> 00:47:46,300
- I drank last night.
- I see. Eat up.

518
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:49,840
I didn't know
you cared about us so much.

519
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:52,510
You said we should
take care of ourselves.

520
00:47:52,909 --> 00:47:55,710
What I was trying to say was...

521
00:47:56,179 --> 00:47:59,679
that you need to be able to
manage yourselves.

522
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:03,119
I guess there was
not enough explanation.

523
00:48:03,389 --> 00:48:06,150
Rather than blindly
following the orders,

524
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:08,389
you should be able to
motivate yourself...

525
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:11,289
and any kind of ideas
should be welcomed.

526
00:48:11,329 --> 00:48:15,599
I want our company
to be a place like that.

527
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,170
In short,

528
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,500
it'd be a company
where no boss is needed.

529
00:48:28,309 --> 00:48:31,409
Please help me a lot.

530
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:40,019
When talking one-on-one,
he's easier to talk to.

531
00:48:40,059 --> 00:48:42,920
I agree. Who said he's quiet?

532
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,659
He talks a lot.

533
00:48:44,929 --> 00:48:46,329
He's so talkative.

534
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,039
It seems like you're getting on
with your employees.

535
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,449
I'm sorry.

536
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,050
Okay.

537
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:11,920
Sorry?

538
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:18,260
I made Woo Il take charge of
all communications.

539
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:21,630
It was irresponsible of me.

540
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:28,239
- Well...
- I've tried to hide my flaws...

541
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:30,269
just like Bravo Liquors did.

542
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:33,440
But it...

543
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:36,409
didn't turn out well.

544
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:41,980
So I'm trying to
apologize for my faults...

545
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:44,750
and work on my flaws.

546
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:48,559
I thought I should change first
before I try to...

547
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:50,460
persuade my client.

548
00:49:51,329 --> 00:49:54,400
I... I see.

549
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,099
Regarding the meeting
with our client...

550
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:02,269
If you could accompany me,

551
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:05,840
it'd be a big help.

552
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:14,780
Then...

553
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:17,949
I'll accompany you.

554
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,429
You will?

555
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,599
Well...

556
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,559
To Silent Monster.

557
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:32,769
- To Silent Monster.
- Bravo.

558
00:50:32,869 --> 00:50:36,639
Since Bravo Liquors decided to
discard their old bottles,

559
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:39,469
their stock price has been soaring.

560
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:45,510
Their case is being praised as
a good crisis management example.

561
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,280
It's all thanks to our client's
brave decision.

562
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,949
You're so modest.

563
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:52,750
Anyway, congratulations
on your successful debut.

564
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:53,820
Thank you.

565
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,789
- Cheers.
- Bravo.

566
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:00,360
By the way, Woo Il is...

567
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,659
coming back.

568
00:51:02,929 --> 00:51:07,000
You said you wanted a company
where no boss is needed.

569
00:51:07,769 --> 00:51:10,869
- Are you leaving the company?
- Sorry.

570
00:51:10,909 --> 00:51:14,239
He's not our boss. He's just
Hwan Gi. Did you forget?

571
00:51:15,179 --> 00:51:17,480
She's right. Don't say such a thing.

572
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:20,780
I don't want to imagine
Hwan Gi not being here.

573
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:22,820
- I'm sorry.
- Exactly.

574
00:51:22,849 --> 00:51:24,719
It'd be like an egg without yolk.

575
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,619
- Or beer without alcohol.
- Exactly.

576
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:29,860
Sun Bong, that was a nice one.

577
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,960
Hwan Gi gives us fresh ideas.

578
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,360
- That's right.
- Exactly.

579
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,230
Stop it and drink.

580
00:51:42,969 --> 00:51:44,070
Are you leaving?

581
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:47,280
Yes.

582
00:51:49,949 --> 00:51:52,349
Well...

583
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,650
Are you...

584
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:59,119
coming tomorrow?

585
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:01,889
Why wouldn't I?

586
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:04,230
Were you not going to see me again?

587
00:52:05,659 --> 00:52:07,659
I never said
I wouldn't see you again.

588
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,269
Right.

589
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:18,809
That day,

590
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:22,809
you closed the door after saying
only what you wanted to say.

591
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,909
I couldn't say what I wanted to say.

592
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:31,349
Why did you do that? You kept
your door closed for three years.

593
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:34,320
It was painful for you too.
Why did you do it again?

594
00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:42,360
I'd like to request
a one-on-one meeting.

595
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,030
Is tomorrow evening okay for you?

596
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:48,969
Then I'll see you tomorrow.

597
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:54,639
Right.

598
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,179
You know it's
Valentine's Day tomorrow, right?

599
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:17,929
Why would you have a meeting here?

600
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:20,300
I have the right to decide
how the meeting is held, right?

601
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:22,900
The estimated waiting time is
two hours.

602
00:53:23,769 --> 00:53:24,869
Would you like to wait?

603
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,610
- Two hours?
- Let's find another place.

604
00:53:39,489 --> 00:53:42,389
Isn't it too pink here?

605
00:53:44,289 --> 00:53:48,130
This place usually
doesn't look like this.

606
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,570
Should we move?

607
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,170
Let's just stay.

608
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:59,039
I don't think we'll be able to
find another place.

609
00:54:03,409 --> 00:54:06,079
Why did you want to meet me
on a day like this?

610
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,860
I realized...

611
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:22,400
we've never had
any proper meal together.

612
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,099
Just the two of us, I mean.

613
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:27,300
We haven't?

614
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,840
We've never watched
any movies together either.

615
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:33,809
We have.

616
00:54:34,409 --> 00:54:35,480
Sorry?

617
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:49,119
You came? Why didn't you
come see me?

618
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,659
Where were you sitting?

619
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:53,289
Well, somewhere near you.

620
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,829
What's with you?

621
00:54:56,699 --> 00:54:58,869
Were you just staring at
the back of my head?

622
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:12,110
You look a little nervous.

623
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,280
As if you're on a date.

624
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:17,219
It's not like that.

625
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:19,789
I'm just not sure...

626
00:55:21,219 --> 00:55:22,420
if it's really okay for us
to do this.

627
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,829
You said...

628
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:34,670
my sister would have blamed you
in her last moment.

629
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,670
But I don't think
that was the case at all.

630
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:43,679
She left the shoes you gave her.

631
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:46,010
I don't think she resented you.

632
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:48,179
She must have felt sorry.

633
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:52,849
She hurt your family member.

634
00:55:53,489 --> 00:55:55,219
She must have felt sorry for that.

635
00:55:56,489 --> 00:55:58,230
My sister is that kind of person.

636
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,800
Is your sister all right?

637
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:09,699
Yes.

638
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:12,440
She feels...

639
00:56:14,139 --> 00:56:15,510
very sorry.

640
00:56:18,409 --> 00:56:20,420
I hope she'll become healthy.

641
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:23,150
I'm sure my sister thinks the same.

642
00:56:30,389 --> 00:56:36,829
I know that there are still many
things that we need to overcome.

643
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:40,599
But can we do it together?

644
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:44,010
We already have so many obstacles.

645
00:56:45,269 --> 00:56:47,179
Let's not shut each other out.

646
00:56:51,409 --> 00:56:52,449
From now on,

647
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,920
you're not allowed
to watch me secretly.

648
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,489
We have to face each other
no matter what happens.

649
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,420
And no more secrets.

650
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:06,429
Okay?

651
00:57:16,869 --> 00:57:19,440
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
Hello, hello.

652
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:22,739
It's nice to meet you all.
Are you all enjoying your food?

653
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,780
- Yes.
- Great. Thank you.

654
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:31,019
All right. To thank all the couples
for visiting us on Valentine's Day,

655
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:36,960
we've prepared a sweet kiss event.

656
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:38,789
Please applaud!

657
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:47,170
Good. Then I'll start counting down
from five.

658
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:49,369
You all got that, right? Five!

659
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,239
Can we be doing this?

660
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:52,639
Four!

661
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,980
I'm sorry, but I don't feel
comfortable doing it here.

662
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:58,610
- Three!
- I never said I wanted to do it.

663
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:00,280
- I'm speechless.
- Two!

664
00:58:00,949 --> 00:58:02,219
Then shall we leave?

665
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,320
- One!
- Yes. Let's go.

666
00:58:05,349 --> 00:58:06,989
Lights off, please!

667
00:58:07,889 --> 00:58:09,219
You've been waiting for this,
haven't you?

668
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,329
- Boss, where are you?
- My goodness.

669
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:13,860
Over here.

670
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,300
- Here?
- No.

671
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,170
Why are you touching there?

672
00:58:19,369 --> 00:58:22,869
I'm sorry. I don't know what I
touched, but it wasn't intentional.

673
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,739
Just stay still.
I'll find your hand.

674
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,510
There. I'm holding your hand.

675
00:58:29,179 --> 00:58:31,909
Whose hand are you holding?
My hands are here.

676
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:33,780
Then whose hand is this?

677
00:58:33,949 --> 00:58:36,179
Boss... Gosh, where are you?

678
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:53,469
My goodness.

679
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,210
Gosh, you must have peculiar taste.

680
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:01,280
Come on.

681
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,280
My gosh.

682
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:13,489
Did you get hurt when you fell?

683
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:17,690
Just a little. It's fine.

684
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,489
Will you be able to walk?

685
00:59:19,929 --> 00:59:22,159
I'm really okay. See?

686
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:24,030
I'm fine, right?

687
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:27,900
Oh, just a second.

688
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,150
He wants to carry me on his back?

689
00:59:40,519 --> 00:59:42,179
Gosh, seriously.

690
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,449
I said I'm fine.

691
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:47,619
I'm really...

692
00:59:49,289 --> 00:59:50,590
We shouldn't be...

693
00:59:51,329 --> 00:59:53,559
doing things like this yet.

694
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:58,030
Sorry?

695
01:00:04,369 --> 01:00:06,809
Oh, you weren't sitting down
to give me a piggyback ride.

696
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:08,739
Your shoelaces?

697
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:14,219
My goodness.

698
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,389
Wait.

699
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:20,860
You said it's fine.

700
01:00:21,219 --> 01:00:22,389
That's not what I meant.

701
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,690
Get me down, please.
I want to get down.

702
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,400
We can't be doing this.

703
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,300
Just pretend you're in pain.

704
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,570
Even if you're fine,

705
01:00:36,139 --> 01:00:37,239
just fake it.

706
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,179
I know that we can't be doing this.

707
01:00:43,409 --> 01:00:44,409
But...

708
01:00:46,579 --> 01:00:47,849
I want to do this.

709
01:01:04,329 --> 01:01:07,500
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...

710
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:17,150
Hold on. Just a second.

711
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,510
Sure.

712
01:01:30,789 --> 01:01:32,690
I can walk.

713
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,000
Goodness.

714
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:37,429
I can do this too. Get on my back.

715
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:44,739
Just let me carry you.
I can totally do it.

716
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:46,309
It's a piece of cake.

717
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:48,940
You sound so lighthearted now.

718
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:51,809
Are you belittling me?

719
01:01:52,679 --> 01:01:57,119
You probably don't remember, but
I carried you home the other day.

720
01:02:04,659 --> 01:02:07,159
- Is that so?
- I'm serious.

721
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:09,860
Cut it out.

722
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,510
Can you hold my hand instead?

723
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:21,510
I thought you were okay.

724
01:02:22,579 --> 01:02:24,349
You told me to pretend that I'm not.

725
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:31,889
But holding hands is...

726
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:34,659
I won't be comfortable.

727
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:53,710
Well...

728
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:59,449
Just hold my arm.
Let's not link arms.

729
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:03,219
You want me to hold your arm? How?

730
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:07,559
Like this?

731
01:03:09,019 --> 01:03:10,190
- Are we good now?
- Yes.

732
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:11,429
All right. Let's go.

733
01:03:18,969 --> 01:03:20,000
Right.

734
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:25,510
It's Valentine's Day,
but we shouldn't really indulge...

735
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:29,010
in being all romantic right now.

736
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:31,280
Exactly.

737
01:03:35,219 --> 01:03:38,090
I'm not getting
any chocolates, am I?

738
01:03:38,389 --> 01:03:41,190
Chocolate, my foot. Things
between us aren't exactly sweet yet.

739
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,489
I can't even hold your hand
or link arms with you.

740
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,730
What's more?

741
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:52,500
You got all shy and acted like
we've never kissed before.

742
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:57,940
Did you want a kiss?

743
01:03:58,039 --> 01:04:00,639
Well...
How can you ask me that outright?

744
01:04:01,309 --> 01:04:05,510
Will you give me a kiss
if I say that I wanted it?

745
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:09,679
You couldn't do it when the lights
were off and the mood was heated up.

746
01:05:05,139 --> 01:05:08,309
What was that about? Just a hug?

747
01:05:27,059 --> 01:05:28,099
It's not...

748
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:31,599
a Valentine's Day gift.

749
01:05:31,699 --> 01:05:32,769
I'm just...

750
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:35,599
I'm giving it to you for no reason.

751
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:40,510
Well, then...

752
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:45,449
I'll get going.

753
01:05:46,809 --> 01:05:47,880
Well...

754
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:55,489
Wait.

755
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:01,099
Boss.

756
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:21,849
That's...

757
01:06:22,619 --> 01:06:24,050
my Valentine's Day gift...

758
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:26,789
to you.

759
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:02,389
CEO Eun Hwan Gi.

760
01:07:04,489 --> 01:07:05,659
It's you, right?

761
01:07:06,659 --> 01:07:07,860
Well, yes.

762
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:10,400
Who are you?

763
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,070
Too bad.

764
01:07:13,269 --> 01:07:14,500
You're smiling so happily...

765
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:17,710
next to Ro Woon.

766
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:20,510
But you don't have the right to.

767
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:23,639
- Sorry?
- There's something you don't know.

768
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:48,170
(My Shy Boss)
