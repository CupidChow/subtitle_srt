1
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:54,429
Ro Woon is going to Brain.

2
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,929
The company Ji Hye worked for.

3
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,799
She wants to take revenge.

4
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,299
What?

5
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,100
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

6
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,810
I tried to stop her,
but she wouldn't listen to me.

7
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,969
Please stop her.

8
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,379
I'm telling you this
because I'm worried about her.

9
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,700
The weight must have been...

10
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,730
so hard on you.

11
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:39,370
What kind of other things...

12
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:43,209
are you trying
to be responsible for?

13
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:46,950
I don't care what they are.

14
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,349
I'll support you no matter what.

15
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,950
I'll stay by your side.

16
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,710
I'll get you some coffee.

17
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:56,710
Sleep some more.

18
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,389
Ro Woon.

19
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:50,730
Dad.

20
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,709
What are you doing here?

21
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,339
What did you do?

22
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:20,259
You...

23
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,199
Why are you here?

24
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,339
Are you the CEO of this company?

25
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,449
Then why did you come to my
barbershop?

26
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:49,389
- Dad, he's...
- Be quiet!

27
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,620
What was your intention?

28
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:57,660
You never came to Ji Hye's funeral.

29
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,069
How could you so shamelessly...

30
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,970
be sitting in front of me?

31
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,850
I'm... I'm sorry.

32
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,420
I wasn't trying to deceive you.

33
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:25,120
I had no idea.

34
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:28,560
You killed my daughter.

35
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:31,060
And I...

36
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,769
cut your hair so carefully
with my own hands.

37
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:41,569
I'm sorry.

38
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,240
I'm sorry.

39
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,850
I'm really sorry.

40
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,319
Ro Woon.

41
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,550
Come with me right now.

42
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:56,490
- Dad.
- Now!

43
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:05,660
Go on.

44
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,029
Boss.

45
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:12,040
Go to your father.

46
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,100
(Episode 12:
The Difficulty of Doing Nothing)

47
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,040
He's not a bad person.

48
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,339
It was all a misunderstanding.

49
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,319
He was the one who sent me flowers.

50
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:03,319
He visited you for three years
because he wanted to apologize.

51
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:04,790
Is that what he told you?

52
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,230
Deceiving me right in front of my
face was his way of apologizing?

53
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,490
Do you think that makes sense?

54
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:16,129
He couldn't bring himself
to come forward.

55
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,839
- He'll take the responsibility now.
- We can't turn anything back.

56
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,509
Why did you do something
so pointless?

57
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,079
Why did you go there?

58
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,120
Then...

59
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:36,820
what have you been doing?

60
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,129
While he was hovering around
this barbershop...

61
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:47,029
While I was trying to take revenge
by doing those pointless things...

62
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:49,769
What were you doing?

63
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,009
"Don't do anything."

64
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,509
"Don't say anything."

65
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:58,980
"Just stay where you are."

66
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,610
You didn't even step out
of this tiny barbershop.

67
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,419
After we lost Ji Hye,

68
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,590
Mom followed her too.

69
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,429
It's all your fault!

70
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:21,830
It's because
you didn't do anything.

71
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:28,740
The fact that
we can't turn back time...

72
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,679
He knows that too.

73
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:35,210
But he's still trying
to do something.

74
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,279
He is...

75
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,620
so much better than you.

76
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,600
Get out.

77
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,039
- Dad.
- I said, get out.

78
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:55,990
Gosh, it's freezing.

79
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:58,000
It's so cold.

80
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,629
Why are you here?

81
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,500
It looks like you just got in too.

82
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,799
Where were you?

83
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:08,840
Did you roll in grass or something?

84
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,309
You don't need to know.
Just go home.

85
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,779
I actually got kicked out.

86
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,490
Let me sleep here, please.

87
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,549
What are you talking about?

88
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,059
Go home.

89
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:30,059
My dad is usually
very gentle and quiet,

90
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,830
but he's a stubborn man and a firm
believer in keeping his word.

91
00:11:33,929 --> 00:11:36,769
- I'll just get kicked out again.
- Ro Woon.

92
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,169
All right.

93
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,070
I'll go.

94
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,139
I'll go, but I'm so cold
and hungry right now.

95
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:49,480
I want to eat something warm
before I leave.

96
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,629
Do you have any ramyeon
lying around?

97
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,929
Get out.

98
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,529
I'll eat something quick and go.

99
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,070
Fine, but just leave it.
Don't touch anything in my kitchen.

100
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,059
Thank you for the meal.

101
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,669
This is definitely warming me up.

102
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:50,710
I feel as if I'm eating
my mom's food.

103
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:52,940
Why don't you eat at home?

104
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,279
Right, you saw everything.

105
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,820
I become a completely
different person when I get home.

106
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:09,759
I look prettier
when I'm not talking,

107
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,299
don't you think?

108
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,669
Do you get drained
from acting happy all the time...

109
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,539
and just crash when you get home?
Is that why?

110
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,309
There's some of that.

111
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,480
It's also because of my dad.

112
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,279
We share something in common.

113
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,750
Just like how people tell you
to be more like Kang Woo Il,

114
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,190
when I'm home...
"Be more like your sister."

115
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,190
I'm sick of hearing it.

116
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:49,929
"Be quiet and well-behaved
like Ji Hye."

117
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,639
Even after she died like that,

118
00:13:54,809 --> 00:13:56,269
I was told to be quiet.

119
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,049
"Please don't do anything."

120
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,220
I made my dad's wish come true.

121
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:14,120
That's how he is.

122
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:20,299
Look at that.

123
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:23,299
He barged in here as if he'd set
this entire place on fire,

124
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,039
but he just left
without doing anything.

125
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,370
He did his utmost
to restrain himself...

126
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,039
for you.

127
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:39,179
He's telling you not to do anything
because he wants to protect you.

128
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,690
Because he knows your personality
better than anyone else does,

129
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,159
he's worried you might
get hurt from being reckless.

130
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:48,860
You are...

131
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:51,399
the only thing he has left now.

132
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:57,529
Doing something can be hard,

133
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:03,870
but not doing anything must've been
extremely difficult for him.

134
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,879
Well, you may be right.

135
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,419
Then he should've told me.

136
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,450
Does he have to tell you?

137
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,820
You and my dad are so similar.

138
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,559
All guys around me...

139
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:29,629
are so hard to read.

mad at me.

00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,259
It's just for tonight.

168
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,670
You held me as we slept last night.
What is this?

169
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:18,869
That's because...

170
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,069
we were sick.

171
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,839
We were both sick, that's why.

172
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,849
It's best to keep a distance.
Do not cross the line.

173
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:29,809
Don't, okay?

174
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:33,950
Don't cross over.

175
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,089
Goodnight.

176
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:05,119
Sleep tight.

177
00:19:25,869 --> 00:19:28,309
I'm so curious. I'm so curious.

178
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,880
She must have such a cute face on
as she snores like that.

179
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,950
No, I'm not saying this
because I'm curious.

180
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,609
I'm just worried she might
have difficulty breathing...

181
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,450
from sleep apnea while snoring.

182
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:43,220
Is my pillow too high for her?

183
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,019
Wait, hold on.

184
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,720
Is she drooling on my pillow?

185
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:51,059
Right. That's what I need to check.

186
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:07,039
She's so heavy.

187
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,450
What are you doing?

188
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,480
It's a misunderstanding.

189
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,650
You misunderstood, I just...
Pillow. Just the pillow.

190
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,039
You should be thankful
I'm going easy on you.

191
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,880
If you cross over the line again,

192
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:23,849
you're going to get it.
I'll attack you.

193
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:33,789
I'll let you off for today.

194
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,730
Goodnight.

195
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,160
(New York Barbershop)

196
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:36,049
What are you doing?

197
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,859
What do you think you're doing?

198
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,089
Go. Just leave.

199
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,029
I don't need it. I don't need it.

200
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,799
I don't need it. Go. Go.

201
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:01,569
- It's Sun Bong.
- Sun Bong?

202
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,309
Why today?

203
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:07,109
Let's just go out there proudly.

204
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,549
I'll just say I came in here
to talk about work.

205
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:10,609
Wait.

206
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:14,349
Anyone can tell you just woke up
and those are my clothes.

207
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:17,250
Sun Bong is a keen guy,
don't you know?

208
00:25:19,589 --> 00:25:20,960
What should we do then?

209
00:25:34,769 --> 00:25:36,069
You're early.

210
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,880
I decided to become an early bird.

211
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,109
Reading early in the morning
is so rewarding.

212
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,579
I see.

213
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,180
Then...

214
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,750
what about some tea?

215
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:48,119
I have one.

216
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:51,490
- But I don't have one.
- Pardon?

217
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,490
I said, I don't have tea.

218
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,859
I see. Okay.

219
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,740
He never asked me
to make tea before.

220
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:07,700
Whatever happened to
being a lateral organization?

221
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:14,279
I love you. I love you.

222
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:18,079
- I love you.
- You love me? You're a joker.

223
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,579
Why are you hugging me
all of a sudden?

224
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:21,819
- Get out.
- Right.

225
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:25,119
Didn't you hear something?

226
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:27,190
I said I love you!

227
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:38,599
Why are you doing this to me?

228
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,910
Good morning.

229
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,720
Hello.

230
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:56,119
Sun Bong, why are you on the floor?

231
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:59,960
I'm never coming early again.

232
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,160
Change of plan. Keep hiding there.

233
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:10,130
I'll go buy some clothes for you.

234
00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:12,200
Until when?

235
00:27:58,349 --> 00:27:59,480
Hwan Gi?

236
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,420
Yi Soo.

237
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,789
Why are you here?

238
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,559
This place only has women's clothes.

239
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:14,559
Who should be asking that question?

240
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,069
Who are these for?

241
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:17,799
They're for me. I mean...

242
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,170
Wait. Are you seeing someone?

243
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,170
- Now way.
- Of course you deny it.

244
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,380
- You're full of secrets.
- It's not like that.

245
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:26,940
Do you want me to help?

246
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,809
Well, sure.

247
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:30,980
What is she like?

248
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,250
Is she sexy?

249
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:37,119
- Feminine?
- Feminine, my foot.

250
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,420
Cute?

251
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,960
- So she's cute.
- Yes.

252
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:45,630
I mean, no.

253
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:53,500
I'd love to see this girl
who managed to get into your heart.

254
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,769
Bring her to my wedding.

255
00:28:58,109 --> 00:29:01,109
It'll be just
a small family wedding.

256
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,710
I'm actually here to
look for wedding gifts.

257
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,619
I think we should just
exchange rings.

258
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,750
- Yi Soo.
- I don't need anything else.

259
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,259
You're in love with someone now.

260
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:14,190
You must understand...

261
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:16,859
how I feel.

262
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,640
Why is he taking so long?

263
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:30,210
Should I just go out?

264
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:34,140
Right. I'll just act natural.

265
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:41,250
Boss. Why did it take so long?

266
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,119
It was hard to choose. Go change.

267
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,720
Why did you buy so many?

268
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,460
I didn't know what you'd like.

269
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:51,960
I just need to talk to you
for a minute.

270
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,970
Hide over there.

271
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:11,380
Gyo Ri, did I hurt you
by any chance?

272
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:13,079
Sorry?

273
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,990
I'm not sure
if this will make you feel better,

274
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:18,150
my mom is not an ordinary woman.

275
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,819
If anything goes wrong,
she might come to you with money,

276
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:25,500
pull out your hair and splash
steaming coffee on you or something.

277
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,269
What are you trying to say?

278
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:32,140
Do you think I like you
or something?

279
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:36,109
Sun Bong said something like that.

280
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:37,609
You don't?

281
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,339
No.

282
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,109
That's a relief.

283
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:45,819
I thought you liked me.
I felt so awkward around you.

284
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,680
It's a good thing
that I brought this up.

285
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:51,289
This is why you should
always be straightforward, right?

286
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,789
- Exactly.
- I'm so relieved.

287
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:13,880
He was so frustrated...

288
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,710
when Ro Woon ignored his feelings.

289
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:20,950
What about my feelings?

290
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:53,920
Gyo Ri.

291
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,690
- Yes?
- Well...

292
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:01,289
Would you like to take charge of
the jewelry brand project?

293
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,160
What? Me?

294
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,259
Yes.

295
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:07,430
With Se Jong.

296
00:32:08,869 --> 00:32:09,930
Me?

297
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:15,039
What exactly are the two of us
supposed to do?

298
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,440
Yoo Hee, Sun Bong,
please help them.

299
00:32:18,009 --> 00:32:20,109
- Okay.
- Okay.

300
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,319
What was that?

301
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:30,250
Are you playing Cupid?

302
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,589
I just thought the two of them
could achieve synergy.

303
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,269
This and... This one is pretty.

304
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:49,069
What do you think?

305
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:51,609
Was it Ms. Chae?

306
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,349
Hello. You must be here to see Boss.

307
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:06,059
He just went that way.

308
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:08,160
No. I'm here to see Woo Il.

309
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,589
I need to measure his finger
for our wedding rings.

310
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,970
If you have time,

311
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,470
can you come to our wedding?

312
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:23,710
If you're inviting me,
I'd love to be there.

313
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,250
All you have done is slack off.

314
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,420
Come up with some ideas.

315
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:40,759
Ideas don't come from
analyzing data.

316
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,730
Creativity comes from insight.

317
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:45,400
It's supposed to pop out
all of a sudden.

318
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:50,069
When will it finally pop out?

319
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:55,539
Stuck in the office,
my brain is working so slowly.

320
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,480
Hey, wait.

321
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,579
Why did Boss,

322
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:10,849
I mean, Hwan Gi, do this to me?

323
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:22,000
- Why aren't you coming out?
- Do you want me to come?

324
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:24,300
Let's go out and meet some people.

325
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,000
We need inspirations.

326
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,070
Let's go.

327
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,670
- This is no time for that.
- It's okay. Let's go.

328
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,440
Come on.

329
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,349
- Do you see anything?
- I'm not sure.

330
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,920
What would be a good idea?

331
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,719
That necklace is very bold.

332
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,190
It reminds me of shackles.

333
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,730
She carefully chose
a combination of black and gold.

334
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,789
Her neck must hurt.

335
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:53,159
Those sleeves have
interesting details.

336
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,960
- They were heart-shaped.
- Exactly.

337
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:57,099
She's wearing
an antique-style necklace.

338
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,769
It looks like my grandma's.

339
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,840
Se Jong, you don't know
anything about this.

340
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:05,070
Young artists' works might
inspire us.

341
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,309
Let's see. What do you think?

342
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,539
I look like a priest, right?

343
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:11,349
Yes. It looks good on you.

344
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,079
I look good, don't I?

345
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,250
- What about this?
- This?

346
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:18,420
Like this.

347
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:20,360
This, too.

348
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:22,659
It's perfect, isn't it?

349
00:35:23,429 --> 00:35:25,800
I used to come here very often.

350
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,000
There are often concerts here.

351
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:32,769
Here, many young actors perform.

352
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,440
That's the cafe I used to
visit a lot.

353
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:40,309
By the way, don't you think
we're slacking off too much?

354
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:42,079
I think we should work.

355
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:45,050
It's okay. We're here to
feel the energy of youth.

356
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:48,820
The energy will lead to
creative ideas.

357
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:54,289
- Gyo Ri, follow me for a minute.
- Sorry?

358
00:35:54,389 --> 00:35:56,289
- Just a minute.
- Where are we going?

359
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,400
What are you doing now?

360
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:07,300
Se Jong.

361
00:36:08,369 --> 00:36:10,170
You should be working.

362
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,840
I'm working right now.

363
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:13,510
We should feel the energy of youth.

364
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:14,909
Here we go.

365
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,449
Gyo Ri. Give me that phone.

366
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:28,489
Se Jong, you really don't look like
a chairman's grandson.

367
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,690
Do you mean I look poor?

368
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,929
- That's not what I mean.
- To tell you the truth,

369
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,329
I get that a lot.

370
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:39,199
By the way, it's true.

371
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,739
What? You're mean.

372
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,670
- You pay for the food.
- What?

373
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:47,309
This doesn't even cost that much.

374
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,679
I finally have an idea.

375
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:56,489
Collaboration with an artist.

376
00:36:58,989 --> 00:37:00,090
Gosh.

377
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,730
You mentioned intuitions
and getting inspirations.

378
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,929
This is what you came up with?
A collaboration?

379
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,699
Hear me out.

380
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,630
A jewelry brand with history
and traditions...

381
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:12,000
along with the taste of a young
and rising artist...

382
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,199
will result in an innovative design.

383
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,469
We'll make them limited editions
to make it more valuable.

384
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:21,840
I'm not sure. It won't be easy
working with artists.

385
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:25,849
Boss.
I mean, Hwan Gi, what do you think?

386
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,050
What about you, Gyo Ri?

387
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,190
Pardon? Me?

388
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:39,030
I think Se Jong's idea is great.

389
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:41,199
I'll support him.

390
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,469
Come up with a proposal.

391
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:49,309
I got it. Gyo Ri.

392
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:53,280
Great.

393
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:57,280
- It's going to be hard work.
- Exactly.

394
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:08,320
(New York Barbershop)

395
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:23,610
You seem fine.

396
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,860
My flowers.

397
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,110
My pictures.

398
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,280
Mom and Ji Hye's pictures...

399
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:23,500
Where are Mom and Ji Hye's pictures?

400
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:25,530
Don't look for them.

401
00:39:26,269 --> 00:39:28,840
You should forget about everything.

402
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:36,280
I lived the way you wanted
until now.

403
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:40,420
I was dead quiet
whenever I came home.

404
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:45,250
I can't do it anymore.

405
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:48,860
I have to be by his side.

406
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,369
He's going to come soon.

407
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,409
There will be a moment of truth.

408
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:05,409
Chae Ro Woon.

409
00:40:05,909 --> 00:40:08,110
You should know
since you've seen him.

410
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:10,150
He's not a bad person.

411
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,829
I'm going for a smoke.

412
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:59,030
Is she here again?

413
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,059
Here.

414
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:11,670
Have you calmed down?

415
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:18,510
Then...

416
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,480
you should go back home.

417
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:30,590
Crying won't help. You have to go.

418
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,519
You're so evil.

419
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,960
Hwan Gi.

420
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,599
Ro Woon, you're here too?

421
00:42:45,769 --> 00:42:46,969
I thought you were alone.

422
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:52,780
Is this why you were trying
to send me home?

423
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,980
Yun Jung.

424
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,780
You didn't tell me you were coming.

425
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:02,519
I had no idea you were with
another woman,

426
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:05,250
let alone making her cry.

427
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:08,190
What's going on anyway?

428
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,590
Are you being dumped?

429
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,400
If so, I'll step out for a minute.

430
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,769
I didn't make her cry. No.

431
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:21,570
I see. You're not being dumped.

432
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,710
Should the three of us drink, then?

433
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,010
- Three?
- No?

434
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,079
Ro Woon has to go. It's late.

435
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:33,480
Is that so? I'd appreciate that.

436
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:37,289
It's still early. Let's have wine
together.

437
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,719
- Fine. Shall we go over there?
- Sure.

438
00:43:46,429 --> 00:43:47,429
Goodness.

439
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:53,369
We'll have one quick drink
and go on our ways.

440
00:43:53,769 --> 00:43:55,599
Okay? All right?

441
00:44:11,019 --> 00:44:13,920
Hwan Gi sat beside me, Ro Woon.

442
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:16,989
What are you saying?

443
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:22,300
Let's drink wine.

444
00:44:29,269 --> 00:44:30,340
I'll do it.

445
00:44:30,769 --> 00:44:33,039
I'll do it, give it to me. Come on.

446
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,750
Isn't he so sweet?

447
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,320
He's thoughtful and polite.
On top of that, he's handsome.

448
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:46,059
He's quite athletic too.

449
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,460
Don't make me feel uncomfortable.

450
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:51,730
He doesn't talk much,

451
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,960
but I find that sexy.

452
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:59,030
Sexy? Hey, stop it.

453
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,869
She and I are going to fight
over you.

454
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:06,409
It's been officially announced.

455
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,579
Stop joking around.

456
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:10,579
I mean it.

457
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,780
Ro Woon. Don't you admit
that the two of us...

458
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,889
look better together?

459
00:45:17,019 --> 00:45:19,820
- Gosh.
- Seriously.

460
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:24,090
Only if I was a little bit taller,
I wouldn't be inferior.

461
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:32,369
His first love.

462
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:34,170
Is that you?

463
00:45:37,309 --> 00:45:38,539
You are.

464
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:41,679
So you're the one that made him
hide behind his black hoodie.

465
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,449
I see.

466
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:46,380
- Are you talking about university?
- Don't talk about it.

467
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:50,119
What is it?

468
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:54,289
What is it that I don't know?
I'm so curious.

469
00:45:54,889 --> 00:45:58,590
Then you should tell me
something I don't know about.

470
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,059
How far did you two go?

471
00:46:01,099 --> 00:46:03,630
Stop that. Really.

472
00:46:03,769 --> 00:46:04,769
Gosh.

473
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:06,670
I'm just surprised, that's all.

474
00:46:07,369 --> 00:46:09,539
By the way, when did you...

475
00:46:09,869 --> 00:46:12,940
start preferring little kids?

476
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,480
It's...

477
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:19,820
Kids?

478
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:26,190
What? A little kid?

479
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:29,630
I wasn't going to say this,

480
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:34,400
but we even slept together
for two days in a row.

481
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,199
- You probably just slept.
- Yes.

482
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,469
Are you serious?

483
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:44,769
So it's true.

484
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:48,840
How can a man and a woman
just sleep and not do anything?

485
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:50,480
For two days straight?

486
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:55,050
This is a serious problem.

487
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:02,389
Tonight, we won't just sleep.

488
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:05,530
I won't let him sleep.
I definitely won't.

489
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,860
All right. You tell us, Hwan Gi.

490
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,199
Whom will you kiss if you're
asked to kiss one of us now?

491
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,639
I can't believe you.

492
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,739
Gosh, seriously.

493
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,110
- Yes. Tell us, Boss.
- Tell us.

494
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:20,210
What is the matter
with the two of you today?

495
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:22,840
- Tell us.
- Tell you what?

496
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,710
Tell us, please.

497
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,260
A kiss?

498
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:44,230
- Why did he drink so much?
- I drank too much.

499
00:47:44,269 --> 00:47:45,429
- Yun Jung.
- Hey.

500
00:47:45,469 --> 00:47:47,440
- Ro Woon.
- Yes?

501
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,639
- You two should kiss each other.
- Ro Woon, are you all right?

502
00:47:50,739 --> 00:47:54,010
Come on. Gosh, Yun Jung...

503
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:58,949
Gosh, Yun Jung... That time...

504
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:02,650
- Ro Woon.
- I feel like I'm having a deja vu.

505
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,820
- Ro Woon, Ro Woon.
- Ro Woon?

506
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:07,190
Why did you say
you didn't want to go?

507
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,130
I'm over here.

508
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,099
- What? What now?
- That day... Water...

509
00:48:18,099 --> 00:48:20,739
- Then this... My gosh.
- Gosh, you're making me blush.

510
00:48:20,769 --> 00:48:22,900
What's going on? What's he saying?

511
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,639
- It's a secret.
- It's just our secret.

512
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:27,079
I can't tell you.

513
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:30,309
Anyway, you two should do it.
Kiss each other. Come on.

514
00:48:30,409 --> 00:48:31,679
- What's this guy saying?
- Goodness.

515
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:33,349
Let me do a little inspection
before you kiss.

516
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:36,949
Both of you, show me your teeth.
Come on.

517
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:38,849
- Don't do that.
- Show me your teeth.

518
00:48:38,889 --> 00:48:40,619
- Cut me some slack.
- What's this about?

519
00:48:40,659 --> 00:48:43,760
- Yun Jung, let me see your teeth.
- I check my teeth often now.

520
00:48:43,789 --> 00:48:45,730
- Show me your teeth.
- Stop it already.

521
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,969
You can have him.
I don't think I want him.

522
00:48:55,969 --> 00:48:58,340
Then shall we go finish our drinks?

523
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,840
Sounds good.

524
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,989
Yun Jung, how much do you know?

525
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:15,559
I don't know everything either.

526
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,360
I just know a bit about you.

527
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,030
When will I find out everything?

528
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:25,599
Just trust Hwan Gi
and give him some more time.

529
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,099
Don't be so impatient.

530
00:49:29,739 --> 00:49:31,309
I'm a little scared too.

531
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,380
What if I find out...

532
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:37,750
that the truth is more
than what I can handle?

533
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:39,920
What should I do...

534
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:46,489
if I can't forgive him?

535
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,960
I'm sure Hwan Gi isn't
keeping it to himself...

536
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:56,469
because of his selfish greed
or desire.

537
00:49:57,699 --> 00:49:59,300
That's the Hwan Gi I know.

538
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:05,170
Don't worry too much.

539
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,440
I'll stay by his side
if you can't forgive him.

540
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,909
Gosh, I really can't let
my guard down.

541
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:20,190
By the way,

542
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:23,630
when are you leaving?

543
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:25,190
When you leave.

544
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:27,460
I'm going to stay here forever.

545
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,559
Then I'll stay too.

546
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:30,369
Gosh, seriously.

547
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,469
He's cute when he's asleep,
isn't he?

548
00:50:39,809 --> 00:50:40,909
He is cute.

549
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:16,710
Oh, you're up.

550
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:30,960
Do I still look like a little
kid to you?

551
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:49,280
Where's Yun Jung?

552
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:55,349
What a mess.

553
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:03,090
My hair.

554
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:06,260
I'm sorry.

555
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:08,599
Oh, right.

556
00:52:10,099 --> 00:52:13,340
Shall we go check this out?

557
00:52:17,909 --> 00:52:20,710
It's the exhibition
Yun Jung curated.

558
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:22,179
Yes.

559
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:24,150
She gave me these,

560
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:27,750
saying that we should have dates
in front of her.

561
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,619
Right, my sister's drawing.

562
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,219
Do you have it?

563
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:38,329
Pardon? A drawing?
What kind of drawing?

564
00:52:38,659 --> 00:52:41,199
Who has it if Boss doesn't?

565
00:52:41,329 --> 00:52:42,460
Never mind.

566
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:45,269
- Then we're going here.
- Okay.

567
00:52:54,909 --> 00:52:55,980
What's the matter?

568
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:06,820
It's the main piece
of this exhibition.

569
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,590
- Take your time and browse around.
- Thank you.

570
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,429
You came.

571
00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:18,599
Hey. Yes.

572
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:22,900
I'm right here.

573
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:28,610
Oh, I'm looking for Ro Woon.
I'm supposed to meet her here.

574
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:30,780
How can you be so obvious
about looking for another girl?

575
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:33,150
Please be respectful
to your first love, will you?

576
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:35,949
You wanted us to come together.

577
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:39,150
It looks like someone else
tagged along.

578
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,530
You're here too.

579
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:54,400
Yes, I'm meeting someone here.

580
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,239
- What brings you here?
- I'm meeting Yi Soo here.

581
00:53:58,309 --> 00:53:59,440
Yi Soo is coming too?

582
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,739
What's this awkward tension about?

583
00:54:02,809 --> 00:54:05,110
As far as I can remember,
you two used to be best friends.

584
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:08,679
About the orchestra we had in mind
for the mini concert...

585
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:11,789
It won't work out due to an internal
conflict among their members.

586
00:54:12,019 --> 00:54:13,360
I wasn't aware of that issue.

587
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:15,690
It's my team's project...

588
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,530
which you dumped on us.

589
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:20,860
Right. Yes.

590
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:24,969
I'm sure Woo Il
will sort it all out.

591
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,599
Don't worry too much.
We'll go with a different orchestra.

592
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:31,710
By the way, this is too boring.

593
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:35,380
I'd like it to look like
a handwritten letter to the viewers.

594
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:36,980
This is a little...

595
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:43,079
Can Yun Jung and I talk about work?

596
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:44,489
Oh, right. By all means.

597
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:56,730
Thanks.

598
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:00,539
When I heard that you two now run
the company together as co-CEOs,

599
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:02,670
I thought that you'd be
make a great team together.

600
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,110
We did.

601
00:55:05,409 --> 00:55:06,539
But not now?

602
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:10,679
Now, Hwan Gi can do a great job
on his own without my help.

603
00:55:11,179 --> 00:55:13,380
He's very smart,

604
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:15,920
and he's also
such a wonderful person.

605
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,590
I've known it all along, but I also
wanted other people to know it.

606
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:22,090
But now that it's actually happened,

607
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:25,489
thinking that he doesn't need me
anymore makes me anxious.

608
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:30,369
- I must sound like a total loser.
- Yes, a little.

609
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:34,969
I know that you've always wanted
to prove yourself to the world.

610
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,869
You try too hard
to become someone who is needed.

611
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:42,840
"Hwan Gi absolutely needs me."

612
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:47,619
I must've been full of vain conceit.

613
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:54,659
- It was you.
- What do you mean?

614
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:57,429
Christmas Eve three years ago.

615
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:01,460
You were the one Hwan Gi has been
trying to protect since then.

616
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:06,900
Your face just confirmed that.

617
00:56:08,469 --> 00:56:11,440
To be honest, I knew it was you
the moment I heard about it.

618
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:15,039
Who else would mean so much
to Hwan Gi?

619
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:20,980
Like you said,

620
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,550
Hwan Gi doesn't need you.

621
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:28,659
Still, he protected you.

622
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:31,860
He wasn't with you
because he needed you.

623
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,860
He didn't try to abandon you
because he didn't need you anymore.

624
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:38,929
Deep down, you know that, don't you?

625
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:53,920
Are you really going to
reveal everything?

626
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:56,949
How could you even tell Yun Jung?

627
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:00,090
Father told me to be extra careful.

628
00:57:00,659 --> 00:57:02,460
Father treats you like a tool.

629
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,360
And you've been suffering from it.

630
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:06,800
Yes, I have.

631
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:09,699
That's why I once wanted to
give up everything. But...

632
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,500
you made me stay with Yi Soo.

633
00:57:17,869 --> 00:57:19,369
It's hard for me too.

634
00:57:20,539 --> 00:57:21,840
But...

635
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:25,210
I can't give up everything
I've achieved like this.

636
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:29,119
It might be the end of everything.

637
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:31,590
I might...

638
00:57:32,619 --> 00:57:36,159
not work here or see you again.
I really can't...

639
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:38,059
Revealing it doesn't have to be
the end of everything.

640
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:40,199
I'll stay with Yi Soo.

641
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:43,260
I'll marry her as you wanted.

642
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:45,329
- Isn't that enough?
- Woo Il.

643
00:57:45,469 --> 00:57:48,300
- If Yi Soo finds out, she'll...
- She already knows.

644
00:57:50,269 --> 00:57:51,269
What?

645
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,940
I'm not telling only you...

646
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:59,980
to reveal the truth
and give up everything.

647
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:01,119
I might...

648
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:05,949
lose something precious as well.
I'm as scared as you are.

649
00:58:07,059 --> 00:58:08,289
I mean...

650
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,590
What does that mean?

651
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:12,690
Yi Soo...

652
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,800
- Yi Soo...
- Hwan Gi.

653
00:58:24,739 --> 00:58:25,840
What are you guys...

654
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:28,739
talking about?

655
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,380
You look so serious.

656
00:58:31,909 --> 00:58:32,909
Yi Soo.

657
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,420
Are you okay?

658
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:44,329
My body suddenly feels so heavy.

659
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,329
I'm sorry.

660
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,829
Let's put off our date.

661
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,400
- Hwan Gi, help me.
- Okay.

662
00:59:52,829 --> 00:59:54,929
You want me to die, don't you?

663
00:59:56,199 --> 00:59:57,230
Yi Soo.

664
00:59:58,630 --> 00:59:59,800
I asked you a favor.

665
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,710
I said Woo Il is all I need.

666
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:06,610
Without him, I'll really die.

667
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,739
You know I'm not just saying this.

668
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:09,809
Then...

669
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:13,480
Woo Il will always feel guilty.

670
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,380
And you'll keep pretending
you have no idea.

671
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:18,789
Is that really the life
you want to live?

672
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:24,929
In any case, a dead person
can't come back alive.

673
01:00:25,829 --> 01:00:27,360
It's been three years already.

674
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,400
Why can't you just let it go?

675
01:00:30,429 --> 01:00:31,829
It's not over yet.

676
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:34,400
There are people
who are still suffering from it.

677
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,139
They suffer much more than we do.

678
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:37,869
Ms. Chae's...

679
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:41,840
family.

680
01:00:47,179 --> 01:00:48,820
They're just strangers.

681
01:00:51,389 --> 01:00:53,889
- Just ignore them.
- I can't.

682
01:00:55,019 --> 01:00:56,119
Anymore.

683
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:11,570
Boss, you're here.

684
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:14,610
Your sister is here too.

685
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,340
Hello.

686
01:01:38,869 --> 01:01:40,329
I didn't know...

687
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:42,500
he was getting married.

688
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:44,940
What did you do?

689
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:48,840
What did you do...

690
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:51,909
to win Woo Il's heart?

691
01:01:55,579 --> 01:01:56,750
I didn't...

692
01:01:57,690 --> 01:02:00,289
- mean to do this.
- I'm not blaming you.

693
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:03,860
I just want to know.

694
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:08,300
It was so hard for me.

695
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:13,170
I'm sorry.

696
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:20,639
I can't understand what I did.

697
01:02:21,539 --> 01:02:22,980
I wish I could...

698
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,150
undo what I did last night.

699
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:30,380
Did he...

700
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:33,719
give you a necklace by any chance?

701
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,360
Sorry?

702
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:42,360
He did, didn't he?

703
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,300
I was going to...

704
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:49,699
return it.

705
01:02:55,679 --> 01:02:58,710
Two women wearing the same necklace.

706
01:03:02,849 --> 01:03:04,820
I've seen something like this
somewhere.

707
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:09,489
Did it just happen to me?

708
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,190
I picked out that necklace.

709
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:18,300
Not for me, but for Woo Il.

710
01:03:20,099 --> 01:03:21,500
And Woo Il...

711
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:26,210
gave it to you.

712
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:39,750
He made a mistake.

713
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,230
As he said,
it wasn't supposed to mean anything.

714
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:47,530
No.

715
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:50,969
It wasn't a mistake.

716
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:15,659
What are you doing right now?

717
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,630
I've always thought,

718
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:23,300
without him, I can't exist.

719
01:04:24,829 --> 01:04:26,530
Don't do this.

720
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:29,170
- It was just a mistake.
- Woo Il...

721
01:04:33,269 --> 01:04:35,309
wouldn't make such a mistake.

722
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:41,480
It means...

723
01:04:43,949 --> 01:04:44,920
It means...

724
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,389
It means...

725
01:04:57,630 --> 01:04:58,769
Stay away!

726
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:16,880
I'm going to hate you.

727
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:19,550
I can't hate Woo Il.

728
01:05:20,019 --> 01:05:23,219
Whatever he did,
I can never give up on him!

729
01:05:25,929 --> 01:05:27,800
If you're really sorry,

730
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:31,400
don't pretend to be so innocent
and just disappear.

731
01:05:33,369 --> 01:05:34,369
Please.

732
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:39,210
Disappear.

733
01:06:44,539 --> 01:06:46,010
- Honey.
- Mom.

734
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:48,139
Mom.

735
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:50,110
- Gosh.
- Mom.

736
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:51,909
Say hello. These are my colleagues.

737
01:06:51,949 --> 01:06:53,510
- Hello.
- Hello.

738
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:56,480
- Mister.
- Have you been well?

739
01:06:56,519 --> 01:06:59,449
Hello. I heard a lot about you
from my sons.

740
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:00,650
I see.

741
01:07:01,619 --> 01:07:04,289
They want you to be their dad.

742
01:07:04,329 --> 01:07:05,929
Dad? What do you...

743
01:07:12,869 --> 01:07:14,840
- Here. Good job.
- Go like this.

744
01:07:14,869 --> 01:07:17,269
This is so nice.

745
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,670
Should I just quit my job?

746
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:22,340
Why? You look so sexy when you work.

747
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:24,039
Really?

748
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:27,480
I actually bought a new car.

749
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:32,019
(My Shy Boss)
