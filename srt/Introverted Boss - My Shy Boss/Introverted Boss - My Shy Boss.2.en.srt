(Flower Boss,
Flower Delivery Service)

2
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,549
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,890
I apologize.

4
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,320
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:57,000
(Episode 2: I'm Sorry, I Apologize)

6
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,729
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,870
- I'm sorry!
- What are you so sorry for?

8
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,879
(Episode 2: I'm Sorry, I Apologize)

9
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,260
(Episode 2: I'm Sorry,
I Cannot Apologize)

10
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,489
I should have mustered up
my courage earlier.

11
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,569
I hesitated for too long
and lost my chance.

12
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:36,069
Where is she now?

13
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,269
Why did she quit all of a sudden?

14
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,159
- My goodness.
- What about Mr. Smith?

15
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:03,500
You reek of alcohol.

16
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,930
Why are you here?
Did you get fired already?

17
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,900
I did see this coming.

18
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,240
Did Mr. Smith come here or not?

19
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:13,610
He just left. Didn't you see him?

20
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:19,180
Ro Woon!

21
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:31,590
Are you Mr. Smith?

22
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,530
I'm Chae Ro Woon.

23
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,699
These flowers are for me, right?

24
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,759
Yes. Well, it's...

25
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,770
I'm... I'm your...

26
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,539
Where is Mr. Smith?

27
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:47,770
- Who?
- Mr. Smith.

28
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,610
The person who sent me
this bouquet.

29
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,310
- Who is it?
- Well, the thing is...

30
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,080
Actually, I...

31
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,689
I know you can't tell me
even if I ask. I know that.

32
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:05,189
However, I must find out today.

33
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:09,659
What kind of person is he? Tell me.

34
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,930
Who is he?

35
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,300
Move the bouquet.

36
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,270
What is he like?

37
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,969
I said, what is he like?

38
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,270
Won't you tell me?

39
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,409
You can't go until you tell me.

40
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,210
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,789
Stop!

42
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:09,919
I want to meet him!

43
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:26,069
It's because today's the last day.

44
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,209
I want to meet him
since today's the final show.

45
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,410
Please take me to Mr. Smith. Please?

46
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,750
Please?

47
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:55,529
If you can't take me to him,

48
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,769
at least give him this message.

49
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:03,939
Tell him that I thank him
so much for everything.

50
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:10,110
Thanks to Mr. Smith,
I was able to go through hard times.

51
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,649
Got it?

52
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,160
Please forward my message.

53
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,899
I'll get going then.

54
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,720
Can I ask you one thing?

55
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:49,649
How did you know I didn't leave?

56
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:53,689
Go ahead.

57
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:59,399
Why are you suddenly
leaving the stage?

58
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,399
That's a secret...

59
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,069
even for Mr. Smith.

60
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,810
Why do you keep calling him
Mr. Smith?

61
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:18,579
My goodness.

62
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,050
- We weren't eavesdropping.
- Let's go.

63
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,709
That's the alias
Daddy-long-legs used.

64
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,139
John Smith.

65
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,519
My older sister...

66
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:55,550
committed suicide three years ago.

67
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:06,259
My sister used to always send me...

68
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,899
bouquets whenever I performed.

69
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:12,040
Although...

70
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,839
she was no longer in this world,

71
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,040
I kept getting flowers.

72
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,480
I felt like she was still alive.

73
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,519
Mr. Smith...

74
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,920
must be my sister's friend...

75
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,699
or her past lover.

76
00:07:54,009 --> 00:07:55,980
Or perhaps...

77
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,620
Are you still there?

78
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,600
Do you really want to know
who he is?

79
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,500
Don't tell me.

80
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,839
Actually, I want to know,

81
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,339
but I also don't.

82
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,209
I want to remain curious
and let it make my heart flutter.

83
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:32,750
I can imagine all I want.

84
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,720
Even if my sister isn't around,
I'll act like she is.

85
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,000
I never told this anyone.

86
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:51,840
How did I end up telling it
in a smelly washroom?

87
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,909
And the men's washroom at that.

88
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,879
On top of that,
I told someone that's super quiet.

89
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,210
"Are you all right?"

90
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,279
"It must have been tough."

91
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,049
You don't even know how to
console someone like that.

92
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:21,029
My sister was just like you.

93
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:25,169
She had her mouth shut like a clam.

94
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:27,340
Sir,

95
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:31,809
is there something
you want to say to me?

96
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,279
She should have said so
if she was suffering.

97
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:40,350
She was hurting so much,

98
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:43,850
yet I didn't hear a peep from her.

99
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,860
In the last three years,

100
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,700
that was the hardest part of all.

101
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,299
Not knowing...

102
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,639
why my sister died.

103
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,279
I was right beside her.

104
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,049
We even shared a room.

105
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:27,330
Why didn't she tell me?

106
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:35,210
I wish she had just said...

107
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:37,440
something.

108
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,730
I must tell her...

109
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,169
so that the tragedy
doesn't repeat itself.

110
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,649
- Put pressure on it.
- Okay.

111
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,950
All done.

112
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:58,759
Thank you.

113
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:08,129
Excuse me,
where is patient Kim Gyo Ri?

114
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:09,299
Over here.

115
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,200
Mr. Eun?

116
00:12:12,669 --> 00:12:14,269
Am I hearing things now?

117
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,340
Ms. Kim.

118
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:21,850
It's me, Eun Hwan Gi.

119
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,120
Just listen as you are.

120
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:42,169
Actually,

121
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,799
I...

122
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,470
I have a small problem.

123
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:49,610
Well...

124
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,279
I have a disorder
that prevents me from interacting...

125
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,450
I mean,

126
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:00,850
I have extreme difficulty
interacting with people.

127
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:07,559
If people find out,
I might get in trouble.

128
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,990
Please keep it to yourself.

129
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,500
Well...

130
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,830
What I'm saying is...

131
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,100
I'm...

132
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,309
really sorry...

133
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:27,440
for giving you a hard time.

134
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,250
I'll give you paid leave,
so take a rest.

135
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:34,549
Make sure you get treated.

136
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:36,750
I'll of course pay the medical fees.

137
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,190
Also, if you'd like,

138
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:44,659
I'll introduce you
to a psychotherapist as well.

139
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,929
I can't guarantee
her competence, though.

140
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:51,269
She...

141
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,970
failed to fix me.

142
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:01,649
I'm...

143
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,850
so sorry...

144
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,419
for giving you a hard time.

145
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,269
- The bike has started.
- What are you talking about?

146
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:03,710
I got rid of my constipation.

147
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,340
What I mean is...

148
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,679
Mr. Eun.

149
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:11,620
Relax. Breathe.

150
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,490
There you go. Start talking again.

151
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,019
I finally...

152
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,360
I finally told her.

153
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:24,759
I told her.

154
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,460
Mr. Eun. Mr. Eun?

155
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,909
Nice shot!

156
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,049
The CEO of Brain is the most
searched name on the web right now.

157
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,590
What?

158
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,659
Really? Let me see.

159
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:55,889
- What is this?
- What is all that?

160
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,059
Let me see.

(Under the Veil Was a Cruel Boss)

162
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:08,169
- Good shot.
- Good shot.

163
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:10,669
He's great.

164
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,649
This article is about Mr. Eun's son.

165
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:16,610
- It is.
- My goodness.

166
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,679
- He abused his power?
- Are you talking about my son?

00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:34,700
That brat.

171
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,330
We can't reach him at the moment.

172
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,240
Please wait.

173
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,070
- Here.
- We're preparing a statement.

174
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,009
We cannot tell you anything yet.

175
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:47,580
My goodness.

176
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:49,879
Here. Gosh.

177
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,320
- Where's Mr. Kang?
- Yes? Hello?

178
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,190
- He's not picking up.
- He's been out of reach.

179
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,159
- Hello?
- Hello?

180
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,960
We're preparing a statement.

181
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,490
- That's not true.
- We'll reveal everything.

182
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,690
We're not really sure.

183
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:06,730
Where is he at a time like this?

184
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,509
- He must be here.
- Where is he?

185
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:18,140
Please say something.

186
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,380
I told you. The CEO is not here.

187
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,250
Please go back.

188
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,549
That's him.

189
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,089
Did you treat your
secretary cruelly?

190
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,690
- Did you not feed her?
- Is it true?

191
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,890
- How much of it is true?
- Please say something.

192
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,829
- Please say something.
- Is she hospitalized?

193
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:41,099
- Mr. Eun.
- Please say something.

194
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,470
Please explain.

195
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,880
Is she hospitalized?

196
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,519
Move.

197
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,470
Did Mr. Eun treat
his secretary cruelly?

198
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:25,380
She's hospitalized. Did he hit her?

199
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,609
Are there any other victims?

200
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,079
Did he really not feed her?

201
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:30,180
Has he visited her at the hospital?
Has he apologized?

202
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:31,849
Why did he treat her cruelly?

203
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,319
Did he abuse his power?

204
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,390
I'm the co-CEO, Kang Woo Il.

205
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:37,789
You've come all the way here,

206
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:40,259
but I'm afraid I can't
tell you anything for now.

207
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:43,130
We'll prepare an official statement
as soon as possible.

208
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:45,130
Please come back then.

209
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:47,130
- He's such a good speaker.
- My goodness.

210
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:50,299
- He's the best.
- He's amazing.

211
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,940
Please explain what happened.

212
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,269
Do you admit it?

213
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,970
Where is Mr. Eun now?

214
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,839
Did he hit her?

215
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,109
Did he treat her cruelly?

216
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,339
Is Mr. Eun's father aware of this?

217
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,950
What will happen to
Mr. Eun's father?

218
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,450
What's going to happen?
Please say something.

219
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,150
- Will he run for the election?
- Will he remain as a candidate?

220
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,119
- Please say something.
- Will he run for the election?

221
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,289
- Will it get in his way?
- Please say something.

222
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:15,630
Please tell us the truth.

223
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Brain never hides or
avoids anything.

224
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:27,740
We won't make
any superficial apology.

225
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,440
That's why we need time.

226
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,410
If we did anything wrong,
we'll admit it...

227
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:35,910
and come up with a plan to improve.

228
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,180
I beg you to give us some time.

229
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,559
So many of you came
despite the cold.

230
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,329
Wasn't it cold on the way here?

231
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,769
- It was really cold.
- We waited so long.

232
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,500
- I apologize.
- Look at him.

233
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,000
He's so handsome.

234
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,240
We'll look into what happened and
come up with an official statement.

235
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:02,339
Please wait.

236
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,359
Mr. Eun.

237
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,670
- Why is she here?
- Don't you recognize me?

238
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,799
We've met before.

239
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,440
Well technically,
I didn't see your face,

240
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,279
so I guess I can't say that
we've properly met.

241
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:45,680
Still, I saw a lot of you
apart from your face.

242
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,019
She followed me
all the way to my office.

243
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:51,759
Did it all start from there?

244
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,589
You're Mr. Eun Hwan Gi, aren't you?

245
00:20:56,859 --> 00:20:58,059
Let go of me.

246
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,430
Are you crazy?

247
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:05,599
Ms. Kim couldn't have done this
all by herself.

248
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,170
You seem perplexed.

249
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,670
Could she be involved in this?

250
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,849
Are you okay?

251
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,710
Wait.

252
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:20,680
I'm sorry, but could you
use another elevator?

253
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,289
Wait.

254
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,250
I'm sorry.

255
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,400
You should keep low.
I'll take care of...

256
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,000
- Do you know her?
- Who do you mean?

257
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,329
Do you mean Ms. Chae?

258
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:39,670
She works here.
She's our new employee.

259
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,069
A new employee?

260
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,410
Why? Did she say something to you?

261
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:46,980
No, it's nothing.

262
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,049
Did she quit musicals
all of a sudden...

263
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:53,619
to get a job at my company?

264
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:55,920
What is she trying...

265
00:21:57,089 --> 00:21:58,420
to do here?

266
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,230
What about the article?
Did you read it?

267
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,430
(Brain's Co-CEO
Ill-treated His Secretary)

268
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,630
(Is His Father a Congressman?)

269
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,509
(Brain's CEO, Mr. Eun Hwan Gi,
treated his secretary cruelly.)

270
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,509
I still can't get a hold of Ms. Kim.

271
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,049
She disappeared
after she got discharged.

272
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:28,650
The hospital staff told me that a
man came to see her before she left.

273
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,220
Ms. Kim.

274
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:34,730
It's me, Eun Hwan Gi.

275
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,599
It must be because of money. She
has to support her entire family.

276
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,230
She's not that kind of person.

277
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,769
You don't even know her well.

278
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,200
I know her better than you do.

279
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,240
It's okay.

280
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:56,710
I'll sort everything out so that
there's no problem, so don't worry.

281
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,589
I shouldn't have given her money
when she's so hungry for it.

282
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,089
Anyway,
she'll get in touch with us soon.

283
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,990
If she wants more money, that is.

284
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,430
Hey. See?

285
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,259
Kang Woo Il speaking.

286
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:16,829
Ms. Kim?

287
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:18,400
No, it's totally fine.

288
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,339
Thank you for calling.

289
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,309
Where are you now?
I'll pick you up.

290
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,940
Stay right there.
I'll be there shortly.

291
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:30,410
She's in front of our building now.

292
00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:31,779
- I'll go with you, then.
- No, Hwan Gi.

293
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,279
You don't need to get involved.

294
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,119
Reporters might swarm in again,
so you should lay low.

295
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:37,819
I'll be back soon.

296
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:43,589
What if Chae Ro Woon has something
to do with this incident?

297
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:47,559
It's only a matter of time before
Ms. Kim talks about Chae Ro Woon.

298
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,740
She's in danger.

299
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:34,880
Ji Hye.

300
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,549
I'll make him...

301
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,119
fall all the way down to the bottom.

302
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,589
I'll show you.

303
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,710
- Hello, Sir.
- Where is Hwan Gi?

304
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,039
Please calm down. Let me explain...

305
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:10,150
He must be shuddering in fear
in that penthouse of this.

306
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:12,920
You lead the way.

307
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:18,660
It's my fault. I should've
sorted out the situation sooner.

308
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,519
But the word didn't leak out
because of...

309
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,990
Where's that secretary?

310
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,900
I was just about
to try contacting her.

311
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,200
Go bring her right now!

312
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,099
That blabbing mouth of hers.

313
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:32,869
I'll cut it all up...

314
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,640
and thinly slice her tongue,

315
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,980
and store it in a jar with brine.

316
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:45,750
Gosh, what should I do?

317
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,859
The former CEO looks
like a scary man.

318
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:54,720
I bet he can fire me
without even blinking an eye.

319
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,160
I'm so dead.

320
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,190
Where did he go?

321
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,069
Please let me handle it.
You should just head home now, Sir.

322
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:45,309
"Eun Hwan Gi is apparently
Congressman Eun Bok Dong's son."

323
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,779
Reporters are excited
about their newly-found prey.

324
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:50,109
You should avoid
running into them at all costs.

325
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:53,849
Please don't worry.

326
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:56,849
I have a plan that can turn
this crisis into an opportunity.

327
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,690
That project you told me
about the other day?

328
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:02,460
Yes. The only challenge I'd have
is persuading Hwan Gi.

329
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,390
Let me handle him.

330
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,700
Sir... Sir.

331
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,240
Don't be surprised. Just listen.

332
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,279
It's not me. I didn't do it.
Please believe me.

333
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:23,650
Please lower your voice.

334
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:26,920
I swear I've never told any of my
family or friends about you.

335
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:29,819
I've let my guard down just once.
I told just one person.

336
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:32,319
I had no idea
that would explode like this.

337
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,259
Is it really her, then?

338
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,630
- Please forgive me, Sir.
- Lower your voice, please.

339
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,000
I'll tell you everything.

340
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:48,470
I'll tell you with whom
I chatted to.

341
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,140
Please let me live.

342
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,779
- It was...
- Shut it if you want to live.

343
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:01,420
Ms. Kim,
you didn't do anything wrong.

344
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:03,549
You didn't disclose
anything to anyone.

345
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,490
Pardon me?

346
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,789
You didn't say anything to anybody.
Do you understand?

347
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,430
That means... So you're saying...

348
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:16,069
No matter what anyone does to
persuade you, keep playing innocent.

349
00:28:17,369 --> 00:28:18,869
Only then, you can get out of this.

350
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:27,579
Sir.

351
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:30,680
So you're worried about me.

352
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,059
Ms. Kim.

353
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,829
What took you so long?

354
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,069
I was really worried about you.

355
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:57,440
I'm saying it because I feel so bad
that you have to go through this.

356
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,140
I wish you reached out to me sooner.

357
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,450
It would've been great
if you hadn't signed...

358
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:06,720
the confidentiality agreement
when you joined the company.

359
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,920
If you leave like this, you'll be
known as a whistle-blower...

360
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:12,089
and won't be able to get
another job.

361
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,490
I... I never said...

362
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,930
anything to anyone.

363
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,700
I already know everything.
You can be open with me.

364
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:29,140
That man who came to see you
at the hospital. Who is he?

365
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:33,480
It was Mr. Eun.

366
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,049
Mr. Eun visited me at the hospital.

367
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,319
- You mean Hwan Gi?
- Yes.

368
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,289
You find it hard to believe, right?
I was so surprised, too.

369
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:49,259
He even brought me flowers.
Why would I do such a thing to him?

370
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:51,230
I really didn't do it.

371
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:52,799
Please believe me.

372
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,700

If there's nothing else you'd like
me to take care of, I'll get...

Come in.

Excuse me, Sir.

Is there something
you want to say to me?

382

You seem to be in a bad mood today.

383

If you could tell me
what I did wrong, I'll...

384
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,079
I lost a cuff link.

385
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,920
Now I only have one.

- Right now.

You hardly wear dress shirts.

If you tell me
when you plan on wearing it...

390
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:20,799
I thought...

391
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,009
I said right now.

392
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:31,180
Yes. Right now.

Don't tell me
you were thinking of jumping.

- Hello.

- Are you well?
- Yes.

440
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,170
How are you?

441
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:34,679
Will he come?

442
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,579
- No way.
- Who?

443
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,650
The penthouse ghost.

444
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,090
The hidden monster
that's hiding behind a veil.

445
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,550
Of course he should be here.

446
00:39:44,989 --> 00:39:47,219
The person responsible
should apologize himself.

447
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,860
Otherwise, it's not sincere.

448
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,030
To be an heir of the owner...

449
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:53,599
allows you never to be sorry.

450
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,530
It's always the weak
that have to be sorry.

451
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,539
Thanks to the mess a higher-up made,

452
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,739
look at how many staff
have to pick up afterwards.

453
00:40:02,969 --> 00:40:06,110
These days, it's a trend
for the CEO to be apologetic...

454
00:40:06,309 --> 00:40:09,079
even when a small problem arises.

455
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,849
He's old-fashioned.

456
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,150
He doesn't know what trend is.

457
00:40:14,449 --> 00:40:15,449
No way.

458
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,789
He'll show up if he's human.

459
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,920
Hey.

460
00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:22,059
- He's not human.
- He's a zombie.

461
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,070
Regardless...
Regardless of my intention,

462
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,579
I ended up...

463
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,210
hurting someone.

464
00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:45,780
I admit it is something
I cannot deny...

465
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:11,610
I can do it. I have to.

466
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:13,739
I can do it.

467
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,119
Why did you come down here?

468
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:24,190
I'll apologize to everyone myself.

469
00:41:24,289 --> 00:41:25,320
What?

470
00:41:26,389 --> 00:41:27,519
Come with me.

471
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:41,599
I said I'll take care of it.

472
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,639
You can just hide behind me.

473
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:46,639
I know you cover for me a lot.
So this time, I'll do it myself.

474
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,710
In that condition?

475
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:51,480
What are you thinking?

476
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,389
I'll admit my fault honestly.

477
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,889
It might bring what happened
three years ago to light.

478
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:01,320
Will you be honest about that, too?

479
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:04,860
Is that what you're scared of?

480
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,539
Have you ever been
in my office before?

481
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:22,679
Compared to your penthouse,

482
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,409
it looks like a doghouse.

483
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:26,480
- Woo Il.
- But I don't care.

484
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,150
People tell me...

485
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,659
that I struggle to benefit from
my rich friend...

486
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:36,059
and that I shouldn't
work too hard...

487
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,329
because the money will
never be mine.

488
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:39,329
The money will go to the ghost CEO.

489
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,960
No matter what they say,

490
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:45,940
I've always tried to...

491
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,869
make things easier for you...

492
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:52,210
and cover up your weaknesses.

493
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,909
Just like you covered up my secret.

494
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:07,489
Don't worry.
What happened three years ago...

495
00:43:08,659 --> 00:43:09,789
will remain hidden.

496
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:13,659
So please let me talk to the people.

497
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,369
This is not like you.

498
00:43:18,269 --> 00:43:20,400
- Are you really Hwan Gi?
- I have to do it for it to end.

499
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,409
Nothing will end.
I'll make sure nothing ends.

500
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,539
Just trust me.

501
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:26,079
- This time, I...
- Can you...

502
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:28,579
really stand before
all those people?

503
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,550
Can you really express your opinions
correctly in front of everyone?

504
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:35,880
If you're confident that you won't
make a fool of yourself, do it.

505
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:47,760
Hey.

506
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:52,469
Hwan Gi, I'm sorry for being harsh.

507
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:55,739
I'm getting impatient
because the reporters are waiting.

508
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:00,340
I'll keep it short.

509
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:03,809
Will you step down from
your position for the time being?

510
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,780
It's just a formality, you know.

511
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:14,590
All right. I should. I was going to.

512
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,429
Instead,

513
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:18,730
take charge of a new project.

514
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,230
Your father will tell you
the details.

515
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,800
He's waiting for you.

516
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,469
You two decided on what I should do?

517
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:26,000
He must have calmed down by now.

518
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:27,940
I had a hard time calming him down.

519
00:44:30,469 --> 00:44:31,570
I have to go now.

520
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:47,460
Can you really stand before
all those people?

521
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,530
We're sorry for making you wait.

522
00:44:58,869 --> 00:45:02,940
We have someone here who can
clear up all the misunderstanding.

523
00:45:13,219 --> 00:45:14,280
Please sit there.

524
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:29,630
See?

525
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:39,940
I'm...

526
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,949
Mr. Eun Hwan Gi's secretary.

527
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:47,280
The article is...

528
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,849
completely false.

529
00:45:53,019 --> 00:45:54,159
What?

530
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:01,030
I was hospitalized...

531
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:04,070
because of my chronic disease.

532
00:46:04,869 --> 00:46:09,610
Mr. Eun even visited me
at the hospital with flowers...

533
00:46:10,469 --> 00:46:13,380
and cheered me up.

534
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:16,650
I'm very perplexed...

535
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:22,079
that false things about me
have been published against my will.

536
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:27,659
Mr. Eun and my colleagues,

537
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,829
I'm really sorry for the trouble
I caused the company.

538
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,960
- I have a question.
- I have a question.

539
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,230
You seem to be in a bad condition.
Did you come here voluntarily?

540
00:46:39,269 --> 00:46:41,070
As you just said,

541
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:43,769
was there no cruel treatment?

542
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:45,409
Have you met Mr. Eun?

543
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,179
Were you put under coercion?

544
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:53,019
Please explain.

545
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:55,820
Hold on.

546
00:47:00,289 --> 00:47:02,789
I'm the CEO of Brain, Kang Woo Il.

547
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:07,730
I'll answer your questions,
considering my employee's condition.

548
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,099
Where's Mr. Eun?

549
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,369
He couldn't adjust his plans abroad,

550
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:21,409
so he's still outside of Korea.

551
00:47:26,349 --> 00:47:27,420
That's all a lie.

552
00:47:47,469 --> 00:47:49,400
You're stuck in your room every day.

553
00:47:49,769 --> 00:47:52,139
Do you call yourself a man?

554
00:47:53,809 --> 00:47:54,880
Can't you do any better?

555
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:57,650
I thought you said you're quite good
when you play against a wall.

556
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:00,920
Golf and tennis.

557
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:05,219
Real sports let you
mingle with other people.

558
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:09,789
Why do you make a fool of yourself
whenever people look at you?

559
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:14,030
Why do you always get so timid
in front of people?

560
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:16,570
Gosh.

561
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,710
Why does Mr. Eun never
show up in front of people?

562
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,710
We just divided
our work efficiently.

563
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,679
Mr. Eun takes care of the internal
matters of the company,

564
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,650
and I undertake
all the external businesses.

565
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:41,590
Three years ago, Mr. Eun's secretary
jumped from the office rooftop.

566
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:44,360
- Is that...
- That's not related to this at all.

567
00:48:45,929 --> 00:48:50,869
There's a rumor that Mr. Eun
is impossible to communicate with.

568
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,769
That's exaggerated.

569
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:57,440
But I humbly admit that
there was not enough communication.

570
00:48:57,639 --> 00:49:01,280
To prevent
any further misunderstandings,

571
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:04,980
we've come up with
an improvement plan.

572
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,250
Mr. Eun...

573
00:49:13,389 --> 00:49:15,019
will be resigning...

574
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:17,329
from his position.

575
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,300
I can't believe this.

576
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,429
What?

577
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:40,619
You didn't win that position
because you deserved it.

578
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,719
We're starting a venture
in the company.

579
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:48,659
And you'll take charge of the team.

580
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,860
- Sorry?
- Break out of the egg.

581
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:53,900
Be reborn.

582
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:58,230
I can't.

583
00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:02,269
This is your last chance.

584
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:07,280
If you don't pull yourself together,
I'll give the company to Woo Il.

585
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:09,849
I'm not interested in
taking over the company.

586
00:50:09,949 --> 00:50:12,849
What? How dare you say that?

587
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,980
My goodness.

588
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,190
Gosh.

589
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:22,420
I'd rather start something alone.

590
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:24,230
Alone? What nonsense!

591
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:27,300
You can't do anything alone
from now on.

592
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:30,670
Come in.

593
00:50:37,139 --> 00:50:38,170
Stay seated.

594
00:50:43,949 --> 00:50:46,110
You should learn to mingle
with people.

595
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:56,889
An in-house venture doesn't have
the customary corporate structure.

596
00:50:57,489 --> 00:50:59,190
Neither does it have
rigid hierarchy...

597
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:02,199
nor unnecessary formalities that can
hinder the organization's growth.

598
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,900
In that new horizontal structure,
Mr. Eun Hwan Gi will become...

599
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,739
a leader with communicative
leadership who can have...

600
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,869
flourishing relationships
with our employees.

601
00:51:16,909 --> 00:51:20,650
In-house venture? What is going on?

602
00:51:22,019 --> 00:51:24,150
My gosh, that's so clever.

603
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:26,420
They'll avoid the blame...

604
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:29,059
and pretend that he's giving up his
CEO position when he's actually not.

605
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:30,289
My goodness.

606
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:31,889
I have a question.

607
00:51:33,059 --> 00:51:35,699
This decision will shock many people
considering that Mr. Eun...

608
00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:37,800
is the heir of the company.

609
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:40,199
Has the founder of the company,
Congressman Eun, agreed to it?

610
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,340
Of course.

611
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:44,670
Many second-generation conglomerates
have been involved in scandals.

612
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:46,010
Even though the article is false,

613
00:51:46,409 --> 00:51:49,579
he is deeply distressed because it
may have hurt some people.

614
00:51:50,179 --> 00:51:53,010
He asked us to fundamentally
revamp our corporate system.

615
00:51:55,219 --> 00:51:56,590
I promise that we will change.

616
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:58,949
I sincerely apologize...

617
00:51:59,389 --> 00:52:01,360
for causing you concern.

618
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,239
Mr. Kang never disappoints me.

619
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,940
He's so good at everything,

620
00:52:20,139 --> 00:52:22,179
but his crisis management skills
are truly outstanding.

621
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:25,880
From planning to execution, he gets
everything done like a thunderbolt.

622
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,280
I can't believe this.

623
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,219
What about Eun Hwan Gi?

624
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:32,619
He didn't even show up here.

625
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,079
Why did you do that?

626
00:53:01,019 --> 00:53:02,820
Look who's talking.
Why are you doing this to me?

627
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:06,090
Did Mr. Kang make you lie?

628
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,789
It's true that Mr. Eun
visited me at the hospital...

629
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,460
with flowers.

630
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,760
That psychopath didn't even step out
of his office when you were...

631
00:53:16,199 --> 00:53:18,070
almost dying
right in front of his door.

632
00:53:18,099 --> 00:53:20,869
The article came out
regardless of my intent.

633
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:24,340
Keep your lips sealed unless
you want both of us to be doomed.

634
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:26,610
We don't know each other.

635
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:28,909
We've never even seen
or talked to each other.

636
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:36,280
You got money from them, didn't you?

637
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:39,250
What do you...

638
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,019
How much did they give you?

639
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:43,360
It must've been quite a bit.

640
00:53:43,989 --> 00:53:45,860
That must be why you
gave up on your conscience...

641
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,460
Yes, I sold my conscience.

642
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:49,460
What was I supposed to do?

643
00:53:49,969 --> 00:53:51,829
Because of some
missionary of justice,

644
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:54,769
I lost my job. My conscience
was the only thing I could sell!

645
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:59,110
You can get another job.

646
00:53:59,409 --> 00:54:00,679
I mean,
this isn't the only company...

647
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:03,039
Who'd want to hire a whistle-blower?

648
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:07,719
Well...

649
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:10,719
I just wanted to help you.

650
00:54:11,889 --> 00:54:13,519
You couldn't even
raise your head up...

651
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,920
or look at him
when you were talking to him.

652
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,590
But in return
for putting up with all of that,

653
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:23,599
I was able to buy food for
my family and pay the utility bills.

654
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:26,099
I shouldn't have told you anything.

655
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:36,710
Ji Hye.

656
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:40,119
You must've been
this distressed, too.

657
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:43,489
You were in so much pain,

658
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:46,420
yet you couldn't even
let out a squeal.

659
00:55:21,659 --> 00:55:22,789
Lie face down.

660
00:55:34,139 --> 00:55:36,099
I said, face down.
Lie face down completely.

661
00:55:36,539 --> 00:55:37,710
Lie on your stomach.

662
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:51,019
The scrubbing towel
feels so rough on my skin.

663
00:55:51,789 --> 00:55:54,519
It looks like he pulled out a new
one for me, so I should be thankful.

664
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:57,230
There must be a reason
why it hurts so much.

665
00:55:57,659 --> 00:56:00,530
He's a specialist. He must know the
most ideal scrubbing intensity...

666
00:56:00,829 --> 00:56:02,329
for removing dead skin.

667
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,599
My gosh, look at how much
he's sweating.

668
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,940
He's trying to do his very best
to fulfill his given task.

669
00:56:08,369 --> 00:56:10,840
I'll be letting him down if I
complain and ask him to be gentle.

670
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:14,110
I feel as if my skin is on fire.

671
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,809
He might actually be trying...

672
00:56:16,849 --> 00:56:19,079
to relieve his own stress
by scrubbing me as hard as he can.

673
00:56:19,949 --> 00:56:22,320
What kinds of things has he been
through in life? He's so aggressive.

674
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:24,119
Is one of his family members ill?

675
00:56:24,389 --> 00:56:25,690
Is he desperate for
the hospital fee?

676
00:56:26,289 --> 00:56:29,460
I'm sure that he's trying so hard
to forget pain.

677
00:56:29,989 --> 00:56:31,360
I'm just lying down.

678
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:34,130
I can't... I cannot complain.

679
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:37,730
(Moaning in pain)

680
00:56:39,969 --> 00:56:42,400
My goodness. You should've told me
if it hurt that much.

681
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,170
- You've been enduring it all?
- Sorry?

682
00:56:44,269 --> 00:56:45,739
Lie down on your back again.

683
00:56:46,539 --> 00:56:47,739
I want to scrub the parts I missed.

684
00:56:48,909 --> 00:56:50,039
You little...

685
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:54,880
They completely got me this time.

686
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:57,420
Kang Woo Il was the dark horse.

687
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:00,119
He was prepared
for every single possible scenario.

688
00:57:00,489 --> 00:57:03,219
I bet everyone in the company
was expecting a scandal like that.

689
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:04,929
Exactly.

690
00:57:05,659 --> 00:57:07,960
They probably started working
on the plans three years ago.

691
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,130
People are calling it the most
ideal crisis management strategy...

692
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:13,170
and highly praising
Brain's competency.

693
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,199
We ended up benefiting them.

694
00:57:16,539 --> 00:57:18,610
Eun Hwan Gi's dad,
Congressman Eun Bok Dong.

695
00:57:18,809 --> 00:57:20,710
He founded Brain with nothing,

696
00:57:20,739 --> 00:57:22,980
and he's now aiming to get
elected as the mayor of Seoul.

697
00:57:24,449 --> 00:57:26,210
It won't be easy to take them down.

698
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,719
I'll take all of them down,

699
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:32,750
including that psychopath's dad who
put a silver spoon in his mouth.

700
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:36,360
Forget being a mayor. He'll be too
humiliated to even leave the house.

701
00:57:36,989 --> 00:57:38,360
You should leave that company.

702
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:39,760
You've done enough.

703
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,500
What are you talking about?

704
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,030
They completely destroyed my family.

705
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:46,369
You might end up in danger...

706
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,239
Do you know what
infuriates me the most?

707
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:58,579
It's the fact that the psychopath
did not show up.

708
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:02,519
He put Kang Woo Il on the frontline
and made him apologize.

709
00:58:03,219 --> 00:58:06,889
He hid behind him and didn't
even lift a finger.

710
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:13,829
(Call for Applications:
In-House Venture Project)

711
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:15,960
Hye Young, have a look at this.

712
00:58:21,269 --> 00:58:23,239
(Call for Applications:
In-House Venture Project)

713
00:58:23,269 --> 00:58:25,809
(Objectives, Criteria, Required
Qualifications, Procedure, Schedule)

714
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:31,449
It looks like it's really happening.

715
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:34,050
The ghost of the penthouse,
Eun Hwan Gi.

716
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:35,980
He does pique my curiosity.

717
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:37,650
Then go ahead and apply.

718
00:58:38,219 --> 00:58:39,420
Do you think I'm crazy?

719
00:58:42,489 --> 00:58:43,590
Shall I apply?

720
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:44,929
- You?
- You?

721
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,690
It'll be such an easy job.

722
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:48,530
I'll just have to make sure
not to get on his nerves...

723
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:51,599
and flatter him as much as possible.

724
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:53,869
Do you want to be unemployed
for the rest of your life or what?

725
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:57,170
I'm telling you.
It's all for a show.

726
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:58,909
The project itself
will be cancelled in no time.

727
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:02,239
No way. I mean,
he's the founder's son.

728
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:07,449
Kang Woo Il is obviously doing it
to demote Eun Hwan Gi.

729
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,690
Being cutthroat about it
will look bad,

730
00:59:11,219 --> 00:59:12,889
so he's trying
to be a little polite.

731
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:15,920
I guess you're right.

732
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:18,889
Joining that team means death.
Who'd want to apply for it?

733
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:20,300
Me!

734
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:26,070
I think it'll be fun.

735
00:59:28,139 --> 00:59:30,099
Kid, come here.

736
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:32,909
- Me?
- Come here.

737
00:59:33,139 --> 00:59:34,139
Yes?

738
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:40,719
You keep getting distracted as you
have too much time on your hands.

739
00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:42,650
Let's get some work done, okay?

740
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:47,389
Yes. You know what to do, right?
Everything here.

741
00:59:48,219 --> 00:59:49,219
How dare you!

742
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:55,159
If you misplace any of them,
you'll receive a death sentence.

743
00:59:55,699 --> 00:59:58,170
Send them to the photoshoot
locations via express courier,

744
00:59:58,829 --> 01:00:01,170
but make sure all the handmade
decorations don't get damaged.

745
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:04,170
Handle them gently
as you'd treat babies.

746
01:00:04,369 --> 01:00:05,909
You have to be very careful.

747
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:08,510
Also, you must be punctual
and meet all the deadlines.

748
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:10,750
Those in fashion
are known for their impatience.

749
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:13,210
Okay!

750
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:18,550
Because I'm fond of you,

751
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:20,619
I'm giving you a chance
to be the boss.

752
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:22,320
A chance to be the boss?

753
01:00:22,659 --> 01:00:24,289
When you work at a PR agency,

754
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:28,300
you have to put up with the media
and clients without losing a smile.

755
01:00:28,599 --> 01:00:32,030
The only people we can boss around
are those express couriers.

756
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:35,199
I'm sorry.

757
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:39,469
I'm sorry.

758
01:00:43,579 --> 01:00:46,449
Keep them on a tight leash, okay?

759
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,119
Yes! Of course.

760
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:55,889
All right, let's do this.

761
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:05,599
Hey, I saw you on the rooftop.

762
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,000
Are you not the guy?

763
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:11,769
Am I mistaken?

764
01:01:14,909 --> 01:01:16,280
Where are you going?

765
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:19,110
You're the guy.

766
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:21,349
Why are you trying to run away?

767
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:25,119
Why can't you look at me in the eye?

768
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,389
Are you...

769
01:01:29,889 --> 01:01:30,989
a newbie?

770
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:33,489
You must be
a newbie express courier.

771
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:39,699
I'm not picking on you, so don't be
scared. Everyone starts somewhere.

772
01:01:40,699 --> 01:01:41,940
I'm new, too.

773
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:49,409
Here's another weird guy.

774
01:01:50,449 --> 01:01:53,510
He walks around with his head down
and can't even make eye contact.

775
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,090
Gosh, my eye...

776
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:03,320
What's wrong?

777
01:02:04,389 --> 01:02:05,530
What happened to your eye?

778
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,260
I like that you're looking
at me in the eye now.

779
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,269
What scares you? Do you think I'll
shoot laser beams out of my eyes?

780
01:02:16,969 --> 01:02:19,710
There's a photo shoot
taking place in Ilsan Lake Park.

781
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:22,639
You just have to get there
in one hour.

782
01:02:23,309 --> 01:02:27,219
You have plenty of time, so please
ride your motorcycle safely.

783
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,880
- Pardon?
- We'll see each other often.

784
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,019
Wait...

785
01:02:35,989 --> 01:02:38,260
Let's not run into each other again
on the rooftop, though.

786
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:47,170
I believe in you!

787
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,940
Why do I have to do this? It's her
fault for jumping to conclusions.

788
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:28,280
I never said that I work
for an express courier service.

789
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:40,659
If these things disappear
into thin air,

790
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:44,690
the photoshoot will be affected,
and she'll get in trouble.

791
01:03:57,170 --> 01:03:59,539
It may be enough reason to fire her.

792
01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:03,340
I do feel bad, but I have
to straighten things out.

793
01:04:04,849 --> 01:04:07,050
Yes, I shouldn't go.
Get off the car now.

794
01:04:33,539 --> 01:04:36,010
Pardon?
The courier didn't arrive yet?

795
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:39,309
That's strange. We sent them via
courier before we left the office.

796
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:42,849
- You sent them out, right?
- Yes. I sent them.

797
01:04:43,349 --> 01:04:44,590
We're ready to roll.

798
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,420
- Call the courier guy.
- Okay.

799
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:52,590
I don't have his phone number.

800
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,159
- What?
- Who was it?

801
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Which company?

802
01:04:56,429 --> 01:04:59,630
He's new. He came to our office
to promote the company.

803
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:01,840
Well... He's not bad looking and...

804
01:05:01,869 --> 01:05:04,570
Is that why you forgot
to ask him for his business card?

805
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:06,869
I got his business card
on the rooftop...

806
01:05:07,309 --> 01:05:11,380
I can't really say I got it. I found
the one he dropped, but I...

807
01:05:11,409 --> 01:05:12,880
Call the courier companies
and locate the order.

808
01:05:13,849 --> 01:05:15,179
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

809
01:05:15,449 --> 01:05:17,989
Right. I just...

810
01:05:20,619 --> 01:05:22,320
I would've already
called the police.

811
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,789
It actually turned out for the best.
I mean, this is what I wanted.

812
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:00,699
I'll be late anyway.

813
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:04,070
The photoshoot will have to be
rescheduled, and they'll complain.

814
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:07,130
But it's none of my business since
I'm no longer the CEO of Brain.

815
01:06:08,139 --> 01:06:10,039
Yes. I should turn my car around.

816
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,199
- What is going on?
- Gosh.

817
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,630
What should we do? What a disaster!

818
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:42,800
No one has received the order.
Are you sure he's a courier guy?

819
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,239
Yes, he is. I'm certain.

820
01:06:44,469 --> 01:06:46,909
Why else do you think he took them?

821
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:49,210
It's obviously because they're
very expensive designer stuff.

822
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:51,710
We have no time to waste like this.
Call the police now.

823
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:53,050
Just a moment.

824
01:06:53,449 --> 01:06:57,320
- Let's wait just a bit more.
- He obviously stole them.

825
01:06:57,619 --> 01:07:00,960
- He'll never do such a thing.
- You've never even seen him before.

826
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:03,260
You said you don't know
his name or his phone number.

827
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:04,730
That's true, but...

828
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:07,500
Are you two a team? Is that it?

829
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,769
- Are you two splitting them?
- Pardon me?

830
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:15,469
- Gosh, no way.
- This is why.

831
01:07:16,139 --> 01:07:19,010
This is precisely why you have to be
careful when hiring new employees.

832
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:24,679
All right. It's all my fault.
I actually...

833
01:07:26,349 --> 01:07:29,980
asked Ro Woon to take care
of arranging the courier delivery.

834
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:32,750
Why? What were you doing? Tell me.

835
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:35,559
You don't even do that much.

836
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:40,900
There're so many people here. Don't
get so worked up. Go easy on me.

837
01:07:40,929 --> 01:07:44,929
Can you talk politely to me since
there are so many people here?

838
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:49,369
We did go to the same school, but
I can't go easy on you all the time.

839
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,539
- Do you understand, Ms. Dang?
- Yes.

840
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:54,070
I'm sorry, Ms. Park.

841
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:58,210
Can you still not figure out
what's going on?

842
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:10,619
I'm sorry. I'm...

843
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:15,400
I'm... I'm sorry.

844
01:08:16,529 --> 01:08:19,029
It's always the weak
that have to be sorry.

845
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:29,710
I beg you.

846
01:08:32,210 --> 01:08:34,720
I implore you,

847
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,560
so please trust him.

848
01:08:42,989 --> 01:08:44,890
Are you really going
to be this bull-headed?

849
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:46,689
I promise you that I'll find them.

850
01:08:47,029 --> 01:08:48,800
So please don't call the police yet.

851
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:51,869
Please give me some time.
Just a little bit of time.

852
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,100
Please wait just a little bit.

853
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:56,739
Hey, get yourself back...

854
01:09:06,949 --> 01:09:08,119
What is going on?

855
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:10,680
Even Mr. Kang is here now.

856
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:12,850
I'm so sorry, Mr. Kang.

857
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,890
The thing that I've been
worried about finally happened.

858
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:46,220
Where on earth is he?

859
01:09:47,859 --> 01:09:49,060
Did he get into an accident?

860
01:09:51,090 --> 01:09:52,260
Where is he?

861
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:29,300
Where is he now?

862
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,100
Where did he go?

863
01:10:40,409 --> 01:10:41,510
I knew it!

864
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,180
Look at that.

865
01:10:43,579 --> 01:10:45,010
I knew he would come.

866
01:10:45,710 --> 01:10:47,449
He even gave up his motorbike...

867
01:10:47,479 --> 01:10:49,380
and ran all the way here.

868
01:10:50,649 --> 01:10:52,050
Here!

869
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,260
I've been waiting for you!

870
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:08,369
I shouldn't have come here.

871
01:11:09,270 --> 01:11:12,109
Thank you for coming!

872
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,739
I shouldn't have gone near her
in the first place.

873
01:11:27,319 --> 01:11:28,359
There we go.

874
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,359
Thank you so much
for all of your support.

875
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:36,159
I shouldn't have hovered around her.

876
01:11:36,729 --> 01:11:39,829
I had faith in you!

877
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:44,300
What if she finds out who I am?

878
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:54,880
If I told her then...

879
01:11:55,479 --> 01:11:59,020
I knew you'd come!

880
01:12:00,689 --> 01:12:03,520
No, before that...

881
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:09,500
Is there something
you want to say to me?

882
01:12:10,930 --> 01:12:13,800
If only I had told her...

883
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:59,350
If only I had said
anything to her...

884
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:14,760
If I tell her now,

885
01:13:15,699 --> 01:13:17,159
will I be able to make things right?

886
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:18,600
Move!

887
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:21,340
What did you say?

888
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:24,039
- Move!
- I can't hear you.

889
01:13:26,439 --> 01:13:27,880
I can't hear you.

890
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:29,840
Or is it...

891
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,210
too late now?

892
01:14:22,899 --> 01:14:25,670
(My Shy Boss)

893
01:14:25,869 --> 01:14:27,170
This is a new beginning
and a new challenge.

894
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:28,239
Did you hear?

895
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:30,369
The penthouse will be opened.

896
01:14:30,569 --> 01:14:32,069
- That's unbelievable.
- Why here, of all places?

897
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:34,880
She might get hurt
if my cover gets blown.

898
01:14:35,079 --> 01:14:36,880
- Did you eat?
- Yes.

899
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:38,810
Don't worry.

900
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:41,920
This is only the beginning
of my revenge.

901
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:45,420
I've picked out members
for the venture.

902
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,390
Forget it. I have a few on my mind.

903
01:14:47,449 --> 01:14:48,659
There's one more.

904
01:14:49,090 --> 01:14:50,960
- Trust me.
- Have you two already become close?

905
01:14:50,989 --> 01:14:54,060
She's cheerful and energetic
just like I used to be.

906
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:55,199
I like her.

907
01:14:55,229 --> 01:14:56,460
We'll soon find out...

908
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:59,130
who he really is.

909
01:14:59,229 --> 01:15:01,800
Meet the leader of Silent Monster,

910
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:03,439
Eun Hwan Gi.
