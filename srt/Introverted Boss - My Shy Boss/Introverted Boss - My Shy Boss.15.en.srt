1
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,859
Dad, the food is ready.

2
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,870
Okay, let's eat.

3
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,849
How does it taste?

4
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,819
It's good.

5
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:26,019
That's a relief.

6
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:32,459
Gosh.

7
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,569
Dad, can't you stop pretending
everything's okay?

8
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:42,269
I really think it tastes okay.

9
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,609
No, it doesn't.

10
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,209
Oh, I might be late for work.

11
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,030
Are you going to
continue to work there?

12
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:06,530
You started with bad intentions.

13
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,009
Ji Hye led me there.

14
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,939
Can you buy these for me?

15
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:23,180
I have a really important audition
after this performance.

16
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,050
If I wear this necklace
to the audition,

17
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,819
people will recognize my worth.

18
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,860
I finally found...

19
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:37,830
people and a place
that recognize my worth.

20
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,099
It's all thanks to Ji Hye.

21
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,539
That's what I believe.

22
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:45,340
But Ji Hye didn't...

23
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:48,669
leave the necklace for you.

24
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:54,949
Still, I got an even prettier one.

25
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,659
Gosh, that's blinding.

26
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,930
Is that a tray or a mirror?

27
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,599
You're going to make a hole in it.

28
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,969
What's wrong?

29
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:22,669
You're not here to do dishes.

30
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,680
You came to talk, didn't you?

31
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,280
Well...

32
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,490
Go ahead.

33
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:39,560
Are you going to keep
your mouth shut?

34
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,830
You make people feel alienated
when you do that.

35
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:45,229
Really?

36
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,560
Are you joking?

37
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,129
Do you think
I only want to be understood?

38
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,039
I want to understand you too.

39
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:54,669
Enough with seeing through
other people.

40
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,569
Show me who you are inside.

41
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:00,849
I can't see through anything.

42
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:07,289
It's true. I thought that
it was easy at times.

43
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:12,259
I could see through and read
what people were thinking.

44
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,730
But I was wrong.

45
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,269
To think that you know
and to think that you understand...

46
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:25,540
is a very dangerous thing.

47
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,740
What do you mean?

48
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,579
I'm talking about Ji Hye.

49
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,449
I think...

50
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,350
it happened because of me.

51
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,230
What? That's...

52
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,310
Boss.

53
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:41,649
I was worried about you.
Where have you been all day?

54
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,180
I told you. No more locking doors.

55
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,920
No more secrets.

56
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:50,660
That was not too long ago.
Why are you still being secretive?

57
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:57,930
Boss?

58
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:01,269
What's wrong?

59
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:03,839
Did something happen?

60
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,240
Why is it...

61
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,850
that there are so many reasons
why we can't be together?

62
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,120
Pardon?

63
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:42,410
(Episode 15: A Reason Bigger
Than 99 Other Reasons)

64
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,079
Mr. Eun Hwan Gi.

65
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,379
That's you, right?

66
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:51,550
Yes.

67
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,149
Who are you?

68
00:06:56,589 --> 00:07:00,160
I'm just Ro Woon's
neighborhood friend.

69
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,160
I see.

70
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,029
Do you think it's over?

71
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,100
You seem to be relieved.

72
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:13,939
But guess what?

73
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,139
You don't have the right
to smile so happily...

74
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,810
beside Ro Woon.

75
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,410
Pardon?

76
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:24,920
There's something
you don't know about.

77
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,350
Ji Hye was watching...

78
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,629
you, not Kang Woo Il.

79
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,730
Pardon? What are you talking about?

80
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,839
Of course you didn't know.

81
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,170
You probably
never gave her a glance.

82
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,610
I think you have it wrong.

83
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,949
I don't know how she ended up
getting involved with him.

84
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,220
It took me by surprise.

85
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:01,750
However, all of this started
because of you.

86
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:07,560
She wanted to hear about you
from your friend.

87
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:33,620
Should I ask Mr. Kang
to do me a favor...

88
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,889
and give this to Mr. Eun?

89
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,490
I didn't get to give him the drawing
in the end.

90
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,730
The woman he's seeing...

91
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,870
is a curator who only deals with
professional paintings by artists.

92
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,009
But I'm...

93
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,309
My drawing is...

94
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:02,149
That's enough. You can't even drink.

95
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:06,720
I don't hate her, though.

96
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,450
Thanks to her,

97
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,360
I got to go on a fake date with him.

98
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,230
I was so nervous.

99
00:09:22,669 --> 00:09:24,870
- Pardon?
- Thank you for your help.

100
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,820
Hey, don't you know
no one likes bad guys anymore?

101
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,649
He's not a bad guy.

102
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:45,159
He's sweet.

103
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:49,559
If a guy is mean to you nine times
and he's nice once, you're moved.

104
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,029
If a guy's good to you nine times
and he makes a mistake once,

105
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,559
you say that he changed.

106
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:56,070
Do girls have a problem counting?

107
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,870
One is good to you nine times
while the other is good to you once.

108
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,740
The answer is obvious.

109
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:02,509
Are you all that dumb?

110
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:07,080
It's true. I'm dumb.

111
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,919
I know it will never work
between us,

112
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,850
but I can't help looking at him.

113
00:10:14,049 --> 00:10:16,250
I'm suffering
the more I look at him,

114
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,860
but I can't stop myself.

115
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:22,759
Then just go up to him
and tell him you like him.

116
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,929
If I do that, I won't be able
to see him anymore.

117
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,500
I can't live without seeing him.

118
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,299
It's a mere crush.

119
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,309
Why is it such a big deal?

120
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,649
(Mr. Kang Woo Il)

121
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,179
Yes, sir.

122
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,789
Right now?

123
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,889
Yes. I'll be right there.

124
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,159
- Okay.
- Hey.

125
00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:00,200
It's after hours.
Why is he calling you in?

126
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:02,200
He's abusing his power.

127
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,870
It's not him.

128
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:06,370
You just said, "Yes, sir".

129
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,909
You really are dumb.

130
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:14,009
I'm sorry.
I'll take care of the tab.

131
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,379
Hey. Ji Hye.

132
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,850
Don't go.

133
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:22,519
Thank you for listening to me.

134
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,860
I'm lucky I have someone to talk to.

135
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:26,789
I'm sorry.

136
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:56,419
You should have given her a glance.

137
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,590
You should have...

138
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,529
listened to her at least once.

139
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:06,360
She was so desperate
as she looked towards you.

140
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,370
How could you be so cruel
and ignore her like that?

141
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:17,509
More than anyone else,

142
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:21,210
you hurt her the most.

143
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,279
More than anyone else,

144
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,450
you're responsible.

145
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:28,820
But...

146
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,490
how can you be beside her sister?

147
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,139
Reporter Woo...

148
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:49,370
tried really hard...

149
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:53,440
to reveal the truth three years ago.

150
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,750
But his higher-ups stopped him.

151
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,279
Then he got fired from the newspaper
company he used to work for.

152
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,220
But he has never said anything
like that about Ji Hye to me.

153
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:05,789
He probably wanted to...

154
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,490
respect her feelings.

155
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:12,730
Maybe he wanted to bury it all.

156
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,370
Then...

157
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,870
what distressed Ji Hye...

158
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,379
was not...

159
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:27,779
getting abandoned by Mr. Kang.

160
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:32,750
It was the thought...

161
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,120
that she wouldn't be able
to face you again.

162
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,289
That she couldn't turn back.

163
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:42,789
That's probably...

164
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:46,000
what devastated her.

165
00:13:56,539 --> 00:13:57,610
Please...

166
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,750
Please...

167
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,250
Please pick up.

168
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,179
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached at the moment.

169
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,549
Please...

170
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,659
Please leave a message...

171
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,120
Mr. Eun.

172
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:17,720
The person who should own
Ji Hye's drawing.

173
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,519
It wasn't Mr. Kang.

174
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,059
It was you.

175
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,029
What are you drawing?

176
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,070
Of what someone is always
looking at.

177
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,049
Mr. Kang is always surrounded
by a lot of people, you know.

178
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:54,889
I thought that's why she drew
a building filled with people.

179
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,250
But I was wrong.

180
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,860
Mr. Eun.

181
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,200
What are you doing?

182
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,940
Nothing. I wasn't doing anything.

183
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:27,579
I was trying to see if these
windowsills are dusty,

184
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:30,710
but they're not. They're clean.

185
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:32,180
I do the cleaning.

186
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:34,789
You don't need to worry about it.

187
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,750
My apologies.

188
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:41,049
What you see from the window
you always look out of.

189
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:48,859
The flower shop and the bakery
on the main floor.

190
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,829
The cafe on the second floor.

191
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,869
The hair salon on the third floor.

192
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:56,869
Right?

193
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,910
I think she wanted to fill...

194
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,539
the concrete building with people.

195
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,980
You're alone all the time,

196
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,819
so she was probably hoping you can
always have warm people around you.

197
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,759
Here.

198
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:33,369
Take it.

199
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,789
The drawing has finally
found its owner.

200
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,549
Why do you look at me like that?

201
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,990
It's just... You look different.

202
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:10,059
You never looked this relaxed
even at home.

203
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:12,859
Are you disappointed?

204
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:15,829
I'm sorry.

205
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,500
This is who I really am.

206
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:23,539
I'm not disappointed.
You look very comfortable.

207
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,009
I am.

208
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:32,420
I'm stuck at home all the time.
I never have to dress up.

209
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,950
I don't have to force myself
to speak anymore.

210
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,259
I don't need to put on fake smiles
for other people's sakes either.

211
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,390
Do you stay at home all the time?

212
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,130
Mom and Dad told me to.

213
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:50,269
They must be ashamed of me.

214
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:51,569
That's absurd.

215
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,869
They must worry about you.

216
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,440
Anyway, I'm not supposed to be
outside. I should get back soon.

217
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,480
Why did you want to see me?

218
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,190
I've been thinking about you.

219
00:24:13,089 --> 00:24:15,759
I thought you had everything.

220
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:21,430
I didn't feel like there was
anything I should do for you.

221
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,039
I took it for granted that
you always put me before yourself.

222
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,569
Sometimes,

223
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:35,480
I even thought it was boring.

224
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,779
I had no idea
I was hurting you so much.

225
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,890
It makes me sad.

226
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:52,099
Forget it.

227
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,900
It's not your fault.

228
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:57,970
There you go again.

229
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,769
You're just saying that for my sake.

230
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,509
You said you feel comfortable
being yourself.

231
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,380
You look more beautiful now...

232
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,579
than ever.

233
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:14,180
So stop holding it back.

234
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:17,190
Say what you want to say.

235
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,490
You're right.

236
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:25,960
It's all your fault.

237
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,329
I hate you.

238
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,299
I like that.

239
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:35,809
But I think it's too mild.

240
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,450
I don't want you to be happy
without me.

241
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,049
I hope you'll become a big failure.

242
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,380
Is that it?

243
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,390
That still sounds too moderate.

244
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,289
Take it a little further.

245
00:25:56,029 --> 00:25:58,460
You're a jerk. You're the worst.

246
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,160
You're a jerk.

247
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,869
There you go.

248
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:10,970
That's the least you should say.

249
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,750
I thought I'd never see you again.

250
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:30,630
I thought you'd run away
once you see who I really am.

251
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:34,130
I thought it'd be
the end of everything.

252
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:55,289
Oh, my.

253
00:26:56,819 --> 00:26:58,789
Are you sick again?

254
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,190
You should take better care of
yourself to stay competitive.

255
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,460
I'm not sick. It's for weight loss.

256
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:07,630
Who are you trying to impress
this time?

257
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,170
It's not like that.

258
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,339
I'm going to change.

259
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:16,109
I'll take better care of myself
and love myself from now on.

260
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,109
What are you doing tonight?

261
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:25,279
- I'm...
- You probably don't have any plans,

262
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:26,380
do you?

263
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,089
When couples go around arm in arm,

264
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:32,319
you read about them on your phone
at home.

265
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:36,859
Gosh, I'm doing you a big favor.

266
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:38,630
Here.

267
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:41,130
What is this?

268
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:44,299
It's a concert Brain is promoting.

269
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:46,740
Go to the concert.
I can accompany you.

270
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:50,869
Aren't I such an amazing colleague?

271
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,750
I appreciate your kindness,
but I already have plans.

272
00:27:58,549 --> 00:27:59,650
With who?

273
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,319
With myself.

274
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,750
Sorry?

275
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:06,390
I'm attending a lecture on PR
this evening.

276
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:10,029
Since when do you
attend those lectures?

277
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:12,529
Starting now, as I already said.

278
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:16,069
I'm going to take better care
of myself and love myself.

279
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,099
Let's do it some other time.

280
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,539
Well...

281
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,039
Hello.

282
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,710
Be kinder to her.

283
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:36,150
Gyo Ri is soft-hearted.
She must be attracted to kind guys.

284
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,460
What are you talking about?

285
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:42,160
Don't tell me you believe...

286
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:44,490
being manly means
being cold on purpose.

287
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:46,200
That's just pathetic.

288
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:49,430
You're mistaken.

289
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,670
Enjoy the concert.

290
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:57,140
These are concert tickets. Oh, my.

291
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,380
Thank you.
I think I'll go with my husband.

292
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,710
What is this?

293
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,809
It's weight-loss pills.

294
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,789
About the lecture...

295
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:12,819
Can I go with you?

296
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:17,329
Do you want to?

297
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:20,730
I'll buy you dinner in return.

298
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:23,970
Sure.

299
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:25,500
Let's go.

300
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:34,680
- Gosh.
- What did I tell you?

301
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,279
You're so stupid.

302
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,109
Why are you doing this to me?

303
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,549
- Have some chocolate.
- I don't like sweets.

304
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,420
Have some sweets and wake up.

305
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,089
- Stop it.
- Wake up.

306
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:57,500
Thanks to you, I could remind
myself of the role of PR.

307
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,440
You dozed off the whole time.

308
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:04,140
What's wrong with me?

309
00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:09,410
All the other team members
seem to be progressing.

310
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:11,950
I only get in trouble.

311
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,819
You said you have a different dream.

312
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,690
- You want to become a celebrity.
- Still,

313
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,720
I feel...

314
00:30:22,089 --> 00:30:26,400
a bit left out
and distant from the others.

315
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:31,529
These days, you feel like
a much mature person than I am.

316
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:37,670
Once you start
pursuing your real dream,

317
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,539
you'll change.

318
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:43,450
What is this? Are you trying to
send me away?

319
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,720
Do you feel no attachment to me?

320
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,950
Don't say that.

321
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:51,450
- I liked you.
- So...

322
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,359
What did you just say?

323
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,529
Do you want to see where I live?

324
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:02,099
What? Now?
Your parents must be there.

325
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:07,900
Well...

326
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,460
I knew you'd make that face.

327
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,730
After seeing where I live,
you feel sorry for me, right?

328
00:31:32,829 --> 00:31:35,099
Me? Not at all.

329
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,900
You live on a rooftop,
the symbol of dreams.

330
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,269
Youths who have nothing
but dreams and passion...

331
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:45,480
live either in the basement
or on the rooftop.

332
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:47,339
I've always wanted to try it.

333
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:48,880
You're just saying that.

334
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:51,579
This is why...

335
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:53,680
I couldn't tell you how I felt.

336
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:56,789
I'm sorry.

337
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:59,289
I didn't know.

338
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:01,720
Don't be. I'm the one that's sorry.

339
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,190
When you asked me
to act like we're dating,

340
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:08,230
I shouldn't have continued
to grow my feelings for you.

341
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:13,140
I'll give back the clothes
you bought for me.

342
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,740
Why?

343
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:16,569
Take them.

344
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:22,509
Now it's really over.

345
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:27,049
You're not even going to try?

346
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,549
Although our relationship was fake,

347
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,920
thank you for everything.

348
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:50,269
I finally confessed.

349
00:32:50,309 --> 00:32:53,009
Now I don't have
any lingering feelings.

350
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,950
Goodbye.

351
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:25,140
Hwan Gi stole
all my dishes last time.

352
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:26,940
Now it's you?

353
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,049
I didn't come here to see you,
so don't mind me.

354
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,880
I came to volunteer.

355
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,750
I have a heartache
because of someone.

356
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,049
That's cold.

357
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,250
Sorry, were you standing there?

358
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,930
I'm worried about Hwan Gi.

359
00:33:46,029 --> 00:33:47,430
He'll be fine.

360
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:50,529
He has someone beside him...

361
00:33:50,569 --> 00:33:54,369
that keeps on knocking at his door
to drag him out.

362
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,170
Unfortunately,

363
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,940
that won't be easy anymore.

364
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:08,050
We were all fools.

365
00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:10,320
Not a single person...

366
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,389
was able to confess
their feelings properly.

367
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,730
You're right.

368
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,500
Too bad for you, though.

369
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:22,699
What?

370
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,699
What do you mean?

371
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,900
Think about it.

372
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:31,409
Ji Hye was looking at someone else
three years ago,

373
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:34,110
when you misunderstood her
and wasted your time.

374
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,449
Come on.

375
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,110
I'm not sure if I can say this,

376
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,150
but you deserve it.

377
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:46,860
You're being harsh on me.
I'm starting to find you scary.

378
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,829
Good. You shouldn't have
told me everything then.

379
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,199
I'm sure Hwan Gi feels the same.

380
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:58,840
An open door won't be easy to close.

381
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,510
You fool.

382
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:06,280
Try me. Keep going.

383
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,949
This is Reporter Woo.
He's been attacking you constantly.

384
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:20,059
He used to work for a major press.

385
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,829
He was best friends with that
secretary from three years ago.

386
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:26,829
Also, I found this out
while researching around him.

387
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,429
The dead secretary's little sister
currently works for Brain.

388
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,469
What?

389
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,570
She must have given Reporter Woo
information...

390
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,010
since Mr. Eun's power abuse scandal.

(New York Barbershop)

392
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,829
That's enough.

393
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:53,440
There's no more space.

394
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:00,480
Even if you do this,
Ro Woon won't change her mind.

395
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,219
Come in.

396
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:38,849
I thought I should
tell you in advance...

397
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,219
that there's no use
in visiting anymore.

398
00:39:43,389 --> 00:39:46,719
I'll be closing the shop soon.

399
00:39:46,889 --> 00:39:47,960
Pardon?

400
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:51,159
Why all of a sudden?

401
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,199
The landlord changed,

402
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,559
and they hiked up the rent
by a lot.

403
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,599
He doesn't have
as my customers anymore.

404
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:01,900
He was here for 30 years.

405
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,570
How can they do that?

406
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:14,949
I don't know why Ro Woon
locked herself in,

407
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,920
but I don't think you two
were meant to be.

408
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,260
You should get over her.

409
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,699
Now I get it.
You were blinded by a woman.

410
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:08,300
Did she tell you to kick Woo Il out
for what he did to her sister?

411
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,769
She didn't tell me anything
nor kick Woo Il out.

412
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:16,280
You're so high-maintenance.

413
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,949
Was it you...

414
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:23,190
that took over New York Barbershop?

415
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,130
Why did you do that?

416
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:38,170
They don't have anything left.
Was it necessary?

417
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:41,400
- You saw how Yi Soo broke down.
- Yes.

418
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,869
I finally woke up after seeing
what happened to Yi Soo.

419
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:48,909
I'll have to pick out
your partner myself.

420
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,250
Pardon?

421
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,320
There she is.

Yun Jung.

423
00:42:00,389 --> 00:42:02,559
Hello, I'm Seo Yun Jung.

424
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:05,460
Thank you for taking time out of
your busy schedule to meet with me.

425
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,599
I'm an impatient man.

426
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,769
I wanted to meet you
as soon as possible.

427
00:42:11,769 --> 00:42:13,039
Please have a seat.

428
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:17,170
Why are you here?

429
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,710
You didn't know I was coming?

430
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:23,110
Hey, you should've told me
that you've been seeing her.

431
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,110
Why did you have to make me
get involved?

432
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:28,920
You know how shy Hwan Gi is.

433
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:31,190
I should have reached out
to you first.

434
00:42:32,289 --> 00:42:34,460
So you two met in university?

435
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:36,789
No, we don't have that kind
of relationship.

436
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:41,230
Yes. I've been wanting to be the one
by his side since then.

437
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,429
I like him a lot.

438
00:42:43,699 --> 00:42:48,199
You're so straightforward.
I love it.

439
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,510
I'd love for you to become my
daughter-in-law right away.

440
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:54,610
What do you say? Do you want
to marry him?

441
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,949
Marry Hwan Gi?

442
00:43:00,349 --> 00:43:01,880
Even just the thought of it
makes me happy.

443
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,789
- Well, it's...
- I'm sorry though.

444
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:08,590
You're not exactly my type.

445
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:11,590
What?

446
00:43:13,059 --> 00:43:16,000
I like how prudent Hwan Gi is.

447
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,239
He can be a bit slow, but
he's thoughtful and considerate.

448
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,269
That's...

449
00:43:23,409 --> 00:43:25,440
But I see that
you're a little different.

450
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:29,309
You're outgoing, impatient,
and driven.

451
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:33,380
I'm like that, so people
in that category don't appeal to me.

452
00:43:37,989 --> 00:43:41,719
Thank you for thinking highly of me
and arranging this,

453
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:46,400
but I thought you would've at least
given Hwan Gi a heads up.

454
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:52,000
Judging from how pushy you are, I'm
assuming you've already vetted me.

455
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,400
Well, that's...

456
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,969
Since I'm already here, I'll just
be open and honest with you.

457
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:00,579
Will you be okay with us
living on our own?

are big family gatherings.

I can't make those pancakes.

461
00:44:09,949 --> 00:44:11,289
I jumped the gun too fast.

462
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,260
I was too rude, wasn't I?

463
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:23,599
I just didn't think it was right.

464

I'm sorry for putting you
in an uncomfortable position.

465

Your parents
will disapprove of me now.

Does it mean a beginning
of sad love?

00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:55,650
Come on. Show me.

494
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,059
Who is this?

495
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:10,630
He does look like a prankster.
Is it really Se Jong?

496
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:14,739
Yes, I'm Jang Se Jong today.

497
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,840
If I can be with her, I can let
myself go and become anyone.

498
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:22,239
You're cute.

499
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,719
How cute!

500
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,119
This should be in the photo too.

501
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:31,349
This is New York Barbershop.

502
00:47:31,389 --> 00:47:33,090
Please visit us!

503
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,539
I can let myself go,

504
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:51,610
but I cannot defy time.

505
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,579
Here. Drink it.

506
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,550
"Drink it"?

507
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:02,619
You said you're Se Jong.
Can I not talk casually to you?

508
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:07,590
Stop putting on an act, Boss.

509
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:10,730
You must be exhausted.
Take that off, will you?

510
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,530
Come on! Gosh, seriously.

511
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,599
Stop moving.

512
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:24,010
Reveal your face already. Goodness.

513
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,010
What are you doing?

514
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:32,449
Let go of me, Boss.

515
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,349
I'm sorry.

516
00:48:36,889 --> 00:48:41,460
Can you just pretend
that I'm someone else?

517
00:48:44,929 --> 00:48:45,989
I just...

518
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:50,130
want to see your face once.

519
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:57,739
You're already here.
Please let me see your face.

520
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:02,079
I've missed you so much.

521
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:18,130
Mom. When someone falls
in love with a bear,

522
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:20,929
will a hero be born?

523
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:23,769
- What are you talking about?
- Let's go, Ro Ah.

524
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:44,349
You have to leave after eating this.

525
00:49:45,019 --> 00:49:46,289
You said you've missed me.

526
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:49,059
That's a separate matter.

527
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:51,289
What can't be done cannot be done.

528
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:55,730
Here.
I'm on an extremely tight budget,

529
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,929
so this is all I can give you.

530
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:01,139
Anyway, thank you for your help.

531
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,139
You don't need to thank me.

532
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:09,780
Your dad's business is suffering...

533
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,650
because of my father.

534
00:50:14,449 --> 00:50:15,519
Sorry?

535
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:18,389
How...

536
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,219
I'm sorry.

537
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:24,329
Now, there's another reason
I can't be the one for you.

538
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,130
But I came.

539
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,530
You're saying it can't be done,

540
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,769
but I've decided to pursue it.

541
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:39,440
But this won't change anything.

542
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:45,510
Until now, you always ran to me.

543
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:48,750
You trust me having no idea
what I had done.

544
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:53,050
After finding out,
you forgave me right away.

545
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,360
You can...

546
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,090
lock yourself up now.

547
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,429
Just like you did,

548
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:06,469
I'll knock on the door,
look into the room,

549
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,840
and try to drag you out.

550
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:13,039
I'll do that from now on.

551
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,980
I wouldn't be able to
face my sister.

552
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:24,650
We shouldn't do this.

553
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:27,190
I'll do it.

554
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:31,329
I'll shamelessly insist on staying
with someone I shouldn't be with.

555
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:32,530
I'll do it.

556
00:51:34,699 --> 00:51:36,599
Still, I can't do this.

557
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:41,900
Making the impossible possible is
the spirit of the special forces.

558
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,139
Special forces.

559
00:51:46,809 --> 00:51:48,940
Let me help your father's shop.

560
00:51:49,309 --> 00:51:50,880
It's all my father's fault.

561
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:52,750
Okay?

562
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:56,820
Let me do it.

563
00:51:57,889 --> 00:51:59,150
I don't know.

564
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:03,360
Please.

565
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:14,900
Gosh.

566
00:52:19,739 --> 00:52:22,210
It's just like three years ago.

567
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:35,019
I shout my heart out,
but no one listens.

568
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,760
One thing has changed.

569
00:52:38,329 --> 00:52:39,389
What is that?

570
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:41,730
You're not alone anymore.

571
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:44,469
Gosh, that's cheesy.

572
00:52:44,769 --> 00:52:47,099
Do you want one more reason
why you can't be with me?

573
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,440
I'm not talking about myself.

574
00:53:10,329 --> 00:53:13,530
My goodness.

575
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:15,699
Gosh.

576
00:53:16,429 --> 00:53:19,199
I knew you'd be using
elementary methods like this.

577
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:22,369
Don't tell anyone
you've worked at Silent Monster.

578
00:53:22,769 --> 00:53:24,239
Sun Bong.

579
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:28,309
He's right. You have a lot to learn.
Who said you could leave?

580
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:30,309
Yoo Hee.

581
00:53:30,449 --> 00:53:32,980
You should have told us.

582
00:53:34,219 --> 00:53:36,920
We're all here to help you, Ro Woon.

583
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:42,519
Thank you so much,

584
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:45,030
everyone.

585
00:53:55,369 --> 00:53:56,710
As you already know,

586
00:53:56,739 --> 00:53:59,070
the market is now dominated by
hair salons.

587
00:54:00,139 --> 00:54:02,280
If you simply beg customers
to visit a barbershop...

588
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:05,710
that has been forgotten,
you'll only look pitiful.

589
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:07,179
Then what should we do?

590
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:10,050
Don't blame the world
for never changing.

591
00:54:10,349 --> 00:54:13,590
It's faster and more effective
to change yourself.

592
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:20,360
- Excuse me.
- Do you like red ginseng?

593
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,659
Try it.

594
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,599
Could you answer this questionnaire?

595
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:27,699
Hello, could you
answer this questionnaire?

596
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:30,039
- Hello.
- Hello.

597
00:54:30,139 --> 00:54:32,610
- Try some red ginseng.
- Please answer this questionnaire.

598
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:34,280
Don't feel burdened.

599
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:36,679
Try some red ginseng too.

600
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,550
Here's the questionnaire.

601
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,449
- Yoo Hee, here's one for you.
- For me?

602
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:46,550
- If you're bored...
- It's a bit bitter.

603
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:49,489
For an innovation,
do thorough market research first.

604
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:50,590
It tastes good, right?

605
00:54:52,059 --> 00:54:53,400
Please take this.

606
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:56,360
Try white.

607
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:01,539
- Pink.
- It looks good.

608
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:05,940
It's nice.

609
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,010
It looks great.

610
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:21,460
- You look like an actor.
- That's absurd.

611
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:29,630
You look amazing.

612
00:55:29,699 --> 00:55:31,599
- It looks great on you.
- You look great.

613
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:34,039
You look 10 years younger.

614
00:55:34,099 --> 00:55:35,199
You look amazing.

615
00:55:38,269 --> 00:55:39,539
Are you really my dad?

616
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:42,780
You look fantastic.
You look like a different person.

617
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,079
Why don't you
change all the towels as well?

618
00:55:46,179 --> 00:55:48,150
The interior design
and the signs too.

619
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:51,789
You could change the name
of the shop as well.

620
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:55,789
The floor, the ceiling, and
the walls will look better this way.

621
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:56,889
Oh, my.

622
00:55:57,329 --> 00:56:01,460
I don't know how to
pay you back for your efforts.

623
00:56:02,199 --> 00:56:07,199
Still, all this feels strange
and uncomfortable to me.

624
00:56:08,739 --> 00:56:10,769
You need to change to be loved.

625
00:56:10,809 --> 00:56:12,840
If I'm going to change everything,

626
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:15,710
what's the point of
staying at the same place?

627
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:20,980
You've worked so hard. I'm so sorry.

628
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,280
Don't say that.

629
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,590
- It's okay.
- We understand.

630
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:26,190
It's okay.

631
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,889
Dad.

632
00:56:44,539 --> 00:56:46,570
Well then...

633
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:48,780
I'll get going.

634
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,579
Get home safely.

635
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,019
I can't believe him.

636
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,389
He never gets out of
his comfort zone.

637
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:05,590
We shouldn't have urged him
to change against his will.

638
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:09,130
We should find a way
he can stay the way he is.

639
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:13,570
Would that be possible?

640
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:17,110
It's what someone told me before.

641
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:22,340
I'm sure there's a method of
communication that suits you.

642
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,280
Let's find it.

643
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:26,510
Don't change.

644
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:38,360
I'll make sure to find it.

645
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:41,059
Don't worry too much.
You should get going now.

646
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:44,630
- I'll get going then.
- See you.

647
00:57:57,909 --> 00:57:59,480
I'm reporter Han Seok Jun.

648
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:01,849
- The 38th...
- Seok Jun?

649
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,920
Please do me a favor.

650
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,690
He's so popular as a host.

651
00:58:12,429 --> 00:58:14,760
I can't promise you anything.

652
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,630
- You know that, right?
- Yes. Thank you.

653
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:20,030
Please ask him to
look through the material.

654
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:21,170
(New York Barbershop)

655
00:58:23,139 --> 00:58:25,670
Do me a favor in return.

656
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:28,579
Pretend to be
my boyfriend just once.

657
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,349
What?

658
00:58:30,610 --> 00:58:33,510
You know that
he's my first love, right?

659
00:58:34,619 --> 00:58:36,719
I was an unattractive girl
with braces back then.

660
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,519
I want to show him
that I've completely changed.

661
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:42,860
But why me?

662
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,659
I pretended to be your girlfriend
in front of your father too.

663
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:47,860
Can't you do it for me
just this once?

664
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,769
- Still, I...
- You don't want to?

665
00:58:57,969 --> 00:58:59,610
I didn't say that.

666
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,780
Just take it.

667
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:04,550
You're doing it, okay?

668
00:59:05,809 --> 00:59:07,079
I like the concept.

669
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,059
Can I just say hi and leave?

670
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:22,300
Yes, give me a kiss too.

671
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:23,800
Okay. What?

672
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:26,429
I have a sad history.

673
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:29,369
While keeping me on the hook,

674
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,809
he kissed my best friend.

675
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:34,309
Help me recover from my trauma.

676
00:59:34,679 --> 00:59:38,110
Still, I can't kiss you.

677
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:41,019
It's just a little peck.
Is it that hard?

678
00:59:44,619 --> 00:59:45,849
I can't do that.

679
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,519
I can't do this either then.

680
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:55,460
Wait.

681
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:57,869
It'll be a peck on the cheek.

682
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,539
- On the lips.
- On the cheek.

683
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:03,400
Fine, on the cheek.

684
01:00:04,769 --> 01:00:05,769
Let's go.

685
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:08,809
It'll be on the cheek.

686
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,849
- Hi, it's been a long time.
- Hi, Yun Jung.

687
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:22,460
Have you been well? Who is this?

688
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:25,289
This is Hwan Gi,
the CEO of Silent Monster.

689
01:00:25,329 --> 01:00:26,329
I see.

690
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:33,329
He's my boyfriend.

691
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:36,769
Hello.

692
01:00:37,139 --> 01:00:38,469
Nice to meet you.

693
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:41,480
- He wanted to meet you.
- I see.

694
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:45,010
Honey, you can go now.

695
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,579
- Should I go?
- Yes.

696
01:00:48,349 --> 01:00:49,449
Right now?

697
01:01:11,309 --> 01:01:13,570
Thank you. Bye.

698
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:58,989
- All right, it's finished.
- Thank you.

699
01:02:05,329 --> 01:02:08,360
I heard other people tell me
that my stylist must hate me...

700
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,929
because I got trendy haircuts
that didn't suit me.

701
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:13,030
However, the New York Barbershop...

702
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:15,940
has kept their place for 30 years
for a reason.

703
01:02:15,969 --> 01:02:17,670
They have a huge presence.

704
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:31,449
Thank you so much.

705
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:33,190
You should thank Hwan Gi.

706
01:02:33,219 --> 01:02:34,789
All I did was help with the contact.

707
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,559
Also, New York Barbershop
is a good item by itself.

708
01:02:38,659 --> 01:02:40,599
The producers could see
that it was worth covering.

709
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:47,400
I'm leaving for the US tonight.

710
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,570
Pardon? The US?

711
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:50,400
It's going to be
a long trip this time.

712
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:52,869
Don't be too happy.

713
01:02:52,909 --> 01:02:55,639
Why all of a sudden?

714
01:02:57,650 --> 01:02:59,280
So that people miss me more.

715
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:03,119
I didn't tell Hwan Gi yet.

716
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:06,019
I hope he gets upset and misses me.

717
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:08,690
You should still say goodbye.

718
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:11,760
I got to say my goodbye.

719
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:18,570
Please take good care of him.

720
01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:25,710
I...

721
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:33,110
I know.
Still, please take good care of him.

722
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:45,429
Take care.

723
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:47,460
Come visit me.

724
01:03:51,699 --> 01:03:53,030
Please line up.

725
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:56,469
- Don't cut in line.
- What's going on?

726
01:03:56,969 --> 01:03:59,239
- Here you go.
- Okay.

727
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:02,340
- Sure, take a picture.
- You can take me.

728
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,349
I'm his closest friend.

729
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:12,989
You have a lot of customers.

730
01:04:13,019 --> 01:04:14,760
Oh, hello.

731
01:04:14,789 --> 01:04:16,659
- Please sit here to wait.
- Okay.

732
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:18,760
You have to line up here.

733
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:21,760
Hey, you're here.

734
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,900
- Come here.
- Sure, okay.

735
01:04:25,469 --> 01:04:26,630
Almost done.

736
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,769
What is all this?

737
01:04:35,909 --> 01:04:37,780
98...

738
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,880
Gosh, rent isn't the issue anymore.

739
01:04:41,079 --> 01:04:43,050
You'll become a landlord
at this rate.

740
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:45,050
It'll only be temporary.

741
01:04:45,289 --> 01:04:48,460
Don't be blinded.
You should always be consistent.

742
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:51,630
Gosh. All right.

743
01:04:53,059 --> 01:04:54,099
2,000.

744
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,469
(Yoo Hee)

745
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:01,699
Yes, Yoo Hee.

746
01:05:04,969 --> 01:05:06,070
Pardon?

747
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:12,909
Last year, corruption behind
a huge construction was revealed.

748
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:18,250
That was also the time a famous
celebrity's scandal broke out.

749
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:22,059
The one that provided
the information about the scandal...

750
01:05:22,789 --> 01:05:24,590
was Silent Monster.

751
01:05:25,329 --> 01:05:28,159
The power abuser Eun Hwan Gi
helped another power abuser...

752
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,269
regain his good image.
Rose Airlines' Mr. Park.

753
01:05:31,699 --> 01:05:33,400
Birds of a feather flock together.

754
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:35,940
There is something more beyond that.

755
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:39,110
For Congressman Eun's election
within the party,

756
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:43,480
Mr. Park's in-laws have a key vote.

757
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:47,679
Congressman Eun has a great network
in the press and in politics.

758
01:05:48,349 --> 01:05:51,650
He's talented
in dealing with issues.

759
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:54,159
Gosh.

760
01:05:55,989 --> 01:05:58,190
Someone fell to her death
at the company,

761
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:01,559
but he covered it up
and not a single line was published.

762
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:07,670
I'm Mr. Eun Hwan Gi's secretary.

763
01:06:08,070 --> 01:06:12,340
When he was talked about
regarding his abuse of power,

764
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:14,980
they were able to deal with
the crisis and get out of it.

765
01:06:16,409 --> 01:06:19,150
They buried truths
that put them at a disadvantage.

766
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:23,150
Congressman Eun would emphasize
advantageous issues.

767
01:06:24,449 --> 01:06:26,449
The one that executed everything...

768
01:06:27,289 --> 01:06:29,420
was Brain. And also,

769
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,590
Silent Monster.

770
01:06:33,929 --> 01:06:36,530
Reporter Woo, how can you do this
without telling me?

771
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,699
Did you know Congressman Eun
is trying to kick your father out?

772
01:06:40,739 --> 01:06:41,840
I know that.

773
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,469
But you got one thing wrong.

774
01:06:46,139 --> 01:06:49,139
Boss and Silent Monster are...

775
01:06:49,179 --> 01:06:51,050
The truth is relative.

776
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:52,949
I'm sorry.

777
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:55,019
But...

778
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:16,570
Why can't you leave?

779
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:20,170
Exactly what was that about?

780
01:07:31,219 --> 01:07:32,349
Ji Hye...

781
01:07:37,989 --> 01:07:39,690
used to like him.

782
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,400
What?

783
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:44,800
That's why she suffered.

784
01:07:47,739 --> 01:07:51,610
It was because she couldn't
tell him how she felt.

785
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:53,710
Then...

786
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:58,610
how can I...

787
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:02,320
accept him?

788
01:08:04,449 --> 01:08:05,590
I...

789
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:15,900
There is a way out for us.

790
01:08:18,069 --> 01:08:19,170
We can say...

791
01:08:20,569 --> 01:08:22,970
that Woo Il did it out of
excessive loyalty.

792
01:08:24,409 --> 01:08:26,739
- Father.
- He's already gone.

793
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:30,579
We can say that we found out
and fired him in advance.

794
01:08:30,609 --> 01:08:32,010
Please stop it!

795
01:09:04,609 --> 01:09:07,479
(My Shy Boss)

796
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,149
There is only one person
I want to be with.

797
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:13,619
I was always stuck in one spot,
but she made me run.

798
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:15,619
She also ran towards me.

799
01:09:15,659 --> 01:09:18,060
How long are you going
to stay here by yourself?

800
01:09:18,159 --> 01:09:20,560
- I can't sleep anyway.
- Porn?

801
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:21,899
Isn't that sexy?

802
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:24,199
- Go wash up.
- Should I take a shower?

803
01:09:24,229 --> 01:09:26,130
From head to toe?

804
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:29,039
Tell me. What are you unhappy with?
Just go ahead.

805
01:09:29,069 --> 01:09:30,670
Don't see me, or don't ask me.

806
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:32,340
No, just don't be curious.

807
01:09:32,369 --> 01:09:34,340
I'm by myself again. Boss!

808
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:35,739
Let's grant the wish of the winner.

809
01:09:35,779 --> 01:09:38,149
- I got my wish.
- What was your wish?
