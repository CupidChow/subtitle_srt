1
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,750
- Merry Christmas.
- Look, it's Santa Claus.

2
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,079
Thank you.

3
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,120
Sir.

4
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:43,229
Hey, I bought
some bread for everyone.

5
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,270
Take a quick break, everyone.

6
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,099
(Brain)

7
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:16,430
(PR Presentation Competition
for Large-scale Opera)

8
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:18,240
(D-day)

9
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,810
Excuse me...

10
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,509
It's a presentation for
a huge competitive project.

11
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,349
You should at least
go to the last rehearsal...

12
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,379
Does he think he's Elsa
or something?

13
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,579
Finally.

14
00:04:41,089 --> 00:04:42,120
I'm sorry.

15
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,870
Sir, you're here.

16
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,269
- Hello, Sir.
- Hello, Sir.

17
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,339
- The materials are ready.
- Hello.

18
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:06,480
It's as thick as a book. Good work.

19
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,550
Our competitor scouted
a professional planner as a board.

20
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,920
They couldn't have worked well
together on such a tight notice.

21
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:18,290
All PR companies are putting
their necks on this project.

22
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,230
Of course they should
give their all.

23
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:22,930
They're going up against us.

24
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:27,730
All right! Let's start!

25
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,129
(Brain)

26
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,449
It's the biggest thus far.

27
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:45,180
A large-scale opera performance.

28
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:52,389
In just three days, we need
a total of 160,000 audiences.

29
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:58,529
Television advertisements.

30
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,500
Main banners on portal websites.

31
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,029
(Total production cost:
10 million dollars)

32
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,199
Emails and text messages.

33
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,069
We will be using all outlets
for promotional purposes.

34
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,839
(Production cost: 10 million
dollars, Production crew: 1,500)

35
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,209
We will cast top celebrities
with over 10 million followers...

36
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,750
so that we can reach out
fast and effectively...

37
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,279
to younger audiences who are
unfamiliar with operas.

38
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:22,550
It's my favorite opera. It will
become an unforgettable memory.

39
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:24,560
- Come join us.
- Come join us.

40
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,620
- Come.
- Come join us.

41
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,029
We will partner with
the top franchise cafe...

42
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,470
to develop a limited edition
opera-themed menu.

43
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,339
We'll invade into everyone's
daily lives via familiar approaches.

44
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,910
Hot and busy locations like
Gwanghwamun Square, Hongdae streets,

45
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:48,379
and Han River will hold
guerrilla mini concerts.

46
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:51,980
People think operas
are difficult and boring.

47
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:53,850
But our strategy will break
that stereotypical view.

48
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:58,720
Having just one single goal to make
a show successful isn't enough.

49
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,800
We need to draw a bigger picture
that fits this big performance.

50
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,100
I'm CEO of Brain, Kang Woo Il.
Thank you.

51
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,370
Sir?

52
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,399
- Yes?
- Is something bothering you?

53
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,139
Not at all. I'm just excited.

54
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:53,879
We will cast top celebrities
with over 10 million followers.

55
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,810
We will use top stars who has
10 million followers.

56
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:00,920
We will partner with
the top franchise cafe...

57
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,689
to develop a limited edition
opera-themed menu.

58
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:06,360
We will break the hard-to-approach
image of operas...

59
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:09,290
by holding guerrilla concerts
at hot places.

60
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,560
Opera

61
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,870
Opera

62
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,139
Opera

63
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:22,740
Us at YM Marketing always love you.

64
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,279
YM Marketing will always love you.

65
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,250
This has been YM Marketing.

66
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:30,279
- Give him a round of applause.
- Sir!

67
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,750
Sir, we're in trouble.

68
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,450
We just looked at the presentation
of our competitor,

69
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,259
and they have the same concept
as we do.

70
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,909
Hey, is that you, Mr. Kang?

71
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:09,019
Gosh, this is heavy.

72
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,629
Brain?
Please prepare your presentation.

73
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:29,110
- Hurry up.
- What is he doing?

74
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,370
What is the matter?

75
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:34,009
- Mr. Kang must be in shock.
- What is he doing?

76
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,879
Maybe we should have just left.

77
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,980
Just wait.

78
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:40,149
Mr. Kang isn't someone
who gives up easily.

79
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,029
What is this?

80
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,570
I think he's giving up.

81
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,000
No way.

82
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,139
What are you doing?

83
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,370
Are you saying
you don't want to present?

84
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,840
What is he doing?

85
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:12,919
What do you think you're doing?

86
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,750
- Are you joking?
- My goodness.

87
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,190
I have a stubborn friend.

88
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,929
A friend of mine is very stubborn.

89
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:23,029
He knows what he likes.

90
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,259
He watches musicals,
but he never watches operas.

91
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,870
His taste is also very clear.
He never watches operas.

92
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,169
He thinks it's not as interesting
as musicals.

93
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:38,039
However, he saw the advertisement
for this opera on television...

94
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,850
and the banners posted
on portal websites.

95
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:43,909
He even received emails
and text messages.

96
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,820
He saw the advertisement
on television,

97
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,649
he saw banners posted on
portal websites,

98
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,559
and he even received
emails and texts.

99
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,460
On top of that, he's one of the
500,000 likers of a PR posting...

100
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:02,399
uploaded by a top celebrity
with countless followers.

101
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,269
He saw an opera advertisement
on television and websites.

102
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:10,269
Sometimes he got a message or an
email of the opera advertisement.

103
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:14,649
A lot of money was spent to
advertise it in various media.

104
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:17,950
But will he come to watch the show?

105
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,789
No way. He will never come.

106
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,320
No, it never happens.

107
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:26,889
He would only watch a drama or
a film that stars the top celebrity.

108
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,629
Unless that top star is cast
in the opera.

109
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:35,100
- If you order the Turandot set...
- I'm sure other companies...

110
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:38,200
mentioned a strategy
like this already.

111
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,710
This event may help
with the branding,

112
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,279
but it will not...

113
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,279
sell any tickets.

114
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:49,950
A 200 dollar ticket...

115
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,179
is not cheap.

116
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,720
Can you decide to spend
200 dollars on a show...

117
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:00,960
and commit yourself
in fighting through the traffic...

118
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:04,460
and to sit through a few hours
for a show...

119
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:07,029
through just five dollars?

120
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:11,039
Will you be able decide over a cup
of coffee that costs five dollars?

121
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,309
I'm sure you were all thinking about
how to persuade my stubborn friend.

122
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,980
However, this genre called opera...

123
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,750
has been stagnant
for hundreds of years.

124
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,990
You shouldn't expect the public
to suddenly fall in love with it.

125
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:33,820
That's near impossible.
It's very difficult.

126
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:36,429
It will require a long time.

127
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:39,899
Please do not waste your money
on my stubborn friend.

128
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,100
Save that money for someone
who has seen operas before.

129
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:47,610
With a hopeless dream
to change the world,

130
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:51,840
do you plan on spending half
of your PR budget on my friend?

131
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,990
The world cannot change,
nor should you try.

132
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,490
There is no reason to do that.

133
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,720
All we have to do is gather
160,000 people to fill the seats.

134
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,389
Forget those grandiose strategies
and superficial events.

135
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:12,500
Do you see now...

136
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:15,200
on whom and how you should spend...

137
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,139
your marketing expenses?

138
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,570
I'm getting goosebumps.
He's amazing.

139
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,850
I was so worked up
that I ripped out all the pages.

140
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,350
This is all that's left.

141
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,019
He ripped out all the pages.

142
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,620
But...

143
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,490
Brain's solution is in this.

144
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:44,960
Forget about all the pages
on the floor.

145
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:48,230
Just this small amount
of material that I'm holding here...

146
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,299
is the answer we have for you.

147
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:54,509
Only 20 percent of
your marketing budget.

148
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:58,379
Just that 20 percent will be enough.

149
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:03,779
I'm Kang Woo Il from Brain.

150
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,019
Thank you.

151
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,769
He's so clever.

152
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,039
And decisive.

153
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:31,940
And he's charismatic.

154
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,580
You're the best!

155
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,980
Way to go, Mr. Kang.

156
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:43,690
You're as good as I expected,

157
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,259
Mr. Kang.

158
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,519
Thank you.

159
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,789
But I heard a strange rumor.

160
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,399
- Sorry?
- The top floor of your office.

161
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:55,970
There are all kinds of rumors.

162
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,100
What is he like?

163
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,389
He's not a human being.

164
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,389
He's a ghost.

165
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:28,629
(Episode 1:
The Phantom of the Opera)

166
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:47,690
Never look at him in the eye.

167
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,690
If your eyes meet,

168
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:52,990
your heart will freeze,

169
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,360
and he'll see right through you.

170
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,700
Not many people have
actually seen him,

171
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,039
even including his employees.

172
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,039
He's a co-CEO,

173
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,480
but he hides himself like a ghost.

174
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,450
There are all kinds of rumors
about why he stays hidden.

175
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:24,919
Some believe he has
a horrible scar on his face...

176
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:27,590
just like the Phantom of the Opera.

177
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:37,600
But the reality is...

178
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:40,669
not as tragic or beautiful...

179
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:43,610
as the musical.

180
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:46,039
Thanks to his father,

181
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,009
he took over the best
PR agency in the country.

182
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,919
And luckily,
he had a very clever friend.

183
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:57,019
While the unlucky guy slaves away,

184
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,860
the lucky guy counts his money
in his cozy room.

185
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,529
What do you want to say?

186
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,859
You don't want to use
top celebrities' social media page.

187
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,329
You don't like the idea of
special menus...

188
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,099
or guerrilla concerts, either.

189
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,170
If you don't like any of those,
what do you want us to do?

190
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,500
Do you not want to
promote this opera?

191
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,769
Let's not aim too high.

192
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,410
We should. Don't you know
how much this will pay us?

193
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:22,609
Fine. Let's forget about money.

194
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,819
Still, we've come a long way
since we took over the agency.

195
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:26,079
We're upgraded now.

196
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,089
You want to show off. I know.

197
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:32,460
Are you going to preach again
and say...

198
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:34,490
we should ensure internal stability?

199
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:35,930
It's too much
for the employees as well.

200
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:38,299
They already have too many projects.

201
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:41,130
What have you been doing
if you care about them so much?

202
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,670
You're only dismissing
your employees' hard work.

203
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,200
The presentation is
only an hour away.

204
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:56,950
We can't change the world.

205
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,250
What?

206
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,950
And we don't need to.

207
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:10,759
With a hopeless dream to change the
public's prejudice against operas...

208
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,269
Do you plan on spending half
of your PR budget on my friend?

209
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,299
It'd be a better idea...

210
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,240
to spend that money on people
who have watched operas before.

211
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,710
- Those grandiose strategies...
- Forget those...

212
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:26,809
grandiose strategies
and superficial events.

213
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,380
Forget about them.

214
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,009
(Branding events)

215
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,750
Opera-lovers will want to watch it
even without any promotion.

216
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:37,220
It's the biggest opera in history.

217
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:40,019
I'd say there are about
50,000 of them.

218
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,630
In total, we need to attract
an audience of 160,000.

219
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,200
(50,000 opera-lovers)

220
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,099
Let's say you invite 20 people
to an event.

221
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,170
Usually, about 10 people show up
in the end.

222
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,470
Therefore, we'll need to reach
at least 500,000 people.

223
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,670
People who have been to operas
at least once.

224
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,539
We should focus our efforts on
culture lovers.

225
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,349
Focus on these three groups.

226
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,519
Give up the strategies that
make you throw money in the air.

227
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:14,259
Do you now see on whom and how
you should spend...

228
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,190
your marketing expenses?

229
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,930
Look at her.

230
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,529
It's okay.

231
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:26,569
Of course, that's
just another rumor.

232
00:19:27,369 --> 00:19:29,309
There's only one fact.

233
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,839
Act Two is starting.

234
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,480
Let's go.

235
00:19:54,029 --> 00:19:55,170
He's...

236
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,299
wearing a mask.

237
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:00,799
And someone must...

238
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:02,940
take off that mask.

239
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,740
- Good job, everyone
- Good job.

240
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,140
- Thank you.
- Good job.

241
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,380
- What shall we eat?
- What time is the gathering?

242
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,119
- Let's go.
- All right.

243
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,150
Take this much. Like this.

244
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:25,960
Did you hear that?

245
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,089
That was great.

246
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:30,930
I'm getting better and better.

247
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,769
Who are you looking for?

248
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,509
What?

249
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,710
- Who...
- Who's he?

250
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,680
You're not allowed
in the dressing room.

251
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,109
How can we help you?

252
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:55,849
I'm jealous.

253
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,990
- You got flowers from a guy.
- Congratulations!

254
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:26,950
Why isn't he coming?

255
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,519
He's late today.

256
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,029
- Who are you waiting for?
- Mr. Smith.

257
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,759
Mr. Smith?

258
00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:42,000
He's just a perverted stalker.

259
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,240
Didn't I tell you not to
talk badly of Mr. Smith?

260
00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:48,369
- Didn't I?
- Ms. Chae Ro Woon.

261
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:49,769
It's here.

262
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,539
Yes, I'm Chae Ro Woon.

263
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:55,009
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

264
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,910
It's beautiful.

265
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,450
He sends flowers
to all your shows...

266
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,650
without leaving his name or
phone number. It's suspicious.

267
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,519
You play only minor roles.
It's definitely suspicious.

268
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,619
No matter how suspicious it is,
this will be the last gift from him.

269
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,690
Are you really going to quit?

270
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,529
I told you
that I'm going to get a job.

271
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,029
I didn't think you'd pass
the interview.

272
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:13,400
There we go.

273
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,839
Thank you so much
for all of your support.

274
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,970
I could hold out because of you.

275
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,640
That's what I want to say.
We've sweated buckets together.

276
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:27,809
I can't believe you're betraying me.

277
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:30,880
I'm not talking to you.
I'm thanking Mr. Smith.

278
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,250
Cut it out.

279
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:34,349
Why are you quitting anyway?

280
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,549
Why are you being no fun
all of a sudden? Why?

281
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,789
Did you get it
delivered to her again?

282
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:45,029
You just have to say four syllables.
"I am your fan."

283
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,960
I told you to just give her
the flowers in person...

284
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,700
and tell her
that you're a fan of hers.

285
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,970
I don't think I can do it.

286
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,509
I don't know
why I have to do it, either.

287
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,809
You are a fan of hers. Are you not?

288
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,950
When you like someone, it's only
natural to express those emotions.

289
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:10,390
I don't want her to know my face
or my name. An anonymous fan.

290
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:13,220
I'd like to keep
that distance from her.

291
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,660
It sounds like you like her
more than just as a fan.

292
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:17,359
I mean, there are many
famous actresses.

293
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:21,569
Why did you become a fan
of that no-name actress?

294
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:24,230
There must be a story behind it.
You can tell her things like...

295
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:33,710
You always become tight-lipped
when I ask you this question.

296
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,210
What should I do
with you, seriously?

297
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:42,420
Anyway, she certainly holds
the key to your problem.

298
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,019
Since your feelings for her
are so deep,

299
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:47,420
it'll be that much harder for you to
face her. Just remember that.

300
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,430
Go tell her, "I'm your fan."

301
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,230
If you accomplish that mission,

302
00:24:51,259 --> 00:24:54,660
you'll get a confidence boost
in your social interactions.

303
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:55,900
I'm not sure.

304
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,799
You've ridden a bike before, right?

305
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,900
If you work the pedals
vigorously a few times,

306
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,839
the bike just keeps going
on its own without faltering.

307
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:04,309
I don't ride bicycles.

308
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,039
I see. You don't ride bicycles.
Well, then...

309
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:09,849
If that's the case...

310
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:11,779
Take diarrhea as an example.

311
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,619
You've had diarrhea before, right?

312
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,920
Think about the first dollop.

313
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:19,559
Getting that first dollop out is
so hard, but once you get it going,

314
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:23,259
you can empty your bowels so easily.
You know what I mean, right?

315
00:25:23,529 --> 00:25:24,789
I'm a healthy guy.

316
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,960
I know that you know.

317
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,269
We've been doing this
for three years.

318
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:37,569
Let's obtain some results here.

319
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:42,410
Also, until when do we have
to converse like this?

320
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,720
Practice repeatedly.

321
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,890
Practice again and again.

322
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,660
- "I'm your fan."
- I'm your fan.

323
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,359
- "I'm your fan."
- I'm your fan.

324
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,500
I'm your fan.

325
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,039
I'm your fan.

326
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,319
I'm your fan.

327
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:26,619
I'm your fan!

328
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:28,190
I'm your fan.

329
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:30,329
I'm your fan.

330
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,000
I'm your fan!

331
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,269
I'm your fan!

332
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,569
I'm your fan!

333
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,569
- Me?
- Me?

334
00:26:43,609 --> 00:26:44,839
- Me?
- Me?

335
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,009
You said that to me, right?

336
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,619
Excuse me. You said
that you're my fan.

337
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,150
Just try to avoid
unexpected mishaps.

338
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,230
Tell us!

339
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:18,710
The doors are opening.

340
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,180
The doors are closing.

341
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:34,890
Hey, Hwan Gi. You missed the dinner
with our employees again yesterday.

342
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:38,029
You promised that you'd be there.

343
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,900
You should've been there
to give them a pat on the back.

344
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,140
- Good job.
- Great work, everyone.

345
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,109
(Last night at dinner to celebrate
the successful presentation)

346
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,839
- Let's drink.
- Cheers.

347
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:54,640
- Cheers, everyone.
- Thanks for your hard work.

348
00:27:57,349 --> 00:28:00,720
Mr. Kim, you shouldn't eat meat.
Eat this instead.

349
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:03,950
Hello.

350
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,630
Let's be honest.
What did Mr. Eun even do?

351
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,799
Nothing. He didn't do anything.

352
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:22,009
Hey, you're drunk.

353
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:23,970
Tell me. Am I wrong?

354
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:26,339
The company
couldn't have stayed afloat...

355
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,809
and maintained its reputation
after the former CEO retired...

356
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,650
without all of Mr. Kang's hard work.

357
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,319
- Mr. Kang!
- Mr. Kang!

358
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:40,289
- Mr. Kang!
- Mr. Kang!

359
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,660
I'm very flattered,

360
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:44,990
but Mr. Eun is my friend.

361
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I should let you all know
that I'm a bit of a tattletale.

362
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:51,329
- No, we don't believe you.
- Please don't tell him on us.

363
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,799
All right. Okay.

364
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:55,539
So please don't talk
badly about him, okay?

365
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,170
Go easy on him for me.

366
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,880
I'll work harder, everyone.

367
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,180
Let's work hard together!

368
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,549
- Mr. Kang!
- All right.

369
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,619
Mr. Kang, you rock!

370
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:09,920
- Here's to the success of Brain!
- Go, Brain!

371
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,960
I'm sorry. I was too tired.

372
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:15,490
I gave an excuse to the staff.

373
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:18,759
I also told everyone
that the presentation was my idea.

374
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,630
You didn't even come to
any of the meetings.

375
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:25,140
I thought they'd be upset to know
that you changed it all up.

376
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,940
You did the right thing.

377
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:29,009
- No offense.
- None taken.

378
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,119
(Letter of Resignation)

379
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,819
Ms. Kim?

380
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:47,990
I'm so sorry.

381
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:50,829
I can't do this job anymore.

382
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:52,500
Why do you want to leave?

383
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,670
I'll talk to her.
Wait in your office.

384
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,349
I'm not even his secretary.

385
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,089
I'm just a gatekeeper.

386
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,890
No, I'm a living door lock.

387
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:25,400
To be very honest with you,

388
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,460
I can't even breathe when I'm here.

389
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,539
I want to live.

390
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:36,210
What do you mean?

391
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:40,680
Ms. Kim, you've been doing
such a great job so far.

392
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,710
Please hang in there
just a bit longer for me.

393
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:56,190
Go tell her, "I'm your fan."
If you accomplish that mission,

394
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,460
you'll get a confidence boost
in your social interactions.

395
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,670
We've been doing this
for three years.

396
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:08,099
Let's obtain some
results here. Please?

397
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:16,109
I'm your fan.

398
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:24,390
- Hello. Welcome!
- Hello. Welcome!

399
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,259
Sir, we can hold on to your bag.

400
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,759
- Sir, I can hang your jacket.
- I'll bring a gown for you.

401
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:33,130
Sir, you're handsome enough
to be a celebrity.

402
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,200
All right. Let's see.

403
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:40,539
Is there a specific type
of haircut you'd like?

404
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:44,640
It's all right. We'll take
great care of you.

405
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,609
- Sir, the steam is on.
- Sir, the steam is on.

406
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:52,650
Anxiety stems from
fear of the unfamiliar.

407
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:17,140
Get yourself familiarized with it so
that it can come out automatically.

408
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:19,539
I'm your fan.

409
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:22,009
I'm your fan. I'm your fan.

410
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,779
I'm your fan.
I'm a huge fan of yours.

411
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:25,450
I'm your fan.

412
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,920
I'm your fan, a huge fan.

413
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,519
I'm your fan. I'm your fan.
I'm your fan.

414
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:29,589
I'm your fan.

415
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,250
I'm your fan.

416
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,019
I'm your fan.

417
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,390
What do I do?

418
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,799
Just try to avoid
unexpected mishaps.

419
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,700
Are you all right?

420
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,509
Can you come out?

421
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:01,940
Right now? Why now?

422
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:05,450
Are you hurt?

423
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,349
Are you in shock?
Are you a new driver?

424
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:12,019
It's okay. Just come out.

425
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,559
Anxiety stems from
fear of the unfamiliar.

426
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,289
What is this?
Why isn't he coming out?

427
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,699
No. Not now.

428
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:23,670
Get yourself familiarized with it so
that it can come out automatically.

429
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:25,869
It has to be at the perfect moment.

430
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:27,369
I'm perfectly ready.

431
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,010
I practiced so much.

432
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,809
I can't see anything.

433
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,280
- Hello?
- I can do this.

434
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:39,420
I'm your...

435
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:41,019
Don't try to ignore me.

436
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,590
This is 100 percent your fault.

437
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,460
Is he really
just going to sit in there?

438
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,130
What?

439
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,909
What do you think you're doing?

440
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:05,739
You didn't even apologize.

441
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:11,050
Who are you?
Do you think money is everything?

442
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:13,349
Are you looking down on me
because my car is cheap?

443
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:15,349
Hey, come out here.

444
00:35:15,789 --> 00:35:17,789
I must see your face.

445
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,420
Hey. Come out.

446
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,929
- This is driving me crazy.
- You little...

447
00:35:25,699 --> 00:35:27,000
You can hear me, can't you?

448
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,070
You can see me, right?

449
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:31,929
Come out. Hurry up and come out.

450
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,940
Hey!

451
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:37,440
You are really clueless.

452
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,940
I don't need this!

453
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,019
- Oh, no. My goodness.
- Hey.

454
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,019
- Hey, you better come out.
- Gosh.

455
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:53,760
- What do I do?
- Come out.

456
00:35:53,789 --> 00:35:55,860
- Please, please...
- Come out.

457
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,630
Are you leaving?

458
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:05,639
Are you trying to leave? Really?

459
00:36:06,469 --> 00:36:08,539
Hey! Stop right there!

460
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:22,079
Is this the farthest you could go
with that expensive car?

461
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,389
You'll see.

462
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,730
She's driving me crazy. Please...

463
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,920
Where did he disappear to?

464
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:06,590
(Brain)

465
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,960
No way.

466
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,090
(Brain)

467
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:19,739
How can this be? Is he from Brain?

468
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:25,369
He must be one of the higher-ups.

469
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:29,280
I was going to be a good employee
on my first day.

470
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:37,719
He didn't even put up
his phone number?

471
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:41,690
Hey! What are you doing
on top of the CEO's car?

472
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:44,590
Whose car?

473
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,630
The CEO hates it
when people watch him.

474
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,659
Get away from there.

475
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:51,429
Is that CEO...

476
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,039
Really?

477
00:39:31,409 --> 00:39:32,480
Gosh.

478
00:39:33,409 --> 00:39:34,679
What do I do?

479
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:32,429
Chae Ro Woon.

480
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:36,639
Chae Ro Woon?

481
00:40:38,909 --> 00:40:40,710
Is she late...

482
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:43,909
on her first day?

483
00:40:43,949 --> 00:40:45,050
(Chae Ro Woon)

484
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,150
(Dang Yoo Hee)

485
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,750
There is a rule...

486
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:51,619
you must all learn.

487
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,630
No matter what happens,

488
00:41:01,699 --> 00:41:05,230
never ever press the button
on the elevator...

489
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,639
for the top floor.

490
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,909
The moment you step into...

491
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,739
the penthouse by accident...

492
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:51,380
No wonder he's throwing money
on the street.

493
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:00,179
Why...

494
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:03,010
are you naked in your office
in broad daylight?

495
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:05,650
How...

496
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,820
How did you get in here?

497
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:12,190
Did you think you could
just run off like that?

498
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,789
Put on some clothes first.

499
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:22,300
You gave me too much money
for my junk car.

500
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:25,500
You should
calculate things correctly.

501
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,340
Have you covered
all the important parts yet?

502
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:35,480
I'm sorry to intrude
without permission,

503
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:37,449
but it's better than a hit-and-run,
don't you think?

504
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:40,880
I'm an extremely
honest person, you see.

505
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:44,320
Also, I've seen many people
get in trouble later on...

506
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:45,989
after fleeing from a car accident.

507
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:51,659
Are you all covered up now?

508
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:55,630
What?

509
00:45:02,809 --> 00:45:04,610
You've covered up
too much of yourself.

510
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,039
I wanted to see your face.

511
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:14,750
I wondered how rich you were to
throw money on the street like that.

512
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:18,719
It turns out you're a CEO
of a big company.

513
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:34,469
You're Mr. Eun Hwan Gi, right?

514
00:45:36,809 --> 00:45:39,170
You are, aren't you?

515
00:45:39,409 --> 00:45:40,440
No.

516
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,639
Why are you hiding your face?

517
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:44,909
- Gosh, let go.
- Take that off.

518
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:48,150
- Let me see your face.
- Stop it.

519
00:45:53,659 --> 00:45:54,659
Hey.

520
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,019
You little...

521
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,989
Who are you?

522
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:04,800
What are you doing in here?

523
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,599
- I'm...
- I'm sorry, Sir.

524
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,639
Get out of here right now.

525
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,519
Let go of me.

526
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,349
Are you crazy? Come here.

527
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:26,989
Be quiet. Do you have any idea
who he is?

528
00:46:46,909 --> 00:46:48,210
It hurts.

529
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:50,309
Excuse me.

530
00:46:50,949 --> 00:46:52,210
It really hurts.

531
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:53,920
Please let go of me.

532
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:59,920
Where are you from?
A newspaper company? A TV station?

533
00:47:00,219 --> 00:47:02,929
- I said no to interviews.
- I'm not a reporter.

534
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:05,460
Then how did you...

535
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,429
- Why are you here?
- I had a minor car accident.

536
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:13,969
You can talk to your insurance
company. Why did you go up there?

537
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:15,400
Why can't I?

538
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:17,610
That's...

539
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:21,309
Do you have something fishy
you want to cover up?

540
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:29,280
Did you notice anything strange
in there?

541
00:47:30,019 --> 00:47:31,889
Is there something strange in there?

542
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:34,019
You're the one who's been inside.

543
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:35,559
Have you never gone inside before?

544
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,059
You're his secretary.

545
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:39,630
Anyway,

546
00:47:42,929 --> 00:47:44,469
never come back here again.

547
00:47:53,179 --> 00:47:54,579
There must be something going on.

548
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:58,750
What could be going on in there?

549
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:10,929
Why did she come all the way here?

550
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:16,429
Hello, I'm a new member of Brain,

551
00:48:16,469 --> 00:48:17,929
Chae Ro Woon.

552
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,469
- Hello.
- Hello.

553
00:48:19,739 --> 00:48:21,070
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

554
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,670
The moment I saw you

555
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:29,239
I fell in love

556
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,519
You were so beautiful

557
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,989
I couldn't move

558
00:48:38,789 --> 00:48:42,690
That beautiful smile of yours

559
00:48:42,789 --> 00:48:45,329
Fascinated me

560
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:07,679
Fill me with your love

561
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:11,619
I'm out of my battery

562
00:49:12,289 --> 00:49:16,019
My only love

563
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:19,190
You're my battery

564
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:22,360
You're my everything

565
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:26,199
I like you so much

566
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,369
It's her.

567
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,610
As you ordered, I mixed in someone
who'd be the light of the party...

568
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:32,739
regardless of her background,

569
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,739
and she was late on her first day.

570
00:49:36,449 --> 00:49:38,550
Do you think she'll be able to
adjust herself to the organization?

571
00:49:38,579 --> 00:49:41,150
- Chae Ro Woon.
- Chae Ro Woon.

572
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:45,050
- Chae Ro Woon.
- Chae Ro Woon.

573
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,460
I think she's already adjusted.

574
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:52,289
We have to break up

575
00:49:52,329 --> 00:49:54,300
- Thank you.
- Gosh.

576
00:49:56,599 --> 00:49:57,630
It tastes good.

577
00:50:02,269 --> 00:50:03,969
Enjoy. I'll be right back.

578
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:06,409
See you. Do come back.

579
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,380
I heard you used to perform
in musicals.

580
00:50:17,019 --> 00:50:18,050
That's right.

581
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:20,360
Maybe that's why you look familiar.

582
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:21,960
What's your most famous work?

583
00:50:22,659 --> 00:50:26,159
I only played minor roles.
I don't have any famous works.

584
00:50:27,329 --> 00:50:28,630
What made you join Brain?

585
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:31,929
You welcome people
with supporting roles like me.

586
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,369
You also play
a supporting role yourself.

587
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:38,239
I do?

588
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:44,110
I heard that the rich guy in
the penthouse has the leading role.

589
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:49,650
You're just Alfred who
cleans up after Batman, right?

590
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,719
Are you going for a brave character?

591
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:59,130
Are you trying to shoot a romantic
comedy with your boss?

592
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:00,900
I just think we're on the same team.

593
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:03,500
That's why I can say this.

594
00:51:04,329 --> 00:51:05,469
What makes you think so?

595
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:07,639
I'm more like
a film noir type of person.

596
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:11,239
I'm someone who's standing
outside the door just like you.

597
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:14,880
Behind that door are...

598
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:18,179
the rich ones
who have a lot to lose.

599
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:22,480
People like me have to
knock on that door and open it.

600
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:26,690
You never know whether it's a
monster or a prince that's waiting.

601
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:29,960
But I can't afford to be scared
or hesitate.

602
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:32,559
That's the only way I can survive.

603
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:39,099
You're someone who opened
that door on your own.

604
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:42,269
Now, you shine even brighter
than the main character.

605
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,269
I'm wondering if you'll
open that door for me, too.

606
00:51:48,679 --> 00:51:50,949
I just remembered where I saw you.

607
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:54,150
Was it about 10 years ago?

608
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:57,920
I think I saw you in the mirror.

609
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,590
The door is open now.

610
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,219
Did she follow me because
she knows who I am?

611
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:38,329
Did she plan the accident, too?

612
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,099
How silly of me.

613
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:43,429
I'm the one who bumped into her car.

614
00:52:48,269 --> 00:52:50,670
I should try not to overanalyze it.
It was a coincidence.

615
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:54,440
It couldn't have been predicted.
It was simply an accident.

616
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:56,980
There's no way she will show up...

617
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:58,750
in my office again.

618
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,619
- Hello. Good morning.
- Hi.

619
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,489
- Hello, good morning.
- Hello.

620
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:12,260
Hello.

621
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,400
Did you sleep well?

622
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,269
My gosh, thank you.

623
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,940
I have a question.

624
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,610
Has Mr. Eun arrived yet?

625
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:30,510
He rarely leaves his office.

626
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:33,719
He usually just stays in his office
all night.

627
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:35,619
Pardon? Does that mean
you've never seen him?

628
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:38,690
He gets parcels sometimes,
so I've taken them to his office.

629
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:41,159
I see. What kind of stuff were they?

630
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:45,630
They were all wrapped and strapped,
so I couldn't see what they were.

631
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,099
- But...
- But what?

632
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,230
I'm not sure if I should tell you.

633
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:54,869
That's okay.
Just talk to me comfortably.

634
00:53:58,070 --> 00:54:00,309
I haven't told anyone yet.

635
00:54:00,679 --> 00:54:02,880
I'll trust you
and tell you about it.

636
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,309
Okay.

637
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,519
It was a night when
there was a torrential downpour.

638
00:54:48,389 --> 00:54:49,420
A knife?

639
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,829
So you don't clean the penthouse?

640
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:57,630
We're not allowed in there.

641
00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:00,639
Someone has to clean it, though.

642
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,900
Does he not care much
about cleanliness?

643
00:55:03,269 --> 00:55:04,469
It's the opposite.

644
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:06,980
He's too clean and neat.

645
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,309
No matter how well
we clean his office,

646
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:14,679
he has to redo
and reorganize everything himself.

647
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:21,989
He's an obsessive-compulsive
neat freak.

648
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:25,630
Why are you here again?

649
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:27,730
I just want to talk to you
for a while.

650
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,969
Hey, your heels. My goodness.

651
00:55:35,469 --> 00:55:36,469
Gosh.

652
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,679
What do you want? I told you
to never show up here again.

653
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:44,309
I just wanted to give you this.

654
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,420
I didn't get a chance to introduce
myself properly the last time,

655
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:49,280
but I actually work here, too.

656
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,719
Do you think I'll believe that?

657
00:55:52,889 --> 00:55:54,960
I'm a new hire.

658
00:55:54,989 --> 00:55:56,090
(Chae Ro Woon)

659
00:55:56,889 --> 00:55:58,030
Seriously?

660
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:01,559
Here.

661
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:05,829
This soothing herbal tea is great
for stress relief.

662
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,070
- Try it.
- Thank you.

663
00:56:10,539 --> 00:56:11,739
To tell you the truth,

664
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:15,380
I feel as if I'm standing at the
edge of a cliff when I'm here.

665
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:19,610
What are you so scared of?

666
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:24,219
I have no idea...

667
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:28,559
about what goes on inside that room.

668
00:56:29,559 --> 00:56:30,889
So it terrifies me more.

669
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:35,730
Even this morning, I saw him
dragging something into that room.

670
00:56:52,949 --> 00:56:54,349
I have no idea what's inside.

671
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:56,719
Sometimes, it's a huge sack.
I've also seen boxes.

672
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:59,949
He also brought suitcases that
were big enough to fit a person.

673
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:03,559
Do you know what's really scary?

674
00:57:04,389 --> 00:57:08,500
Whatever goes in there
never leaves that room.

675
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:16,170
So he's an unsociable person
with no social skills whatsoever...

676
00:57:16,739 --> 00:57:19,469
on top of being a neat freak.
And that knife...

677
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,610
Is he...

678
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:24,280
a psychopath?

679
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:51,269
To be very honest with you,

680
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:54,269
I can't even breathe when I'm here.

681
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,340
I want to live.

682
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:24,130
Sir... Sir.

683
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:29,969
Lunch...

684
00:59:30,909 --> 00:59:33,139
Yes! It's lunchtime soon.

685
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:35,739
Don't eat lunch yet.
Wait a little bit.

686
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,909
Sure, that's no problem.

687
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:46,650
Even mutts get to eat at mealtimes.

688
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,059
Will she like radish?

689
01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:35,969
Women at her age
must love pasta more than rice.

690
01:00:36,269 --> 01:00:38,969
I went all the way to Dangjin
so early to get radishes in season.

691
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,510
She'll totally love...

692
01:00:40,539 --> 01:00:44,150
the sweet, refreshing taste and
the crunchy texture. Don't worry.

693
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:50,550
Let's see.

694
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:53,690
It's so pretty.

695
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:58,360
But whether a meal
is satisfying or not...

696
01:00:58,389 --> 01:01:00,960
is decided not by what you eat
but by whom you eat with.

697
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:05,670
If I eat with her,
she'll be so uncomfortable.

698
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:09,369
Yes, she won't be able
to digest the food.

699
01:01:10,869 --> 01:01:13,440
She'll regret eating with me
until her indigestion is gone...

700
01:01:13,639 --> 01:01:16,380
which can take over a day.

701
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:32,190
I'm so hungry.

702
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:45,239
Ms. Kim.

703
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:47,110
Yes, Sir.

704
01:01:47,909 --> 01:01:49,710
Have you had lunch yet?

705
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:52,280
No. I actually have no appetite.

706
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:54,320
My stomach is a bit upset.

707
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:58,289
Oh, really?

708
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:01,159
Yes. I really don't have to eat.

709
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,090
All right, then.

710
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,400
I'm starving.

711
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,389
I went all the way to Dangjin...

712
01:02:37,389 --> 01:02:38,789
to buy this radish.

713
01:02:50,039 --> 01:02:51,139
I knew it would taste nice.

714
01:02:56,739 --> 01:02:59,349
What? Did you just say
he made you starve?

715
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:03,920
Not even for a specific reason?
Just so that you can guard the door?

716
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:08,119
Somebody broke into that room
the other day, you know.

717
01:03:08,659 --> 01:03:09,860
He wants me to be glued to my desk.

718
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:13,190
But what's so wrong
with going into his office?

719
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,860
He doesn't even let me look at him.

720
01:03:15,059 --> 01:03:17,730
Sorry? Are you saying you're not
allowed to look at him?

721
01:03:18,269 --> 01:03:20,170
He doesn't like it
when people look at him.

722
01:03:20,469 --> 01:03:23,469
When you're with him,
you have to stare at the floor.

723
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:27,039
My goodness. What a horrible boss.

724
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:29,579
I wouldn't look at him even if
he tells me to. I mean, I can't.

725
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:31,010
He has such scary eyes.

726
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:33,750
Three years ago... Oh, right.

727
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,019
I cannot tell anyone about it.

728
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:41,719
Three years ago?
Did something happen then?

729
01:03:43,889 --> 01:03:45,889
His former secretary...

730
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,869
- Hold on a second.
- Tell me. Come on.

731
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:53,000
Gosh, my stomach.
What's wrong with me?

732
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:56,570
What's the matter?
Is your stomach upset?

733
01:03:57,809 --> 01:03:59,239
It'll go away soon.

734
01:04:02,739 --> 01:04:04,380
It looks like
you're in a lot of pain.

735
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:09,519
- Gosh, my stomach...
- My goodness.

736
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,449
I'll call an ambulance.

737
01:04:13,289 --> 01:04:14,360
Why does it have to turn off now?

738
01:04:15,789 --> 01:04:17,019
My gosh, it hurts so much...

739
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:25,329
Hey, don't. Wait.

740
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,030
Excuse me!

741
01:04:28,039 --> 01:04:29,400
You're in there, right?

742
01:04:30,469 --> 01:04:32,010
Please don't. You can't do that.

743
01:04:32,469 --> 01:04:35,840
Please stop.
He hates the sound of knocking.

744
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,079
That's not important right now.

745
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,949
Excuse me! Please come out!

746
01:04:41,349 --> 01:04:43,849
Can you not hear me?
Please come out and help us!

747
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:45,489
Gosh, my stomach...

748
01:04:46,719 --> 01:04:49,820
Please call 911. Please!

749
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:52,690
She's in so much pain now!

750
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:03,500
My gosh. Look who's here.

751
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:06,510
Thanks so much for coming home.

752
01:05:06,809 --> 01:05:08,340
Has it been about two months?

753
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:14,920
Don't stand there like a stranger.
Come have a seat.

754
01:05:17,949 --> 01:05:19,920
It'd be easier
to talk to a complete stranger.

755
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:24,090
You're over 30 now, yet you're still
so timid even around your parents.

756
01:05:24,989 --> 01:05:26,829
How would your employees feel?

757
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,329
That's why that happened
three years ago...

758
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:31,929
Stop talking
about that cruel incident.

759
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:35,500
Stay behind the scenes
so that people don't gossip.

760
01:05:35,969 --> 01:05:37,940
Live a quiet, trouble-free life.

761
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:41,639
You don't even need to remind him.
That's his specialty.

762
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:44,210
The Seoul mayoral election
is around the corner.

763
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:47,619
Do not get yourself
in any trouble. Got it?

764
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:49,949
Gosh, you embarrass me so much.

765
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:53,190
I can't believe that he's my son.

766
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:56,260
I guess I cheated on you
and had him.

767
01:05:56,460 --> 01:06:00,190
Listen. I'm the one who founded
the first PR agency of Korea...

768
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:03,599
Then you made the agency become
a top-notch industry leader...

769
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:06,030
and enjoyed a very successful
career for 30 years.

770
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:09,300
Your success wouldn't have been
possible without your connections.

771
01:06:09,539 --> 01:06:11,739
We know that you'll achieve
bigger and greater things...

772
01:06:11,769 --> 01:06:15,480
using those
amazing connections that you have.

773
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:17,849
We're fully aware of your plan.

774
01:06:18,409 --> 01:06:20,309
What I'm saying is
that people will think...

775
01:06:20,349 --> 01:06:22,320
People will probably assume
that Kang Woo Il is your son.

776
01:06:22,420 --> 01:06:23,519
For goodness' sake.

777
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:25,989
Hwan Gi, you're home.

778
01:06:28,659 --> 01:06:30,960
I knew you'd be home any day
now. I've been waiting for you.

779
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:49,909
Why do you hate
going to hair salons?

780
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:52,480
I mean, it's filled with young,
pretty girls. They talk to you...

781
01:06:52,679 --> 01:06:54,380
and ask you, "Is this okay?"

782
01:06:54,679 --> 01:06:55,920
It's basically paradise.

783
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:00,250
But I guess
it's like a nightmare to you.

784
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:04,360
I'm sorry to bother you.

785
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:07,659
I think it's good enough.

786
01:07:08,699 --> 01:07:10,230
No, it's not done yet.

787
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,639
Is there anyone you're
attracted to these days?

788
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:20,039
Not really.

789
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:23,179
You've been
seeing that therapist regularly.

790
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:25,880
Didn't you run away to not get
counseling when Dad made you do it?

791
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:28,349
What motivated you
to change your mind?

792
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:29,820
It's a girl, isn't it?

793
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:31,250
No, it's not.

794
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:32,789
Who is she? Is she pretty?

795
01:07:33,389 --> 01:07:34,460
There's no girl.

796
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:36,860
Just a second.

797
01:07:37,489 --> 01:07:38,530
Is it that girl?

798
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:41,500
- It must be her.
- Hello?

799
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:45,929
What do you mean?

800
01:07:48,699 --> 01:07:49,940
How serious is it?

801
01:07:58,409 --> 01:08:02,019
I'll sort it all out so that there's
no problem. Don't worry too much.

802
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,519
All right.

803
01:08:05,219 --> 01:08:07,719
(Quiet, please.)

804
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:27,210
Ji Hye... Ji Hye. No...

805
01:08:28,909 --> 01:08:30,640
What should I do now? Ji Hye...

806
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:32,979
(3 years ago)

807
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:38,649
She died.

808
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:42,390
She jumped off the building. How
can there be no articles about it?

809
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:46,760
They're saying that Ji Hye
suffered from depression.

810
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:48,659
Does that make any sense to you?

811
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:51,399
Dad, I'm going to do it
if you don't.

812
01:08:52,199 --> 01:08:55,270
I'll go there and do something,
even if it's just getting her shoes.

813
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:14,619
Chronic enteritis accompanied by
acid reflux and stomach cramps.

814
01:09:15,090 --> 01:09:18,689
Life is so easy for some when
others are ruining their health.

815
01:09:18,989 --> 01:09:22,060
He goes through secretaries as if
they're disposable commodities.

816
01:09:26,199 --> 01:09:29,699
I guess the same goes
for what happened three years ago.

817
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:32,170
Drink up.

818
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:41,350
What are we waiting for?

819
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:43,819
Let's go ahead and expose it.

820
01:09:46,449 --> 01:09:47,449
Do you really have to do that?

821
01:09:47,489 --> 01:09:49,720
You're the one who told me
about the rumor.

822
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:52,159
I only told you because you were
having a hard time moving on.

823
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:56,229
And you know what?
It's a fact, not a rumor.

824
01:09:57,329 --> 01:09:59,170
He doesn't like it
when people look at him.

825
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:02,239
When you're with him,
you have to stare at the floor.

826
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:08,109
Anyhow, you shouldn't
jump into it recklessly.

827
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:11,409
- Let's see how things go and...
- If we don't do anything,

828
01:10:11,850 --> 01:10:13,479
there will be more victims.

829
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:18,050
I looked into it, and he's not just
a rich guy who's a bit fussy.

830
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:21,619
He's a lot more dangerous
than we thought.

831
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:24,930
A person collapsed
right in front of his door,

832
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:27,159
yet he didn't even blink an eye.

833
01:10:47,949 --> 01:10:51,890
That psychopath killed my sister.

834
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:30,720
I remained as an anonymous fan.

835
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:33,229
It was out of selfishness...

836
01:11:33,659 --> 01:11:36,500
that I've been keeping my distance.

837
01:11:37,970 --> 01:11:39,229
Has he come?

838
01:11:40,569 --> 01:11:42,840
I mean Mr. Smith.

839
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:46,239
He must have no idea that I quit.

840
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:48,510
He must have sent flowers again.

841
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:51,279
Make sure you keep the flowers.

842
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:58,949
While trying to comfort her,

843
01:11:59,819 --> 01:12:02,460
I was the one who
ended up receiving comfort.

844
01:12:04,789 --> 01:12:07,590
Mr. Smith will be shocked, right?

845
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:11,899
He'll worry about me.

846
01:12:12,130 --> 01:12:13,430
What if he gets hurt?

847
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:15,500
He'll think I turned him down.

848
01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:18,170
That's not okay. No, it's not.

849
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:19,670
That shouldn't happen.

850
01:12:21,039 --> 01:12:22,479
This is the last time.

851
01:12:24,609 --> 01:12:26,350
- Taxi.
- What are you doing?

852
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,119
- Hey.
- Go home.

853
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:30,949
There's someone I must meet.

854
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:32,449
Ro Woon.

855
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:48,369
This is the last time.

856
01:12:49,569 --> 01:12:51,140
For one last time...

857
01:13:14,699 --> 01:13:17,260
For one last time,
I'll deliver it...

858
01:13:18,329 --> 01:13:19,569
myself.

859
01:13:21,399 --> 01:13:22,640
Where's Chae Ro Woon?

860
01:13:24,539 --> 01:13:26,140
She quit.

861
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:28,140
- Why?
- She found a job.

862
01:13:28,939 --> 01:13:32,109
Tell the guy
who sent those flowers...

863
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:35,119
that his perverted stalking
must end now, too.

864
01:13:36,649 --> 01:13:37,680
Who's he?

865
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:39,220
Please move. We're taking pictures.

866
01:13:39,619 --> 01:13:41,859
- He's getting in the way.
- Who's he?

867
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:43,520
- Get out.
- What's he doing here?

868
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,130
Let's take one all together.

869
01:13:47,529 --> 01:13:49,829
- Gosh.
- What is he doing?

870
01:13:50,329 --> 01:13:53,000
Leave it. We'll do it.

871
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,939
I should have mustered up
my courage earlier.

872
01:13:59,069 --> 01:14:01,779
I hesitated for too long
and lost my chance.

873
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:04,210
Where is she now?

874
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:07,510
Why did she quit all of a sudden?

875
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:30,369
- My goodness.
- What about Mr. Smith?

876
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:31,810
You reek of alcohol.

877
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:34,069
Why are you here?
Did you get fired already?

878
01:14:34,609 --> 01:14:37,079
I did see this coming.

879
01:14:37,479 --> 01:14:39,380
Did Mr. Smith come here or not?

880
01:14:39,779 --> 01:14:41,779
He just left. Didn't you see him?

881
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:47,319
Ro Woon!

882
01:14:58,630 --> 01:14:59,699
Are you Mr. Smith?

883
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:06,670
I'm Chae Ro Woon.

884
01:15:09,710 --> 01:15:11,279
(We thank many shy bosses
who helped this show.)

885
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:12,909
(Please excuse us for not being
able to reveal their names...)

886
01:15:12,949 --> 01:15:14,409
(due to their
introverted personalities.)

887
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,649
(We thank all the actors
who made special appearances.)

888
01:15:43,779 --> 01:15:46,479
(My Shy Boss)

889
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:48,979
I told her.

890
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:50,779
I finally told her.

891
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:53,649
We're starting a venture
in the company.

892
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:56,119
You'll take charge of the team.

893
01:15:56,189 --> 01:15:58,359
In a horizontal environment,
Mr. Eun will be a leader...

894
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:59,930
who actively communicates
with the team members.

895
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:01,859
I have social phobia,

896
01:16:01,899 --> 01:16:03,359
and I'm socially maladjusted.

897
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,069
Who would want to
go to that field of death?

898
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:07,170
Me.

899
01:16:07,569 --> 01:16:09,000
It sounds fun to me.

900
01:16:10,069 --> 01:16:11,069
Mr. Eun.

901
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:13,140
The CEO of Brain is the most
searched name on the web right now.

902
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:15,979
Keep your mouth shut
if you want to know.

903
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:18,250
It's an article about Mr. Eun's son.
He abused his power?

904
01:16:18,279 --> 01:16:20,880
It's him. Did you really
treat your secretary cruelly?

905
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:22,380
I'll apologize in person.

906
01:16:22,420 --> 01:16:24,579
They might bring up the incident
that happened three years ago.

907
01:16:24,649 --> 01:16:26,050
Can you be honest about that, too?

908
01:16:26,119 --> 01:16:27,689
Can you really stand
before all those people?
