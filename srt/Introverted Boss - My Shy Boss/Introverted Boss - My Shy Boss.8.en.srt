1
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,549
I guess Panda isn't here yet.

2
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,420
What brings you here?

3
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,019
I missed someone.

4
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:57,560
I jumped on the plane on impulse.

5
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,290
And you came all the way here?

6
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,530
This far?

7
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,569
This was the only way
I could see her.

8
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,129
I wanted to see her.

9
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,469
Where's the director?

10
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,379
The director?

11
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:30,719
Did you think I was talking about...

12
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:33,189
No, no. Not at all.

13
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,360
You were part of the reason.

14
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,569
I thought I should come because
I got worried after you called me.

15
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:45,300
I shouldn't have said it.

16
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,210
Ro Woon.

17
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:51,580
All right, let's go.

18
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,879
I'll take you to her.

19
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:56,449
She'll be so happy to see you.

20
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,620
Come on.

21
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:39,789
Should we go?

22
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,969
Why are you crying?
Is he a bad person?

23
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:53,139
What?

24
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:55,969
No, he's not a bad person.

25
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:59,240
Then is it because he's not
the man in black?

26
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:04,479
You've been waiting for
the man in black the whole time,

27
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,379
and someone else came. Is that why?

28
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,219
That's not it, either.

29
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,360
There he is.

30
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:27,939
You're smiling now.

31
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,350
I missed you.

32
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,399
Did you miss him?

33
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,370
Panda!

34
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,879
Not just once, but twice?

35
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,259
You should have said something.

36
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:20,360
You disappeared without a word
and got us flustered.

37
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,790
You could have asked us for help.

38
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,170
Did you see the pictures?

39
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:29,699
I can totally picture you
wandering all over the place...

40
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,899
not being able to
ask others for help.

41
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:34,870
That must be why it took so long.

42
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:36,839
I'm so frustrated by you.

43
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,250
I'm sorry I made you wait.

44
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:46,579
Well, I didn't exactly wait for you.

45
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:48,149
She did.

46
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:51,290
She's been waiting for
the man in black to come...

47
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,629
the whole time.

48
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:03,129
That's just...

49
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:08,470
because of the last picture.

50
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,480
So many people are
waiting for more pictures.

51
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:15,949
Let's take one.

52
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,350
It's a beautifully happy ending.

53
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,889
All right. Let me take a picture.

54
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:28,560
Here we go.

55
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,699
One, two, three.

56
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,029
One more.

57
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:38,170
- One, two, three.
- You look so pretty.

58
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,600
Smile.

59
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,139
(I missed you, Si Yeon.
Sorry for keeping you waiting.)

60
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,839
(Battery low)

61
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,379
Battery. Gosh.

62
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,350
I have it.

63
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,949
- Is it okay now?
- Yes.

64
00:06:58,889 --> 00:06:59,920
What should we do?

65
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:02,629
I wasn't planning to come,
so I'll have to stay with you.

66
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:08,269
By the way,
this is not even a twin room.

67
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,639
Are we really going to
share the bed?

68
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,170
Should we ask for an extra bed?

69
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,240
Or should I sleep on the sofa?

70
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,610
That felt weird.

71
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,490
Could it be because you don't
usually react this way?

72
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,990
Hey. Don't say anything.

73
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:34,560
Fine, I won't.

74
00:07:37,329 --> 00:07:39,360
But I want to. Can't I?

75
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,500
Hey, go away. It's disgusting.
What's with you?

76
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,470
Fine, I won't do anything.

77
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,899
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

78
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,779
Let me just hold your hand, Hwan Gi.

79
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,149
Hey! Gosh.

80
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,420
When are you going back?

81
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,819
I just came. Why do you ask me that?

82
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:04,589
You were the one who told
me to come.

83
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,889
Thank you for asking me to come.

84
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,360
She hasn't changed a bit.

85
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,500
Except for the wrinkles
around her eyes...

86
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:16,870
and a bit of gray hair.

87
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:24,610
Your present.

88
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,209
I really appreciate it, Hwan Gi.

89
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,850
Woo Il, I need to talk to you.

90
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:37,149
(Report on Rose Airlines Project)

91
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,529
I offered to talk to Mr. Park
of Rose Airlines...

92
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,899
because Father made me to.

93
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:53,870
He needs Mr. Park's in-laws' help
for the primary election.

94
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:56,940
He wanted me to butter him up.

95
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,879
About yesterday...

96
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:06,080
- I yelled at you...
- It's okay.

97
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,889
I've been your sidekick
for 20 years now.

98
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:16,659
The problem is, I've been
ignoring her for those 20 years.

99
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,629
How will I face her now?

100
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,799
If only I could,

101
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,509
I'd go back to 20 years ago.

102
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,279
Or at least to three years ago.

103
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:39,519
Would that allow you and me...

104
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,320
to go back to how we were?

105
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,299
(I missed you, Si Yeon.
Sorry for keeping you waiting.)

106
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,009
- Are you okay?
- Nice.

107
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,909
There you go. Good job.

108
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,019
- Si Yeon looks happy.
- She does.

109
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,120
Hey.

110
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,960
When are you leaving?

111
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,059
Let me take some more rest.

112
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,269
Hey, please take a picture of
me and the director.

113
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,039
Ma'am.

114
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,580
Guys, look at the camera.

115
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,580
Look at the camera.

116
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,750
Here we go.

117
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:50,720
One, two, three.

118
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,559
- Like this?
- Let's take one more.

119
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,830
One more?

120
00:10:55,429 --> 00:10:57,759
One, two, three.

121
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,899
One more.

122
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,500
Just one more.

123
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:05,500
Very good.

124
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,029
By the way, why did Mr. Kang come?

125
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,759
Oh, that? When Boss disappeared,

126
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,799
I told Mr. Kang.

127
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:35,669
He must have been worried.

128
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,669
Did he come all the way here
just because you called?

129
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,039
Could he...

130
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:51,779
Woo Il, when are you leaving?

131
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,320
Hey, as you can see,
not anytime soon.

132
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,460
Why does Boss want Mr. Kang
to leave so desperately?

133
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:03,230
He must be jealous.

134
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:19,610
Everyone, here we go.

135
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,370
When are you leaving?
When are you leaving?

136
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,669
When are you leaving?

137
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:46,799
When are you leaving?

138
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,039
When are you going back?

139
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,809
When are you leaving?

140
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,279
When are you leaving?

141
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:53,139
When are you going back?

142
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,960
Everybody, great job.

143
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:14,429
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

144
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,970
Great work.

145
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,539
What a great team.
We're so talented.

146
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,070
- Everything we do is a hit.
- Exactly.

147
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:23,070
Sun Bong, you were really good.

148
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,809
Boss, I was surprised.

149
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,480
How did you come up with the idea?

150
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,549
He's our boss after all.

151
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:33,080
I know that.

152
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,100
All right.

153
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,529
Let's give Mr. Eun
a round of applause.

154
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,440
Mr. Eun, you're a genius.

155
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:55,840
No, I'm not...

156
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,509
Take this off.

157
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:00,440
You're frowning
as if you're mad again.

158
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,279
Boss, you should smile
at a time like this.

159
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:04,320
- Smile.
- Smile.

160
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:06,450
Smile, smile.

161
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:07,850
Smile.

162
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,889
He's upset.

163
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:20,029
Great work, everyone.

164
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:23,330
It must have been tiring
to babysit for the last three days.

165
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:25,370
Before we head to Seoul tomorrow,

166
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,740
you will get free time.

167
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:28,710
Really?

168
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,639
Our team was able to avoid...

169
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,610
getting disbanded thanks to Boss.

170
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:34,779
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

171
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:38,720
However, it was just a start
on the rocky road.

172
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,899
Mr. Eun, you're a genius.

173
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:14,549
I want to see Boss smile.

174
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,990
Not anyone can see it.

175
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,490
Does he even know how?

176
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:22,159
Have you ever seen him
smile with his mouth open?

177
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,730
Of course.

178
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:26,200
Although, not recently.

179
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:32,000
Boss! What are you doing there?

180
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,440
Come here.

181
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,509
Gosh, why are you running away?

182
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:42,009
Just let him be.

183
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:43,610
Gosh.

184
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,690
Did you two...

185
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,820
have a fight?

186
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,159
No.

187
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:59,299
Hwan Gi needs space.

188
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,830
Especially if he looks like
he has a lot on his mind,

189
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:05,200
you need to give him
enough time and space to think.

190
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,870
Then after a while,

191
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:10,440
Hwan Gi will approach you first...

192
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,110
like a sneaky cat.

193
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:16,080
A cat?

194
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,220
That's true.

195
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:23,289
He sneaks around just like a cat.

196
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:24,960
You said you want to see him smile,
right?

197
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,759
Then keep your distance
and give him some time.

198
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,059
It must be hard for a puppy
that wags its tail...

199
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,429
at everyone.

200
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:35,769
Are you talking about me?

201
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:36,970
Well,

202
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:39,169
you only talk about Hwan Gi.

203
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,710
By the way, don't you
have to go back to the office?

204
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,679
Boss looked worried.

205
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,250
It's been a while
since I took a vacation.

206
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,019
This is so nice.

207
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,320
Did you know?

208
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,230
Even when we're on a trip,

209
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:04,500
Boss is wearing that black outfit
for three days in a row.

210
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,769
Won't he get rashes?
Is that his second skin?

211
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,430
Did that outfit
get installed on him?

212
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,470
No matter the weather
and where he is,

213
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,640
he has that black hood on.
Isn't he hot?

214
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:25,220
(Episode 8: Unsocial Sociability,
Immanuel Kant)

215
00:17:34,259 --> 00:17:35,490
It's so nice.

216
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:38,230
Shall we just jump in?

217
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:39,400
This is paradise.

218
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,529
I didn't even know
there was a pool here.

219
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:50,809
There you are.

220
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,619
Hwan Gi needs space.

221
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,019
Does he want to be alone?

222
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:08,059
Gosh, aren't you hot?

223
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:09,789
Do you want a drink?

224
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:13,730
- Let's go.
- Are you feeling sick?

225
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,869
- We can play on our own.
- You'll get a rash.

226
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:18,400
"On our own"?

227
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:33,180
Aren't you the grandson of
Mr. Kwon, the chairman of KJ Food?

228
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,789
Are you not?

229
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,990
He was already out of my reach,

230
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,059
but now it's impossible.

231
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:48,130
Go again.

232
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:53,900
It's hot. I'm a human, too.

233
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,839
When I get hot, I sweat.

234
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:57,269
When I sweat, it feels unpleasant.

235
00:18:57,309 --> 00:18:59,279
I want to throw away
the sweaty clothes.

236
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,579
I also want to jump into the water.

237
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,079
I know how to swim, too.

238
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,680
Should I just take it off?

239
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:08,420
Can I?

240
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:11,720
This isn't the office. It's a pool.
There's nothing wrong with it.

241
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,660
How can I go into the pool
looking natural?

242
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:17,059
I hope I don't spoil the fun
by joining in.

243
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:22,069
How can I look natural
without attracting attention?

244
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,740
Hold on, hold on.

245
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,940
Let's put Boss in the water.

246
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,440
Okay, I'm in.

247
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,140
That's it.

248
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,150
Yes. Come on.

249
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,480
- Don't do this. I'm okay.
- Let's go.

250
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:39,880
- Let's take off your shoes.
- I'm okay.

251
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,519
- Wait.
- Let's go.

252
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,789
- Come in.
- I'm okay, really.

253
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:46,690
One, two, three.

254
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,599
Don't. Stop it.

255
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,339
Hold on, hold on.
Let's put Boss in the water.

256
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:10,680
- Yes.
- No, Se Jong. No.

257
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:12,950
- Se Jong. Se Jong.
- Come on.

258
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:14,319
- Don't go.
- What is this?

259
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,819
- Why not?
- Do not play pranks on Boss.

260
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,619
Don't cross over the line
and go away.

261
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,289
Mr. Kang said
it's our day off today.

262
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,559
That means we're just friends today.

263
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:28,329
Let's take this hideous thing off.

264
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:31,230
Don't do this. I'm okay.

265
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:34,269
See? He doesn't like it.

266
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:40,109
How was it before?

267
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,900
He's such a cat.

268
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:06,700
I'll just wait.

269
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,869
If I approach him, he'll run away.

270
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:11,039
He'll come to me if I wait.

271
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,710
I must wait.

272
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,019
(Yi Soo)

273
00:21:59,589 --> 00:22:01,289
- Yes?
- Congratulations.

274
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:05,559
Silent Monster is finally
making a stand, isn't it?

275
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,130
Mr. Park from Rose Airlines
seems very pleased.

276
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,400
By the way,

277
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,410
is he with you?

278
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,710
- Who? Woo Il?
- Is he next to you?

279
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,549
Did he not tell you
he was coming here?

280
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,519
He did. Of course he did.

281
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:30,220
I just wanted to talk with him.

282
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,460
Why?

283
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,420
Is he not answering your calls?

284
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,859
Come on, don't overreact.

285
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:39,200
I thought I'd talk to him since I...

286
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,430
Forget it.
You don't have to put him on.

287
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,839
Yi Soo, tell me. What happened?

288
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:50,710
Actually...

289
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:55,180
Mom and Dad did something
to upset Woo Il.

290
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,509
You know,

291
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:00,220
they don't accept him as family,

292
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:03,119
but they expect more than
what a family can give in return.

293
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,160
Don't act like you know, okay?

294
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,960
Don't ask him anything,

295
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,500
and don't show him
you know anything.

296
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,970
He hasn't been away like that
for a long time.

297
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:18,170
Just let him
forget everything and rest.

298
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,369
I hope he can get
a load off of his chest...

299
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:26,839
so that he can come back
to where he should be.

300
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,650
- Yi Soo.
- Everything is fine here.

301
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,849
Dad is also in a great mood...

302
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,420
because he has something
to brag about at the exhibition.

303
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:39,589
Mr. Park's wife is a painter,
and her solo exhibition opens today.

304
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,690
I have to make
a flower arrangement for her.

305
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,359
I have to go.

306
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,420
Don't go.

307
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,960
(Chae Ro Woon)

308
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,410
- In 1, 2, 3, 4.
- 4.

309
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,109
I can't do it
because of my belly rolls.

310
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,039
You're just not strong enough.

311
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,680
- Whatever.
- When did you learn how to dance?

312
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,009
Yi Soo, do you need more time?

313
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,349
It's done. I'm coming now.

314
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:47,859
Ta-da! What do you think? I made it.

315
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,559
- Oh, my. It's beautiful.
- It's gorgeous.

316
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,730
But you're prettier.

317
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:56,099
It's because I'm your daughter.

318
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,299
Yi Soo, how do I look?

319
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,900
Let's get going.

320
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,170
Honey! What about me?

321
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,809
I'm dressed to the nines, too.

322
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,630
Especially if he looks like
he has a lot on his mind,

323
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,569
you need to give him
enough space and time to think.

324
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,079
Okay.

325
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:48,180
If I get closer to him,
he'll run away.

326
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:53,160
If I wait, he'll approach me first.

327
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,630
If I wait, he'll approach me first.

328
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,670
(Yi Soo)

329
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,839
Woo Il, I'm sorry you had to go
all the way to Malaysia.

330
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,980
You had to go that far
just to appease Mr. Park.

331
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,710
Thanks so much for not giving up
on the project.

332
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,210
I love you, Woo Il.

333
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,119
All right, it's done.

334
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,130
- It's a princess.
- She's not a princess.

335
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,500
She doesn't look like a princess.

336
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:37,869
She's just covered
in ashes right now.

337
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,839
Give her some colors.
Transform her with your magic touch.

338
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,039
Okay.

339
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,210
Good.

340
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:54,319
You remind me
of someone I used to know...

341
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,250
even though you two
aren't really similar.

342
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,619
What was that person like?

343
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:05,400
I want a drawing, too.

344
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:07,660
You're making fun of me, right?

345
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:13,670
By the way, how much longer
do I have to wait?

346
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:17,839
I'm talking about Boss. He hasn't
even stepped out of his room.

347
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,609
Why do you keep
talking to me about him?

348
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:23,809
- Do you like him?
- Pardon?

349
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,650
My gosh, of course not.

350
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:30,990
I'm just frustrated by having
to keep distance and wait.

351
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:34,960
Why?

352
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,490
Should I not talk about him?

353
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,700
Are you two having problems?

354
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,640
(Hwan Gi)

355
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:51,509
Well, things might
get a little awkward.

356
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,480
Make me a drawing.

357
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,579
You know that I'm bad at drawing.

358
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:16,099
The number you have dialed
is not available...

359
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,180
Do you want to give him some mango?

360
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,279
Go get it.

361
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:31,410
Mango?

362
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,119
He must like mango.

363
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:36,849
It looks like he's enjoying it.

364
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:39,720
I'm scared.

365
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,390
Don't monkeys scare you?

366
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,859
As long as I don't make eye contact,
I'm fine.

367
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,529
I heard looking at them in the eye
can get you in huge trouble.

368
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:50,700
They'll want to fight.

369
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:53,470
Panda, be careful.

370
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,269
You're just like someone I know.

371
00:28:57,309 --> 00:28:58,410
Who?

372
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,380
Just someone.

373
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,279
A monkey who is like a cat.

374
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:06,480
- Let's go, Si Yeon.
- I'll see you later.

375
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:08,519
- Say bye.
- Have fun.

376
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:21,400
The cat?

377
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:26,299
Is he finally approaching me?

378
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:32,009
- Have you two not sorted it out?
- Pardon?

379
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,440
What did you do with him
on Christmas Eve?

380
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,109
What do you mean...

381
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,309
Answer me. What happened
between you and Woo Il?

382
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,759
I can't believe I waited
all this time just to hear that.

383
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,059
"Just"?

384
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,059
Christmas?

385
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:55,700
That was so long ago. You've been
bottling it up all this time?

386
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:59,240
I've never seen anyone
who holds grudges like you do.

387
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,369
Grudges?

388
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,539
I clearly told you
that nothing happened.

389
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,579
You've been pretending not to know
anything when you obviously knew.

390
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,849
Is that why you spied on me and
glared at the back of my head?

391
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:13,519
Are you getting mad at me right now?

392
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:16,690
Whatever you're worrying about
did not happen.

393
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:21,259
When he called me...

394
00:30:22,589 --> 00:30:26,599
To be honest, I wondered what it was
about for a brief moment.

395
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,269
You know, the kind of hope
you shouldn't have.

396
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,829
I'd be lying if I say
it didn't occur to me at all.

397
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:35,440
But I'm embarrassed I had such
hope even for a very brief moment...

398
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:39,210
because Mr. Kang sorted it all out.

399
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,509
It's done.

400
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,210
Brutally rejected.
Confirmed and verified!

401
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,519
Are we good now?

402
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,960
I can't do this anymore.

403
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,130
I can't go on like this because
I don't want to become all grouchy.

404
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:11,109
Why are you just standing there?
Come with me.

405
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,079
Why did you bring me here? Why...

406
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,950
Mr. Kang, it's me.

407
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,250
Please come to the beach.

408
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,890
Just come and you'll find out.

409
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,759
Please hurry up.

410
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,059
Okay.

411
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,089
What was that about?

412
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,430
I thought you two were
strangely awkward around each other.

413
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,900
I just realized that it was because
of a silly misunderstanding.

414
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:48,180
I figured the two of you
might need a little chat.

415
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,750
Give me back my camera.

416
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,089
Come on. There we go.
I'll hold onto this.

417
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:00,190
- Give me back the camera at least.
- You might drop it in the water.

418
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,630
- I'll hold onto it.
- Still...

419
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:05,259
Shall we go ride it
until Mr. Kang comes?

420
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:08,160
The two of us?

421
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,829
You don't want to?

422
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:11,799
That's not what I meant.

423
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:13,869
If that's the case...

424
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,750
All right.

425
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:32,519
Don't forget to give me back
my camera. You have to give it back.

426
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:50,109
Have a great time!

427
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,140
Look at the camera.

428
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:08,289
Help!

429
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,190
I need help!

430
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,470
Gyo Ri, take your hands
off the thing.

431
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:17,269
Just hold the ropes.

432
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,000
It's too scary.

433
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:24,670
Just hold the ropes.

434
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,440
Why is she up there? What happened?

435
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,309
Ro Woon, who have you been with?

436
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:32,279
- What?
- What's that in your hand?

437
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:34,079
Isn't that Boss's?

438
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:36,619
- Gosh, I took it with me.
- What is this?

439
00:33:37,589 --> 00:33:38,859
Do you like him?

440
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:41,490
What are you talking about?

441
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,160
I'm Jang Se Jong.

442
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:45,329
I know everything about you.

443
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,230
You definitely like Boss.

444
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,730
Even if you don't yet,

445
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,069
you'll go head over heels soon.
I'm sure of it.

446
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,440
Gyo Ri, are you okay?

447
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,579
- Hey, go bring some water.
- Okay.

448
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,190
Why did you rock-climb
all of a sudden?

449
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,159
- It's because of you.
- Me?

450
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,829
I made it.

451
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,469
Amazing.

452
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:41,449
Yoo Hee, you're amazing.

453
00:34:41,619 --> 00:34:42,889
How did you go up so high?

454
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:44,650
Moms are strong.

455
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:47,519
- Moms are strong.
- Moms are strong.

456
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:50,460
You're the worst.

457
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:54,800
Wait, what?

458
00:34:57,699 --> 00:34:58,670
Where's Gyo Ri?

459
00:34:58,699 --> 00:35:02,440
Hey, did you make Gyo Ri rock-climb?

460
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:03,610
No.

461
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:08,239
I just said you'd probably be
very good at rock climbing...

462
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:12,150
and it'd make me like you even more.

463
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,519
- What should I talk about?
- What should I talk about?

464
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:23,989
- What should I say?
- What should I say?

465
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:27,329
- What should I talk about?
- What should I talk about?

466
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:31,369
- What should I say?
- What should I say?

467
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:36,710
- What should I talk about?
- What should I talk about?

468
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:39,610
Right, that'll do.

469
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,739
All guys' common interest.

470
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,550
I'm quite good at rowing, aren't I?

471
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,889
I served in the navy.

472
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,860
Just like Admiral Yi Sun Shin.

473
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:03,730
I think you're rowing
in the wrong direction.

474
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,170
Wait.

475
00:36:11,639 --> 00:36:13,340
- I see.
- Can I try?

476
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,480
Turn back.

477
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,880
Be careful.

478
00:36:42,309 --> 00:36:45,170
Gosh, let go. Let go of me.

479
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:55,789
- Help!
- It's okay now.

480
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:58,019
You're okay now.

481
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:07,730
You said you served in the navy.

482
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:10,730
I worked at the PX.

483
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,699
What about you?

484
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,269
In the army,
you have to live in a group.

485
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,710
Were you exempted from military
service thanks to your father?

486
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,239
Counter-terrorism unit.

487
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,150
Do you mean
you served in the special forces?

488
00:37:29,019 --> 00:37:31,619
- Did you work at the PX, too?
- I was a sniper.

489
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,820
You were a sniper? Really?

490
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:44,699
It's better to be facing
the same direction.

491
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,969
It sure feels much better.

492
00:37:50,909 --> 00:37:52,309
Private Um Sun Bong.

493
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,780
Let's go. Start from the right side.
One.

494
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,710
- One. Right side first.
- Right side?

495
00:37:57,809 --> 00:37:58,880
Mr. Um.

496
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:01,449
Right side first.

497
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,849
One, two.

498
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:07,119
One, two. That's wrong. Start over.

499
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,489
One, two.

500
00:38:10,429 --> 00:38:11,789
Right side first. One.

501
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,840
I looked everywhere for you.

502
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,610
Gosh, it's hot.

503
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,909
I'm sorry I took it out on you.

504
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,909
I'm sorry, too.

505
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:33,880
I should have noticed
how you were feeling sooner.

506
00:38:37,889 --> 00:38:39,920
Why did you find it out,
of all people?

507
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:44,059
Please don't tell Se Jong.

508
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:45,960
I don't want him to know.

509
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,300
I'm not going to say anything.

510
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:52,329
You tell him.

511
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,769
Stop keeping it to yourself.

512
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:01,909
Don't get startled.
Just don't look them in the eye.

513
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:06,750
Am I...

514
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,849
not allowed to even
look monkeys in the eye?

515
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:12,460
- Well...
- When I was a secretary,

516
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:15,489
I had to keep my head down
to avoid Boss's eyes.

517
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:16,960
Well...

518
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:22,000
When I can't even
look monkeys in the eye,

519
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,199
how could I look
a chairman's grandson in the eye?

520
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,269
I can't.

521
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,980
I can't look him in the eye.

522
00:39:36,449 --> 00:39:38,980
Why are you crying?

523
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:44,750
By the way,

524
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,019
isn't that your bag?

525
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,199
Wait, where's my bag?

526
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,730
The monkey just took it.

527
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,170
Let me go with you.

528
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:02,610
Just hold on to this.

529
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:10,949
Ro Woon lost her bag because of me.

530
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,380
I'm of no help to anyone.

531
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:31,630
- It was fun.
- I enjoyed it very much.

532
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:16,250
Hwan Gi.

533
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,719
- Where have you been?
- I took some rest.

534
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,389
By the way, have you seen Ms. Chae?

535
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:44,440
Ms. Kim.

536
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,610
Ms. Chae had that jacket.

537
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:52,980
Is... Is this yours?

538
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:56,320
Why is it in my hands?

539
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,050
Where's Ms. Chae now?

540
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:02,460
A monkey took her bag.
She went to get it back.

541
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:03,860
- When?
- Where did she go?

542
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:05,690
That way.

543
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,929
It's been a while.

544
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:23,909
- Why are you following me?
- I'm not.

545
00:42:23,949 --> 00:42:26,219
- I'm going to find Ro Woon.
- Why are you looking for her?

546
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,519
She was looking for me earlier.
She told me it was urgent.

547
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:29,690
It's nothing important.

548
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,389
Why are you looking for her?

549
00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:33,789
You even look pale.

550
00:42:33,989 --> 00:42:36,590
I'm not looking for her.
My camera...

551
00:42:37,059 --> 00:42:39,860
is in that bag.
You can go on your way.

552
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,900
Go.

553
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,650
- I'll help you look.
- I don't need your help.

554
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:02,219
The sun will go down soon.
I'm worried.

555
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:03,250
There is no need to worry.

556
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,289
- She's our staff.
- She's my staff.

557
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,159
- I hired her.
- Don't be immature.

558
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,659
If she's lost and hurt,

559
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,800
you better not act emotional.

560
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:15,900
You're the one acting emotional.

561
00:43:17,969 --> 00:43:19,840
Do you want to get physical then?

562
00:43:21,139 --> 00:43:22,440
- Hey!
- What?

563
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,070
You just stepped on my foot.

564
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:26,980
I'm sorry.

565
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,980
- I stepped on it on purpose.
- Are you serious?

566
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:31,650
How long has it been...

567
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:33,179
since we got so friendly?

568
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:36,789
I saw you rush over after
getting Ro Woon's call.

569
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,090
Why didn't you answer my call?

570
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:40,489
You sound like you're jealous
of her.

571
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:42,159
Tell me, why didn't you pick up?

572
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:44,590
Because it's obvious
you'd tell me to leave!

573
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,500
- Hey!
- What?

574
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:51,130
Hey.

575
00:43:54,869 --> 00:43:56,969
Hey, why did you come here?

576
00:43:57,269 --> 00:43:58,570
I came to think.

577
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:00,840
I needed time alone to think.

578
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:05,050
You should have still told her.
Why didn't you tell Yi Soo?

579
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:06,619
I'm sure your father knows.

580
00:44:06,679 --> 00:44:08,480
No matter where I go,
I'm still under his thumb.

581
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:12,619
Why didn't you answer Yi Soo's call?

582
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:15,659
If you talked to her,
you must know what happened.

583
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,360
Then why is it
that you're not worried about me?

584
00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:36,780
When I saw that you left
a boarding pass on my desk,

585
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:39,150
I thought you understood me.

586
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:40,820
I was thankful
that you wanted to console me.

587
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:44,090
Once I got here,
you were acting so cold to me.

588
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:47,519
Forget it. Just go back right now.

589
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,760
Why do you keep on telling me
to leave?

590
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:50,230
Do you know how Yi Soo...

591
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,500
- What about Yi Soo?
- She...

592
00:45:03,809 --> 00:45:04,909
Forget it.

593
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:07,039
I understand.

594
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:10,050
Yi Soo is your family, but I'm not.

595
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:15,250
That's not what I meant.

596
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,920
You're telling me you'd be done
with me if I hurt Yi Soo.

597
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:19,960
Your father will abandon me.

598
00:45:19,989 --> 00:45:22,320
I'd be kicked out from the company,
and you'd never see me again!

599
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:26,199
Are you trying to threaten me, too?

600
00:45:27,699 --> 00:45:29,329
You're just like your father.

601
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,699
Stop blaming others
and be honest with yourself.

602
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,400
You're the one abandoning others
blinded by something else.

603
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,409
- You're not being abandoned.
- Why you...

604
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:42,710
Anyone there?

605
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,510
Help me!

606
00:45:51,489 --> 00:45:52,619
- It's this way.
- This way.

607
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,989
Her voice definitely came
from this direction.

608
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:58,489
All right. You can go that way.
It's safer there.

609
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:00,000
- I'll go this way.
- Wait.

610
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:03,900
You should go this way.

611
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,179
How did it get up there?

612
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:33,329
Boss?

613
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:34,699
Are you all right?

614
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,530
I'm fine, but what happened to you?

615
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:40,840
If you're fine, why did you scream?

616
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:45,309
I couldn't reach it.

617
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:49,210
My cell phone is in the bag,
so I couldn't call anyone.

618
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:52,110
Going back down and up
would be too tiring.

619
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,789
- I thought it was an emergency.
- It is an emergency.

620
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:02,519
Your camera is in there.

621
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:09,059
Were you worried about me?

622
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:11,170
What?

623
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:21,179
You're bleeding.

624
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:25,280
It's nothing. It's okay.

625
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,760
Did you come for me?

626
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:41,530
Camera...
Did you look at the camera?

627
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,070
Pardon?

628
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:47,170
Did you look at the pictures
inside it or not?

629
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,570
What is this?

630
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:54,980
Is there something weird in there?

631
00:47:55,579 --> 00:47:57,380
Is that why you ran here?

632
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:05,750
All right. Here.

633
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:08,820
Go on top of me.

634
00:48:09,489 --> 00:48:10,530
What is this?

635
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,590
We need to get it back.

636
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:15,329
Are you telling me to step on you?

637
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:20,670
Get up.

638
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:22,940
Then...

639
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:26,139
are you going to kneel?

640
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:35,550
Can I really go on you?

641
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:40,059
It's my first time
seeing you like this.

642
00:48:46,929 --> 00:48:48,159
It's not the first time.

643
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:56,199
Pardon? What did you say?

644
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,570
It's not the first time?

645
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,309
Hurry up, you're heavy.

646
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,110
Okay.

647
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,619
A bit higher.

648
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:10,150
- Higher?
- Yes.

649
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:13,219
Can you get it?

650
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,559
Not even close.

651
00:49:18,329 --> 00:49:19,489
- Why?
- Put me down.

652
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:21,860
- Is it not working?
- No.

653
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,699
Put me down.

654
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:31,039
Okay.

655
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:35,079
What... What are you doing?

656
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:36,750
Come on. Stand up.

657
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,579
- You want me to stand up?
- Yes, hurry.

658
00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:42,179
Okay. One, two, three.

659
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,320
What are you doing? Hold on tight.

660
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:48,590
Even if you don't like me,

661
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:50,690
- please hold onto me or I'll fall.
- Okay.

662
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:54,429
- Hold me tight.
- Okay, tightly.

663
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,269
You scared me.

664
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,400
- Okay.
- No. Take a step forward.

665
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,539
- Forward?
- Yes.

666
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:04,539
- Forward, like this?
- No, no.

667
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:06,880
A little bit to the left. Left.

668
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,340
- Left?
- This way. Yes

669
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:11,449
- No, no. To the right.
- Right?

670
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,920
No. That's not right.

671
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:17,219
- Sorry.
- Hold on.

672
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:18,320
Here.

673
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:20,320
- I'm almost there.
- Did you get it?

674
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:22,659
I got it. I got it.

675
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,179
Are you okay?

676
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:27,360
What about you?

677
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:34,760
I'm okay.

678
00:51:38,699 --> 00:51:40,739
Oh, my. Did you sprain your ankle?

679
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,170
Does it hurt a lot?

680
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:45,010
- What should we do? Are you okay?
- Yes.

681
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:46,239
Ms. Chae.

682
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:59,090
Why are you here?

683
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:02,519
What's going on? What happened?

684
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:03,829
Nothing much.

685
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,829
- Nothing happened.
- Why are you on the ground?

686
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,000
- Did you hurt yourself?
- I'm just relaxing.

687
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,530
I'm really okay, I promise.

688
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:15,840
What should we do?

689
00:52:15,869 --> 00:52:17,739
- Hwan Gi.
- Boss.

690
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:21,440
What should we do?
Do you think you can walk?

691
00:52:23,409 --> 00:52:25,449
- Boss.
- I'm okay.

692
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,690
You two look great together.

693
00:52:40,429 --> 00:52:42,360
Put me down now.

694
00:52:42,429 --> 00:52:44,000
You're making it harder for me.
Stay still.

695
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:53,309
Hey, don't do it.

696
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,610
You better behave yourself.

697
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,480
Gosh.

698
00:52:59,349 --> 00:53:01,619
Did you see my camera?

699
00:53:04,349 --> 00:53:06,860
Did you see the pictures in it
or not?

700
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:18,000
What's in it?

701
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:29,949
You put on weight because
you're always stuck in your room.

702
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:41,690
Cheers.

703
00:53:41,789 --> 00:53:43,429
- Cheers.
- Great job, everyone.

704
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:47,329
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

705
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,840
- The wine tastes great.
- Enjoy your food.

706
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:01,809
Sun Bong, go easy on the alcohol.

707
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,980
I will.

708
00:54:11,019 --> 00:54:12,320
- What was that?
- You look pretty.

709
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:13,889
I'm going to upload it on my
SNS account.

710
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:17,329
Oh, you look so cute in this one.

711
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:18,659
Don't you think, Gyo Ri?

712
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:24,030
Yes, Ro Woon is cute.

713
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,030
Right?

714
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:28,900
Who told you you could upload
a picture of me?

715
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:31,340
Why did you delete it?

716
00:54:32,539 --> 00:54:33,610
Fine.

717
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:36,340
Let's take one together.

718
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:38,449
- Hey, look at the camera.
- Forget it.

719
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,449
- Stop it.
- One, two, three.

720
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:46,349
Great.

721
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:53,800
This is fantastic. Look at this.

722
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,000
- She's so cute.
- Look at this.

723
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:01,340
Look at this.

724
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:05,570
You're unbelievable, Ro Woon.

725
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:07,510
This is why I love you.

726
00:55:07,909 --> 00:55:10,849
Cut it out. You can't upload
that one, can you?

727
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:13,949
If you upload that,
you're dead meat.

728
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:16,789
I'm still going to upload it.

729
00:55:17,619 --> 00:55:18,789
I love you, Ro Woon.

730
00:55:18,889 --> 00:55:21,760
I love you so much.

731
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:26,059
Gosh.

732
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:28,800
Boss, look at this.

733
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:30,929
Look at this.

734
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:33,739
Maybe...

735
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,039
I'll get to see him laugh.

736
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:37,210
Laugh.

737
00:55:40,179 --> 00:55:41,880
- Isn't it funny?
- It's funny, right?

738
00:55:41,909 --> 00:55:44,210
- He's about to laugh.
- He's going to laugh.

739
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:45,349
Is he finally going to laugh?

740
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:48,480
He's going to laugh soon.
It's funny, isn't it?

741
00:55:48,619 --> 00:55:50,250
Look how funny it is.

742
00:55:50,289 --> 00:55:52,590
Not a chance.

743
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,530
- Isn't she cute?
- Is that Ms. Chae?

744
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:00,960
- Can you look like that?
- Stop it.

745
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,000
Put the phone away. Stop it.

746
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:05,769
Look at that face.
Look at those eyes.

747
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,670
Stop it.
Do you have to do this here?

748
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:12,710
I'm sorry to interrupt,

749
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,880
but can I have your attention
for a minute?

750
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:22,980
The director...

751
00:56:23,889 --> 00:56:25,920
would like to thank you.

752
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:33,090
Thank you so much for
giving the kids...

753
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:36,230
unforgettable memories.

754
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:38,730
- We should thank you.
- Thank you.

755
00:56:38,769 --> 00:56:41,769
- We'll never forget this.
- It was so fun.

756
00:56:44,409 --> 00:56:46,469
By the way, you seem to...

757
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:49,610
like Mr. Kang very much.

758
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,610
That's right.

759
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:55,849
You can't stop smiling at Mr. Kang.

760
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:56,889
Well...

761
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:01,090
Please excuse me now.

762
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:14,340
Actually,

763
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,510
I'd like to thank you, too.

764
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:24,250
This project was very meaningful
to me personally.

765
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,349
White Cloud Orphanage is...

766
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:33,190
my childhood home.

767
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:40,559
- Sorry?
- Didn't you grow up abroad?

768
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:42,630
I thought so, too.

769
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:48,500
Thank you for finding my family
I lost a long time ago.

770
00:57:49,239 --> 00:57:52,139
It's all thanks to Silent Monster.

771
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:55,179
Us?

772
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,550
- We did a good job.
- I guess.

773
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:00,750
We're always grateful.

774
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:33,719
You served
in the counter-terrorism unit?

775
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:35,280
Is that true?

776
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:41,659
A sniper who shoots people
from somewhere hidden?

777
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:46,559
Then again,
that'd suit you quite well.

778
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,800
But it's still hard to believe
you were in special forces.

779
00:58:49,829 --> 00:58:50,900
It's a lie, isn't it?

780
00:58:51,869 --> 00:58:53,230
It was my father's order.

781
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,909
He wanted me to become a man.

782
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:11,119
I thought...

783
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:14,760
I had found out everything
about you.

784
00:59:15,619 --> 00:59:17,090
But I was wrong.

785
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:20,760
There was still more to learn.

786
00:59:24,469 --> 00:59:25,530
Actually,

787
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:28,739
I saw the pictures in your camera.

788
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:32,340
It's a misunderstanding.

789
00:59:32,909 --> 00:59:33,940
I just...

790
00:59:34,409 --> 00:59:37,610
happened to take those pictures
without any intention.

791
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:39,349
They were quite a few.

792
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:41,980
I didn't even know
you were taking those pictures.

793
00:59:42,349 --> 00:59:44,750
You sure are a sniper.

794
00:59:44,849 --> 00:59:48,159
I didn't have any weird intention,
I swear.

795
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:49,320
I know.

796
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:52,130
You like me, don't you?

797
00:59:57,099 --> 01:00:00,230
I could see how much you
care about me from those pictures.

798
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:12,579
Don't be so shy.

799
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:18,219
What's so shameful about a boss
caring about his staff?

800
01:00:20,989 --> 01:00:23,420
The camera was full of
pictures of the staff.

801
01:00:24,429 --> 01:00:28,329
In addition, you captured
the most splendid moments of each.

802
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,039
Now that I think of it,

803
01:00:36,769 --> 01:00:39,739
I was no different from your father.

804
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:44,949
I didn't know you were
watching everyone from behind.

805
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,250
That's who you are.

806
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,920
And you're good enough
the way you are.

807
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:02,659
I kept telling you to change.

808
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:05,929
I'm sorry I pushed you like that.

809
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:23,719
All right.

810
01:01:25,619 --> 01:01:28,219
Here. Put this on.

811
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:33,460
Gyo Ri washed it for you.

812
01:01:39,869 --> 01:01:40,969
It's okay.

813
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,070
Come on.

814
01:01:42,739 --> 01:01:44,809
I won't try to change you anymore.

815
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:48,880
There must be a way of
communication that's right for you.

816
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:50,880
Let's find it.

817
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:54,420
You thought of posting about Panda's
journey for Rose Airlines...

818
01:01:54,679 --> 01:01:57,619
and moved people's hearts
in your own way.

819
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:06,489
Don't change.

820
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,820
That completes the real Eun Hwan Gi.

821
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:43,599
Oh, you smiled.

822
01:02:45,329 --> 01:02:47,070
You just smiled, right?

823
01:02:53,769 --> 01:02:55,280
I saw you smile just now.

824
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,349
I know you smiled.

825
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:59,280
- You did.
- No, I didn't smile.

826
01:02:59,349 --> 01:03:00,449
You did smile.

827
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,949
- No, I didn't.
- Show me just once more.

828
01:03:03,449 --> 01:03:05,920
- I didn't smile.
- You did. Just once more, please.

829
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:07,190
I really didn't.

830
01:03:07,789 --> 01:03:09,659
Come on. I know you smiled.

831
01:03:10,059 --> 01:03:14,460
Just one more time, please.
Show me your smile once more. Boss.

832
01:03:15,429 --> 01:03:17,969
Boss, show me one more time.
Just once more, please?

833
01:03:18,099 --> 01:03:21,699
Just one more time.
Are you being shy?

834
01:03:21,969 --> 01:03:25,010
Show me just once more.
Please? Boss.

835
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:26,269
Ms. Chae.

836
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:29,980
I've been looking for you.

837
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,050
Me?

838
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:35,750
Can you spare me a second?

839
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,289
Let's talk first.
We have stuff to talk about.

840
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,349
I guess we do.

841
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:44,730
Shall I give you guys some privacy?

842
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,289
- Would you mind?
- Just stay.

843
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:53,530
It has nothing to do with her.
Just let her go.

844
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,239
What I want to talk to you about
should concern her.

845
01:03:59,409 --> 01:04:01,309
- I'll go first.
- Listen to me first.

846
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:02,739
There's something you don't know.

847
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:05,250
And you think
you always know everything?

848
01:04:10,519 --> 01:04:11,849
That's strange.

849
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:14,960
Things were good earlier.

850
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:21,730
How about we grab a drink together?

851
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:52,989
I thought I lost it.

852
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:56,159
I didn't know you had it.

853
01:04:56,199 --> 01:04:57,429
Did you see it?

854
01:04:58,530 --> 01:04:59,599
I did.

855
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:01,070
You're thanking me now, right?

856
01:05:01,099 --> 01:05:03,670
- Why are you giving it to me now?
- I wasn't going to give it to you,

857
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:05,809
but I changed my mind.

858
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,329
- Shall we begin?
- Bring it on.

859
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:51,449
Mr. Kang! Please be careful.

860
01:05:56,219 --> 01:05:58,030
- My shoe... Where did it go?
- Your shoe?

861
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,929
It's right here.
Shall I carry it for you?

862
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:04,230
Is it this way or that way?

863
01:06:04,369 --> 01:06:07,230
This way. It's this way. Let's go.

864
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,599
Oh, no...

865
01:06:18,409 --> 01:06:19,880
Are you crying?

866
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:33,090
She's so ugly.

867
01:06:34,429 --> 01:06:35,900
My goodness.

868
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:42,139
- Oh, my goodness.
- I do look so ugly.

869
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:44,210
That totally sobered me up.

870
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:49,510
We're here.

871
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:56,349
Oh, boy.

872
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,539
(My Shy Boss)
