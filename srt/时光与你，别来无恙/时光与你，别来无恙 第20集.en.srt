[Profile of Jiang Dian]

6
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,070
You came here.

7
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,350
That’s a big step you took.

8
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,390
Dr. Xie,

9
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,950
do you have any drugs which can help me control myself?

10
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,950
According to your condition,

11
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,630
drugs can only be of little help.

12
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,430
The key is

13
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,950
believing that you deserve to be loved.

14
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,830
When you grow up, if there’s

15
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,470
no return for your love for a long time,

16
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,400
you’ll feel sad,

17
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:09,070
angry, hopeless and start to deny yourself.

18
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:10,789
The self-denial

19
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,630
will be buried in your mind.

20
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,190
One day when you

21
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,180
love someone for real again,

22
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,590
in order not to be sad,

23
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,070
you tend to

24
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,590
deny yourself first.

25
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,100
So when you suffer a setback,

26
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,230
you never give up easily.

27
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:27,230
However, after you fall in love,

28
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,510
because you’re afraid of losing her,

29
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,310
you’ll tend to work hard,

30
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,550
get worried

31
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,350
and doubt about yourself constantly.

32
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,670
When you can’t control yourself,

33
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,470
look at the one who you love

34
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,190
and do not think about anything.

35
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,190
Just look into her eyes.

36
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,070
You’ll find yourself.

37
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,390
But I can’t accept that

38
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,190
there’s another guy in her eyes,

39
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:50,870
even if they’re already done.

40
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,190
I understand what you said, but I

41
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,510
can’t control myself. I...

42
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,150
Sorry.

43
00:02:58,950 --> 00:02:59,550
Jiang Dian,

44
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,670
do you think the starry sky is beautiful?

45
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,230
Do you think the brightest star

46
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,950
will still be shinning as before

47
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,710
when other stars are all gone?

48
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,510
Stubbornness can make you

49
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,790
become perfectly strict with love.

50
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,030
To any kind of possession,

51
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,550
no matter it’s a good one or a bad one,

52
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,110
you just can’t accept it.

53
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,750
Think about the sky.

54
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,670
The brightest star

55
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,510
can definitely make others appear to be dark.

56
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:28,950
If you don’t believe me,

57
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,150
just look into her eyes.

58
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,350
Sorry, I got a phone call.

59
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,030
Hello.

60
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,079
OK. I’ll be right there.

61
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:50,829
Dr. Xie,

62
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,510
please help me...

63
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:56,550
Help me hide

64
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,750
my medical records.

65
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,310
Don’t worry.

66
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,310
Your medical records

67
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,950
are strictly confidential here.

68
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,070
No one will

69
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:04,990
know you’ve been here.

70
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,030
Thank you.

71
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,430
Taking your medications on time

72
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,670
can stabilize your medical condition.

73
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:15,710
Thanks.

74
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:17,670
I gotta go.

75
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,350
He could have told his girlfriend,

76
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,070
but he chose to keep it secret.

77
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,310
Why?

00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,230
Hi, Chengcheng.

103
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,270
I took my boyfriend here.

104
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,430
Do you mind?

105
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,910
Of course not.

106
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,110
No matter if you mind or not,

107
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,430
do not call my girlfriend by

108
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,510
her nickname in public.

109
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,950
It’s not appropriate.

110

What my boyfriend means

111
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,030
is also what I mean.

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,750
Please take a seat.

113
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,630
Good job, Dian.

114
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,750
Everyone is shocked.

115
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,710
Some people

116
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,550
may think

117
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,830
it’s the engagement party of Cheng and you.

118
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,030
Great.

119
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,750
You’re here to shock everyone.

120
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,270
Baoling,

121
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,670
I already said the same words.

122
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:10,470
Dian,

123
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,950
let’s get a drink there.

124
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,150
What you wear is fancy.

125
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,950
You’re here to steal the show.

126
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:28,790
No.

127
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,070
I just want to announce that Dian is my boyfriend

128
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,060
to make him feel secure.

129
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,590
I know you’re in love,

130
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,550
but you don’t have to

131
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,030
provoke others this way.

132
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,100
Then try to provoke me.

133
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,920
Are you gonna keep hiding from him?

134
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,230
He doesn’t like me.

135
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:52,670
That’s it.

136
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:53,790
It’s OK.

137
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,990
I know you’re always assertive,

138
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,070
but please don’t get hurt.

139
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,590
It’s Zhou Yao’s celebratory party,

140
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,750
but it was held by the company.

141
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,510
By convention

142
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,670
the company may also

143
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,710
advertise some other stars.

144
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,830
Why do those journalists all focus on Zhou Yao?

145
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,310
Lian Ruoshen is going to release a new song too.

146
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,920
I thought

147
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,750
scheduling Lian Ruoshen’s song

148
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,430
and finishing it as soon as possible

149
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,910
could bring him some opportunities.

150
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,550
However, I forwarded my plan several times.

151
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,990
Our boss hasn’t replied to me yet.

152
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,230
Now I’m wondering

153
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,630
if it’s because Lian Ruoshen

154
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,030
contradicted him last time.

155
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,150
So he plans to ignore us.

156
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,990
He’s capable of that after all.

157
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,390
So what’s your plan?

158
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:42,750
What’s my plan?

159
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,510
I have to do something.

160
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,270
There are new stars every day.

161
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,640
If someone is slightly behind,

162
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,070
he’ll be completely forgotten.

163
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:50,990
I have to

164
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,270
convince our boss to make Lian Ruoshen famous,

165
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:54,990
or

166
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,350
I quit and do it on my own.

167
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,230
Think about it carefully.

168
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,840
It’s not easy to work alone.

169
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,430
Don’t worry. I got it.

170
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,510
If it’s not necessary,

171
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,000
I won’t quit.

172
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,710
Chengcheng,

173
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,790
wait a moment.

174
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,190
I have to talk to DK.

175
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,230
Why are you asking me?

176
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,150
Handle it by yourself.

177
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,040
Sir.

178
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,710
You can go.

179
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:31,670
OK.

180
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,110
Come in.

181
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:41,909
Sir,

182
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,070
you made every effort to found

183
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:44,830
the Royal Entertainment.

184
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,950
Today there are a lot of people.

185
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,870
They came here for you.

186
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,030
Stop flattering me. Get straight to the point.

187
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:53,880
Sir,

188
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,750
you’re always good at finding talents.

189
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,190
People selected by you all became famous.

190
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,110
So I’m gonna ask you a question today.

191
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,630
What do you think of Lian Ruoshen?

192
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,710
He’s gifted,

193
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,230
but

194
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,550
it’s not enough.

195
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,950
I can’t give the best resources to him.

196
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,590
I understand that.

197
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,230
He just began to be a star.

198
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,390
In terms of his popularity and advertising,

199
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,470
he’s not that good.

200
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,070
I’m not greedy.

201
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:20,950
I don’t hope

202
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,350
you can give him the best resources now.

203
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,110
But...

204
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,910
His new single is going to be released.

205
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,350
The release

206
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,310
will be a great opportunity for him.

207
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,550
You said he’s gifted.

208
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,350
Well, if he’s gifted,

209
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:34,910
his single will be the top 3

210
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,120
of the domestic single charts.

211
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,350
There are several key variety shows.

212
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,590
I hope our senior staff members

213
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,960
can offer some help.

214
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,110
About the specific plan,

215
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,310
I already told it to you before.

216
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,910
Now I just need your approval.

217
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,230
Since you talk to me,

218
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,230
I can help you.

219
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,310
It’s obvious that

220
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,710
you care about him.

221
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,910
Otherwise, you wouldn’t

222
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,110
help him again and again.

223
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,630
I just cherish talents.

224
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,550
Think about his ability.

225
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,200
He won’t let you down.

226
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,430
His attitude

227
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,390
doesn’t matter.

228
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,480
What matters is your attitude.

229
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,680
Baoling,

230
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,350
you’re a senior staff member.

231
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,520
Do I have to make it clear?

232
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,230
[Gangzhou Hotel]

233
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:41,950
Later

234
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,630
I’ll wait for you upstairs.

235
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,640
Sir,

236
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,990
what do you mean?

237
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,350
Baoling,

238
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,630
you’re not young anymore.

239
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:55,070
You have to create a superstar

240
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,590
to help you stay in the entertainment industry.

241
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,830
As to me,

242
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,310
I can make anyone famous.

243
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,070
Why should I make someone who

244
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,150
always contradicts me famous?

245
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,590
To put it simply,

246
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:07,760
I care about you.

247
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,150
To come or not,

248
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,430
it’s up to you.

249
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,270
Bastard, I won’t forgive you.

250
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,790
Let’s toast the success of Zhou Yao’s new song.

251
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:24,670
Cheers!

252
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,990
Cheers!

253
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,310
Next, let’s invite the host,

254
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,070
Zhou Yao,

255
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,150
to say something to us.

256
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,230
Cheng Feng,

257
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,110
thank you for

258
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,030
helping me this time.

259
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,030
I want to invite you to

260
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,230
come with me.

261
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,270
My boyfriend hates

262
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,720
me being close to other guys.

263
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,750
There are a lot of people today.

264
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,070
I don’t want anyone to think that

265
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,150
I’m using you to hype myself up.

266
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,430
So let’s stop here.

267
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,950
Why are you so arrogant?

268
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,070
Think about where you are

269
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,230
and who you are.

270
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,510
Mind your tongue.

271
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,150
You guys asked her to come here.

272
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,350
Ask? You’re kidding.

273
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,390
Who are you?

274
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,120
You’re ignorant.

275
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,590
Don’t ever think that you can do

276
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,470
whatever you want.

277
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,870
It’s your honor to be invited.

278
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,670
So you’re kicking down the ladder?

279
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,150
You should stop talking.

280
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,590
You’re just a gigolo.

281
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,160
To those who don’t respect others,

282
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,870
there is no need to be polite.

283
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:42,920
Sorry, guys.

284
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,350
Sorry for disturbing you. Have fun!

285
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,190
Stop!

286
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,030
You raised hell in my place.

287
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,550
Now you just wanna leave?

288
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,550
Do you wanna fight me?

289
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:54,950
I’m not afraid of you!

290
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:56,870
OK.

291
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:58,350
Hit me.

292
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,470
You’re fired!

293
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,710
As the CEO of Royal Entertainment,

294
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,470
you insulted your business partner

295
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,510
and planned to beat him up privately.

296
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,230
If I publish the video,

297
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,550
what will happen? You know it.

298
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,310
Dai Baoling, you’re insane!

299
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,280
Delete the video now,

300
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,040
or I’ll let you pay for what you did!

301
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,680
Baoling, don’t worry.

302
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:18,830
I’m here.

303
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,110
Baoling, calm down.

304
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,110
It’s personal.

305
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,110
Essentially,

306
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,950
I have you involved in it.

307
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,680
Sir,

308
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:29,910
you shouldn’t

309
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,150
say something like that again.

310
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:32,710
Recently,

311
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,430
you connived with Pang Ting to

312
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,070
take resources for Lian Ruoshen away

313
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,790
and gave them to Zhou Yao secretly.

314
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,590
I didn’t complain.

315
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,630
However, you refused to

316
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,030
publicize Lian Ruoshen’s new single.

317
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,840
You know what’s the reason.

318
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,230
Don’t blame me.

319
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,590
You should blame yourself.

320
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,870
It’s meaningless for me to

321
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,440
keep working for this company.

322
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,080
What do you mean?

323
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,720
I mean

324
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,550
from now on,

325
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,360
I quit!

326
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,440
I’m fed up with you,

327
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:05,950
I quit, too!

328
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,270
You…

329
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:08,670
Dude.

330
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,350
Idiot.

331
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:09,870
Go with me.

332
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,360
Let’s toast to our victory.

333
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:33,990
Cheers!

334
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,470
- Cheers! - Cheers!

335
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,160
Great!

336
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,920
I’ve been through a lot these years.

337
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,190
I finally quit.

338
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,470
I regret that we left early.

339
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,670
I should kick him.

340
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,430
Eat some vegetables.

341
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,840
I agree with you.

342
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,070
I’m starving.

343
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,350
I was drinking before.

344
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,110
I didn’t eat anything.

345
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,430
Didn’t you order the staple food?

346
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,790
Yes, we did. Here it is

347
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,750
Don’t throw it into the hot pot directly.

348
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:08,550
Look.

349
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:10,670
I’ll show you

350
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,030
my improvisation.

351
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,550
I can stretch the noodles while singing.

352
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,150
♫ When I have wings ♫

353
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,070
♫ I can fly to a bigger world ♫

354
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:31,680
♫ I change in the last second ♫

355
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,760
♫ Breaking the cocoon into a butterfly ♫

356
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,110
You regret it, right?

357
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,790
No, I don’t.

358
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:45,640
I’m happy.

359
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,510
No matter how hard it will be,

360
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,510
I will never regret my decision today.

361
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,000
Before, I

362
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,110
often felt depressed.

363
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,350
Suddenly my life

364
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,720
felt lacking in direction.

365
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,790
Now it’s different.

366
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,710
As long as he agrees,

367
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,830
I’ll get him out of there

368
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:06,630
at any price.

369
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,470
Whatever decision you are going to make,

370
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,630
I’m always behind you.

371
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:13,870
If you need help in the future,

372
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,870
I’ll try my best to help you.

373
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,310
Drink some hot water.

374
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,800
Your stomach will feel better.

375
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,510
Dian,

376
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:35,870
somehow,

377
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,510
I feel unhappy now.

378
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,230
What’s wrong?

379
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:40,950
I’m

380
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,110
a little worried.

381
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,870
I’m worried that I’ll fail.

382
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,360
What should I do?

383
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,870
You don’t have to be worried.

384
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,320
Ask yourself.

385
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,710
Do you think I’m gonna succeed?

386
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,390
It depends on your attitude.

387
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,510
Do you really like singing?

388
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,040
Or do you just want to be famous?

389
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,680
Is there a difference?

390
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,830
Of course, there is.

391
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,400
If you do like singing,

392
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,750
you won’t care about the fame.

393
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,190
If you just want to be famous,

394
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,829
in the future,

395
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,000
your life will be full of worry.

396
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,230
How can you focus on music?

397
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,190
Believe in yourself.

398
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:39,840
Are you sleeping?

399
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,030
No.

400
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,310
Do you want to see the stars?

401
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,590
Yes.

402
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,870
What are you doing?

403
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,310
Look at the stars.

404
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:19,510
Where are they?

405
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:21,870
There.

406
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,310
Are they your favorite stars?

407
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,750
No.

408
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:41,760
No?

409
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,190
My favorite is

410
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,950
the one who looks at stars with me.

411
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,360
Baoling,

412
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,240
why are you here?

413
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,470
What did we do?

414
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,760
We did nothing.

415
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,430
I thought you might feel cold,

416
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,040
so I tucked you in.

417
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,910
Where is Dian?

418
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:43,910
Stop looking for him.

419
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,400
You move frequently while at sleep.

420
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:47,960
Will he sleep with you?

421
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,630
We should go.

422
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,510
The loving couple

423
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,070
has been separated by us.

424
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,470
Well, I’d

425
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,790
like to tell you something bad first.

426
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:11,950
After leaving Royal Entertainment,

427
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,510
you’ll be less stressful.

428
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,880
But you’ll lose all the resources

429
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:16,950
which Royal Entertainment has.

430
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,030
In the future, we

431
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,840
have to fight for everything.

432
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:23,990
It’ll be hard.

433
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:25,590
Ruoshen,

434
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,590
can you handle that?

435
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:31,720
The reason why I

436
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,040
stayed in Royal Entertainment for a period of time

437
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,390
is not that I wanted resources and money.

438
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,030
I stayed because of you.

439
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,840
When my dream got denied,

440
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:44,950
you believed in me,

441
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:46,310
praised me

442
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,190
and helped me with my debut.

443
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,670
As to me,

444
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:51,790
you’re the savior

445
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,400
and the confidant of my life.

446
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,230
You left Royal Entertainment.

447
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:57,920
Whatever resources it has,

448
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,000
I don’t care.

449
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,960
You trust me so much.

450
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,830
What if I fail to make you famous?

451
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,270
Baoling,

452
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,390
no matter what happens in the end,

453
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,350
I will always be there for you.

454
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,910
You stay,

455
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,350
I stay.

456
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,950
Dude,

457
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,910
why are you so emotional tonight?

458
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:41,710
Baoling.

459
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,400
OK.

460
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,870
Thinking of what you said,

461
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,390
I’ll keep you accompanied till the end.

462
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,310
I told you

463
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,270
you can’t get in without a reservation.

464
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,150
Please go back.

465
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,070
Ruoshen,

466
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,670
let’s drink a toast to Ms. Gao.

467
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:19,710
OK.

468
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,400
Ms. Gao.

469
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:33,790
Hey,

470
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:34,910
come here.

471
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,160
Drink with me.

472
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,470
Ms. Gao,

473
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,630
he can’t drink too much.

474
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,230
If you do want to drink,

475
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,800
I can drink with you.

476
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,200
Come here.

477
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:00,240
Ms. Gao.

478
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,200
It’s your honor to have my support.

479
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,520
You’re no longer a member of Royal Entertainment.

480
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,630
Stupid boy.

481
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,190
Ms. Gao!

482
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:24,790
Sir,

483
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,470
we’ve talked about

484
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,670
the contract before.

485
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:29,080
Could you please sign it now?

486
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:32,360
Sir.

487
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,920
Mr. Chen,

488
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,030
why did Lian Ruoshen’s

489
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,670
first song become a real hit?

490
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,030
Royal Entertainment did help him,

491
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,110
but it’s more about himself.

492
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,360
He’s cheerful, decent,

493
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:55,870
optimistic and upright.

494
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,120
All of these characteristics

495
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,760
are rare in the entertainment industry.

496
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,550
I believe

497
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,280
as long as you give him a chance,

498
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,550
he can be more popular than before.

499
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:05,480
Baoling,

500
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,750
why are you so naive now?

501
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,880
Do you really think

502
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,080
without Royal Entertainment,

503
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,400
Lian Ruoshen’s song

504
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,470
can still be popular?

505
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,750
As old friends of Royal Entertainment,

506
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,510
we offered all of our resources

507
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,270
and tried our best to support him.

508
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:18,950
Without us…

509
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,030
Mr. Chen,

510
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:21,350
what you said

511
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,710
is not appropriate.

512
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,630
Before, you told me that

513
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,190
you liked Lian Ruoshen’s song the best.

514
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,710
Because of DK,

515
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,000
you denied all the effort we made.

516
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,000
Mr. Chen,

517
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,840
you can’t be so mean.

518
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,360
Dai Baoling,

519
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,750
who do you think you are?

520
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,870
How dare you talk to me this way?

521
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,270
After leaving Royal Entertainment,

522
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,230
you’re nothing.

523
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,880
Fortune knocks once at every man’s door.

524
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,670
Wait and see.

525
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:47,990
Dai Baoling,

526
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,240
why are you so arrogant?

527
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,000
The reason why you succeed

528
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:52,750
is that

529
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,950
you have an affair with DK.

530
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,520
Mr. Chen.

531
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,030
You!

532
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,600
Please mind your words.

533
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,230
You’re a general manager.

534
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,430
You shouldn’t talk like a jerk.

535
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,550
By the way,

536
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,670
you might forget that

537
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,630
I’m good at Muay Thai.

538
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,360
So

539
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,270
don’t piss me off.

540
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,390
Dai Baoling,

541
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,520
don’t be so cocky.

542
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,400
You'll loose your momentum soon.

543
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,710
I was so stupid before.

544
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,520
Why did I work for Royal Entertainment?

545
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,470
It’s a disgusting company.

546
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,990
The CEO threatened to shut me out by media

547
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,950
and told me to kowtow to him.

548
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,950
He’s insane!

549
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,590
I’d rather give up my business

550
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,080
than go back and beg him for help.

551
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,630
I’m an excellent celebrity manager.

552
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,550
I’m quite famous in the industry.

553
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,630
I’ve never felt so humiliated.

554
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,440
Well, Chengcheng,

555
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,910
you asked me to come here over the phone.

556
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,910
What happened?

557
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:54,790
Glory Media

558
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,830
is looking for an endorser

559
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,950
for their game.

560
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,030
I’m the choreographer of their artists.

561
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,590
I recommended Lian Ruoshen to them.

562
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,960
After an assessment,

563
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,520
they think Lian Ruoshen is suitable.

564
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,920
They want to invite you to

565
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,830
participate in their event tomorrow.

566
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,190
By the way,

567
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,320
they’ll announce that

568
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,640
Lian Ruoshen is their endorser.

569
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,150
Really?

570
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,680
Well, it’s a little bit weird.

571
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,150
A big company looks for an endorser.

572
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,990
I’m the celebrity manager.

573
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,750
They didn’t talk to me

574
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,110
and made a decision directly.

575
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,950
I also think it’s kind of weird,

576
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,880
Since there’s an opportunity,

577
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,270
I told you about it first.

578
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,590
To take it or not,

579
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,840
it’s up to you.

580
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,680
Actually, I don’t have to be worried.

581
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,120
We should take it.

582
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,350
It wouldn’t do us any harm.

583
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,550
Maybe…

584
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,430
As a big company

585
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,350
and an employer,

586
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,510
it's normal to be a bit condescending.

587
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,600
Or maybe

588
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,590
their procedure

589
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,800
is different.

590
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,110
Anyway, Chengcheng,

591
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,790
thank you so much.

592
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,720
In the world, there are genuine emotions,

593
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,920
true love

594
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,750
and true warmth everywhere.

595
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,590
I love you so much, Chengcheng.

596
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,030
Stop flattering me.

597
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,150
You’re right.

598
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,470
I have to call Lian Ruoshen

599
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,510
and ask him where he is.

600
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,590
I want to tell the good news

601
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:16,830
to him in person.

602
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,470
How’s your preparation for the concert?

603
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,110
It’s not bad.

604
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,550
Everything is on the right track.

605
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:28,880
What about the new dance teacher?

606
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:29,710
How’s your cooperation with her?

607
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:31,910
I’m still adjusting.

608
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:35,630
It’ll take me some time to be familiar with a new partner.

609
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,110
Looks like

610
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:37,870
you still prefer

611
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,270
your ex-girlfriend Cheng Feng.

612
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,470
Although I don’t like her,

613
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,910
I can tolerate her

614
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:47,310
as long as she can

615
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,030
create business value for me.

616
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,560
Your first dance

617
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,560
and your current popular dance

618
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,080
were both choreographed by her.

619
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,910
After she left,

620
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:55,670
your other dances

621
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,190
haven't been that popular.

622
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,110
About the reason,

623
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,040
we both know.

624
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,590
I don’t have to explain, right?

625
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,390
If you can convince her

626
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,640
to be your permanent choreographer,

627
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,520
your future career will be promising.

628
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,680
Sir, I wish I could.

629
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:15,760
But…

630
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,430
I already broke up with Chengcheng.

631
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,040
Besides,

632
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,950
she has a new boyfriend now.

633
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,910
How can she be my

634
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,270
permanent choreographer?

635
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,520
Nothing is impossible.

636
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,550
She’s active in the industry recently.

637
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,280
She must be

638
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,800
busy helping Dai Baoling and Lian Ruosheng.

639
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,320
However, you should know

640
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,000
if I decide to blacklist them,

641
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,400
I will never let anyone help them.

642
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,960
When I put pressure,

643
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,510
you come to help them.

644
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,040
Maybe she’ll be grateful to you.

645
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:45,880
I don’t know much about her,

646
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:46,830
but I can tell that

647
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,230
she’s a sensitive and caring woman.

648
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,910
If Baoling is in trouble,

649
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,790
she will definitely help her.

650
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:55,870
Understand?

651
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:56,950
Yes.

652
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:18,630
Get out!

653
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,270
We’ve been together for many years.

654
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:24,960
You never

655
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,870
cooked for me.

656
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,510
It tastes like what I think,

657
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,710
but it still can be improved.

658
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,310
If you don’t get out,

659
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,190
I’ll call the police.

660
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,240
Recently I heard that

661
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,480
in order to help Dai Baoling and Lian Ruoshen,

662
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,000
you contacted some people in the show business.

663
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,030
It’s none of your business.

664
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,240
I can help you

665
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,630
as long as you come back to me

666
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,200
and be my exclusive choreographer.

667
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,310
Here is the contract.

668
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,370
[Choreographer Employment Contract]

669
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,830
Sign it.

670
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,560
I’ll convince DK to

671
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,950
forgive them.

672
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:16,760
Stay away!

673
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,590
You don’t have to worry about us.

674
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,160
Why?

675
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,070
Is it because

676
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,270
I borrowed a dance from you?

677
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:26,950
Are you gonna hate me all your life?

678
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:32,750
Chengcheng,

679
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,830
look at you.

680
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,830
Your life is miserable.

681
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,200
You’re too good for Jiang Dian.

682
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,710
He’s neither rich

683
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,640
nor famous.

684
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,830
He can’t give you anything.

685
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,270
But I’m different.

686
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,910
Now I’m rich and famous.

687
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,710
I can give you everything you want.

688
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,990
I left you before

689
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,590
because I didn’t want you to

690
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,380
suffer with me.

691
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,070
I thought one day

692
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:58,950
when I can

693
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,590
create the life you want,

694
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,400
I’ll come back to you.

695
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,630

872
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,870
I’ve been thinking

873
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,000
what I should do

874
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,040
to not let him down.

875
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,200
I’ve really tried so hard.

876
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,430
Why are the results

877
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,360
always unpleasant?

878
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,030
Stop drinking.

879
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:11,750
What’s wrong, Baoling?

880
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:14,680
Do you have the medication?

881
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,830
I’ll get you to the hospital.

882
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:21,870
I hate going to the hospital.

883
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,430
I always feel like I can get in

884
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:24,830
but cannot get out.

885
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,070
Do you think I’m a coward?

886
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,640
I want to be alive.

887
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:34,670
If I’m not,

888
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:36,800
how can I make his dream come true?

889
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,110
What about your dream?

890
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,200
My dream

891
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,230
is to make his dream come true.

Chengcheng,

895
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,280
I’ve been waiting for you at hospital for a long time.

896
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:41,870
Why didn’t you…

897
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,120
Why didn’t you go there?
