Episode 14

5
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,070
Who are you? What do you want to do?

6
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,790
I'll call the police!

7
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,260
Let go of it!

8
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:47,860
Are you OK?

9
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:54,630
Don't run!

10
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,270
Dian, it's dangerous! Stop chasing!

11
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:02,870
Are you OK?

12
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,630
I'm fine.

13
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,390
What's the matter? Let me see.

14
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,590
I'm fine.

15
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,350
Sorry.

16
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,750
I'm fine. It doesn't hurt.

17
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,630
How can you be fine?

18
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:22,860
The thief was in the house.

19
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,500
How can you be fine?

20
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,260
It's not a big deal.

21
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,910
It was just a thief coming in.

22
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,230
We can call the police later.

23
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:28,829
Don't worry.

24
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:30,310
I won't go there tomorrow.

25
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,630
Dian.

26
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,950
Why do you plan not to go tomorrow?

27
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,430
I told you I was fine.

28
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,340
It's just a small accident.

29
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,630
Don't make a fuss.

30
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,750
How can you say it's a small accident?

31
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,950
Are you sure it's a small accident?

32
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,500
He didn't take away other precious things,

33
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,060
but he only took away your phone.

34
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:51,750
I don't have

35
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,660
other precious things.

36
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,750
The only precious thing is

37
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,070
the imported coffee machine downstairs.

38
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,500
He was not able to carry it.

39
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,990
It's not funny at all.

40
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,950
I was not joking with you.

41
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:04,510
Dian,

42
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,540
the master salon

43
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,740
is very important to you.

44
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,150
It's an important starting point for you

45
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,910
to realize your dream in the field of physics.

46
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,990
You must go there this time.

47
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,390
You must listen to me.

48
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,269
Besides,

49
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,110
you will only leave three days.

50
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:20,790
I can ask

51
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,500
Yun and Baoling to come over.

52
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,340
I'm still worried.

53
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,780
I want to protect you myself.

54
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,070
Dian,

55
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,470
I will be angry if you go on like this.

56
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,230
The thief...

57
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,140
All right. All right.

58
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,340
I'll go there. I'll go there. OK?

59
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,110
Dian,

60
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,230
we can make each other a better person

61
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,190
when we are together.

62
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,070
I want you to see more brilliant things in the world.

63
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,220
I'm not the only one

64
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,790
in the world.

65
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,870
I should not be the only one.

66
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,500
Do you understand?

67
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,830
But I'm worried about you.

68
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,390
Be good.

69
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,670
I'll send you to the airport tomorrow.

70
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,460
This movement is wrong.

71
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,310
Move your chest first.

72
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,390
Yes. Your chest first.

73
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:25,940
Like this.

74
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,590
Those without fixed duties

75
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:39,790
please leave.

76
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,940
Are you sure about it?

77
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,670
Zhou Yao will

78
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,140
participate in the grading this time.

79
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,590
I believe Mr. Zhou

80
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,940
will not abuse public power

81
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,750
to take on revenge because of a trifle.

82
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:55,020
Right?

83
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,350
Of course.

84
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,500
I have a few words to say to Chengcheng.

85
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,550
Can I talk to her?

86
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,100
I'll give you one minute.

87
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:20,220
Tell me what you want to say.

88
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,300
Chengcheng,

89
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,500
can I help you

90
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,580
solve the issue on the internet?

91
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,140
You didn't add to my misfortunes.

92
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,310
You are already helping me.

93
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:27,630
Well,

94
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,980
do you have to speak to me in this way?

95
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,470
I really want to help you.

96
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,030
We are cooperating with each other.

97
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,380
If I smear you, what benefit can I get?

98
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,659
The agreement has been terminated.

99
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,780
You can smear me.

100
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,390
Chengcheng, your choreography...

101
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:43,500
Let's begin.

102
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,230
♫ Starlight on a bitter night goes out ♫

103
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:00,000
♫ Hope dies out in my heart♫

104
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,630
♫ So I’m lost and confused ♫

105
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,360
♫ Stumbling around in the crowd ♫

106
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,640
♫ The footsteps never stop ♫

107
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:19,370
♫ To see, to experience, to surpass ♫

108
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:24,480
♫ I find clear blue skies ♫

109
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:31,190
♫ I wanna chase in my lifetime ♫

110
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,400
♫ I chase a faraway gleam ♫

111
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,159
♫ And I chase every dream ♫

112
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:46,770
♫ I chase my heart ♫

113
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,860
Why do you stand there?

114
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,030
You need to thank the bosses.

115
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,110
Thank you all!

116
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,430
Very good!

117
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,340
Your performance is very good!

118
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,630
Please try hard

119
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,750
to become

120
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,460
the mainstay of our company.

121
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,590
Thank you, Sir!

122
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,940
Baoling worked very hard recently.

123
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,110
But

124
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,220
she will have to work harder later on.

125
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,780
You must follow

126
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,700
the advance publicity.

127
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,830
The expenses on publicity will be increased by 30%.

128
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,790
The company will give you full support.

129
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,980
Thank you for your support!

130
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,510
I'll make arrangements immediately.

131
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,910
Lian Ruoshen performed so well this time

132
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,990
that is not only because he made a lot of efforts,

133
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,460
but also because Chengcheng

134
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,900
has composed a suitable dance for him.

135
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,299
You can see not only his personal traits

136
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,909
but also his potential.

137
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:38,549
You are indeed very capable.

138
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,340
Zhou Yao is going to release a new album.

139
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,659
Please help him.

140
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,140
You can ask for any price.

141
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,990
Thank you for your offer!

142
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,820
But I'm sorry I can't compose dances for him.

143
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,180
Do you know how many people

144
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,470
want the chance to compose dances for him?

145
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,620
You are the first one I'm inviting.

146
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,660
You refused me without thinking.

147
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,950
Can you tell me the reason?

148
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,620
Because I don't like him.

149
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,350
I can't compose a dance when I see him.

150
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,620
Sir, Chengcheng is joking with you.

151
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,870
After all, she is out of the entertainment circle.

152
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,140
This time

153
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,150
she is just helping a bestie.

154
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,780
Besides,

155
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,470
I have asked her

156
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,820
to compose all Lian Ruoshen's dances.

157
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,220
Therefore, she really has

158
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,060
no time to help others.

159
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,740
I'm sorry about it, Sir.

160
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,470
Chengcheng.

161
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,500
Chengcheng, congratulations!

162
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,190
Your choreography was very successful.

163
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,420
When I saw the dance you had composed for Lian Ruoshen,

164
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,230
it reminds me of our past.

165
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,060
At that time,

166
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,580
you were shining.

167
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:25,830
Chengcheng,

168
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,860
I can help you become the brand ambassador for HA again.

169
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,300
Like before, we can...

170
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,700
I never gaze on the old pasture.

171
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,510
No matter how many times you invite me,

172
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,980
I will never consider it one more time.

173
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,380
Therefore, go away!

174
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,700
Because I don't like him.

175
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,140
I can't compose a dance when I see him.

176
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,860
Why are you dancing Lian Ruoshen's dance?

177
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,780
How is my dancing?

178
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,500
Not very good.

179
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,380
I don't know what's so good about this kind of dance.

180
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,980
He can get a high score with such a dance.

181
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:32,940
It can't be compared

182
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,620
with your dance.

183
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,510
Do you really think it's not a good dance?

184
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,380
Or are you comforting me?

185
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,460
-You are really...
-Really what?

186
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,140
A worse dancer?

187
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,860
You know that's not what I mean.

188
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,340
You really don't have to care too much about Lian Ruoshen.

189
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,380
He and you are not on the same level.

190
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,710
But you care too much

191
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,350
about Cheng Feng.

192
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,460
Chengcheng,

193
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,820
one day

194
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,140
I will become a singer with all eyes fixed on me.

195
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,460
At that time,

196
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,580
I will give you all you want.

197
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,140
If you choose

198
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,300
between me and fame,

199
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,290
-which one will you choose?
-I want both.

200
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,220
What if you can choose only one?

201
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,180
Of course, it's you.

202
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,780
She is still in your heart.

203
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,030
Don't worry.

204
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,700
I know what I'm doing.

205
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,340
Chengcheng,

206
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,260
you didn't notice

207
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,700
DK's look

208
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,740
after you refused him.

209
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:24,620
I was so scared.

210
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,980
I thought I should give him my life.

211
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
You are exaggerating.

212
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,620
Exaggerating?

213
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,260
Chengcheng,

214
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,620
DK has a high status in the entertainment circle.

215
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,260
You can't refuse him.

216
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,020
Even if you only say something wrong,

217
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,100
you might be shut out.

218
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,220
But you

219
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,220
refused him directly.

220
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,540
No warned, no fault.

221
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,260
Please don't

222
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,380
do this again.

223
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,940
You shouldn’t have offended him.

224
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,140
After all,

225
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,980
you will open a dance studio.

226
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,620
You will be related to him

227
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,740
in some way.

228
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,260
OK.

229
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,930
It's a new cell phone.

230
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,180
I've lost that one. I've just bought this one.

231
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,850
You've been looking at your phone frequently.

232
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,740
Are you waiting for Jiang Dian's phone call?

233
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,250
Yes.

234
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,380
The plane

235
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,420
should have landed.

236
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,580
Chengcheng,

237
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,980
you told me that it was a Master Salon.

238
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,700
He has to communicate with a lot of senior professionals.

239
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,860
He must be very busy.

240
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,130
Previously even if he was very busy,

241
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,140
he would send me a message on WeChat.

242
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,380
I don't know what's the matter today.

243
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,300
My Queen,

244
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,420
you didn't know

245
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,260
you would become like this.

246
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:03,860
Sir,

247
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,780
I've finished the investigation

248
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,540
as you instructed.

249
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,500
The thief usually goes to Happiness Street.

250
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:08,890
He is there now.

251
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,210
I've asked Hao Xiang to watch him.

252
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,340
Will you go there?

253
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,580
Sir, do you need help?

254
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:14,580
Sir!

255
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:16,900
Pei Xiaoyun,

256
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,380
I will sing

257
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,980
the next song for you.

258
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,300
Please listen carefully.

259
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:44,380
♫ I catch the gale before dawn ♫

260
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,900
♫ Through the night I can change the world ♫

261
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:58,170
♫ With my pride and wildness ♫

♫ I come over the far mountain ♫

263
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:10,780
♫ Youth means pain and joy♫

264
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:16,940
♫ It’s an adventure strengthening my drive ♫

265
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,900
♫ When I have wings ♫

266
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,860
♫ I can fly to a bigger world ♫

267
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,620
♫ I change in the last second♫

268
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,580
♫ Breaking the cocoon into a butterfly ♫

269
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,610
♫ Mockery  ♫

270
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,340
♫ is momentary♫

271
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:37,180
♫ Just like a passing cloud ♫

272
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:43,170
♫ I can make a world ♫

273
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,380
♫ My world ♫

274
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:56,780
Pei Xiaoyun,

275
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,450
today this song

276
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,740
only belongs to you.

277
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,380
Do you want to be my first fan?

278
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,260
Next, Pei Xiaoyun,

279
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,260
could you give the flowers in your hands

280
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,339
to your idol Lian Ruoshen

281
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,369
whom you are crazy about?

282
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,850
Thank you for your support!

283
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:39,290
I'm really very happy.

284
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:42,890
Easy, man!

285
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,620
Who asked you to go there?

286
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,540
Who asked you to go there?

287
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,610
Step aside!

288
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:50,580
Don't run!

289
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,340
What are they doing?

290
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,370
I told you not to call me.

291
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,370
What happened?

292
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,940
Someone is watching me.

293
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,010
What?

294
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,090
You should also be careful.

295
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,220
Don't mention me.

296
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,900
[Police]

297
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,020
Hello!

298
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:16,820
Hello!

299
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,490
I'm a policeman at Happiness Street Police Station.

300
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,140
Is that Cheng Feng speaking?

301
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,220
Yes, this is.

302
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,690
Well, do you know Jiang Dian?

303
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,500
He has just sent a thief here.

304
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,890
He said he attacked you yesterday.

305
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,060
Could you come here?

306
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:32,240
[Police]

307
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,620
Cheng! Cheng!

308
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,970
You can beat me or scold me.

309
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,780
Please don't turn your back on me.

310
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,490
I'll talk to you when we go back.

311
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,020
Cheng,

312
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,810
please don't turn your back on me.

313
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,740
Please don't go!

314
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,530
Listen to me.

315
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,210
It's not what you think.

316
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:15,850
Dian,

317
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,220
I suddenly don't know

318
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,300
how to communicate with you.

319
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,300
Last night I made it

320
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,700
very clear.

321
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,580
You don't need to worry about me.

322
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,530
Just do

323
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,850
what you should do.

324
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,130
But I didn't expect...

325
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,130
So you don't know what to say to me.

326
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:31,650
Right?

327
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:34,940
Dian,

328
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,970
I'm not in the mood

329
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,780
to quarrel with you.

330
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,980
If you want to communicate with me,

331
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,100
speak in a normal way.

332
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,450
I had been talking to you.

333
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,620
You were not talking in a normal way.

334
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,210
How do you want me to speak to you?

335
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:48,460
Last night,

336
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,610
I made it very clear.

337
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,130
You don't have to deal with this.

338
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,490
What did you do?

339
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,500
How did you promise?

340
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,380
What did you do?

341
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:57,700
Physics,

342
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:58,930
your dream,

343
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,140
your future study...

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,770
if I hadn't seen

516
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,130
the wound on your hand

517
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,410
before I saw this picture?

518
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:23,650
I don't mean it.

519
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:24,050
Jiang Dian,

520
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:26,050
you always say that you've already grown up.

521
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,320
You are no longer a young boy.

522
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,450
But look at what you have done.

523
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,720
Have you really become mature?

524
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,120
You are jealous of Zhou Yao.

525
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:35,880
You were emotionally out of control for several times.

526
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,640
You didn't go to the Master Salon

527
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:38,850
because you were trying to catch a thief.

528
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,090
Now in order to get my attention,

529
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,250
you even tried to...

530
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,290
Jiang Dian,

531
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,610
What on earth are you doing?

532
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,940
♫ I want to know why you feel lonely♫

533
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,840
♫ I want to stay with you ♫

534
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:31,880
♫ I wanna tell you not to be afraid of the dark since I’m here ♫

535
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:38,220
♫ I want to keep you warm ♫

536
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:41,840
♫ Pray that you will keep it ♫

537
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:48,230
♫ It’s okay. I will rest assured if you are happy ♫

538
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:53,690
♫ How satisfactory can love be ♫

539
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,480
♫ It’s the dearest company ♫

540
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,860
♫ I’ve been used to it ♫

541
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:05,740
♫ Even my tears are brave ♫

542
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:09,550
♫ The moments of our memory  ♫

543
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:14,550
♫ The answer you are looking for in every minute ♫

544
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:14,530
Dian,

545
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:21,480
♫ I really want to shoulder everything for you ♫

546
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,610
why don't you sleep on the bed?

547
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,370
Cheng, follow me.

548
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,240
Before you show up

549
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,080
Physics is my only love.

550
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,990
It ignited my passion

551
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,950
to live.

552
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,760
But when I meet you,

553
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,780
it is no longer the only one I love.

554
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,170
Because you have become the light

555
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:01,930
I am going to chase for the rest of my life.

556
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,200
I am chasing you.

557
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,890
Cheng, you must be with me.

558
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,760
I've written what I want to say to you

559
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,290
on all the planes here.

560
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,080
I want to say that

561
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,530
I can have no starlight,

562
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,239
no flowers,

563
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,639
no applause, no honor,

564
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,810
but I must have you.

565
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,580
♫ How satisfactory can love be ♫

566
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,530
♫ It’s the dearest company ♫

567
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:44,900
♫ I’ve been used to it ♫

568
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:49,840
♫ Even my tears are brave ♫

569
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,580
♫ The moments of our memory  ♫

570
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:58,640
♫ The answer you are looking for in every minute ♫

571
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:05,770
♫ I really want to shoulder everything for you ♫

572
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,330
You are no longer angry with me?

573
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:07,640
You fool. Look at you.

574
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,710
♫ I may feel lonely in youth ♫

575
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,960
How can I be angry?

576
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,660
♫ I can be brave when I’m with you♫

577
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,810
Don’t you have a class later?

578
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,170
♫ Time has taught us ♫

579
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,650
Mr. Chen wants to see me.

580
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:21,830
♫ to be grateful for having each other ♫

581
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:18,760
I'll be back soon.

582
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,370
You can wash up now.

583
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:25,840
♫ I laugh and cry because of you♫

584
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:30,970
♫ I spent all the best time with you♫

585
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,210
I never thought that

586
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:31,200
someone

587
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:38,850
♫ Staying with you is my best habit  ♫

588
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,490
would see me as the only light in life.

589
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,130
He would be completely

590
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,800
devoted to me.

591
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:48,290
♫ Staying with you is my best habit  ♫

592
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,490
His love is direct, fierce and awe-inspiring.

593
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,690
What shall I do

594
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:48,360
in this life to guard him?

595
00:35:59,210 --> 00:35:59,960
Hello, Baoling!

596
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:01,800
Chengcheng,

597
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,970
see the Trends. There is a heated debate.

598
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,880
After the climax,

599
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,050
it will be the ending.

600
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,560
You have signed up for the dual dance.

601
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,120
And now you want to switch to solo dance.

602
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,810
This does not mean the rules.

603
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,720
I'm not changing the dance.

604
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,890
I just want to change the way I perform the dance.

605
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,410
I have re-choreographed the dance before.

606
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,280
So I can do it by myself.

607
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,250
Could you please help me to change it?

608
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,800
I'm not what you think.

609
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,970
The competition requires your own original choreography.

610
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,760
You know, the only dancer registered for this dance is Miss Cheng.

611
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,800
And you are just a back dancer. I'm sorry.

612
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,210
I can prove myself.

613
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,120
I have been preparing it for two years.

614
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:51,600
As a dancer,

615
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,080
I'm sure you know

616
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,680
how important the competition means to me.

617
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,800
Please.

618
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,600
All right.

619
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,490
Make up a statement after the competition.

620
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:01,930
But

621
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:05,080
if there are any disputes,

622
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,960
it will have nothing to do with us.

623
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:10,850
OK. Thank you very much!

624
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,330
It's finally an opportunity for me.

625
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,850
When I see you are so angry,

626
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:32,850
I don't worry any more.

627
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:36,840
An Yin,

628
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,760
I've given you opportunities.

629
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,000
You didn't make it simple for yourself.

630
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,040
Don't blame others.

631
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,410
Opportunities?

632
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:45,840
I've been a foil

633
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,600
to you for so many years. Is that an opportunity?

634
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:49,760
Why do I have to

635
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,240
live under your shadow?

636
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:52,560
Why?

637
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,680
Because you have no ability.

638
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,240
If you have,

639
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,610
how can you be

640
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,810
a back dancer behind me for so many years?

641
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,320
You know more clearly than anybody.

642
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:01,570
Without me,

643
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,480
you even have no chance to show up

644
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:04,600
on the international stage.

645
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,600
Shut up!

646
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,680
Stop talking!

647
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,400
I've been

648
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,520
helping you because of

649
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,280
our previous mutual affection.

650
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,010
But you

651
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,640
are thinking about how to do harm to me.

652
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:14,920
There is another thing

653
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,680
you should never do.

654
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,000
You've hurt Jiang Dian.

655
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,560
I want to protect the people around me.

656
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:22,040
If you dare hurt the people around me again,

657
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,040
I will not spare you the punishment!

658
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,680
Spare me?

659
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,240
It's you who should beg me to spare you the punishment.

660
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,120
Do you know what it means

661
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,440
for a dancer to lose her legs?

662
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,890
Do you think I will be satisfied

663
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,960
with the favors you've done?

664
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,170
Let me tell you, Cheng Feng.

665
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,720
You can't have

666
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,320
what I, An Yin, can't have in my life.

667
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,920
I am living in hell.

668
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,040
You can't see the sunlight, either!

669
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,680
I can choose to see the sunlight.

670
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,560
Besides,

671
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,960
don't use the word "dancer" to describe yourself again.

672
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,120
You are not qualified.

673
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:14,880
Chengcheng!

674
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,400
Did you come to Professor Chen?

675
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,800
Why are you back so early?

676
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,410
I asked Professor Chen to help me sell the patent

677
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,640
and the price was 300,000 yuan.

678
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,680
They will send the money to me tomorrow.

679
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,280
With the money we already have,
the total amount is 1 million yuan.

680
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:30,240
I will try to make up the rest.

681
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:36,610
Dian,

682
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,040
I have a feeling that

683
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,800
my younger boyfriend is providing for me.

684
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,560
Well, you don't like it?

685
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,040
I like it because it's you.

686
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:49,930
Oh yes.

687
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,440
Did you see the Trends?

688
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,480
I'm sorry.

689
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,120
I didn't tell you at once.

690
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,240
I don't want you to say "I'm sorry".

691
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,120
What do you want me to say?

692
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,720
I love you.

693
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,520
Can you say it, Cheng?

694
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,440
I love you.

695
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:14,840
Today you are not

696
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,680
angry because of the video.

697
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,200
You are a good boy today. I'll give you a kiss for free.

698
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,850
-Are you satisfied?
-No, I'm not.

699
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,440
Did I interrupt you?

700
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,760
I'll come here later.

701
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:32,680
No.

702
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,680
You can have a talk. I'll go downstairs.

703
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:44,720
[No one is hated for nothing.]

704
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,120
[In this age,]

705
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,600
[there can be such a sucker.]

706
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,640
[She is really a scheming girl!]

707
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,600
[How can there be such a woman in the Welfare House?]

708
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,560
[She is really a scumbag! A degenerate!]

709
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,280
[Pang Ting]

710
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,360
Madam, please let me explain.

711
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,330
In... in fact...

712
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,480
It's useless to explain.

713
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:14,920
This video

714
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:16,560
has given rise to much discussion on the internet.

715
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,240
The public are questioning

716
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,360
the people the Welfare House is using.

717
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,960
Other people are using the video to smear me.

718
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,560
Please give me some time.

719
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,760
I will deal with this issue.

720
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,200
I also want to give you some time,

721
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,680
but no one gives me time.

722
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,680
Do you know that

723
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,520
it might even get me into trouble?

724
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,960
Stop talking.

725
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,520
You can quit your job voluntarily tomorrow.

726
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,280
Madam!

727
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,560
If you can save face when you leave,
it's the best thing to do.

728
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,120
Cheng Feng!
