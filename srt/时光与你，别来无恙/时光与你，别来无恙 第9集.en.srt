Episode 9

5
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,350
Cheng, I…

6
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,270
Do you want me to do it

7
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,110
or will you just let her go yourself?

8
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,350
Hey, this is between Cheng and me.

9
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,910
It’s none of your business.

10
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:47,670
She’s my girlfriend.

11
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,590
What do you think?

12
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:55,950
Next time I see you…

13
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,630
Dian, I’m sleepy. Let’s go back.

14
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,390
Why are you throwing up on me?

15
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,829
It was you who threw up on me!

16
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,720
I didn’t.

17
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,670
I don’t care.

18
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,710
You used the lipstick I sent you.

19
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,950
I drank with you.

20
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,230
You took advantage of me.

21
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:40,790
I think

22
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,870
you just agreed on it.

23
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:43,990
You cheated me!

24
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,430
I didn’t agree.

25
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,829
You used the lipstick too.

26
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,990
You took advantage of me as well.

27
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,910
I did not take advantage of you.

28
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,310
You cheated me.

29
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,150
I didn’t agree!

30
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,990
Hi, Rich.

31
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,750
-Long time no see.-Long time no see.

32
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,590
-Rich.-Have a seat.

33
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,870
Today is your wife’s birthday.

34
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,510
Please take this.

35
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,550
Surprise.

36
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:43,790
Thank you.

37
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:45,840
Callas.

38
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,990
We just met each other

39
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,000
several times when we were abroad.

40
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,350
Yet you were so thoughtful

41
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,200
and remembered that my wife

42
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,190
likes Callas.

43
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,870
Although we just met several times,

44
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,430
I always remembered that

45
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,870
you and your wife

46
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,310
took great care of me.

47
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,030
I thought I’d express my gratitude

48
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,390
if I have the opportunity in the future.

49
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,910
This is the opportunity.

50
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,110
-Cheers.-Cheers.

51
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,110
Thank you so much.

52
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,830
Zhou Yao has

53
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,750
a good image

54
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,390
and is professional as well.

55
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,550
I believe we will

56
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,750
cooperate very well.

57
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:29,960
Sure.

58
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,110
Apart from his commercial value,

59
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,070
I appreciate loyal people even more.

60
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,950
This is one of the reasons

61
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:37,880
why I chose him.

62
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:44,920
This is the contract.

63
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,670
Since it’s Rich’s contract,

64
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:50,640
I don’t think it’s necessary

65
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,390
to view the details.

66

[Party B: Zhou Yao]

67
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,760
If only Cheng could be

68
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,190
straightforward as you.

69
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,510
-Cheng?-Cheng?

70
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,310
Cheng Feng.

71
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,510
Because the inspiration

72
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,590
of HA’s first product

73
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,910
came from her dance.

74
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,990
So it would make it even better

75
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,310
if she could be the spokesperson.

76
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,870
I’m not worried about

77
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,190
her commercial value at all.

78
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,830
Her dance could go viral

79
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,990
all over the internet.

80
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,110
She must have great influence.

81
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:25,550
But it’s a pity that

82
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,230
she is not willing to do it

83
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,950
no matter how I persuade her.

84
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,790
Maybe it’s because she hasn’t done this for a while.

85
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,510
She has got used to the quiet and stable life now.

86
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,030
Maybe she doesn’t want to return to the life before.

87
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,710
If we make her come back,

88
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,150
it may become

89
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,870
a burden to her.

90
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,630
Also, if you need it,

91
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,150
I can recommend

92
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,030
more suitable people for you.

93
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,350
Okay, if I do

94
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,270
I will contact you for sure.

95
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,160
But I still want to wait longer.

96
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,710
What if she agrees?

97
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,510
Did she turn you down

98
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,440
because of me?

99
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,990
If yes,

100
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,670
I don’t want to make things difficult for you.

101
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,990
We can find a chance

102
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:11,870
to cooperate again.

103
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,150
It has nothing to do with you.

104
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,830
Please don’t feel pressured.

105
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,830
Actually,

106
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,950
I was hoping

107
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,640
to get you guys back together

108
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,310
through this.

109
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,190
But it’s a pity that

110
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,190
she seems to have

111
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,510
a little boyfriend now.

112
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,470
Come on, cheers.

113
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,400
Cheers.

114
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,110
I am angry.

115
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,080
I know.

116
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,110
You know nothing.

117
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,159
I don’t like the way he looks at you.

118
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,470
I don’t like it either.

119
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,550
Dian.

120
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
He is just

121
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,950
a stranger to me.

122
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,470
So, you don’t need to feel jealous of him.

123
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,390
You made me suffer from coldness

124
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,870
just for a guy we don’t like.

125
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,190
Dian.

126
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,550
Tell me how I should punish you.

127
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,630
Are you satisfied with this?

128
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,630
I’m satisfied with this.

129
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,950
Why it’s not here?

130
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,950
Was it picked up by someone else?

131
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,830
But normally few people would come here.

132
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,120
What the heck.

133
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,470
Why throwing such a good thing away?

134
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,190
Who? Who’s there?

135
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,310
I’ll count to three.

136
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,150
Come out now.

137
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,560
Or I will kick your ass.

138
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:53,870
Three.

139
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,630
Two.

140
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,230
One.

141
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,270
Oh my gosh! Ghost!

142
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:01,880
Where is the ghost?

143
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,760
Where?

144
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,270
Where is the ghost?

145
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,190
Don’t scare me.

146
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,030
Yun.

147
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:14,640
Over there.

148
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,750
I told you not to come over.

149
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,350
Don’t go any further.

150
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:21,270
Don’t be afraid.

151
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,150
Don’t be afraid.

152
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,030
Don’t come over.

153
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:43,390
Cheng Feng.

154
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,710
Because the inspiration of HA’s first product

155
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,950
came from her dance.

156
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,200
But it’s a pity that

157
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,390
she is not willing to do it

158
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,230
no matter how I persuade her.

159
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,960
How is the choreography?

160
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,110
Is it smooth?

161
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:15,750
I’m working on it.

162
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,120
Then you can show me

163
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:19,950
the completed part first.

164
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,200
I can give you some advice.

165
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,160
I’m a little tired todayWe can do it another day.

166
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,480
He’s till thinking about her.

167
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,480
I’ll get you a raincoat in a while.

168
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,870
You need to take a hot bath.

169
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,510
You can’t catch a cold.

170
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,080
You catch a cold?

171
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,710
No.

172
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,750
Why don’t you tell me if you have a fever?

173
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,510
I’ve been used to it.

174
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,480
You need to tell me

175
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,190
if you feel unwell.

176
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,590
Don’t act cool in front of me.

177
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,230
Go up and take a bath.

178
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,150
You should warm up.

179
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,080
Okay.

180
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,550
Go home after you are done.

181
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,360
No.

182
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,030
Let’s go.

183
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,040
It suits you.

184
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,990
Drink up the ginger tea.

185
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,040
I will get you some cold cure

186
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,150
What?

187
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,470
What’re you doing, Dian?

188
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,960
Get me down.

189
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,550
It’s too fast…

190
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,230
You need to take a shower.

191
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,270
I’ve caught a cold.

192
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:07,990
I can take my time.

193
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,590
But what if you got it too?

194
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,350
What are you thinking about?

195
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,150
Good boy. You drank it up.

196
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,150
What are you looking at?

197
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,390
Cheng,

198
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,430
why are you so pretty?

199
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,430
Hurry up. Drink the ginger tea.

200
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,590
Is it too spicy?

201
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,550
Didn’t you drink it?

202
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,630
I… I did.

203
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,270
Dian.

204
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,200
A liar cannot be a good boy.

205
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,190
I really did.

206
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,910
Go take a shower.

207
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,150
Alright!

208
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,150
You finished?

209
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,830
Sister.

210
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,880
When I just took the shower,

211
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,000
I was feeling a little dizzy.

212
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,270
If I go back now,

213
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,550
my cold will get worse

214
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,350
since it’s still raining.

215
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,270
Can I sleep on the sofa?

216
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,150
I can use the sofa.

217
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,110
My headache is killing me.

218
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,310
It’s definitely because

219
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,950
you didn’t drink the ginger tea.

220
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,360
Okay.

221
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,840
You should say thank you, sister.

222
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:16,990
Thanks, Cheng.

223
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:18,920
Call me sister.

224
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,510
Will I be awarded if I do?

225
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,790
You won’t be awarded if you don’t.

226
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,350
But you may be awarded if you do.

227
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:31,550
Sister.

228
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,550
Are you satisfied with this?

229
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,480
What are you doing?

230
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,390
Dian.

231
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,950
You can’t cross the line.

232
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,400
I need a pillow. That’s all.

233
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,920
Sister, what are you thinking about?

234
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:11,910
Sister.

235
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:14,800
Good night.

236
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,360
Good night, Dian.

237
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,960
It’s so easy

238
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,510
to make you happy.

239
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,960
It would be great

240
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,160
if I could be as happy

241
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,350
as today.

242
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:00,630
Good morning.

243
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:02,910
Good morning.

244
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,150
Mr. Yang.

245
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,560
Hello.

246
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:13,680
Where is Ms. Cheng?

247
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,320
She’s upstairs.

248
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:23,190
Cheng.

249
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,950
I don’t know why the landlord came here.

250
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,160
Good.

251
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,800
My house

252
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,470
has been rented out for so many years.

253
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,880
This is the first time I met a tenant

254
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,960
who cherished the house like you.

255
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,040
I have to thank you.

256
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,360
You’re welcome.

257
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,000
What brings you here?

258
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,120
You can just tell me.

259
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,230
Actually, I’m sorry to tell you this.

260
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:52,840
But I will just be honest with you.

261
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,800
I was

262
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,150
I was arranged to work abroad.

263
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,320
So I talked about it with my wife,

264
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,990
we decided to move there.

265
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,359
So, we want to buy a house there.

266
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,440
And we were thinking to

267
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,319
put this house on sell.

268
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,030
I’m really sorry to tell you that.

269
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,950
So, you may need to move as soon as possible.

270
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,480
But you can rest assured

271
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,800
because I will pay

272
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,240
the penalty to you.

273
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,910
You don’t need to feel sorry.

274
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:24,839
I totally understand it.

275
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,040
Thanks.

276
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:27,599
But

277
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,800
you need to consider more things

278
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,950
since it’s related to your whole family.

279
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,520
It sounds easy to buy a house abroad.

280
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:35,750
But you need to consider

281
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,790
a lot of things.

282
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,510
I used to

283
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,390
live for some time abroad.

284
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,830
If you want to buy a house,

285
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,000
it’s better if you rent one before you buy one.

286
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,440
Really?

287
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,160
And house price here

288
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,720
is still increasing.

289
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,280
It’s not the best option to sell it now.

290
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,240
Moreover,

291
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,710
if you want to come back later,

292
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,470
you would still

293
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,550
have a place to live.

294
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,110
I have a friend

295
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,990
who specializes in planning domestic property.

296
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,390
I can give his number

297
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,150
to you if you need.

298
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,320
You can consult him anytime.

299
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:06,590
Okay.

300
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,160
I haven’t thought about that before.

301
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,000
I still need to talk about it with my wife.

302
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:14,760
Thank you.

303
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:15,710
You’re welcome.

304
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,000
I gotta go back now.

305

-Let me walk you out.-Okay.

306
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:22,750
Goodbye.

307

308
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,560
It’s okay.

I knew you’d be here.

311
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,950
Did you turn off your phone?

He found me in the morning

315
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,960
and asked me to tell you

316
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,080
to go to the physics lab for a meeting now.

317
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,950
I’m fine. You should go.

318
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:46,710
Hold on.

Cheng,

325
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,480
can you come to the welfare house now?

00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,390
Okay.

[The Second Welfare House of Linxi]

328
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,750
I’m sorry to have you

329
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,040
come all the way here.

330
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,950
You don’t need to say that to me.

331
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,520
What did the doctor say about your leg?

332
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,310
This time, the fall

333
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,600
caused a more serious leg injury.

334
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,270
If you can recuperate well,

335
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,470
it is still possible to stand up.

The doctor said

337
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,400
I need two operations.

338
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,840
It would

339
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,190
cost me a fortune.

340
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,390
I’ve borrowed from all the people I know.

00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,320
I know it.

695
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,120
I just hope you

696
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,560
can be happy

697
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,680
and do what you want.

698
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,040
So,

699
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,560
do not torture yourself anymore.

700
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,280
Or I will feel sad.

701
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,400
Stop feeling sorry

702
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,960
and live well, okay?

703
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,560
Okay.

704
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:35,800
My sweetheart,

705
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,240
don’t get hurt.

706
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,200
Don’t get ill.

707
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,480
Don’t suffer.

708
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,960
Eat on time.

709
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,120
Sleep well.

710
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,120
Live well.

711
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,120
I love you.

712
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:54,520
Mom.

713
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,330
I love you too.

714
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,440
Mom. Mom!

715
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:36,640
Mom!

716
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:39,480
Goodbye.

717
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,280
Thanks, Dian.

718
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,570
Look at this.

719
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:08,800
Your kid scratched my boy like this.

720
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,960
I can’t even look at his face.

721
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,530
I’m sorry. I’m terribly sorry.

722
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,240
Let me take him to the hospital.

723
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:16,880
I will pay the medical expense.

724
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:17,880
It’s not about that.

725
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,720
Get away!

726
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,560
Don’t take it on my mother.

727
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:21,800
Look at your kid.

728
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,920
Is this how you educated her?

729
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:23,850
If she doesn’t have a father,

730
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,490
you should educate her well.

731
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,160
She’s so spoiled and naughty.

732
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,040
None of your business. Get away!

733
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,080
Cheng, what are you talking about?

734
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:40,010
I’ve educated my my kid.

735
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,680
If you still think it’s not enough,

736
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,000
you can beat me.

737
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,880
Never mind. Let’s go.

738
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,000
I know

739
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,080
I’m not a qualified mother.

740
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,200
But I will try my best.

741
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:16,650
Sweetheart.

742
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,200
It’s also the first time for me to be a mother.

743
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:23,880
So,

744
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,040
I may also make mistakes.

745
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,160
I will improve myself.

746
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,680
Can you give me more time?

747
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,880
I will give you

748
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,930
a brighter future

749
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,890
and provide you with better education.

750
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,120
If you

751
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:44,280
are concerned about your father,

752
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,160
I can only say that I’m sorry.

753
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:51,920
Because

754
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:54,960
I don’t know where he is either.

755
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,480
But I’ll make it up for you.

756
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,560
A father’s love that you missed.

757
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:12,440
I have never thought like that.

758
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,320
I don’t need a father.

759
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,080
I just need you.

760
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:18,280
I beat that boy

761
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,440
because he said you are a bad woman,

762
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,200
a fox that no one wants.

763
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,400
That’s why I beat him.

764
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:24,800
They can say badly of anything

765
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:27,080
but you. I won’t allow that.

766
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:28,810
You’re the best mother.

767
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,160
From the bottom of my heart.

768
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:32,480
Mom.

769
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,560
Thank you.

770
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,530
Thanks for giving birth to me.

771
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,000
Thanks for giving me everything.

772
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,000
Dian, Dian! What’s wrong?

773
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,400
Dian, Dian!

774
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,680
Wake up! Don’t scare me!
