Episode 17

5
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,410
Is it so hard to answer?

6
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,009
You think I succeed by luck.

7
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,390
You just don't trust my ability.

8
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,539
It's not about trust.

9
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,470
I think you

10
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,050
are simply not fit for the show business.

11
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,280
Why can't you just

12
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,960
go back to college and study?

13
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,820
Study?

14
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,150
I'm not cut out for that!

15
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,940
Pei Xiaoyun.

16
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:03,880
I quit.

17
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,200
I'm dropping out!

18
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,600
Lian Ruoshen!

19
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,140
Pei Xiaoyun,

20
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,570
the more you look down on me,

21
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,370
the more I have to prove myself.

22
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,760
Cheng,

23
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,620
do you think I'm wrong?

24
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,130
Neither of you is wrong.

25
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,280
You just have different standpoints.

26
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,950
Boss, boss!

27
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,890
Boss, you need to stop!

28
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,140
Back off! Mind your own self.

29
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,850
I'll leave then ...

30
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,070
How can she look down on me?

31
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,830
Can't she tell

32
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,190
how hardworking and capable I am?

33
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,290
Kun,

34
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:16,780
tell me,

35
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,110
am I suitable for being a star?

36
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,860
Of course.

37
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,710
I knew you'd get me.

38
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,070
You're the best.

39
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,750
They say I'm not respectful.

40
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,390
Well, I can only be respectful

41
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:40,230
to someone respectable.

42
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,310
Zhou Yao, that scum,

43
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,510
he doesn't deserve my respect!

44
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,540
If it were you,

45
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:49,079
Dian,

46
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,110
Baoling, or Lu Bie,

47
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,310
I would certainly respect you guys!

48
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:55,850
Boss,

49
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,829
to be frank,

50
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,030
let's put him aside.

51
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,970
What about the other staff

52
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,420
who's been working so hard on site?

53
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:04,960
They have done nothing wrong!

54
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,240
How do they deserve this?

55
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,350
I don't care.

56
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,730
I didn't mean it.

57
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,709
I just feel so wronged.

58
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,310
Sober now?

59
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,880
You're getting expelled,

60
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,240
and are you still here drinking?

61
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,270
Get up now! We are finding Xiaoyun together.

62
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:35,980
I'm not...

63
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,770
going...

64
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:47,420
Guys!

65
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,180
Who's paying the bill?

66
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:51,870
Not me...

67
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,150
He's played truant too many times.

68
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,480
And the trending

69
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,580
also has a bad impact.

70
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,510
Now the college wants

71
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,140
to expel him.

72
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,420
The dirt on the internet is dealt with.

73
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,270
And the PR

74
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,550
has got a few solutions.

75
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,830
As for the truancy

76
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,250
it's really tricky.

77
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:19,670
Xiaoyun,

78
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,650
I don't want any expulsion.

79
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,070
Is it possible to apply for

80
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,090
a suspension.

81
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,240
Let's wait until the furor dies down,

82
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,170
and then bring him back in college.

83
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,190
He's still a student now.

84
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,640
Study is his priority.

85
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,710
Plus, now is a key stage.

86
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,980
The suspension would

87
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,740
definitely have a negative impact on him.

88
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,770
Now that

89
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,790
it's already so bad on the internet,

90
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,990
you might as well step away from

91
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,440
the showbiz and come back to college

92
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,080
to find a practical and stable job later.

93
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,710
That's good for your own future.

94
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,080
Who are you

95
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,770
to make decisions for me?

96
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,560
Lian Ruoshen!

97
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,280
Don't talk to her like that.

98
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,160
I want a dropout.

99
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,760
I don't want to regret when I'm old

100
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,700
that I didn't try my best

101
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,560
because I'm afraid when I'm young.

102
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,360
What kind of life is that?

103
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,160
Xiaoyun.

104
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,780
He's a grownup.

105
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,760
He can take responsibility

106
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,510
for his own life.

107
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,930
We can give him advice,

108
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,480
but we can't decide for him..

109
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,170
No matter what he chooses, itâ€™s fine

110
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,410
as long as he can take responsibility for it.

111
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,700
We'll see ourselves out.

112
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,159
There's an event for tomorrow.

113
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,970
Thank you so much for

114
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:41,950
helping me with this.

115
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,470
Please, stay.

116
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,810
Today's the opening day.

117
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,400
They are coming to my dance classes.

118
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,340
Just stay in with me for a while.

119
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,200
Come on, I have to do my makeup.

120
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,990
I think you look fine without it.

121
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,390
So I don't look good with it?

122
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,180
Of course you do.

123
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,820
I just don't want the others to see.

124
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,020
Dian, stop it.

125
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,120
I got plans later.

126
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,460
I just want to hide you away,

127
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,080
so that you are mine only.

128
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,030
I am yours only.

129
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,010
Now give it back, will you?

130
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,330
Let me do your makeup!

131
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,620
Fine.

132
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,860
But if you screw up there,

133
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,220
I'll punish you.

134
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,330
Are we done?

135
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,250
Just a moment.

136
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,870
Good! It's done!

137
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,809
Isn't that cute?

138
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,049
It's not?

139
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,030
Sure.

140
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,850
And let's make you cute too.

141
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:55,930
Alright.

142
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,290
That's what I call cute.

143
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,190
You are not taking it off.

144
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,470
It's so childish!

145
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,050
I like it childish.

146
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,240
Still want to take it off?

147
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,950
Fine then.

148
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,150
Come, let's go have breakfast.

149
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,010
I'm so hungry.

150
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,290
Cheng, someone's here to see you.

151
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:35,790
Get inside.

152
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,970
There's no need to hide anymore.

153
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,600
So she didn't tell you.

154
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,960
We have already met twice.

155
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,510
I'll go make some tea.

156
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,470
Don't bother.

157
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,150
It's him that I want,

158
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,810
not you.

159
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,210
That's yours to decide,

160
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,750
but I'll make it anyway.

161
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,030
Have a good chat. I'll be right there.

162
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,730
Cute hairstyle.

163
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,560
Do you want me to help you take it off?

164
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,810
What do you want?

165
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,350
It's such an eyesore!

166
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,110
What have you become

167
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,340
since you got involved with her!

168
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,050
Someone I want to be.

169
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,150
So this is what you want,

170
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,690
to be sleazy?

171
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,530
Why would you

172
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,630
always disparage me?

173
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:43,730
I've had enough.

174
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,000
Has your father come to you

175
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,010
because of the stocks?

176
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,990
He is such an egotist who'd

177
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,450
do anything for his own benefit.

178
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,910
I once thought that

179
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,270
as selfish as he is, he wouldn't

180
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,120
purloin from his own child.

181
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,210
Looks like I've overestimated him.

182
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,840
You are a grown man.

183
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,230
I never wanted you to get involved

184
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,780
in such dirty deeds.

185
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,500
But he came to you behind my back

186
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,780
and tried to estrange us, so that

187
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,960
he can have Jiang's Group all to himself.

188
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,280
In no case will I ever tolerate it.

189
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,530
I build all this with my bare hands.

190
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,980
How come he gets to have it all?

191
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,000
I understand, you're mad at me.

192
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,900
But I hope you can deal with this issue

193
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,650
rationally.

194
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,750
Do think twice about it.

195
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,110
Do not let him take advantage of you.

196
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,470
All that I've done,

197
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,230
I've done it for your future.

198
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,690
You really should take my side.

199
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,100
All the things I do

200
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,950
is for your own good.

201
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:01,960
That's why I sent you to business school

202
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,280
and why I ask you to leave her.

203
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,470
Are you done now?

204
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,840
Then you can go.

205
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,560
You have no experience at all.

206
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,140
And you don't understand

207
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,380
how complicated this society is.

208
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,650
That's why you have to listen to me...

209
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,060
You both keep on saying

210
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,070
that you are doing this for me,

211
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,230
but neither of you

212
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,640
really cares about me.

213
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,700
Both of you, couldn't even

214
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,980
spare a little time for me

215
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:22,990
and now you all come to me

216
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,270
just to snatch at your own benefits.

217
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,150
I'm not a fool!

218
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,300
I can tell who truly cares about me

219
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,540
and who's putting on a show!

220
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,280
Don't waste your time on me.

221
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,400
I have no interest in the stocks at all.

222
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,070
What's yours is yours.

223
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,320
And I hope you can step away

224
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,860
from my life. I'm begging you!

225
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,270
Please! Let go of me.

226
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,810
Jiang Dian, what are you talking about?

227
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,980
Letting go of you?

228
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,210
For whom did I do at this?

229
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,310
Do you have no conscience?

230
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,720
For me? How can you say that?

231
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,610
This is just an excuse for

232
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,410
refusing to resign yourself to my disobedience,

233
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,160
isn't it?

234
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,490
Calm down.

235
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,810
That's not gonna solve the problem.

236
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,750
How could he get so rebellious

237
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,510
if it weren't because of you?

238
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,030
Please leave now.

239
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:48,920
I want to see Zhou Yao.

240
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,550
You alright?

241
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,080
Cheng,

242
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,160
please just forget about

243
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,890
what happened today, alright?

244
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,350
Dian,

245
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:17,130
now that I've decided to accept you,

246
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:19,770
I would accept all of you.

247
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,330
So,

248
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,450
are you willing to share your past

249
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,860
with me now?

250
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,230
You know what?

251
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,830
They haven't come to me as many times

252
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,380
in those 19 years as in the last few days.

253
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,490
When I was little,

254
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,030
my classmates envied me.

255
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,790
They said I live in a wealthy family,

256
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,120
in a big house, and my parents aren't strict.

257
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:47,710
I could do whatever I want.

258
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,130
But they don't know,

259
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,590
I'm all alone even when I'm sick.

260
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,090
Once

261
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,020
I got a high fever, but I

262
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,130
didn't ring her till I thought I was gonna die.

263
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,290
And she told me

264
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,620
to stop making trouble for her.

265
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:03,850
I never rang her up

266
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,910
for help since then.

267
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,790
Hello? Mommy.

268
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,550
I'm in the middle of something.

269
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,650
What's wrong?

270
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:18,460
When will you be back, mommy?

271
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,130
I'm sick again.

272
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,380
Again? How?

273
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,650
I've told you already.

274
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,710
You're a big child now.

275
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,460
You should know how to take care

276
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,380
of yourself, okay?

277
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,420
Mom, when will you get back?

278
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,740
I miss you.

279
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,590
Son, listen,

280
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,350
I'm on something really important.

281
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:35,670
Alright,

282
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,210
I'll call the ambulance for you.

283
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,700
They'll take over.

284
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,770
I'll go home as soon as I'm done here, okay?

285
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,830
Be a good boy.

286
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,370
I really have to go.

287
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,430
When will you be back, mom?

288
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,050
I miss you...

289
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,670
The other kids,

290
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,600
when they're sick or bullied, they have

291
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,920
their parents beside them.

292
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:02,770
But I don't.

293
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,060
Worse still,

294
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:08,450
my mom blamed it all on me.

295
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,750
So, I sneaked out to a park

296
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,520
and spent the whole night there.

297
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:16,150
She didn't even ring me,

298
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,260
let alone looked for me.

299
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,500
It was the stranger I met,

300
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,650
a little girl,

301
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,470
who consoled and encouraged me.

302
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,530
She said that

303
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,760
if I got bullied,

304
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,210
just return it.

305
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,330
Or else I'll just keep on being bullied.

306
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,350
So, from then on,

307
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,460
that's what I do.

308
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,420
If you got bullied,

309
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,840
fight back.

310
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,830
There's no use crying here.

311
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,040
They won't stop it because you

312
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,270
look pitiful.

313
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,690
Then why are you crying?

314
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,370
â™«Â I want to know why you feel lonelyÂ â™«

315
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,920
You got beaten too?

316
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,430
No, I beat someone.

317
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,270
â™«Â I want toÂ stayÂ with youÂ â™«

318
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,589
But then my mom found out,

319
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,170
and she beat me.

320
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:11,339
â™«Â IÂ wannaÂ tell youÂ not toÂ be afraid of the darkÂ since Iâ€™m hereÂ â™«

321
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,880
They're unfair to my mom.

322
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,339
They can be unfair to me,

323
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:15,810
but not to my mom!

324
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:17,589
â™«Â I want to keep you warmÂ â™«

325
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,240
â™«Â But I may not deserve such happy endingÂ â™«

326
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:28,119
â™«Â Itâ€™s okay. I will rest assured if you are happyÂ â™«

327
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,060
â™«Â Love isÂ transitoryÂ â™«

328
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,530
â™«Â I can laugh while regrettingÂ â™«

329
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,180
I understand,

330
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,980
I'm not a great mom.

331
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,290
â™«Â Iâ€™ve been used to itÂ â™«

332
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,150
But I'll try my best to be one.

333
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:45,100
â™«Â Even my tears are braveÂ â™«

334
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,760
Sweetie,

335
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,980
â™«Â The moments of our memoryÂ â™«

336
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,280
it's my first time to be a mom.

337
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,960
â™«Â The answer you are looking for in every minuteÂ â™«

338
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,990
I know I have made many mistakes.

339
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:53,960
But I'll correct them.

340
00:17:54,310 --> 00:18:00,880
â™«Â I really want to shoulder everything for youÂ â™«

341
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,700
Please wait for me, okay?

342
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,660
I will definitely give you

343
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,980
a better future,

344
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,660
a better education chance.

345
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,590
â™« If our encounter is serendipity â™«

346
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,160
Mommy, I miss you.

347
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,770
â™« If I could turn back time â™«

348
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,690
â™« I would never let you go â™«

349
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,600
It must feel so good to be loved and cared

350
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,920
by your parents.

351
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,860
But I

352
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,740
â™« You don't have to care about me â™«

353
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,020
never know how it is.

354
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,880
That's why I basically

355
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,540
â™« That's the purest affection â™«

356
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,940
have meals alone

357
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,360
and go to hospital alone since then.

358
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:43,740
â™« You are the answer to my youth â™«

359
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,390
I just stand the pains.

360
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,620
Before meeting you, I've decided,

361
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:49,090
â™«Â Love isÂ transitoryÂ â™«

362
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,350
if one day I can't stand it anymore,

363
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,220
â™«Â I can laugh while regrettingÂ â™«

364
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,020
I'll leave the world once and for all.

365
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,560
There's no one that

366
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,540
cares about my existence anyway.

367
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,270
â™«Â Iâ€™ve been used to itÂ â™«

368
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:01,340
â™«Â Even my tears are braveÂ â™«

369
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:00,790
Dian

370
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,130
â™«Â The moments of our memoryÂ â™«

371
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,660
What if I tell you

372
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:09,970
â™«Â The answer you are looking for in every minuteÂ â™«

373
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,830
that girl you met back then

374
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,370
is me.

375
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:17,280
â™«Â I really want to shoulder everything for youÂ â™«

376
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,450
Would you feel better?

377
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,110
â™«Â I may feel lonely in youthÂ â™«

378
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:19,620
Dian,

379
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,530
you and I,

380
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:25,290
â™«Â I can be brave when Iâ€™m with youÂ â™«

381
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,020
we are meant to be.

382
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,860
â™«Â Time has taught usÂ â™«

383
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,400
The only thing

384
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,030
you have to know now

385
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:32,930
â™«Â to be grateful for having each otherÂ â™«

386
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,960
is that there's a person

387
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,810
on this world who truly cares

388
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,350
about you.

389
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,130
â™«Â I laugh and cry because of youÂ â™«

390
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:35,460
That's all you need to know.

391
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:42,430
â™«Â I spent all the best time with youÂ â™«

392
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,550
That's it?

393
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:49,610
â™« Staying with you is my best habit â™«

394
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,490
I have to go now.

395
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,210
I'll make it up for you tonight.

396
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:59,130
â™« Staying with you is my best habit â™«

397
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,370
Turns out that all the serendipity

398
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,520
is predestined.

399
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,500
Ruoshen! Ruoshen!

400
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,610
[Ruoshen, I love you!]

401
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,790
Ruoshen!

402
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,600
Ruoshen!

403
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,950
Look over here!

404
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,180
Over here, please!

405
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,810
Please look over here, thanks!

406
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,790
-Here!
-And here!

407
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,630
Look this way!

408
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,810
Over here, thank you!

409
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,690
Nice one.

410
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,590
Yao! Yao!

411
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,850
Yao! Yao! I love you!

412
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,040
I love you, Yao!

413
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,110
Woah, calm down, man!

414
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,150
You're really into it, eh?

415
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,740
That's a little too much.

416
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,320
Call security!

417
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,860
Come! Get him away!

418
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,810
Yao! I love you!

419
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,930
-Yao... Yao!
-Let's go.

420
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,430
Yao! I want to stay with you forever!

421
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,020
Yao! Yao!

422
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:22,950
Don't lose it.

423
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,680
They're all here to see.

424
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,760
Why a man?

425
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,360
It's boss's idea.

426
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,370
Ask him about it.

427
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:33,600
Maybe he thinks

428
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,320
a man fits you better.

429
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,100
Rumor has it that you two don't get along.

430
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,110
But judging from just now,

431
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,910
you seem to care a lot

432
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:41,740
about him. Will you explain why?

433
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,850
I saw rumors on the internet

434
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,760
saying that Ruoshen is jealous of my glamour

435
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,090
and my accomplishment,

436
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,950
and that he's been throwing dirt on me.

437
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,650
However,

438
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,100
you said it yourself it's just rumor,

439
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:58,510
therefore it shouldn't be taken seriously.

440
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:01,720
We're both signed by the Royal Entertainment.

441
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,300
Lots of people like to compare us.

442
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,060
But we actually have

443
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,780
pretty good relationship personally.

444
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:08,630
Right, Ruoshen?

445
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,180
Of course.

446
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,550
The rumors are feeble.

447
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,060
Zhou got in to the showbiz earlier than me.

448
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,560
And he is a lot steadier.

449
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,740
Though he's only a few years older,

450
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,780
he's more like an uncle to me,

451
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,940
a senior to look up to.

452
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,920
Will you please look over here?

453
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,470
That's it! Nice shot.

454
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,890
Here as well, thank you.

455
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,970
Why is it a man?

456
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,250
It's not a proper show

457
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,710
if it's not entertaining enough.

458
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:54,690
He'll surly be making

459
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,970
the headlines for the next 2 days

460
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,210
without even trying.

461
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,200
It's your idea?

462
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,010
That's how DK wants it.

463
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,900
You can talk to him

464
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,220
if you don't like it.

465
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,190
You'd better not bring Cheng Feng

466
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,640
to the Anniversary Celebration tomorrow.

467
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,450
Or it may let the boss be upset.

468
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,570
Upset? The boss

469
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,420
or yourself?

470
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,920
Well, we have to come

471
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,590
now that you

472
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,260
don't want us to.

473
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,800
Not only that.

474
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,480
We'll amaze them all.

475
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,280
Didn't you make sure in advance?

476
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:41,510
How could it be a man?

477
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:43,750
It's the company's idea.

478
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,810
What can I do?

479
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,190
I'm not authorized

480
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,820
to do much about it.

481
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:00,210
You're still mad at me?

482
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:02,760
I only wanted to...

483
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,770
It doesn't matter.

484
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,970
What matters is,

485
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,850
I know you never

486
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,000
really trusted me.

487
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,000
You know I didn't mean that.

488
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:21,720
And I trust you all the time.

489
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,560
Will you turn your face away

490
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:30,660
like this

491
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,240
if I were Cheng Feng?

492
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:37,780
Come on.

493
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,940
Go with the plan.

494
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,490
Alright.

495
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,590
[Secretary Wen (Ms. Chen)]

496
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,360
Hello?

497
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,630
Wen.

498
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:21,960
Okay.

499
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,100
Good.

500
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:24,910
I'll tell him then.

501
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,540
When did you get to know

502
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,770
the vice president of Jiang's Group?

503
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,830
The OG in Royal Entertainment,

504
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,110
one of the four biggest pop stars in China.

505
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,370
But that's all in the past.

506
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,130
Recently,

507
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,240
he was suppressed by the newcomers

508
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,130
and couldn't get

509
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,540
any resource.

510
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,700
Plus, his age is also a disadvantage.

511
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,210
He tries to change his style,

512
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,220
writing new songs,

513
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,460
trying to get back to stage again.

514
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,840
But he couldn't get a proper choreographer

515
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,080
So the new songs remain unreleased.

without knowing each other well?

520
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,370
I just want you

521
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,090

522
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,630

00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,620

Mrs. Chen, I'm not that kind of man.

526
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,660
Cheng was my beloved, too.

527
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,700
Though we've broken up now,

528
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,720
I want her to get happiness.

Is that right?

530
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,290
Then who's the one

531
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,440
that copied her dance

532
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:51,590
to win the competition

533

534
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,540
Who's the one that

535
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,170
flirted with Pang Ting

when you were still together?

538
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,770
Tell these lies to your fans,

541
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,690
No matter how,

542
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,470
get her away from Jiang Dian.

543
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,550
Fine.

544
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,320

545
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:45,790

546
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,900
is that your boyfriend?

547
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,500
Yes. Why?

548
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,350
Nothing...

549
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,150
But will you please escort

My intuition tells me that

553
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,000
he's gonna beat me up.

554
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,430
Don't worry. He dares not to.

555
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,500
Miss Cheng,

556
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,480
I do have to tell you.

557
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,240
He surely doesn't look at me

558
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,600
the same way he looks at you.

559
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,400
He was staring at me

560
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,740
so furiously like he's gonna tear me up.

561
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,110
Then he gets so gentle when you look at him.

562
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,240
Miss Cheng, maybe we should call it a day.

570

What's with that vicious stare?

571
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,560
I didn't!

572
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,780

573

who bullied me when I was little.

574

You can really hold a grudge.

00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,170
that you can't work after the surgery.

676
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,880
It's for you to spend then.

677
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,460
Thank you

678
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,850
for helping me out when I'm down.

679
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,400
I will return the favor if...

680
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,850
Find a nice place,

681
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,570
start over after this is done.

682
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,330
It's time to relish

683
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:03,960
after all this trouble.

684
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,070
Dian,

685
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,830
what about this one for tomorrow?

686
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,710
Or maybe this one?

687
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,750
What about making up for me?

688
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:43,990
Didn't you say

689
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,310
that you won't attend it?

690
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,310
This is for today,

691
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,410
the celebration is tomorrow.

692
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:50,150
I can do both.

693
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,440
No, you can't go!

694
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,860
We've talked about this.

695
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,840
I go there

696
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:57,770
to get more resource.

697
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,920
And to set roads

698
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,590
for a high-class dance studio.

699
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,440
And I asked you to come with me,

700
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,850
you're the one who can't spare time.

701
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,950
Fine. Fine. Fine!

702
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,490
You can go. In this.

703
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:15,890
This one looks good on you.

704
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,160
Dian,

705
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,190
you know what looks better?

706
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,070
What?

707
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,720
Naked.

708
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:36,930
When will you get naked then?

709
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,170
Right now.

710

[Royal Entertainment Anniversary]

711
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:02,930
Please excuse me.

712
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:03,720
Please.

713
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:06,050
Boss,

714
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,210
a toast for you.

715
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,840
Thank you for taking care

716
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,850
of Lian Ruoshen these days.

717
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:13,930
I did it for your sake.

718
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,610
Unlike someone who doesn't know better.

719
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,440
Cheng is also grateful

720
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:21,500
for offering her a chance.

721
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,570
That's why she's here.

722
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,090
Cheng.

723
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:27,310
Boss.

724
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,860
We shan't occupy you an longer.

725
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,600
Looks like

726
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,540
you are interested in that woman?

727
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,220
Who wouldn't want

728
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,540
a gorgeous woman?

729
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:00,830
I'd advise you to abandon the idea.

730
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,080
That kind of woman doesn't

731
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:05,360
deserve any trouble.

732
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,010
-Hello.
-Hi.

733
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,240
Baoling, stunning as always.

734
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,650
Thanks. How're you doing recently?

735
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,680
Look at her.

736
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,780
What a beauty queen!

737
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,970
He's still into her.

738
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,600
The way he stares...

739
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,490
What are you doing here alone?

740
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,980
Why aren't you getting

741
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,080
acquainted with all these big names

742
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,400
I just introduced you to?

743
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,130
We don't know each other

744
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:33,850
at all,

745
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,360
and then they call me "darling".

746
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,000
It's so spurious!

747
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,280
I don't like the hypocrisy.

748
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,190
That's how it works.

749
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,900
It's inevitable

750
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,270
if you want to be famous.

751
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,940
And even more.

752
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,830
Thus,

753
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,200
you have to be sure.

754
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,220
Take it,

755
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,760
or leave it.

756
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,560
If you can't take it,

757
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,150
then go home.

758
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,080
It's better for us all.

759
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,330
Baoling,

760
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,090
I understand it.

761
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,770
But just give me some time.

762
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:17,410
Mr. Wu,

763
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,150
isn't she beautiful?

764
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:30,650
Beautiful, indeed.

765
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:31,930
What a pity,

766
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,960
she's a thorny beauty.

767
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,040
We are close friends for

768
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:38,610
more than 10 years.

769
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,370
She loves a man

770
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,870
with carriage of a gentleman.

771
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:42,970
Mr. Wu,

772
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,290
isn't that how you are?

773
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:45,790
Really?

774
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,650
Why not buy her a drink?

775
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:50,670
But just not too much.

776
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,050
She can't drink much.

777
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,110
Miss Cheng,

778
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,830
I've heard all about you.

779
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,820
Excuse me, you are...

780
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,980
I'm the producer of Starry Entertainment.

781
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:13,770
I'm Wu.

782
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:16,010
I once had the pleasure to

783
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,250
see you dance.

784
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:19,230
I didn't expect

785
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:20,590
to meet you here.

786
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,790
The pleasure

787
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:23,710
is mine.

Our company is still

790
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,310
going to cooperate with Miss Cheng in the future.

792
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,520
Please, take that.

793

Please excuse me.

794
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,680
-Excuse me, I'll get you another one.
-What's the matter?
