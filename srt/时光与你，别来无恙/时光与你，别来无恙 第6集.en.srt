Episode 6

5
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,110
Now that we've made it clear,

6
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,430
it's useless to keep these things.

7
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:44,940
You can take these back.

8
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:53,670
Do you want it or not?

9
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,110
Do you have to go this far?

10
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,630
We'll have to break up sooner or later.

11
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,710
Why drag it out?

12
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,830
Does what you said last time still count?

13
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:22,990
If we don't bother each other anymore,

14
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,150
it counts.

15
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,350
Why are you treating me like this?

16
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,070
You clearly care about me.

17
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,230
Why did you push me away?

18
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,350
How long can this relationship last?

19
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,230
Maybe it should stop here.

20
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,340
That's what's best for you and me.

21
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,380
If I have done something

22
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,630
that made you misunderstood,

23
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,350
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,030
I'll be careful in the future.

25
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,150
It's a misunderstanding?

26
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:05,910
Yes.

27
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,430
Cheng Feng, let me ask you one last time.

28
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,230
Is it a misunderstanding?

29
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,030
Okay, stop drinking.

30
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:47,910
Tell me.

31
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,670
Why did you go on leave these days?

32
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,829
Why do you drink as soon as you come back?

33
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:56,030
Come on, this one's on me.

34
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,030
Don't be an eyesore here.

35
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,740
Go home and sleep.

36
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,230

38
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,910
Hey, Dian, are you home?

39
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,030
I'm looking for you now.

40
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,870
I have a surprise for you.

41
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,780
It's related to Miss Goddess.

42
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:16,829
I promise…

43
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,910
Okay, stop drinking.

44
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,870
Go back to bed and get some sleep.

45

I have to work now.

Hurry up, go home.

49

You're cute, buddy.

Come on, let's have a drink.

53

Get lost!

Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

60
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,470
How dare you?

61
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,350
I'll kill you.

62
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,550
Don't hit him.

Damn it.

70
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,540
What happened to you?

71
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,190
Who beat you up?

72
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,790
Why did you drink so much?

73
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:35,790
Dian.

Say something!

Who beat you up? Tell me!

76
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,420
I'll help you take revenge.

77
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,510
It's settled. It doesn’t matter.

78
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,230
Why did you drink so much after it’s settled?

79
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,950
I know the answer.

80
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,790
Who could have hurt you like this?

81
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,150
Besides her, who else could it be?

82
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:57,790
Dian.

83
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,950
Look, you two haven't even gotten together,

84
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,790
and she had hurt you like this.

85
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,070
If you really get together,

86
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,030
you'd have to sacrifice half of your life.

87
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,700
An ice mountain like her

88
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,950
takes a man like fire

89
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,630
to warm her.

90
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,310
Someone likes me.

91
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,870
Dian, don't get the wrong idea.

92
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,110
I just think that

93
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,990
both of you are the cool type.

94
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,190
Together, you two argue all the time.

95
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,390
If you date someone like Yun

96
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,030
who is gentle and docile,

97
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,950
it would be more suitable for you.

98
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,230
Of course,

99
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,390
you don't like Yun.

100
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:34,830
You also think we are not suitable for each other?

101
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,299
I mean…

102
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,630
Look at me.

103
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,190
I almost forgot why I came here.

104
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,110
I have two pieces of good news for you.

105
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:45,990
One is that

106
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,830
we all passed the exam.

107
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,230
We can be on the show.

108
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:53,990
And the other one is that

109
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,550
tomorrow is Yun's birthday.

110
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,030
We made a date

111
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,670
to go to the suburbs of Fenglin Mountain scenic spot

112
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,620
to have a

113
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,060
big two-day party.

114
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,750
I'm not going.

115
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,830
You should come. Just to take a break.

116
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,350
No, I won't.

117
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,910
Word on the street.

118
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,390
She'll be there, too.

119
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,020
Are you sure you're not going?

120
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,590
Does it matter to me

121
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,630
whether she goes or not?

122
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,070
Chengcheng, I'm here to pick you up.

123
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,110
I said I wouldn't go.

124
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,060
Dian is not coming.

125
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,150
You don't have to mind about that.

126
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,950
Although you are not destined to be together,

127
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,150
and you can't be my sister-in-law,

128
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,630
we are still friends.

129
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,790
It’s Yun's birthday today.

130
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,310
If you don't go, she'll be sad.

131
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,950
Come on, let's go.

132
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,950
-Cheng, come on.
-Miss Goddess.

133
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:04,870
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

134
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,910
Let's go, Miss Goddess.

135
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,300
I'll be sad if you don't go.

136
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,940
- Let's go.
- Come with us.

137
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,630
Breathe in the fair breath.

138
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,870
Another day of happiness and beauty.

139
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,460
It's been a long time, Blackie.

140
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,220
Next time we meet,

141
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,910
you don’t need to make such a big salute.

142
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,430
Why are you here?

143
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,870
Why can't I be here?

144
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,550
Besides me, there's someone else.

145
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,710
Dian.

146
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,550
Why are you here?

147
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,550
Don't get me wrong, Chengcheng.

148
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:58,950
When I arrived,

149
00:10:58,990 --> 00:10:59,910
he was already here.

150
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,790
It was cold.

151
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,620
I was kind to invite him to wait in my car.

152
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,910
Dian... Dian...

153
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:08,390
We thought you wouldn't come.

154
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,750
If you hadn't helped us with our exams,

155
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,070
we would probably cry at home now.

156
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,150
We wouldn’t have a chance to hang out.

157
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,950
Yes, thank you, Dian.

158
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,940
Okay, thank him later.

159
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,230
Let's go get our stuff.

160
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,020
Let’s go inside.

161
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,340
Didn't you say you wouldn't come?

162
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:23,710
I changed my mind.

163
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,620
Changed your mind.

164
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,380
It's because of Cheng.

165
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,900
What's wrong with you? Go, go, go.

166
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:32,590
Watch out!

167
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,110
What’s wrong with you?

168
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,030
Are you blind?

169
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,870
Who are you?

170
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,550
Are you okay?

171
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,990
Do you want to go to the hospital?

172
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,550
Don't be pretentious.

173
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,820
You almost hit someone with your car.

174
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,470
Do you aware of that?

175
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,110
What are you doing?

176
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,390
What are you doing?

177
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,990
I don't fight with women.

178
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,550
It's fate that

179
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,870
we meet here.

180
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,950
Why are you still here?

181
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:08,790
Let’s go.

182
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,670
- Chengcheng.
- We’re colleagues and you

183
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,830
don’t even say hello to me.

184
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,750
You’re so heartless.

185
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,430
But someone, for her own interests,

186
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,870
even used and betrayed her friend.

187
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,980
That is truly heartless.

188
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,990
Right, Baoling?

189
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,020
Chengcheng, don't listen to her nonsense.

190
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,660
-She is…
-Whether she is heartless or not

191
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,510
is my business.

192
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,590
What does it have to do with you?

193
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,230
If you want to

194
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,180
talk about the past,

195
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,180
just shut it.

196
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,750
Don't play a one-man show here.

197
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:37,950
It's not good.

198
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,230
And a waste of our time.

199
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,990
If you want to act,

200
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,510
go back to your stage.

201
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,060
Chengcheng, don't be angry.

202
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,590
We actually…

203
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,190
Can we leave now?

204
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,950
Get in the car, we're about to shoot.

205
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,340
Dear students,

206
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,270
good afternoon, everyone.

207
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,180
We had an accident just now.

208
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,230
It may spoil everyone's time.

209
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,380
After thinking,

210
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,700
I’ve decided to have a

211
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,750
shooting competition.

212
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,550
The team that wins

213
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,950
doesn’t need to do the chores.

214
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,150
And the losing team

215
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,860
has to do all the chores.

216
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:40,990
Before working,

217
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,270
we should have fun first.

218
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,670
The rule is to

219
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,700
work in pairs.

220
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,230
Come to me

221
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,150
to draw lots in this box.

222
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,870
The people that draw the same color is a team.

223
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,710
Finally, I wish you all good luck

224
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,550
and successful.

225
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:53,590
Come on!

226
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,750
Come on, you guys take it.

227
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,390
Chengcheng, I was wrong.

228
00:13:58,990 --> 00:13:59,910
I shouldn't have hired people to

229
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,510
slander Zhou Yao without telling you.

230
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,150
And let Pang Ting find out.

231
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,350
Chengcheng, I'm sorry.

232
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,870
I've caused you so much trouble.

233
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,230
But don't worry.

234
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,310
No matter we are

235
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:09,990
on the same team or not,

236
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,660
I will protect you.

237
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,620
Yun.

238
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,430
Miss Goddess, Yun.

239
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,150
You three, stop talking.

240
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,750
Draw lots first. Come on.

241
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,980
Yun, I'm with you.

242
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,590
Dian, you and I are in a team.

243
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,710
How about we...

244
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,030
It's a pity that we're not together this time.

245
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,710
If you want to switch,

246
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,790
it's not too late.

247
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,310
I don't want to switch. No.

248
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:56,950
Lu Biebie,

249
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,230
come here for a second.

250
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,790
Good brother, I need your help.

251
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,740
You bully me all the time.

252
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,750
Now we're buddies?

253
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,950
You want to change teams?

254
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,230
No way.

255
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,670
You'll win more easily with Dai Baoling.

256
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,910
Yun needs protection.

257
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,190
She's so weak, she'll hold you back.

258
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,950
I'm doing it for your own good.

259
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,220
It's okay. I don't want to win at all.

260
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:30,750
You...

261
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,820
What? You want to switch teams?

262
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,510
Is it that hard for you

263
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,340
to be my teammate?

264
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:50,350
[Cheng Feng, Chai Jin, Jiang Dian, Li Zikun, Pei Xiaoyun, Lu Bie, Lian Ruoshen, Dai Baoling]

265
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,630
Game on!

266
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,430
Let's go!

267
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,270
Lian Ruoshen, what's wrong with you?

268
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,260
I'm your teammate.

269
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,310
You shot me?

270
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:22,710
I'm sorry.

271
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,900
For the sake of Yunyun,

272
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:24,950
I have to kill you.

273
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:25,830
You!

274
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,350
Wait a minute.

275
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,150
Let me pick up the gun first.

276
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,030
Then we can fight.

277
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,940
Don't move!

278
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,510
How come it's you?

279
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,060
What's up, Yunyun?

280
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,790
Are you stunned

281
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,590
by my invincible handsome?

282
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,020
Yunyun, you're too clumsy!

283
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,590
I'll beat you up if you say anything.

284
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,030
You’re bullying me.

285
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,670
I can't die yet, if I die

286
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,910
who will protect you.

287
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:06,579
I'll let you win and

288
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,630
create you an unforgettable birthday memory.

289
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,260
First Blood.

290
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,579
I can't listen to it anymore.

291
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,630
Goose bumps all over the place.

292
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:20,990
Lu Biebie,

293
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,980
how dare you attack me?

294
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,060
You should blame yourself.

295
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:26,190
Haven’t you realized?

296
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,109
It is this our tactic.

297
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,430
She's in the light, I'm in the dark.

298
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,820
All right.

299
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,430
No matter what choice you make.

300
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,230
I won't blame you.

301
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,460
It's just a shame that

302
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,270
I can’t accompany you to the end.

303
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,020
Again?

304
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,070
You're disgusting, full of nonsense.

305
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,390
I learned it from you.

306
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,190
Yunyun,

307
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,270
don't go with him.

308
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,990
I'll find a place for you to “hide”

309
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,350
until the end.

310
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,270
What do you mean by “hide”?

311
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,430
It means finding a place to hide.

312
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,260
Be sneaky. Attack people in their back.

313
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:15,830
Go!

314
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,030
Dian! Dian!

315
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:21,910
Where are you?

316
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,110
I'm going to find you now, Dian.

317
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,190
I'm sorry.

318
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,510
It's okay. I died in your hands.

319
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,150
I’m okay with it.

320
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,550
Double kill.

321
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:48,870
You…

322
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:52,830
What a coincidence.

323
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,860
We're both dead.

324
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:56,990
Wait for me.

325
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:14,710
Cheng,

326
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,030
I'm sorry.

327
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,710
It's true that even the best brothers

328
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,950
means nothing to love.

329
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,780
Holy…!

330
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,030
What kind of thing was that?

331
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,060
He shot you?

332
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,310
Why am I always the one who gets hurt?

333
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,710
Was that Jiang Dian just now?

334
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,910
Damn, I was scared to death!

335
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,350
You're still alive.

336
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,580
Not for long.

337
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,340
Now it's just me and Jiang Dian.

338
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,950
I can't beat him.

339
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,420
Why don't I just kill myself?

340
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,190
You won.

341
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,340
What happened?

342
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,460
I don't know.

343
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,710
We'll have to break up sooner or later.

344
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,790
Why drag it out?

345
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,540
Why hasn't Dian come yet?

346
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,580
Do you want me to eat the skin?

347
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,070
Or do you want me to eat the core?

348
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,190
I…

349
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,350
I never peel my apples.

350
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:12,870
My father said

351
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,430
the nutrition of apples is in the skin.

352
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,910
Why don't you eat it with the skin?

353
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,270
Did your father tell you that

354
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,700
you can't be too lustful?

355
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,070
You even killed your teammate.

356
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,670
Okay, I'll put up with it.

357
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,590
It was my fault.

358
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,670
I don't know how to peel an apple.

359
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:35,630
I'll peel an orange

360
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,460
for you then.

361
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,910
Boss, do you have a grudge against apples?

362
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,060
Say a word, and I’ll hold a grudge against you.

363
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,190
Who will be the winner?

364
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,070
What do you say?

365
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,150
I hope Yun wins.

366
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,500
But it's not very likely.

367
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,110
I think it might be

368
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,020
Miss Goddess.

369
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,710
You all guessed wrong.

370
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,630
That's it!

371
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,030
In the end, someone won without an effort.

372
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,350
It’s still a win.

373
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,700
Come on, have an orange.

374
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,110
Have an orange.

375
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:27,830
Where's Chengcheng?

376
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,670
Chengcheng is not back?

377
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,900
She should have come back long ago.

378
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,590
She probably went somewhere to heal.

379
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,350
She's upset right now.

380
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,670
If you go now,

381
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,110
it will be trouble for her.

382
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,900
Have you forgotten what you've done?

383
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,790
What about Dian?

384
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,310
Why do you treat me like this?

385
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,580
You clearly care about me.

386
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,700
Why did you push me away?

387
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,180
If I have done something

388
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,390
that made you misunderstood,

389
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,110
I'm sorry.

390
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:26,870
I'll be careful in the future.

391
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,070
Cheng Feng,

392
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,950
what should I do with you?

393
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,860
[Danger, please stay away]

394
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:25,990
Kun.

395
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:29,300
Chengcheng didn't

396
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,790
bring her phone with her.

397
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,790
You guys eat first, I'll go find her.

398
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:36,870
Dian is there,

399
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:37,750
don’t panic.

400
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,060
Dian.

401
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:48,950
Where are your shoes?

402
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:50,630
Have you seen Chengcheng?

403
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,500
She hasn't come back yet.

404
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,460
Let's split up and go look for her.

405
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,150
Okay.

406
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,700
How does it feel to be betrayed by your best friend?

407
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,470
It seems you're not hurt that bad

408
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,550
as I thought you would be.

409
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,230
Of course, you’re used to it.

410
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,190
-After all…
-What?

411
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,070
After all, it's better than that you have been giving for years

412
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:22,780
and not getting anything back.

413
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,780
The pain of not getting a response

414
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,670
is nothing compared to this.

415
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,270
Shut up!

416
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,110
Who are you to judge me?

417
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,350
The one who was betrayed and

418
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:32,190
the one who was abandoned is you.

419
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,070
Not me.

420
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,220
Now even your best friend

421
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,070
is also hurting you.

422
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,830
Do you think your life is sad?

423
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,230
Do you know how cold it would be

424
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:43,710
to fall from here?

425
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,860
Lunatic, are you threatening me?

426
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,550
If you're afraid,

427
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,230
don't bother me anymore.

428
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,790
And don't bother the people around me.

429
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,750
Didn't you say that

430
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,190
I'm lunatic?

431
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,510
So, don't mess with me.

432
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,230
Zhou Yao may be a treasure

433
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,820
to you.

434
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,630
But to me,

435
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,390
he is nothing.

436
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:09,860
You’d better not be too arrogant

437
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,380
or you won't even know how you’ll die.

438
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:31,830
Cheng Feng, Cheng Feng.

439
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,060
Chengcheng, Chengcheng.

440
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,430
- Chengcheng. Ms. Cheng.
- Cheng.

441
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,260
Cheng,

442
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,190
- Miss Goddess
- Ms. Cheng.

443
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,550
Miss Goddess.

444
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,870
Chengcheng.

445
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:32,940
Chengcheng, my daughter, I miss you so much.

446
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,390
I thought I would die alone.

447
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,500
If things are better,

448
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,870
it would be a sunny day.

449
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:29,990
If things are worse,

450
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,750
there's nothing worse than

451
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,660
the life I'm living.

452
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,180
But then you show up unannounced,

453
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,110
You saw the miserable,

454
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,820
broken, pathetic me.

455
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:41,550
Dian,

456
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,590
can I really be with you?

457
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,350
It’s my fault.

458
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,790
If it wasn't my birthday,

459
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,750
we wouldn't have come here to play,

460
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,780
and Chengcheng wouldn't have been in danger.

461
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,420
Chengcheng, I'm sorry.

462
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:11,870
Girl,

463
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,260
how can you sleep so sound?

464
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,150
Wake up and hit me!

465
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,150
You can hit me as many times as you want.

466
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,830
Don't cry, it's bad luck to cry.

467
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,420
I'm not crying.

468
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,110
Chengcheng is just asleep.

469
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,750
Let's wait for her to wake up.

470
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,350
Are you crying?

471
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:00,580
Not your business.

472
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,830
My friend almost died.

473
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,300
I feel bad. Is that okay?

474
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,380
It’s okay, of course.

475
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:12,220
Let alone you, I feel bad even watching it.

476
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,590
I just don't understand.

477
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,990
Why do you still do so many things for her

478
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,990
after being hurt by her so many times?

479
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,550
Is it worth it?

480
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:24,900
In a relationship,

481
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,350
there is no such thing as worth it or not.

482
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,670
Only will or won’t.

483
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,430
If you really love someone,

484
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,500
even in the face of life-threatening danger,

485
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:33,900
there will be no hesitations.

486
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,180
In a relationship, the one

487
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,590
who is more devoted

488
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,790
is humbler.

489
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:53,940
What are you doing?

490
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,070
His feet are cold.

491
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,110
Let me keep them warm.

492
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:19,110
Baoling, Chengcheng seems to be awake.

493
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,060
Chengcheng,

494
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,430
you're awake?

495
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,540
Stop looking for him. He's fine.

496
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,390
It's not too late to go see him

497
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:45,710
when you feel better.

498
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:48,870
It's good that you're okay.

499
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:49,910
You didn't know.

500
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,460
We were worried sick about you.

501
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,780
I'm sorry

502
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,470
for making you worry.

503
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:57,860
Chengcheng,

504
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,030
for the sake of Baoling

505
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,110
saved your life,

506
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,110
please forgive her.

507
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,710
Jiang Dian doesn't know how to swim, either.

508
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,150
But he risked his life

509
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,110
to save you.

510
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,870
Luckily, Baoling and Lian Ruoshen were there.

511
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,550
They rescued you.

512
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,830

don't hurt him anymore.

683
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,820
Let's go. Get in the car.

684
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:45,950
Dian,

685
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,660
this woman likes to hook up.

686
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:49,590
She’s seducing your girlfriend.

687
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,430
Dian,

688
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,140
did you just smile at me?

689
00:41:59,310 --> 00:41:59,900
So sweet.

690
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:00,980
Get in the car!

691
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:17,140
Are you moved?

692
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:21,980
Baoling,

693
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,740
what do you think about the result of

694
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,710
two hedgehogs in love?

695
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,580
Does it matter what the outcome is?

696
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,070
In your mind,

697
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,310
don't you already have an answer?

698
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:34,860
No matter what decision you make,

699
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,670
I will support you unconditionally.

700
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:38,350
But there is a premise,

701
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,550
you must

702
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,700
protect yourself.

703
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:42,310
I don't want you to get hurt.

704
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,420
Thank you, Baoling.

705
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,300
For what?

706
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:49,350
I did something that

707
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:50,500
hurt you.

708
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:52,990
Just don't be angry with me.

709
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:56,070
It's not true that I'm not angry.

710
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:58,180
But...

711
00:42:58,790 --> 00:42:59,980
I'm not angry because

712
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:00,910
you did this thing.

713
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,350
It's because you hid it from me.

714
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:04,990
If it was Yun, I can understand

715
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:06,710
if she doesn’t get me.

716
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:08,470
But you know very well

717
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:09,710
how much I hate that person.

718
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,020
Yes, I was at lost,

719
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,310
I did something stupid.

720
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:16,980
I fell for Pang Ting's trick.

721
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,150
But I really can't stand

722
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,180
Zhou Yao's stupid face.

723
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,380
I'm sorry, Chengcheng.

724
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:23,990
I won't do it again.

725
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:27,430
If you know you were wrong,

726
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,190
make up for it.

727
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,540
Take me to the psychologist later.
