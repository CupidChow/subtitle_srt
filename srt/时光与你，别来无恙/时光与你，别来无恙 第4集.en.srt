Episode 4

5
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,660
Mom, I forgot that today

6
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,630
was your birthday.

7
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,500
Happy birthday, Mom!

8
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,390
Please take care of yourself!

9
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,870
The files are on the table.

10
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,720
You should choose a college today.

11
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,090
Tell me your choice tomorrow.

12
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,490
♫ When there is a sea of pear blossoms, ♫

13
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,770
♫ there is a soft mist on the river... ♫

14
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:05,610
Stop! Stop! Stop!

15
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,220
What are you doing there?

16
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,890
You, Lian Ruoshen,

17
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,430
could you follow

18
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,310
Lu Bie’s rhythm?

19
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:13,790
Me?

20
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:14,720
And Lu Bie,

21
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,610
could you cooperate with Lian Ruoshen?

22
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,060
Me?

23
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,430
You look annoying.

24
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:20,750
Annoying?

25
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,290
I also feel we are annoying.

26
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,400
Now that it’s so difficult to present
a stage play,

27
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,510
let me do a solo performance.

28
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,960
My song will definitely win.

29
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,770
This is a group activity.

30
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,130
It’s not a personal stage show.

31
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,930
Can you be more devoted?

32
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,340
Have some sense of group honor.

33
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,430
It’s all Lu Bie’s fault.

34
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:40,060
Why didn’t you follow my rhythm?

35
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,820
Why didn’t you follow my rhythm?

36
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,110
I follow your rhythm?

37
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,090
I wanted you to save face just now.

38
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,100
I didn’t say it directly.

39
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,079
Not just me.

40
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,800
Chai Jin couldn’t beat time with you.

41
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:52,510
How can you blame me?

42
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,829
You were out of tune!

43
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,120
I was speaking for you, OK?

44
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,530
OK! OK!

45
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,730
I know it’s too difficult for you.

46
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,310
But it’s for the anniversary of the college.

47
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:02,720
The theme

48
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,950
has been settled.

49
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,270
It’s not just

50
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,640
about the sense of group honor.

51
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,540
You can get more credits if you perform well.

52
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,530
Ms. Pei, we all understand it.

53
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,600
But we are a group of people without a leader.

54
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,830
I can’t dance very well.

55
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:16,980
I don’t know how to rehearse a dance, either.

56
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,000
I can accompany you.

57
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,430
Dian! Dian!

58
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,910
You’ve come.

59
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:30,970
But we need a teacher

60
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,250
to teach the professional dances.

61
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,740
It’s not that simple.

62
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,460
We found many teachers previously.

63
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,130
But none of them was very suitable.

64
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,650
How about my sister?

65
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,250
Chengcheng?

66
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,230
She won’t perform on the stage.

67
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,720
No one will ask her to perform on the stage.

68
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,260
We just ask her to give us some simple instructions.

69
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,780
Then I’ll take a try.

70
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,760
-Come on!
-Come on!

71
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,390
Come on!

72
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:00,630
Is there anything that you can’t do?

73
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,780
You said that you wouldn’t come.

74
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,320
Let me help you. Let me help you.

75
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,030
Is it very heavy?

76
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,480
Let me carry it myself. Thank you!

77
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,850
Dian, if you hadn’t come,

78
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,140
I would also come for the rescue.

79
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,770
Dian, do you want a cup of milky tea?

80
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:13,390
I’ll buy you a cup.

81
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,530
I don’t want any.

82
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,400
I also want a cup.

83
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,310
I’ll only buy one cup for Dian.

84
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:23,590
So stingy!

85
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,630
I have a rich father.

86
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,520
I’ll treat you to milky tea.

87
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,130
My dear Chengcheng,

88
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,140
please accept my invitation.

89
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:34,860
The performance at the anniversary of college

90
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,080
will bring honor to our class.

91
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,100
It’s really very important.

92
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,170
My dear Chengcheng,

93
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,590
please help us.

94
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,850
I don’t know

95
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,210
whether you have ever had such a feeling.

96
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,409
You were just over 20 years old.

97
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,480
But you felt that you were already old.

98
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,900
You were no longer passionate
when you made any effort.

99
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,970
But when I’m with my students,

100
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,070
I feel that

101
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,830
I’m young again.

102
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,980
Chengcheng, I really want to

103
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,740
to feel it.

104
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,590
You don’t know

105
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,040
how the students are making efforts.

106
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,370
It’s not difficult at all to teach them.

107
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,710
They are doing a lot of rehearsals now.

108
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,850
Have you finished your words?

109
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,630
Have a drink.

110
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,760
After I drink it,

111
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,440
can you think it over?

112
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:32,980
Try again.

113
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,210
I thought you were great performers.

114
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,830
But you were only singing da da da.

115
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,540
He has fallen down.

116
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,730
There is nothing awesome about you.

117
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,840
None of your business.

118
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,730
Go away! Otherwise, we’ll beat you!

119
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,700
It’s you who should go away.

120
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,840
Now it’s time

121
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:47,810
for our civil engineering department

122
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,600
to use this rehearsal hall.

123
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,450
You are singing some rubbish.

124
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,340
I think you’d better not perform at the anniversary.

125
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,350
Don’t lose your face.

126
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,220
You dare say that again!

127
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,090
I said

128
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,850
you were singing some rubbish.

129
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,410
Let’s fight them!

130
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,370
What are you doing? Don’t touch
our belongings!

131
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,470
Don’t come nearer!

132
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:27,940
I tell you. Don’t come nearer!

133
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:38,760
Stop!

134
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,820
This is ours!

135
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:40,390
Give it back to me!

136
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,400
We want it!

137
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:41,710
I won’t give it to you!

138
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:42,940
Stop fighting! Stop fighting!

139
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,659
Stop fighting!

140
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:51,830
Don’t drag me!

141
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,720
Stop fighting!

142
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,830
Stop fighting!

143
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,250
Chengcheng, did you think it over?

144
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,840
Hello!

145
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,370
Hello!

146
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,570
They are fighting with the people from
the civil engineering department.

147
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,370
Why are they fighting with them?

148
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,000
I’ll go there immediately.

149
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,210
Chengcheng, I need to go to the college.

150
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,580
Please think it over.

151
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,260
Are you senseless?

152
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,890
You cause trouble every day!

153
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,110
Why it’s you again?

154
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,940
I’m sorry, Sir! I’m late.

155
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,030
Ms. Pei has arrived.

156
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,130
You two can talk about

157
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,450
how to solve this issue.

158
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,230
Ms. Pei, I warned you last time they had a fight.

159
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,810
You are only

160
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,950
a few years older than them.

161
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,230
You look like one of them

162
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,590
when you are with them.

163
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,490
You might forget you are a teacher.

164
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,690
Luckily, nothing serious happened this time.

165
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,430
What if something really happens?

166
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,060
As a young assistant teacher,

167
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:11,340
you should live what you teach

168
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,190
and be a strict teacher.

169
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,460
You should teach them the disciplines.

170
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,880
They should not start a fight so easily.

171
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,820
They are bringing trouble to the teachers.

172
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,050
It’s not right not to punish them

173
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,370
this time.

174
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,550
It’s a conflict

175
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,340
between the students.

176
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,400
What does it to do with Ms. Pei?

177
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,410
Lian Ruoshen,

178
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,140
tell me what happened today first.

179
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,070
We were rehearsing the show.

180
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,570
They suddenly came here

181
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,450
and pushed our chairs.

182
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,120
They unplugged our acoustic equipment
and they were trying to take over our place.

183
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,660
Sir, that’s nonsense!

184
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,160
It was our turn to do the rehearsal.

185
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,170
But they won’t leave.

186
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,750
You should not start a fight.

187
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,560
You first offend, but you first complain.

188
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,890
You kicked my bottom and it is swelling.

189
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,770
You deserve it.

190
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:48,910
You are not as tall

191
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,060
as the dustbin outside.

192
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,820
How can you call yourself “Tall Man”?

193
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,140
My mom gave me the name “Tall Man”!

194
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,240
Your mom?

195
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:54,940
Shut up!

196
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,570
You dare quarrel here.

197
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,150
Is it your teacher’s fault

198
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:58,770
or is it because

199
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,780
you ignore the teachers?

200
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,540
Teaching without requiring, the teacher’s fault.

201
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,510
Ms. Pei,

202
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,050
do you think these poor students

203
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,370
can help you

204
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,340
become a formal employee in the college?

205
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,350
I think

206
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,020
you’d better have another plan.

207
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,400
Madam, do you know how to speak?

208
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,200
It’s none of your business

209
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,260
whether Ms. Pei will be a formal employee or not.

210
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:14,650
You...

211
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:16,500
Mr. Chen!

212
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:21,650
Ms. Liu,

213
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,110
who are poor students?

214
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,790
The intention to educate students

215
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,930
in college

216
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,030
is to endow them with the ability to

217
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,700
guide themselves

218
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,330
and correct their mistakes.

219
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,490
We should not deny, suppress,

220
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,540
despise or insult them.

221
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,830
No teacher should take the lead to do so.

222
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:39,030
You don’t know about them at all.

223
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,100
You don’t know how much effort
they’ve made.

224
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,070
How can you

225
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,340
make such comments on them?

226
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,670
Every time they have a conflict
with your civil engineering department,

227
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,170
you are always the first one to start it.

228
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,630
Before

229
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,880
blaming my students,

230
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,170
you should educate your own students first.

231
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,410
You wait for the punishment!

232
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,470
Right, Mr. Chen?

233
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,310
I have to answer a phone call.

234
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,990
Hello, Dad!

235
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,550
OK!

236
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,440
Well, Dian!

237
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,730
Professor Chen wants to see you.

238
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,810
You... Mr. Chen!

239
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,080
Sir, you can blame everything on me.

240
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,450
I’ll accept everything without saying anything.

241
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,530
Let’s go!

242
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,690
Look, Sir!

243
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,350
Yun,

244
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,900
you were so cool just now!

245
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,130
I knew

246
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,260
you would support us.

247
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,870
Put me down!

248
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,550
Lian Ruoshen, put me down!

249
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,690
Put me down!

250
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,910
I boasted about our performance.

251
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,720
You should grasp every minute
to do the rehearsal.

252
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,430
You should live up to my words.

253
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,770
You can count on me.

254
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,230
Miss, are we really

255
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,460
poor students

256
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,560
as they described?

257
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,110
What if our performance is poor...

258
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,130
It won’t be. Don’t worry.

259
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,140
There is no “what if”.

260
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:17,850
Ms. Pei,

261
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,480
did my sister accept our invitation?

262
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,780
No matter there is external support or not,

263
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,010
we should believe in ourselves

264
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,950
and hold on straight to the end. OK?

265
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,180
OK!

266
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,080
Come on!

267
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,880
Come on! Run!

268
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,740
Good afternoon, Ms. Cheng!

269
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,170
Yun asked you to come here, right?

270
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,510
Well...

271
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:11,800
Miss Goddess,

272
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,470
this competition at the anniversary

273
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,580
has extraordinary meaning for us.

274
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:16,680
We may have only one

275
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,180
such opportunity in four years.

276
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,510
This might be the only time

277
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,830
in our college years.

278
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,150
We also want to prove ourselves.

279
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,650
We want everyone to see

280
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,190
that Class Six of Business School

281
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:27,550
are not consisting of poor students.

282
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,960
We are not trouble-makers

283
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,930
who can only bring trouble to Yun.

284
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,480
Recently, other teachers of other classes

285
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,240
are looking down upon her because of us.

286
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,160
Therefore,

287
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,790
for our honor,

288
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,850
for our oath,

289
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,810
for our youth,

290
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,100
we will

291
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,110
hold on straight to the end!

292
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,360
We will do

293
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,770
whatever you want us to do.

294
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:47,880
We just hope

295
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,070
you can

296
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:49,810
think it over.

297
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,570
Is that OK?

298
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:00,990
Miss Goddess,

299
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,370
you don’t have to reply to us now.

300
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,470
You can think about it tonight

301
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,800
and tell us the answer tomorrow morning.

302
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,400
[Linxi University]

303
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,120
Let’s grasp every minute to rehearse.

304
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,570
The civil engineering department will
begin to use this place at 3 o’clock.

305
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,110
We will move to another place ten
minutes before 3 o’clock.

306
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,070
I told you we should not expect my
sister to come.

307
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,090
Now you believe it.

308
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:54,730
Guys,

309
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,460
let’s continue trying, trying our best.

310
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,020
OK. Let’s continue.

311
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,220
Ms. An,

312
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,070
let me support you.

313
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,690
-Thank you.
-Why do you come here?

314
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,140
Are you OK?

315
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,020
Let me support you to go inside.

316
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,770
You can take a rest.

317
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:24,430
I’m fine.

318
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,750
I’m not going inside.

319
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,820
I’ve come to send Mr. Chen a gift

320
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,240
prepared by the children. Then I’ll go back.

321
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,290
Did I interrupt your rehearsal?

322
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,470
No. No.

323
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,500
No. We haven’t started rehearsing.

324
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,570
Shall I ask someone

325
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,450
to go there with you?

326
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:41,680
No, you don’t have to.

327
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:42,430
I can go there

328
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,350
myself.

329
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:44,670
Go ahead.

330
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,560
I’m leaving. Bye bye!

331
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,230
Be careful!

332
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,770
OK. Thank you!

333
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,430
Chengcheng won’t come, will she?

334
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,260
Chengcheng, I know you will come.

335
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:38,750
Cheng!

336
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,360
Miss Goddess,

337
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,510
you finally come.

338
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,300
Great!

339
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,860
Let’s go inside!

340
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,750
Let’s go. Let’s rehearse the show.

341
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,250
Let’s go.

342
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,320
Chengcheng,

343
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,830
we need accompaniment.

344
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,370
When Jiang Dian knew it,

345
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,770
he joined us as an understudy.

346
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,270
He is a great help to us.

347
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,110
Therefore, you...

348
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:21,470
You don’t have to explain it to me.

349
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:22,350
Let’s get started.

350
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,130
Who can dance?

351
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,570
Miss, I can only dance Jazz,

352
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,750
but I can’t do modern dance.

353
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,780
Who can sing?

354
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,980
The King singer is here.

355
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:37,620
Who can play musical instrument?

356
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:38,670
I can play guitar.

357
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,710
I’m the Piano Prince.

358
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,190
Stop bragging. Dian is here.

359
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,510
Don’t cry later

360
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,000
on my shoulder.

361
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,190
Never!

362
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,790
I just feel I want to win.

363
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,350
OK. Please show me

364
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,360
what you can do.

365
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,370
I want to judge your levels.

366
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:15,810
OK!

367
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,070
Bro, do you think that

368
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,870
Lu Bie behaves differently today?

369
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,370
Maybe he thinks that

370
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,820
we can’t appreciate his music.

371
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,140
He played poorly on purpose.

372
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,240
Such a trick!

373
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,090
Jiang Dian is really a talented boy!

374
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,030
There is nothing he can’t do.

375
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,410
How can he be so perfect?

376
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:25,730
No wonder

377
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,830
Lian Ruoshen admires nobody

378
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,530
but him!

379
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,030
Well, Chengcheng,

380
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,670
I think you two are well-matched.

381
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:32,990
An excellent person

382
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,970
should be with

383
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,180
another excellent person.

384
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,020
We are the same type of people.

385
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,620
It seems that we are not alone.

386
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,520
But in fact, in our hearts, we are very lonely.

387
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,780
We seem to be cold and passive.

388
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,980
It’s because

389
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,180
we haven’t met the ones we care.

390
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,790
Have you had such experience?

391
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,940
When you want to get away

392
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,170
from someone,

393
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,650
he is following you like a shadow.

394
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,480
At any time or any place,

395
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:15,970
or maybe

396
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,260
at the next corner,

397
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,640
you might encounter him.

398
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,670
He will change the rhythm of your life.

399
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,480
You will gradually lose self-control

400
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:27,500
because of him.

401
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,410
You will be overcome by your feelings
because of him.

402
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,630
You’ve presented very good performance.

403
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:26,810
But you still need to make improvements.

404
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,010
We still have several days of time.

405
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,030
Come on, everybody!

406
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,510
Come on! Come on! Come on!

407
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,050
Well,

408
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,640
Chengcheng, could you arrange

409
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,000
the order of their shows?

410
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:39,970
The first show,

411
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,290
solo dance by Chai Jin,

412
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:42,920
piano accompaniment by Lu Bie.

413
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:45,820
The second show,

414
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,970
Lian Ruoshen as the leading singer.

415
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,550
Li Zikun playing guitar.

416
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,650
piano accompaniment by Lu Bie.

417
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,110
Miss Goddess,

418
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,700
how about Dian?

419
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,290
Cello at the opening and linking the shows.

420
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,370
Congratulations, Dian!

421
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,550
You will perform at the opening.

422
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:09,850
Biebie,

423
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,040
I will sit up

424
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,620
and take notice of you today.

425
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,250
In the future, we will belong to the same generation.

426
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,140
You are no longer my “son”.
You are my buddy.

427
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:17,640
Get away from me!

428
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,530
Who wants to be your buddy?

429
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,820
How about being brother and sister?

430
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,180
What are you talking about?

431
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:25,690
Now that you are not willing,

432
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,790
you can still be my “son”.

433
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,280
Let me give you a hug.

434
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,190
I pretended to be a poor pianist.

435
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:32,110
I wanted you

436
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,430
to present a solo performance.

437
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,160
Therefore, you should call me “Daddy”.

438
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,910
Really?

439
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,500
How can you become so supportive?

440
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,500
I’m so moved!

441
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,430
Let me give you a kiss.

442
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,100
Kiss him!

443
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,200
OK.

444
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,300
Kiss him!

445
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,020
Something inspired me just now.

446
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,120
I’ll show it to you.

447
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,410
Chai Jin, come here.

448
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,130
You are so busy. You don’t have to see me off.

449
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,180
It’s OK.

450
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,820
There is something I need to do later.

451
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:03,970
Otherwise, I’ll invite you to lunch.

452
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,150
These are the students

453
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,380
from Business School.

454
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:14,970
They are rehearsing a dance for the anniversary.

455
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,160
Very nice, aren’t they?

456
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,160
She dances very well.

457
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,430
Miss Goddess, you danced beautifully.

458
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,140
That’s all for today.

459
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,160
Thank you all!

460
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,980
Thank you for your help, Ms. Cheng!

461
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,880
I’m leaving. Thank you!

462
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,470
OK. Thank you, everybody!

463
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,530
When you go back,

464
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,980
please review the key points

465
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,700
Ms. Cheng has told you today.

466
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,260
You may go to have a meal.

467
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:36,190
I will stay with Chai Jin

468
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:36,980
and she will go on practicing.

469
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,000
-OK.
-OK.

470
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:38,660
Let’s go.

471
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,640
You can go on practicing.

472
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,180
-I’ll talk with Ms. Cheng.
-OK.

473
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,730
I’ll take this.

474
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,840
Chengcheng,

475
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,910
you are a great help to me today!

476
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,500
I wanted to treat you to a meal.

477
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,520
But I want to stay here

478
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,660
when Chai Jin is practicing.

479
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,260
It doesn’t matter.

480
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,580
I feel a bit tired today.

481
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:58,410
Let’s have a meal together next time.

482
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,480
OK. Go back and take a rest.

483
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,650
Dian, why are you lingering?

484
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,880
Miss Goddess is gone.

485
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:16,630
You fool.

486
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,120
This is the second phase.

487
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,220
We should use another strategy.

488
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,900
We can’t go on rushing ahead.

489
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,480
We should exert

490
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:23,620
a subtle influence

491
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,080
and it should be something out of thin air.

492
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,900
You are good at using descriptive words.

493
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,540
Of course. Who am I?

494
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,700
Cheng Feng, what’s the matter with you?

495
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,440
-Did you hear...
-Cheng Feng!

496
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,750
Did you hear

497
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,170
a beeping sound?

498
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,900
Get up. I’ll send you to hospital.

499
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,450
Are you showing care for me?

500
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,900
If it’s someone else, I’ll do the same.

501
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,960
Can you see me as someone else?

502
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,020
My arm is aching. Can you support me?

503
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,520
My leg seems to be hurt, too.

504
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,080
Let’s go to the infirmary.

505
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:24,980
OK.

506
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,360
[Infirmary]

507
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,870
Remember not to touch water these days.

508
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,800
Don’t eat stimulating food such as
spicy food and seafood.

509
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:40,860
You will recover when a scab is forming.

510
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,640
I’ll prescribe some antiphlogistic for him.

511
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:45,740
Come and take them.

512
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,560
Miss!

513
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,430
What is it?

514
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,410
You are in low spirits.

515
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,820

There must be something important.

683
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,070
You can go with him.

684
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,300
Let me take care of this place.

685
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,770
He has nothing important to tell me.

686
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,660
Cheng, I’m not happy

687
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:01,670
to hear those words.

688
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,040
Why I have nothing important to tell you?

689
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,150
I have something very important
to tell you this time.

690
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,360
My mom, your aunt, asked

691
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,460
you to go back

692
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,080
on New Year’s Day.

693
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,010
She said she missed you

694
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,200
and she wanted to see you.

695
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,480
Really?

696
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,150
I’ll give her a phone call later.

697
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,210
Cheng, my stomach is aching again.

698
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,360
It’s aching badly. I must be

699
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,550
suffering from appendicitis again.

700
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,740
Could you send me to the hospital again?

701
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,490
All right, Cheng?

702
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,510
I think your epityphlon is squeezing
your stomach.

703
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,150
Stop acting.

704
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:32,780
You just don’t want me to go inside.

705
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,310
-Cheng.
-Cheng.

706
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,010
When I left,

707
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,060
I locked the door.

708
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:48,140
Cheng!

709
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,070
Let go of me!

710
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,300
Why are you so cross?

711
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,680
I just want to ask you whether you are hungry.

712
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:59,660
Guys, I’ve tried my best.

713
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,200
You be careful.

714
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,520
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go.

715
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:12,690
Dian! Dian!

716
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,620
She is coming. She is coming. Let’s go!

717
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,320
[Certificate of Honor]

718
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:46,960
[Dancing Star]

719
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:58,360
It hurts so much.

720
00:41:58,890 --> 00:41:59,770
Here?

721
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,050
The next time

722
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:06,940
when the movements are very difficult,

723
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,170
you must be careful.

724
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:13,410
The first thing to do

725
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,860
is to protect yourself.

726
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,070
It doesn’t hurt now?

727
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:23,310
Be careful in the future.

728
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:24,450
Don’t hurt yourself.

729
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,040
Mom,

730
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,540
why don’t you go to bed?

731
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,890
I’ll go to bed after sewing this for you.

732
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:48,120
Thank you! I love you!

733
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,850
I love you, too!

734
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,880
Surprise!

735
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:57,940
Miss Goddess,

736
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:58,770
do you like it?

737
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,930
We specially decorated the room for you.

738
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,480
Who asked you to do this?

739
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,760
She doesn’t seem to like it.

740
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,380
Well, calm down.

741
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,360
Don’t quarrel. I gonna go.

742
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:23,760
I’m sorry.

743
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:24,690
I just thought

744
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:25,830
it could help you

745
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,020
Sleep better at night.

746
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,650
Didn’t you say you wanna…
