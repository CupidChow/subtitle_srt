Mr. Shen.

Thank you

6
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,600
for everything.

7
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,720
It's not a problem at all, Xinghuo.

8
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,910
I'm sorry.

9
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,470
I'll throw it away.

10
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,560
It's all right.

11
00:02:06,755 --> 00:02:07,470
It's good stuff.

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,950
Save it for Shen Qing.

You're a good friend.

17
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,400
You encouraged Lina,

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,000
encouraged Ding,

19
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,160
and brought so much energy

20
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,470
into my life.

21
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,070
Thank you.

22

Grandpa Shen, this is for you.

27
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,720
I have no use for this.

28

29
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,230
Okay.

Where did you get this?

32
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,080
Mr. French Fry gave it to me.

33
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,790
Is that so?

34
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:09,870

Can you make dumplings for me?

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,990
Didn't you say

38
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,400
you were happy

39
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,870

40
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,350
We were happy,

41
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,280
but I missed you.

42

She drove her ex-husband crazy

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,950

and the divorce got so messy.

148

the more they run.

153
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:33,160
Nothing.

00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,400

Dad doesn't have many hobbies.

163
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,040
He likes fishing.

164
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,520
And he does it at wild ponds.

165
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,190
It's free.

166
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,360
He needs a bit of social life
with his fishing buddies.

167
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,280
You could at least
give him a bit of cash.

168
00:08:00,311 --> 00:08:01,710
Otherwise, people will laugh at him.

180
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:29,400
She actually sent it!

181
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,880

182
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:33,880

183
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,670

185
00:08:40,355 --> 00:08:41,280

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,160
Go check

188
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,190
if the vacuum's full of dust

189
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:46,830
and empty it.

190
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,480
On it.

191
00:08:49,044 --> 00:08:49,830
You're right.

192
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,640
All this dirt.

193
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,640
I'll take care of this.

194
00:08:55,377 --> 00:08:56,760
Be right back to take care of that!

195
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,933
I'll come back and tidy that!

196
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,360
You...

197
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,000
Mom, see? You let go a little

198
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,710
and Dad's all happy and motivated.

199
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,280
Being the one
who manages everything is hard work.

200
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,430
Look at this. Can I not step in?

201
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,422
There's a mess everywhere.

202
00:09:07,466 --> 00:09:07,790
Yes.

203
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,400
Look at this!

204
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,240
Leave it there. I'll take care of it.

205
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,070
If he does anything,

206
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,590
I've got to follow behind and clean up.

207
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:15,950
- Stop. I'll do it.
- Seriously.

208
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:17,400
You're going to handle it?

209
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,750
I don't want to control everything.

210
00:09:18,755 --> 00:09:20,160
It's exhausting.

211
00:09:24,933 --> 00:09:25,688
Look at these.

212
00:09:31,844 --> 00:09:34,240
It's been such a long time since then.

213
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:38,066
Your father-in-law's had
more romantic drama this year

214
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,360
than in his entire life.

215
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,640
Well, I think

216
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,520
Ms. Lian,

217
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,790
Ms. Nie,

218
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,910
Ms. Lv,

219
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,120
and Ms. Peng

220
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,880
are all brave women
going after their happiness.

221
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,520
They're admirable.

222
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,400
Yes.

223
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,710
Admirable, but way too much drama.

224
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,910
Maybe you can talk
to your father-in-law?

225
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,880
All this matchmaking
is wearing everyone out.

226
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,710
Sing some songs and dance a little.

227
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:07,533
Those are good activities
to pass the time,

228
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,190
aren't they?

We must maintain this momentum.

Shen will speak for us.

244
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:06,670
No, I can't...

245
00:11:06,755 --> 00:11:07,466
Get him to do it!

No, it has to be you!

No.

You have to be the one to do it!

250
00:11:13,777 --> 00:11:14,430

They even brought
a makeup artist for us!

254
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,040
This way, Director.

255
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:25,910
Good work, everyone.

256
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,790
Let's get right to it, then,

257
00:11:27,822 --> 00:11:29,160
shall we? Let's start with makeup.

258
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,710
- Who goes first?
- All right.

259
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:31,710
Shen.

260
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,910
You go first.

261
00:11:32,977 --> 00:11:34,177
You get your makeup done first.

262
00:11:34,244 --> 00:11:35,733
- No...
- Shen, you have to go.

263
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,360
You'll be representing us

264
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
in the interview.

265
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,160
All right. Then I won't hold back.

266
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,760
Everyone else, rest where you are.

267
00:11:44,844 --> 00:11:45,640
Take a short break.

268
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,520
Okay.

269
00:11:49,555 --> 00:11:50,480
Sorry to trouble you.

270
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,760
Not at all.

271
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,670
Sorry to trouble you, Dear.

272
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,070
Not at all.

273
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,310
Here.

274
00:12:17,022 --> 00:12:17,710
Try this on.

275
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,590
I fixed it.

276
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,880
Are we ready to begin?

277
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:37,830
Look in the mirror.

278
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,670
They look so much alike.

279
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,190
What are you looking at?

280
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,710
Jingmin.

281
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,310
Who?

282
00:13:15,422 --> 00:13:16,280
Shen's late wife?

283
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,120
(The Past Gone with the Wind)

284
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,240
She looks so much like Mom.

285
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,120
That must be Grandma!

286
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,279
Definitely what Grandma looked like
before she got sick.

287
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,440
Now with AI, they can reconstruct
how you used to look.

288
00:13:27,444 --> 00:13:29,422
Yes. It's uncanny. Look.

289
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,000
Let me say this one more time.

290
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,830
She is not your mom.

291
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,590
She's the makeup artist

292
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,910
the provincial TV station got
for our choir.

293
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,622
Her name is

294
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,950
Le Shuishan.

295
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:40,880
Dad.

296
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,400
Could she be Mom's long-lost sister?

297
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,550
Your grandma passed away not long

298
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,710
after your mom was born.

299
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:49,155
There's no way that's possible.

300
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,760
Grandpa,

301
00:13:49,866 --> 00:13:51,590
I ran a facial comparison with software.

302
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,777
(Facial recognition: similarity 92%)
They look 92% alike!

303
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,190
She looks so much like her.

304
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,360
Dad.

305
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,040
What if Grandpa

306
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,400
had a secret affair

307
00:14:03,022 --> 00:14:04,190
and this is his love child?

308
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,790
Like Xia Yuhe?

309
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,760
Nonsense!

310
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,310
Your grandpa was a very traditional man.

311
00:14:12,488 --> 00:14:14,520
Shen Dai,
stop letting your imagination run wild.

312
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,240
I...

313
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,480
We shouldn't criticize Shen Dai.

314
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,160
Shen Dai is imaginative,
and she's a bit of a loner.

315
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,070
That's just who she is.

316
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,520
Grandpa, you're so biased.

317
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,360
It's not biased.

318
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,310
Her personality is why she's able

319
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,280
to do artistic work now? Right?

320
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,590
Dad, you've got taste.

321
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,000
You're so good to me.

322
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,360
I'm touched.

323
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,400
Sentiment received.

324
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:36,949
If you're touched,
then come visit Dad more often.

325
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,820
Don't just feel emotional
through the video call.

326
00:14:38,822 --> 00:14:39,755
It's fine. I get it.

327
00:14:39,777 --> 00:14:40,620
Ignore your brother.

328
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,590
I'm ignoring him.

329
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,190
He's lost his charm anyway.

You're right.

342
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,400
It's like they're long-lost sisters.

343
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,760
They look exactly the same.

344
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,000
Right?

345
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,040
Yes.

Their school was updating
its finance system,

349
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,960
so the payment was delayed.

350
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,590
I kept negotiating
with Headmaster Zhang.

351
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,350
In the end, he gave in and signed

352
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,550
the situation report.

353
00:16:02,844 --> 00:16:04,149
I took it to the finance office

354
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,266
and had them process it
through the test system.

355
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,280
You're such a dependable friend.

let me know.

00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,440
Bai.

374
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,040
Here's to you. Thank you.

375
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:39,830
Don't mention it.

376
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,310
Right.

377
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,830
When I was negotiating
the overdue payment,

378
00:16:45,866 --> 00:16:47,650
I also brought up
the school uniform order.

379
00:16:48,688 --> 00:16:50,280
He has a really good impression of you.

380
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,630
Said when the last batch arrived,

381
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,066
there wasn't even a loose thread.

382
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,480
Of course.

383
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,310
I hand-checked every piece.

384
00:16:57,866 --> 00:16:58,888
So he's willing

385
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,280
to give you
the school uniform contract too.

386
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:05,440
Really?

387
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,790
3,000 pieces!

388
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,000
That's a huge order!

389
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,310
That said,

390
00:17:10,577 --> 00:17:12,870
the school's trying
to keep costs low for the students,

391
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,960
so they're pressing the price way down.

392
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,822
But they still expect
high-quality results.

393
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:18,480
I'm worried you'll overexert yourself

394
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,720
and still end up not making a profit.

395
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:22,960
It's okay.

396
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:24,920
Uniforms are all about volume.

397
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,310
If I can land this deal,

398
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,350
the company will scale up.

399
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,520
No more a family workshop.

400
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,390
You've got the long-term vision.

401
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,870
Should we go see
Headmaster Zhang together?

402
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,480
Sure. Let's go tomorrow.

403
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,200
Sounds good.

404
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:43,520
Bai,

405
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,000
you really are my lucky star
on the road to success.

406
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,280
You're too kind.

407
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,960
Thank you.

408
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,440
That's

409
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:56,200
the situation.

410
00:17:59,866 --> 00:18:00,760
Headmaster Zhang,

411
00:18:01,355 --> 00:18:03,150
you want school uniforms
for all four seasons

412
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,440
to stay under 1,000 yuan in total,

413
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,240
with original designs,

414
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,280
and high-quality fabric.

415
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,240
It's not just not profitable.

416
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,680
We'd have to eat the cost.

417
00:18:11,755 --> 00:18:13,155
She's right, Headmaster Zhang.

418
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,760
At least give us a bit of margin.

419
00:18:15,288 --> 00:18:17,560
I'll guarantee quality,
delivery, and after-sales support.

420
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,480
Same as last time.

421
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,866
Not even a thread is out of place.

422
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:20,960
Ms. Liu.

423
00:18:21,888 --> 00:18:22,920
I'll be honest with you.

424
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,110
Most of our students

425
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,040
come from modest families.

426
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,390
So as the headmaster,

427
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,960
I have to do everything I can
to save them money.

428
00:18:32,288 --> 00:18:34,390
We've reached out
to some other manufacturers before

429
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,040
and they can do the job too.

430
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,920
But after working with you,

431
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,590
I feel like you are

432
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,280
more meticulous, and more thoughtful.

433
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,550
Also,

434
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,590
this price point was set

435
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:44,870
after careful research.

436
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:46,444
We really can't raise it any further.

437
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:48,790
But if it's difficult for you, Ms. Liu,

438
00:18:49,244 --> 00:18:51,350
then perhaps we can find
another opportunity instead.

439
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,760
Let's go, Lina.

440
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,488
Headmaster Zhang.

441
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,550
I'll do it.

442
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,200
Starting a business

443
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,590
isn't just about making money,

444
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,480
right?

445
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,150
Then,

446
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,790
I thank you, Ms. Liu.

447
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,150
You're welcome.

448
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,310
Here's some info on Le Shuishan.

449
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,960
She's from Suzhou.

450
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,040
She's retired now,

451
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,329
but used to be a makeup artist.

452
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,109
She has a good reputation
and high EQ,

453
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,380
(Le Shuishan, Makeup Artist)
so she's invited to work events

454
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,600
and programs from time to time.

455
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,550
When she was younger,
she worked in the northwest.

456
00:19:33,622 --> 00:19:34,830
Her husband was from Nanjing.

457
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,630
After he died in an accident,

458
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,659
she moved back to Nanjing

459
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,130
and took over her mother-in-law's job.

460
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:42,639
She first worked
in the broadcast group doing ad sales.

461
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,769
Then she taught herself makeup

462
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,288
and became a professional makeup artist.

463
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,480
She's had quite a journey.

464
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,590
Mr. Shen, why are you looking into her?

465
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,680
Because...

466
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,150
Le Shuishan

467
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,520
looks a bit

468
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,040
like my mom.

469
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,110
Seriously?

470
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:00,244
How similar are we talking?

471
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:11,870
I...

472
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:12,760
This is...

473
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,240
They're practically twins!

474
00:20:18,456 --> 00:20:20,090
(Shen Dai)

475
00:20:21,466 --> 00:20:22,200
Talk to me, Dai.

476
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,870
Qing, I'm transferring to Beijing.

477
00:20:23,911 --> 00:20:25,380
About an hour till I land in Nanjing.

478
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,266
Come pick me up.

479
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,000
Are you out of your mind?

480
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,040
Why do you always act on impulse?

481
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,830
I have to go to the airport later.

482
00:20:37,466 --> 00:20:38,520
My sister's coming back.

483
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,110
Hold on.

484
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,520
Is she back because of this woman?

485
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,480
Who knows?

486
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,350
This is an opera theater.

487
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,200
What are you...

488
00:21:08,288 --> 00:21:10,133
- Come on!
- Do you want to watch opera?

489
00:21:52,422 --> 00:21:53,177
Come on, Mom.

490
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:54,110
Take a few steps.

491
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,480
Are you sure about this?

492
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,070
You look stunning!

493
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,150
But my belly...

494
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,000
Look at how perfectly
this qipao fits you!

495
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,790
Walk a bit. Let me see!

496
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,630
You look fabulous.

497
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,680
Where would I even wear this?

498
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,520
Mom, listen.

499
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:13,244
Your figure hasn't changed a bit.

500
00:22:13,266 --> 00:22:14,630
Turn around and let me take a look.

501
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,720
Such a waste of money.

502
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,390
Look at that waist!

503
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,000
The sleeves fit perfectly! Gorgeous!

504
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:50,777
Tastes just like I remembered!

505
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,630
Eat up, Qing!

506
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,590
I'm not that hungry.

507
00:23:02,755 --> 00:23:03,580
What's on your mind?

508
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,480
I was thinking...

509
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,150
Mom also used to love wearing qipaos

510
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,630
and dressing up.

511
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,550
If I could go back in time,

512
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,955
I'd never have let her
take care of Duole.

513
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,680
Duole used

514
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,720
to spit up all over her.

515
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,350
For more than a year,

516
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,266
she didn't buy herself
a single new outfit.

517
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,680
When Duole got a little older,

518
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,830
Mom started fussing over me again.

519
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,110
She'd obsess over
whether I was wearing socks,

520
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,070
telling me,

521
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:48,830
"Cold enters through the feet!
You have to keep warm!"

522
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,480
It drove me crazy.

523
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,200
Thinking back,

524
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,070
she was probably

525
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,920
already having a relapse then.

526
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,310
Qing, there's something
I never told you.

527
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,240
You know what?

528
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,960
Now, when I sleep,

529
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,280
I always wear a pair of socks.

530
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,870
One night I woke up, and I was yelling

531
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,550
in my sleep.

532
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:17,200
"Mom! Mom, I wore socks!"

533
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,280
And then...

534
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,040
And then I remembered...

535
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,240
Mom isn't with us anymore.

536
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:34,760
Qing.

537
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,310
Why is it that we only listen
to our mothers

538
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,720
after they're gone?

539
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,390
You know what my biggest regret is?

540
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,110
What?

541
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,110
When Mom relapsed,

542
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:56,240
she wanted to go to Xinjiang.

543
00:24:56,266 --> 00:24:58,177
I was afraid it'd be too hard
on her body,

544
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,630
so I told her to wait.

545
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,310
Wait till summer.

546
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,480
But she...

547
00:25:06,577 --> 00:25:07,720
She didn't make it to summer.

548
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,720
In her final days,

549
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,480
lying in that hospital bed...

550
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,550
I...

551
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,440
I told her,

552
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:25,760
"Mom...

553
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,350
I'm sorry.

554
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,870
We probably won't get to Xinjiang."

555
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,480
She couldn't

556
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,630
talk anymore. She just...

557
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,790
She waved me over.

558
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,630
Smiled at me.

559
00:25:53,911 --> 00:25:55,040
Ran her hand over my head,

560
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,590
and plucked out a white hair.

561
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,110
Even now...

562
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,310
Just thinking about that moment...

563
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:16,480
If something comes to mind,

564
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,550
do it.

565
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,040
If you miss the chance,

566
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,790
you might miss it forever.

567
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,800
That's why the moment
I saw that video of Le Shuishan,

568
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,200
I couldn't wait a second longer.

569
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,480
I just wanted to come back.
I just wanted to see her.

570
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:32,110
Qing...

571
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,790
I miss Mom...

572
00:26:45,709 --> 00:26:49,020
(Chaihuo Wontons)

573
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,110
Where's my thanks, hm?

574
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,040
I carried this all the way back for you.

575
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,040
I really appreciate it, Aunt.

576
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,040
This thing is heavy!

577
00:27:01,555 --> 00:27:02,790
"Welcome home" tangyuan for you.

578
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,150
I'll make you a feast tomorrow.

579
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,040
Thanks, Lina.

580
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,350
Slow down. Don't burn yourself.

581
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:10,150
All right.

582
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,070
Tell us.

583
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,590
Why did you suddenly come back?

584
00:27:13,822 --> 00:27:15,022
Is something the matter?

585
00:27:16,777 --> 00:27:18,088
Of course something's up, Dad.

586
00:27:18,155 --> 00:27:19,755
Is missing home a big enough reason?

587
00:27:21,488 --> 00:27:22,320
- Qing?
- Of course.

588
00:27:22,355 --> 00:27:23,844
Is missing Mom a big enough reason?

589
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,110
Dad.

590
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,720
I took my brother
to see Le Shuishan today.

591
00:27:31,933 --> 00:27:33,310
Her qipao team had a performance.

592
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:34,760
You...

593
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:37,440
You two...

594
00:27:38,377 --> 00:27:39,310
You're something else.

595
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,200
There was a moment

596
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,280
when I truly felt like she was Mom.

597
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,480
I've always felt like
I owed her one last family meal.

598
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,480
She left with regrets.

599
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,630
And I'm living with mine.

600
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,760
So, my dear father,

601
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,110
can we please

602
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:57,555
invite Ms. Le over for dinner
this Mid-Autumn Festival?

603
00:27:58,333 --> 00:27:59,790
I don't think that's appropriate.

604
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,520
Why wouldn't it be?

605
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,110
I just want her to sit there,

606
00:28:05,177 --> 00:28:06,760
and for all of us to gather around her.

607
00:28:06,822 --> 00:28:08,688
She doesn't need to do anything
but look at us.

608
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,110
But she's not Mom.

609
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,520
Doesn't matter if she is or isn't.

610
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,870
When I look at that face, she is.

611
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:13,960
Dad,

612
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,760
just this once, please let me have this?

613
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,590
I just want to use
Mom's favorite purple clay teacup

614
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,040
and

615
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,630
pour her favorite tea.

616
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,550
I'd just like her to sit there, smile,

617
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,040
and look at us.

618
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,110
To tell you the truth,

619
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,310
there are times

620
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,760
when I glance at her,

621
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,720
and think she really is your mom.

622
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:42,440
Right?

623
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,110
Then invite her.

624
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,040
I'll give it a shot.

625
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,870
You're the head of the house.
It's your call.

626
00:28:57,222 --> 00:28:57,830
Give it a shot.

627
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:58,830
Okay.

628
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:11,920
How do you feel?

629
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,150
All that sweating really helps
relieve stress.

630
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,000
Right?

631
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,310
"Nature is an excellent sedative."

632
00:29:19,688 --> 00:29:21,000
That's what Chekhov said.

633
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,830
Recently, we met someone

634
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,630
who looks just like my mom.

635
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:29,790
Our whole family was shocked.

636
00:29:30,488 --> 00:29:31,844
How much does she look like her?

637
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,960
Facial recognition software
said 92% similarity

638
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,680
with no blood relation.

639
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,040
Wow, that's serious.

640
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,070
My sister

641
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,200
even flew back from overseas
just because of this.

642
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,111
And now she's insisting we invite
the woman to our house for dinner.

643
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,480
Feels a bit abrupt to me.

644
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,680
Well, meeting someone is fate.

645
00:29:52,955 --> 00:29:55,039
Their being alike
makes it even more special.

646
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,888
You should meet her.

647
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:09,390
♪In the garden late at night,
all is hushed and still...♪

648
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,720
It came out great.

649
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:11,760
Not bad at all.

650
00:30:11,822 --> 00:30:12,288
Excellent.

651
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:12,760
Good.

652
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,200
The Wind and Rainbow Choir

653
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,200
is well-known now.

654
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,760
We might want to consider expanding.

655
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:21,350
We should bring
Ms. Le Shuishan on board.

656
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,760
You know what?

657
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,310
Gou,

658
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,200
I think

659
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,790
that's a great idea.

660
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,110
I'm all for it.

661
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,150
Me too.

662
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,200
"Unbidden...

663
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,350
the memories come."

664
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,240
You've still got your wits, Ding.

665
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,955
I'll come pick you up later.

666
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:03,280
Bye.

667
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:10,160
(Welcome, Le Shuishan!)
This song has been around for a while.

668
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,070
She's here!

669
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,070
She's here!

670
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:15,550
Ms. Le.

671
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,310
Come in.

672
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:17,150
Welcome!

673
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,630
Come in.

674
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,480
Welcome, Ms. Le!

675
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,200
It's an honor

676
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,830
to have you with us.

677
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,350
Now that Ms. Le's here,

678
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,440
the visuals of our choir

679
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,870
just leveled up!

680
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,070
Zhou, better watch out.

681
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,520
Your wife keeps a tight leash.

682
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,040
Welcome!

683
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,280
I'm Le Shuishan,

684
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,480
the new member.

685
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:49,920
Please take care of me.

686
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,870
You're Mr. Shen?

687
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,040
Yes.

688
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,520
Mr. Shen Zhuoran?

689
00:31:56,777 --> 00:31:57,240
That's me.

690
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,110
No wonder I thought you looked familiar

691
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,920
when I did your makeup the other day.

692
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:06,240
You were on the provincial channel's
reading program once.

693
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,070
Yes.

694
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,390
The Literary Beauty of Kun Opera.

695
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:11,790
That's right.

696
00:32:11,866 --> 00:32:12,630
That's the event.

697
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:14,000
Yes.

698
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,110
I was there.

699
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:16,960
You said,

700
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,390
"In life,
there are no better or worse paths.

701
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,240
Just different ones."

702
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,350
That really stuck with me.

703
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,350
Talk about fate.

704
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:28,680
Ms. Le.

705
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,630
This must be fate.

706
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,040
Fate is up to the heavens.

707
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,590
Action is up to us.

708
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,150
What

709
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,360
do you mean?

710
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,040
Before Gou even called me,

711
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,520
I had already asked Dean Xu to help

712
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,590
recommend me to the choir.

713
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,630
Then, when Gou called to invite me,

714
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,710
I was over the moon!

715
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,440
Me and the Wind and Rainbow Choir
were meant to find each other.

716
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,000
Indeed!

717
00:33:00,977 --> 00:33:01,800
Beautifully said!

718
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,590
Wonderful!

719
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:03,840
Mr. Shen.

720
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,230
Could I get your autograph?

721
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,840
You even brought the book?

722
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,670
How thoughtful.

723
00:33:13,155 --> 00:33:14,110
I'll sign it right now.

724
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,440
Where should I sign?

725
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,880
Here, or...

726
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,040
Just right here. The first page.

727
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:24,880
All right.

728
00:33:25,688 --> 00:33:26,190
Will that do?

729
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:31,260
(The Literary Beauty of Kun Opera
by Le Shuishan)

730
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:35,040
Haven't seen a man
use a fountain pen in a long time.

731
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,150
How sophisticated.

732
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,190
Ding.

733
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:43,960
Come here, Ding.

734
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,150
Your handwriting is beautiful.

735
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,750
Thank you.

736
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:02,920
Dad.

737
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,920
Le Shuishan joined your choir?

738
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,520
Yes.

739
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,520
Did you invite her to dinner

740
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,480
for Mid-Autumn yet?

741
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,960
Not yet.

742
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,630
Today was just our first rehearsal.

743
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,230
Inviting her now

744
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,040
would feel too abrupt.

745
00:34:17,444 --> 00:34:17,960
That's true.

746
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,070
We'll have plenty of chances.

747
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,110
That's true.

748
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,110
Oh,

749
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:23,800
and she even

750
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,230
brought one of my books today

751
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,840
and asked for an autograph.

752
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,400
Really?

753
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,800
Le Shuishan's a fan of yours, Dad?

754
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,150
- Of course.
- You never know.

755
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,070
Dad's got charm.

756
00:34:36,555 --> 00:34:37,190
Oh right, Dad.

757
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,040
Try on this new shirt I brought you!

758
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,670
You've got to look your best
at choir practice from now on.

759
00:34:45,866 --> 00:34:46,800
I don't like the color.

760
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,710
It's bright. It suits you.

761
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,400
Look at what Mr. Gou wears.

762
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,800
I can't compare to him.

763
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,520
And this thing
doesn't even have pockets.

764
00:34:54,622 --> 00:34:56,533
Where am I supposed
to put my fountain pen?

765
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,840
Who still carries pens

766
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,000
in their shirts these days?

767
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,880
I do.

768
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,880
Maybe she likes that about him.

769
00:35:14,466 --> 00:35:15,466
Here, you take it.

770
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:16,630
Dad.

771
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,110
I'll get you one with pockets
for your fountain pen.

772
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,000
Oh, good. You're here. Try this one on.

773
00:35:27,088 --> 00:35:28,040
Your sister bought it.

774
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,270
I'll try it later.

775
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,150
I'm heading to Xuanwu Lake for a run.

776
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,840
It's not like you're catching a flight.

777
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,550
What's the rush?

778
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,320
And Xuanwu Lake?

779
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,920
Takes an hour round-trip

780
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,270
and parking is expensive.

781
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,555
Can't you just run near home?

782
00:35:42,288 --> 00:35:43,960
You weren't happy when I had back pain.

783
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,950
And you still aren't happy
now that I'm running.

784
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,800
The running group at Xuanwu Lake

785
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,150
has great vibes.

786
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,110
Fine.

787
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,230
But try this on first.

788
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:54,190
You're looking sprightly these days.

789
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,590
This color fits you perfectly.

790
00:35:55,622 --> 00:35:57,511
You'll be the most stylish one
in the group.

791
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,040
Are you sure this suits me?

792
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,590
No thanks.

793
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,040
Take it.

794
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,110
So hard to please.
Okay, not giving it to you then.

795
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:07,480
I'm off.

796
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,070
Most dedicated runner ever.

797
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,110
Let's eat. Try the fish head.

798
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,070
Eat more, little boy. Eat up.

799
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:20,920
Gentlemen. Everyone.

800
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,710
How are you finding the food?

801
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,000
This clay pot fish head

802
00:36:24,177 --> 00:36:25,040
is pretty authentic.

803
00:36:25,355 --> 00:36:27,040
Now this is someone who knows food.

804
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:27,920
Good taste.

805
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,920
What's your last name?

806
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:29,480
Liu.

807
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,320
Liu, allow me to give you a toast.

808
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,270
Let me tell you.

809
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,550
This clay pot fish head

810
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,150
is a local specialty.

811
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,070
I made it myself.

812
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,360
Liu.

813
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:43,190
You brought us to a great place.

814
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,630
My son-in-law recommended it.

815
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,800
If he says it's good, it must be good.

816
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,880
Another toast to Liu!

817
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,150
To Liu!

818
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,360
Cheers!

819
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,230
Thank you.

820
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:55,630
You're welcome.

821
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:56,880
Let me tell you.

822
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,000
I admire men who fish.

823
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,150
Why's that?

824
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:03,800
First,

825
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,630
they're patient.

826
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,400
Right.

827
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,920
Second,

828
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,880
it takes real skill.

829
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:11,710
Definitely.

830
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,320
And third,

831
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,880
those old fishing guys,
out there in wind and rain.

832
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,440
That's the real deal.

833
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:23,670
Ma'am!

834
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,880
The bill is on me!

835
00:37:25,066 --> 00:37:26,190
Nobody fights me on this!

836
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:28,920
I'm paying!

837
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,800
Don't fight!

838
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,630
I'm paying!

839
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,810
Don't bother fighting over it.

840
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,330
The bill's already been taken care of.

841
00:37:35,466 --> 00:37:36,710
- Guess who paid?
- Who paid?

842
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,230
Was it you?

843
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:37,960
Guess!

844
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,480
Who paid?

845
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:39,550
Come on now.

846
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,000
Who paid?

847
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:41,070
Let's all

848
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,800
thank Liu together.

849
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,550
It's no big deal.

850
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,710
Thank you, Liu!

851
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,000
It's no big deal.

852
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,190
Cheers!

853
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,360
Cheers!

854
00:37:57,844 --> 00:37:58,666
I have to admit,

855
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,270
this Western shirt's

856
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,630
pretty flashy.

857
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:03,920
Oh please.

858
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,840
You wear vibrant colors all the time,

859
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,800
and I can't show off

860
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:09,710
a little?

861
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:14,040
It's just fishing.
What's with this getup?

862
00:38:14,088 --> 00:38:15,355
Who are you dressing up for?

863
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,270
Liu Debao.

864
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,040
Who is this Yu Meijiao?

865
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,480
Why did you transfer her

866
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,800
565 yuan?

867
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,960
The fishing group takes turns
buying dinners.

868
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,880
Yu Meijiao is the owner

869
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,960
of a farm stay.

870
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:34,110
Fishing group dinners? Farm stays?

871
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:35,880
Liu Debao,

872
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,520
you've got
a lot of funny ideas these days.

873
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,590
Funny ideas?

874
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,590
You only gave me 1,000.

875
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:43,590
Not 10,000!

876
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:45,066
What's that supposed to mean?

877
00:38:45,288 --> 00:38:46,711
Not enough money for you?

878
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:49,360
You think wearing foreign clothes

879
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,844
makes you some overseas Chinese now?

880
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,070
All right.

881
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,270
Take the shirt off.

882
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,333
Wear it when you're out with guests.

883
00:38:55,822 --> 00:38:57,070
Since the day we got married,

884
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,070
I've never even seen my bank card.

885
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,270
You finally give me 1,000,

886
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,880
and now you watch my every move!

887
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,200
What's wrong
with treating everyone to a meal?

888
00:39:06,266 --> 00:39:06,977
It's not a crime.

889
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,800
Lina gave me this, and I can't wear it?

890
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,440
If not now, when?

891
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,800
After I'm dead?

892
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,150
That's...

893
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:22,800
Liu Debao!

894
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,044
How dare you talk to me like that!

895
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,670
Fine! Wear it!

896
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:27,920
Go ahead!

897
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:28,960
Wear it!

898
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,110
Wear it!

899
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,110
Take it!

900
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,110
Here's your bank card too!

901
00:39:33,244 --> 00:39:34,270
I don't want it anymore!

902
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,000
It's right here!

903
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,190
New outfit and new hat!

904
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,550
Chasing a new woman,
and handing out cash!

905
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,520
Once you win the new one over,
just let me know!

906
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,110
I'll gladly make room for her!

907
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,630
The nerve of him!

908
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,800
Headmaster Zhang.

909
00:40:03,222 --> 00:40:04,511
Pleasure working with you.

910
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,000
Likewise.

911
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,710
Ms. Liu.

912
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,000
Please get that clothing design sketch

913
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,288
to us as soon as possible.

914
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,040
No problem.

915
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,710
Looking forward to working together.

916
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,270
Thank you.

917
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,230
Thank you.

918
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:19,440
What?
28,000 yuan to design a school uniform?

919
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,400
I get
that they're professional designers,

920
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,710
but that's crazy.

921
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:26,710
Okay. I'll ask around.

922
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:30,590
What's wrong?

923
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,710
Regretting not
studying design back then.

924
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,440
Designers these days
charge ridiculous rates.

925
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,670
It's just a drawing, isn't it?

926
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,710
Don't sell someone's profession short.

927
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:47,360
Every industry has its own complexities.

928
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,480
I understand that,

929
00:40:49,844 --> 00:40:51,960
but this project was already
a no-profit one for me.

930
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,880
If the design fee is that steep,

931
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,400
I'll be losing money big time.

932
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,270
They came to you
to save money, didn't they?

933
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:01,550
You should've thought
about that before taking it on.

934
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:07,190
You're barely home for meals already.

935
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,440
Can't you just be a bit supportive?

936
00:41:09,577 --> 00:41:10,920
All you do is rain on my parade.

937
00:41:12,533 --> 00:41:14,450
If the penalty for breaking
the contract isn't high,

938
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:15,888
just walk away from it. Let it go.

939
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:18,480
No way.

940
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:19,880
I want to do it.

941
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,800
I'll design it myself.

942
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:23,550
I'll figure it out.

943
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,590
There's always a way.

944
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,550
You just sounded just like

945
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,360
Ms. Lv Yuan.

946
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,920
And she's right.

947
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,750
Don't interrupt when I'm talking.

948
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,550
I promise.

949
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,630
This one, right here.

950
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,070
Yes?

951
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:52,710
Hello?

952
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,110
Le.

953
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,040
Mr. Shen.

954
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,710
Sorry to call so late.

955
00:41:57,088 --> 00:41:58,270
Hope I'm not disturbing you?

956
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,000
No, not at all. Go ahead.

957
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,480
It's nothing major.

958
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:03,630
I just wanted to ask

959
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,320
if you're free for Mid-Autumn Festival.

960
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:07,880
Yes, I am.

961
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:08,920
What's up?

962
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:10,750
Well,

963
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,550
my daughter flew back from abroad
to celebrate.

964
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,190
While overseas, she followed your...

965
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:19,840
Channel.

966
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,520
Channel.

967
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:21,920
Right.

968
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,840
She's a fan.

969
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,710
She asked if we could invite you over

970
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,070
for a casual dinner.

971
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,190
Just a little

972
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,750
Mid-Autumn celebration.

973
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,040
So I thought I'd ask.

974
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,070
I'd love to.

975
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,520
Are you sure I wouldn't be a bother?

976
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:39,190
Not at all.

977
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,190
We'd be honored

978
00:42:41,311 --> 00:42:42,590
to have you celebrate with us.

979
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,270
Great. See you then.

980
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,150
Thank you.

981
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,110
Thank you so much.

982
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,000
Thank you, Dad!

983
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,150
I'm so happy!

984
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,270
Ms. Le is coming!

985
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,960
I'll put the pastries in the fridge.

986
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,040
Save them for Ms. Le.

987
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:57,520
