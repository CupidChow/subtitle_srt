=Episode 12=

3
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,990
(Moth orchids thrive in specific light.)

4
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,310
It usually only needs

5
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,320
sufficient diffused light.

6
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,360
Just place it by a well-lit window.

7
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,320
I had it on the balcony,

8
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,830
but maybe it wasn't getting enough light
on the floor.

9
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,880
I'll move it now.

10
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,080
Ms. Nie,

11
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,110
I've placed it somewhere with sunlight.

12
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,640
Remember to praise it.

13
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,600
Plants are living beings too.

14
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,320
Praise it?

15
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,830
Now I understand

16
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,080
why my late wife used to mumble

17
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,360
to the flowers

18
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,360
while watering them.

19
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,960
Praise.

20
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,880
Got it.

21
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,200
What else?

22
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,440
I remember

23
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,320
there's a book called
"Philosophy of Plants".

24
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,320
You can read it, or not.

25
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,360
Just connect with it sincerely

26
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,320
and add some organic fertilizer.

27
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,160
Lotus root mud works well.

28
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,480
All right.

29
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,440
Talk to it.

30
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,560
Perhaps this is the meaning behind
"plants have a heart of their own."

31
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,000
Then give it sunlight

32
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,470
and lotus root mud.

33
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,350
Got it.

34
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,840
Thank you.

35
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,590
"A sharp brush tip
pierces the green veil,

36
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,560
indigo butterfly wings dance
in the morning glow."

37
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,080
Ms. Moth Orchid.

38
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,030
I'll call you Lanlan.

39
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,560
Let's wash your leaves.

40
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,680
Grow well.

41
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,000
Bloom

42
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,240
beautifully.

43
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,550
Dad.

44
00:03:34,844 --> 00:03:36,150
What are you muttering about?

45
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,070
Come and eat.

46
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,177
The food's getting cold.

47
00:03:39,222 --> 00:03:40,080
That's right.

48
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm praising the orchid.

49
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,160
Now I understand why it hasn't bloomed

50
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,710
and withered ever since your mother
passed away.

51
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,270
No one talked to it.

52
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,710
No one praised it.

53
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,030
Plants are life.

54
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,350
And all life needs

55
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,200
praise

56
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,560
and encouragement.

57
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,280
Shen Qing.

58
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,270
You should praise me too.

59
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:12,200
All life needs praise and encouragement.

60
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,400
Lina.

61
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,640
Dinner smells great tonight.

62
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,310
Shen Qing.

63
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,030
Do you know where to buy lotus root mud?

64
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,680
Lotus root mud?

65
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,000
You're asking him?

66
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,320
He doesn't even know
where to buy lotus root.

67
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:38,270
Do you know where to buy lotus roots?

68
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,920
Kexiang Vegetable Market.

69
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,000
Come shopping with me.

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,040
I need to buy groceries!

71
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,890
Just come with me.

72
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,630
What's so nice about China roses?

73
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,710
You don't understand.
Look how beautiful they are.

74
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:55,510
You can't eat flowers.
What good are they?

75
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,222
- Gorgeous.
- What's so special about them?

76
00:04:57,288 --> 00:04:59,120
- They're really pretty.
- So annoying.

77
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,560
Look. These are ready to bloom.

78
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,430
This little spray nozzle is good too.

79
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,350
This one.

80
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,480
Peng Yulan.

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,920
That's my in-law.

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,470
Come on!

83
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,430
Isn't this one a bit too big?

84
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,040
- Would this be better?
- Zhuoran.

85
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,880
It is you!

86
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,000
Baoqin.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,950
Ran into you again.

88
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,870
What a coincidence.

89
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:17,950
Second time now.

90
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,870
Yes.

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,950
What are you here for?

92
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,870
Buying

93
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,270
a watering can.

94
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,400
This is Peng Yulan.

95
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:25,870
Hello.

96
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
Nice to meet you.

97
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,190
You grow flowers?

98
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,110
Yes.

99
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,830
Do you sell

100
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,440
lotus root mud?

101
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,070
Organic lotus root mud?

102
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,120
- Yes.
- No.

103
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,630
It's all chemical fertilizer now.

104
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,550
Would you like some?

105
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,640
Not if it's chemical.

106
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,630
Wait.

107
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,950
You're growing flowers again?

108
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,870
Yes.

109
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,080
Didn't you know?

110
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,910
Jingmin had a moth orchid.

111
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:49,288
It never bloomed after she passed.

112
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,480
I thought I'd try using

113
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,800
some organic fertilizer

114
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,350
to see if it would.

115
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,320
Zhuoran.

116
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,830
That's so thoughtful of you.

117
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,270
Jingmin has been gone for...

118
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,560
She was my in-law.

119
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,630
Over a year now, right?

120
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,550
Yes.

121
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,560
And you've taken such good care
of her plant.

122
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,190
That's so touching.

123
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,240
It's not easy.

124
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,160
It really isn't.

125
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,950
- I'll take this.
- All right.

126
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,150
- This is your old prince charming.
- Scan here, please.

127
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,170
Oh, shush!

128
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,480
Thank you.

129
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:26,720
Thank you for your patronage.

130
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,630
Zhuoran.

131
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,800
I have something to tell you.

132
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,960
Peng Yulan is great

133
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,320
with plants.

134
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,880
I'll bring her to your place some day.

135
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,440
I bet once your orchid sees Yulan,
it'll bloom immediately!

136
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:42,480
Isn't that right, Yulan?

137
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,920
Are you an expert in growing flowers?

138
00:06:43,977 --> 00:06:44,790
Yes.

139
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,240
I'm quite skilled at it.

140
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,510
Not to brag.

141
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,400
That's great.

142
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,440
You're welcome at my home anytime

143
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,830
to teach me. I'd love to learn.

144
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,270
Sure.

145
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,240
All right.

146
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,160
Well...

147
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,560
I should get going.

148
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,480
All right.

149
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,430
Zhuoran.

150
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,320
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

151
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,280
See you around.

152
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,640
What do you think?

153
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,990
Isn't he a cultured

154
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,710
and refined gentleman?

155
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,230
Oh, you!

156
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,550
I have to say,

157
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:22,080
ever since I started running again,

158
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,630
my sleep has improved a lot.

159
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,040
Really?

160
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,200
You've been putting on a lot of cologne.

161
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,830
It's work, not a fashion show.

162
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,040
Why the fancy fragrance?

163
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,070
A bottle costs so much.

164
00:07:44,111 --> 00:07:46,022
Are you the Pacific Police?
Do you have to nag me

165
00:07:46,022 --> 00:07:46,790
for everything I do?

166
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,920
Who else should I nag, then?

167
00:07:49,111 --> 00:07:50,822
I can't tell your father to do anything.

168
00:07:51,155 --> 00:07:52,955
Shen Qing,
here's some information for you.

169
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,630
The three signs of a man cheating.

170
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,750
Concerned about his looks, working out,
never putting his phone down.

171
00:07:57,755 --> 00:07:59,110
You hit all three.

172
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,160
There.

173
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,360
Check it yourself.

174
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,520
I won't.

175
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,880
Let me make this clear.

176
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,200
If you dare cheat,

177
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,280
I'll divorce you.

178
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,320
Let's go. I'm going to be late.

179
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:11,990
You've nothing better to do.

180
00:08:12,422 --> 00:08:14,688
What did you say?
Who has nothing better to do?

181
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,760
Me.

182
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,133
I have nothing better to do.

183
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,270
Dad! What are you doing?

184
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,000
Perfect timing! Give me a hand.

185
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Open the door for me.
My hands are dirty.

186
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,040
What's that you got there?

187
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,120
Dad, did you fall into a mud pit?

188
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,040
No.

189
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,440
This is lotus root mud.

190
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:31,150
The orchid needs organic fertilizer

191
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,470
to bloom.

192
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,790
Nowhere sells it.

193
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:34,720
So

194
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,150
I went to Nanhu Park

195
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,350
to dig some up.

196
00:08:37,377 --> 00:08:39,390
You went to Nanhu Park
to dig for lotus root mud?

197
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,790
They didn't arrest you?

198
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,844
Why would they arrest me?

199
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:42,930
I didn't break any laws.

200
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,280
Come on!

201
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,800
Help me carry it to the balcony.

202
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,955
- To the balcony?
- All right.

203
00:08:46,955 --> 00:08:47,910
- Right.
- Let me do it.

204
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:48,570
Hold this for me.

205
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,080
This is heavy...

206
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,520
Dad.

207
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,040
How did you carry something this heavy
all the way back?

208
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,830
Ms. Lanlan.

209
00:09:06,155 --> 00:09:07,470
Let's get some extra nutrients

210
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,750
in you.

211
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,950
- Shen Qing.
- Bloom nice and pretty.

212
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,870
Did your dad get enchanted by a fairy?

213
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,320
Writing letters, singing opera...

214
00:09:18,888 --> 00:09:20,790
Soon he'll be living
beyond the mortal realm.

215
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,133
Aren't you going to do something?

216
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,520
Dad.

217
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,990
The orchid has a life.

218
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,560
And so do you.

219
00:09:30,222 --> 00:09:31,190
You wouldn't understand.

220
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,640
All right. I don't need you anymore.

221
00:09:32,644 --> 00:09:33,511
Go about your day.

222
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,760
That's right.

223
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,670
What matters is that

224
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,590
Dad's happy.

225
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,160
Dad.

226
00:09:40,844 --> 00:09:41,920
I don't understand either,

227
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,230
but you have my support.

228
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,000
Here we go.

229
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,920
Lanlan.

230
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,830
Zhao.

231
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,470
This is Ms. Zhang's.

232
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,070
Ms. Zhang's.

233
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,310
Sun.

234
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,470
Anything for me?

235
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:04,950
No.

236
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,040
Not a package, just regular mail.

237
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,390
Then nothing.

238
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,622
But if anything comes,
I'll bring it to you right away.

239
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,980
- All right.
- Goodbye, Mr. Shen.

240
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,800
- If something arrives, bring it over.
- I will.

241
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,200
I am the residents' humble servant.

242
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,740
All right.

243
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,670
The door's wide open!

244
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,710
Lina!

245
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,040
Lina!

246
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,670
Zhuoran!

247
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,080
Zhuoran!

248
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,400
I'm here.

249
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,870
Look who I brought with me!

250
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,640
- Come take a look.
- Coming.

251
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:30,790
Peng Yulan.

252
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,240
Peng. Hello.

253
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,400
You met - at the flower market.
- I know.

254
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,930
- Hello, Professor Shen.
- I remember her.

255
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:36,680
Please come in.

256
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,230
I'll get her some slippers.

257
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,640
I...

258
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,400
Mom!

259
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,510
Here.

260
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,430
Put these on.

261
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,080
Put them on.

262
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,450
I think these are a little too big.

263
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,310
Not at all.

264
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,430
They're perfect.

265
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,670
They're the right size.

266
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,550
Look.

267
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,240
Come in.

268
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,790
See? They fit perfectly.

269
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,670
- Come in.
- Come in.

270
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:02,510
Take a seat.

271
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,710
What are you doing, Mom?

272
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,150
Come on.

273
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,120
Go in.

274
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,440
Go in, Peng.

275
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,030
- Here.
- Lina.

276
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,022
Get the guest some water.

277
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,070
All right.

278
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,750
Maybe some tea?

279
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,777
Would you like some tea?

280
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:16,910
You don't need to do that.

281
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,466
- Right.
- No need to be so courteous.

282
00:11:18,488 --> 00:11:19,488
Have some water, then.

283
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:20,280
Yes.

284
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,509
Please have some water.

285
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,830
- Thanks.
- Anything to drink, Dad?

286
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,688
I'm good. I just drank.

287
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,670
Zhuoran.

288
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,990
Peng Yulan made

289
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,270
a special trip to Central Emporium

290
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,560
to buy you goat milk powder.

291
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,870
Oh, you shouldn't have.

292
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,630
Thank you.

293
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,560
Don't mention it.

294
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,160
Thank you.

295
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,920
Peng Yulan is an expert
at growing flowers.

296
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:41,770
I know. You told me.

297
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,790
- Right. I have.
- Yes.

298
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,120
Peng Yulan, did you know?

299
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,360
Zhuoran even went

300
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,400
to dig up lotus root mud himself.

301
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,320
- Yes.
- You didn't have to do that.

302
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,950
I can make organic fertilizer at home.

303
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,990
Oh, I already dug some up.
I already gave it

304
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,240
to the plant.

305
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,600
Don't water the plants, Lina.

306
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,560
I just watered them.

307
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:08,760
- All right. I'll wipe the leaves.
- Don't drown them.

308
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,880
Don't drown the plants.

309
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,240
Oh, that plant!

310
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,160
Professor Shen!

311
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,630
Professor Shen, is that

312
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,200
the moth orchid you mentioned?

313
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,120
Yes. Let me take a look at it.

314
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,710
Look.

315
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,040
It's blooming!

316
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,400
See? The moment you arrived, it bloomed!

317
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,080
Lovely.

318
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,070
Mr. Shen.

319
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,360
Coming!

320
00:12:38,577 --> 00:12:40,470
- Sun.
- I came to deliver it to you in person.

321
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,630
Oh, you.

322
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,670
Thank you.

323
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,720
Just doing my job.

324
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,640
Mr. Shen.

325
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,040
Goodbye.

326
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,160
Salute.

327
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,280
- See you.
- Goodbye.

328
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,120
A letter for you, Dad?

329
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,300
Where are my reading glasses?

330
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,240
Right here.

331
00:13:04,777 --> 00:13:07,111
(Brilliant day and beautiful scenery,
alas the ravages of time.)

332
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,150
That's your calligraphy.

333
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,070
Yes, it is.

334
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,360
Don't just stand there.

335
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,470
Say something!

336
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,200
Talk about your gift!

337
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,120
Hurry up!

338
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,880
Professor Shen.

339
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,800
This goat milk powder is easy to digest.

340
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,630
Especially suitable for us seniors.

341
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,880
Shall I

342
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,390
make a cup of it for you?

343
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,400
Oh, that won't be needed.

344
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,511
You don't have to do that.

345
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,880
Peng.

346
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,200
I'm so sorry. I...

347
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:48,155
Something suddenly came up today.

348
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,350
I need to go out.

349
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,640
I have something to do.

350
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,790
- Then...
- Yes.

351
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,630
- But...
- Right. You brought Peng

352
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,470
to have her

353
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,200
teach me how to raise the flower, right?

354
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,790
- Yes.
- But look!

355
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,040
The flower is in bloom already!

356
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,310
Oh, right.

357
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,360
Baoqin,

358
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,600
be a good host to our guest.

359
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,480
- All right.
- I'm off.

360
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,600
- Take care.
- Dad.

361
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,688
Where are you going?
Are you having dinner with us?

362
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,710
I have something urgent.

363
00:14:11,177 --> 00:14:12,320
Don't count me in for dinner!

364
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,760
That man...

365
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,350
How could he leave just like that?

366
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,720
He seemed rather excited.

367
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,920
Do you think it might be a date?

368
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,160
A date?

369
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:31,470
Ms. Peng said
your father-in-law left for a date.

370
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,630
Goodness. How could it be a date?

371
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,970
He wouldn't rush off for a date.

372
00:14:34,977 --> 00:14:36,950
He practically ran out.

373
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,280
I think it's...

374
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,230
It's an emergency, isn't it, Lina?

375
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,440
Yes.

376
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,320
He writes books and gives lectures.

377
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,240
He's a busy man.

378
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,520
I knew it!

379
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,920
See? Everyone needs someone

380
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,800
to take care of them

381
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,390
when they're old.

382
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,230
- Yes.
- Right?

383
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,866
- Look at him.
- Look at how he fumbled.

384
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,120
Right?

385
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,110
Oh, this...

386
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,750
Let's not put that there.

387
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,510
I say,

388
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,977
Peng Yulan is such a good homemaker.

389
00:15:09,044 --> 00:15:11,040
Look at how diligent she is.

390
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,000
Ms. Peng.

391
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,630
Don't bother. You should rest.

392
00:15:16,977 --> 00:15:19,300
Don't mind me. I just can't stand
seeing the space untidy.

393
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,470
Such a hardworking woman.

394
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,910
This isn't needed anymore, right?

395
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,044
- Let me see.
- This thing.

396
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:25,790
What's this?

397
00:15:28,288 --> 00:15:29,830
It's a discount code for five yuan.

398
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,590
This is worth five yuan!

399
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,440
Left on the table just like that!

400
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,480
How wasteful!

401
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,400
Scan it.

402
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,620
Oh...

403
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,780
(Silk camisole nightgown)

404
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,840
This is...

405
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,720
- Did Professor Shen
- What's that?

406
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:43,990
buy this?

407
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,480
Why would an old man need a nightgown?

408
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,400
Nonsense.

409
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,550
Then...

410
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,480
Did Lian buy this?

411
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,630
Lian? No way!

412
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,000
Couldn't be her.

413
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,000
Ms. Lian? Not a chance.

414
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,670
It must be yours, Lina. Isn't it?

415
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,880
The nightgown.

416
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,520
I mean, it's a nice nightgown.

417
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,560
How is it nice?

418
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,000
Shoulders bared.

419
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,720
Frozen shoulders aren't easy to treat.

420
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,830
I think it looks pretty.

421
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,160
Um,

422
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,350
perhaps we should leave, Peng Yulan.

423
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,110
Of course.

424
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,480
Let's drop by again

425
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,760
when Zhuoran isn't busy.

426
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:29,729
- All right.
- Let's go, then.

427
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,860
- Okay.
- We're leaving, Lina.

428
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:31,600
Goodbye, Ms. Peng.

429
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:32,680
- Goodbye.
- Take care.

430
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,600
Put this away.

431
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,350
Don't just leave it lying around.

432
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,720
Good grief.

433
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,080
And talk to that old man.

434
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,680
He's old.

435
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,830
He has a good pension.

436
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,670
No one's after his house.

437
00:16:45,711 --> 00:16:47,733
He should just stay home
and tend to his flowers.

438
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,750
He shouldn't be out so much.

439
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,320
Who will have to take care of him

440
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,080
if something happens?

441
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,870
You. Me.

442
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,120
And her.

443
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,640
Right?

444
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,710
Right.

445
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,160
Beautiful.

446
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,480
It's a beauty.

447
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,880
Ms. Nie.

448
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,350
I received the fan you sent me.

449
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:41,990
It's stunning.

450
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,350
Such a lively Du Liniang,

451
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,800
so lifelike.

452
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:51,600
You should've seen your dad

453
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,000
when he got the letter.

454
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,960
He rushed out the door

455
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,830
like it was an emergency!

456
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,670
I'm telling you, something's off.

457
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,720
Maybe he really met a fairy
and got bewitched?

458
00:18:03,311 --> 00:18:04,760
Do you have anything else to say?

459
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,040
What does that mean?

460
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,270
Are you annoyed by me?

461
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,420
They say the more nonsense
a couple talks,

462
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,711
the stronger their relationship.

463
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,500
This isn't nonsense.

464
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,000
You're making wild comments
about my dad.

465
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,222
I don't want to hear any of it.

466
00:18:24,155 --> 00:18:25,660
(A dedicated work
by Professor Shen Zhuoran)

467
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,330
(Appreciating
"The Literary Beauty of Kun Opera,")

468
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,422
(Book Sharing Session in Nanjing)

469
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680
Mr. Shen.

470
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,040
It's been ten years,

471
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,030
and your book is being reprinted.

472
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,800
You must have a lot of thoughts.

473
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,800
When I wrote this book ten years ago,

474
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,000
my wife Jingmin was still around.

475
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,280
I remember my grandson

476
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,750
was only this tall.

477
00:18:49,777 --> 00:18:51,600
Hadn't even started
elementary school yet.

478
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,430
Ten years later,

479
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,430
Jingmin is gone.

480
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,510
My grandson is about

481
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,720
to graduate high school.

482
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,640
And I've grown old.

483
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,920
But I always remember
when he was little,

484
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,150
sitting with his grandmother
in front of the TV,

485
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,590
watching the opera channel,

486
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,230
listening to Kun Opera.

487
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,350
"Lovely as flowers,

488
00:19:09,422 --> 00:19:10,955
yet years flow by like water."

489
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,800
The lyrics are the same.

490
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,080
The melodies are the same.

491
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,040
But the older I get,

492
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,350
the more I seem

493
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,520
to understand them.

494
00:19:22,311 --> 00:19:24,022
"You can't know the beauty of spring

495
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,430
unless you enter the garden."

496
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,160
"You can't know

497
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,111
the value of being human
unless you experience it."

498
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,480
Mr. Shen believes

499
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,960
Kun Opera lyrics

500
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,150
carry great literary aesthetic value.

501
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,960
Shen Qing.

502
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,444
I sent you the procurement contract
from Changlu Pharmaceuticals.

503
00:19:48,444 --> 00:19:49,577
Can you check it right away?

504
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,311
Sure. Give me ten minutes.

505
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,360
Mr. Shen.

506
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,640
What a coincidence.

507
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,190
Ice.

508
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,150
Are you here to buy books too?

509
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:15,510
No.

510
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,920
My dad's book

511
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,240
is being reprinted.

512
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,288
I'm here to show support.

513
00:20:19,355 --> 00:20:20,080
Really?

514
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,000
Do you like Kun Opera?

515
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,022
You should check it out.

516
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,390
Sure. Where?

517
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,430
Just over there.

518
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,670
All right. I'll go listen.

519
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:28,720
I need to finish this email
and I'll be right over.

520
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,640
Sure.

521
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,390
This book wouldn't have been possible
without my wife.

522
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,680
But for this reprint,

523
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,670
I have to thank Ms. Nie Juanjuan.

524
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:43,990
She's

525
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,720
an astrophysicist,

526
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,910
but she's very knowledgeable

527
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,630
in Kun Opera as well.

528
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,800
We once had

529
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,040
a heated debate

530
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,720
over a single word in a line

531
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,760
from the Peony Pavilion.

532
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,640
We argued to no end.

533
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,150
We had a lot of fun.

534
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,430
But in the end,
that very word brought us

535
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,670
back to agreement.

536
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,670
Just think about it.

537
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,000
If one word can hold so many stories,

538
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,430
then imagine the depth of the world

539
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,190
hidden in Kun Opera.

540
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

541
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,920
Yes.

542
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,560
Beautifully said.

543
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,000
I am someone

544
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,040
who has already passed 70.

545
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,320
I know

546
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,800
that before long,

547
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,000
I will lose my ability to write,

548
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,510
maybe even

549
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,640
my memories.

550
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,000
So if I want to do something,

551
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,520
I must do it while I still can.

552
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,960
Perhaps when we are born,

553
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,880
we all wonder,

554
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,870
what kind of people
will we meet in this life?

555
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,270
Now, with my hair turning gray,

556
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,880
I'm still meeting fascinating people

557
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,311
and experiencing interesting things.

558
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,870
And that feels wonderful.

559
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:57,990
Thank you.

560
00:21:58,244 --> 00:21:59,240
Thank you for listening

561
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,830
to this old man ramble.

562
00:22:01,133 --> 00:22:02,460
I'm grateful for the encounters.

563
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,888
Grateful for everything.

564
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,870
Once you're past 70,

565
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,040
do what you want.

566
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,830
Sing when you want.

567
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,160
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

568
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,880
Thank you for sharing, Mr. Shen.

569
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,830
For those who would like
Mr. Shen's autograph,

570
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,280
please proceed this way.

571
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,230
All right.

Thank you.

Thank you.

577
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,670
Thank you.

578
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,240
Thank you.

579
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,160
Please have some water.

580
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,560
Thank you.

581
00:22:52,155 --> 00:22:53,350
He should have warm water!

582
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,320
Professor Shen,
please have some warm water.

583
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,360
Peng, you came.

584
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,960
This is clean.

585
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,170
I didn't drink directly from it.

586
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,070
Don't worry.

587
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,320
It's not a problem.

588
00:23:02,377 --> 00:23:03,910
- Thank you.
- Young people these days.

589
00:23:03,911 --> 00:23:05,080
They don't know anything.

590
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,750
Professor Shen has been talking so much.

591
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,190
How can he drink cold water?

592
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,670
His throat won't be able to take it.

593
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,720
Good grief.

594
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,640
Thank you.

595
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,920
Thank you.

596
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,920
Professor Shen.

597
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,320
I bought two copies.

598
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,760
I'd like you to sign one for me.

599
00:23:20,022 --> 00:23:21,190
Oh, you bought my book too.

600
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,310
And for the other one...

601
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,320
Please wait.

602
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,510
This is my friend.

603
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,920
- Sorry.
- Give them to me.

604
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,000
I'd like you to write a message for me
in the other book.

605
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:33,160
What would you like me to write?

606
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,510
Just write

607
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,960
"Yulan magnolia in bloom."

608
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,320
All right.

609
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:43,820
(Yulan)

610
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,660
(Yulan magnolia in bloom, Shen Zhuoran)

611
00:23:51,244 --> 00:23:53,177
- Thank you so much, Professor Shen.
- Thank you.

612
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,870
I'd like a photo with you too.

613
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Oh, of course.

614
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,040
Take a photo of us, young man.

615
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,270
Thank you.

616
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,030
Coming!

617
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,520
Your parcel, ma'am.

618
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,350
Thank you.

619
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,270
You're welcome.

("The Literary Beauty of Kun Opera"

624
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,670
I did.

625
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,350
In front of all those readers,

626
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,270
I said

627
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,720
I'm most grateful for Ms. Nie Juanjuan.

628
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,720
My son recorded everything.

629
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,720
Oh, right.

630
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,630
I have my phone right here.

631
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,560
I'll play it for you.

632
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,990
I believe you.

633
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,030
Of course, I do.

634
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,640
And

635
00:26:23,911 --> 00:26:25,120
I'm tremendously honored.

636
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,190
It's so nice,

637
00:26:32,644 --> 00:26:33,910
having your son by your side.

638
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,910
Ever since my son went abroad,

639
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,870
we only see each other

640
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
once a year at most.

641
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,400
Yes.

642
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,630
My daughter is in the US too.

643
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,920
When she was little,

644
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,733
she was always running around
under my nose.

645
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,430
So much that it gave me a headache.

646
00:26:55,133 --> 00:26:57,177
I used to wish
she would hurry up and grow up.

647
00:26:59,030 --> 00:26:59,950
But once she did

648
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,120
and left,

649
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,040
now it's so hard

650
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:05,520
to even see her once.

651
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,430
Actually,

652
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,870
I really wanted to go
to the bookstore to support you.

653
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,760
But my health

654
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,190
isn't great,

655
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,960
so I rarely go out.

656
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,430
With all the complicated metro
and bus routes,

657
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,560
I always get confused.

658
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,280
And when there are too many people,

659
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,630
I get even more anxious.

660
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,150
Do you remember the first time we met?

661
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,590
I complained

662
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,560
that the restaurant was too far.

663
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,400
The truth is,

664
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,670
I actually walked there.

665
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,040
Oh, so that's how it was.

666
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,920
To be honest, Ms. Nie,

667
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,160
I thought you were just

668
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,150
trying to be difficult with me.

669
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,470
I...

670
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,350
I wasn't aware of your circumstances.

671
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,150
You must forgive me.

672
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,710
Not at all.

673
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,560
I'm simply

674
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,110
too eccentric.

675
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,040
Ms. Nie, you mustn't say that.

676
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,760
Everyone has fears.

677
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,350
Sometimes, I even worry

678
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,470
that if I fall asleep,

679
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,870
I might never wake up again.

680
00:28:26,133 --> 00:28:27,400
When Jingmin passed away

681
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,800
two years ago,

682
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,910
she was struggling to breathe,

683
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,030
holding my hand.

684
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,590
I... I really felt it.

685
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,680
I felt like I couldn't breathe either.

686
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,320
Like someone had put
a plastic bag over my head.

687
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,430
Ms. Nie,

688
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,640
I understand

689
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,560
your fear.

690
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,710
Good morning.

691
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:36,730
Good morning.

692
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,800
Zhuoran!

693
00:29:43,844 --> 00:29:44,859
- Baoqin.
- You're early.

694
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,520
- You're in the area.
- Where are you off to?

695
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,680
I have something to attend to.

696
00:29:47,688 --> 00:29:48,920
- Lina's home.
- I know.

697
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,480
- She's home. Don't worry.
- I'll come...

698
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,030
I need to go.

699
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,270
Lina!

700
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,190
Mom.

701
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,150
I'm having breakfast.

702
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,360
I already ate.

703
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:05,350
I just saw your father-in-law leave

704
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,590
early this morning with a bunch of bags.

705
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,520
Is there something new going on?

706
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,080
It's a mystery.

707
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,030
What do you mean?

708
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,080
He's full of energy every day,

709
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,320
which is unusual for his age.

710
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,560
But so far,

711
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,150
we've never actually seen
anything suspicious.

712
00:30:26,644 --> 00:30:28,377
Every day,
he goes out to listen to opera,

713
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,470
and buy books,

714
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,670
all by himself.

715
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,750
Oh, dear.

716
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,030
This is not good.

717
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,350
He's fallen for a scam!

718
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,720
The community police warned us

719
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,240
about those romance scams!

720
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,240
They lure you in, trap you,
and then take everything!

721
00:30:44,244 --> 00:30:45,080
A romance scam?

722
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:46,830
No way.

723
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,200
Those scams happen online.

724
00:30:48,266 --> 00:30:51,030
No scammer would bother
writing actual letters back and forth.

725
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,040
It's too slow.

726
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,720
Slow work makes fine work!

727
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,430
Scammers are evolving!

728
00:30:57,511 --> 00:30:58,640
You're having porridge.

729
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,630
I bought you your favorite.

730
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,030
Salted duck eggs.

731
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,190
Salted duck eggs?

732
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,440
From Gaoyou.

733
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,710
Their yolks are oily and rich.

734
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,590
If that old man

735
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,960
does have something going on,

736
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,590
then what about Ms. Peng?

737
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,400
Oh, don't worry about her, Mom.

738
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,680
Why are you worrying about this?

739
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,390
How can I not worry?

740
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,000
If Ms. Peng becomes his partner,

741
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,280
we'd both get a break.

742
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,670
Do you know

743
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,270
how good Ms. Peng's cooking is?

744
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,533
Even if her cooking is amazing,

745
00:31:26,555 --> 00:31:28,030
why would she cook for us for free?

746
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,400
Because of a marriage certificate?

747
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,560
Who needs a marriage certificate
to live together?

748
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,960
Look what happened to her.

749
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,030
The moment someone mentioned

750
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:34,960
a marriage certificate,

751
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,470
everything fell apart.

752
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,980
(Days)

753
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,040
(Then let's play)

754
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,830
(a game of patience.)

755
00:31:49,288 --> 00:31:51,888
(Days were slower in the past.)
(Sunday morning at 9:00 AM sharp,)

756
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,040
(we each)

757
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,430
(send the other a postcard.)

758
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,320
(Let's see)

759
00:31:57,466 --> 00:31:58,800
(who receives theirs last.)

760
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,020
(Carriage, horse, and mail
did not reach fast.)

761
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:14,740
(Postbox)

762
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,030
Lina, you're here.

763
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:19,870
Dad, you're back.

764
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,720
Yes.

765
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,970
Were you at the post office again?

766
00:32:21,977 --> 00:32:23,830
Yes. Sent a letter

767
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,750
and bought

768
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,190
some nice stationery and envelopes.

769
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,200
Who do you keep writing to all the time?

770
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,190
So mysterious.

771
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,520
A friend, of course.

772
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,830
What kind of friend needs
so many letters?

773
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,270
A

774
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,190
scientist.

775
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,400
We're both fond of Kun Opera.

776
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,150
It's that female scientist

777
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:45,000
you argued with in your article,
isn't it?

778
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,310
It's the fourth tone.

779
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,920
Remember.

780
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,270
- Yes.
- The fourth tone.

781
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:54,820
- Duì.
- Right.

782
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,840
That scientist?

783
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,760
Yes.

784
00:32:57,511 --> 00:32:59,955
You two started out as rivals
before becoming friends.

785
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:00,840
Dad, I'm telling you.

786
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:01,920
This is straight out

787
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,960
of a K-drama romance plot.

788
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,920
They always get their happy endings.

789
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
Where are you going?

790
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,480
I want to boil some water
to make noodles.

791
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,080
I'll help you.

792
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,950
- I...
- Lina.

793
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,400
Look at you.

794
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,800
Don't rush into things

795
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,720
like your mother.

796
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,110
Take your time.

797
00:33:29,288 --> 00:33:30,400
Let things happen slowly.

798
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:32,550
Take my time.

799
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,110
"Let things happen slowly."

800
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,920
Writing letters
when you can just send a text.

801
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:38,950
That'll take forever.

802
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,880
Oh, right. Dad.

803
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,310
Do you know how much
our phone bill was this month?

804
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,360
How much?

805
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,720
500.

806
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,960
And before?

807
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,590
50.

808
00:33:53,933 --> 00:33:54,960
That's a huge difference.

809
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:58,880
In that case,

810
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,190
I'll try to use my mobile phone more.

811
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,150
Use voice calls instead.

812
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,400
That's it.

813
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,400
That's free.

814
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,320
Yes.

815
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,470
Yes.

816
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,030
Ms. Nie.

817
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,840
Of course, I know it's you.

818
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,760
Voice calls.

819
00:34:17,888 --> 00:34:19,080
Use the voice call function.

820
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,880
All right.

821
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:21,920
I'll stay quiet.

822
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,080
I mailed the postcard

823
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,520
exactly on time.

824
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,800
Yes.

825
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,790
You've posted yours too?

826
00:34:36,555 --> 00:34:37,790
All right. I'll be waiting.

827
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,400
Did you know?

828
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,480
Two minutes before,

829
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,560
I was already standing at the postbox.

830
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,960
I watched the second-hand

831
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,920
tick down,

832
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,550
and right at the stroke

833
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,110
of 9 AM,

834
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,790
I dropped it in.

835
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,680
Oh, look at this!

836
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,070
How did you

837
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,520
burn your hand so badly?

838
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,240
Does it hurt?

839
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:05,630
I'm fine.

840
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,880
- Obviously, it'd hurt.
- Of course.

841
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,570
Even the tiniest cuts hurt.

842
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,760
Lina.

843
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,520
Stay away from spicy foods.

844
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,680
I know.

845
00:35:14,755 --> 00:35:16,244
Here, have some black sesame soup.

846
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,880
Too hot!

847
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,150
- Sorry.
- Give me that!

848
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,280
Clumsy ox!

849
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,080
Don't burn your daughter's tongue!

850
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,840
Here.

851
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,800
I'll do it.

852
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,640
Pass me the remote.

853
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,550
All right.

854
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,150
Which channel?

855
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,440
I can switch the channels myself.

856
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,190
Please welcome our host, Meng Fei.

857
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,550
(Meng Fei, Host)
Welcome.

858
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,080
Open wide.

859
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,230
- Here.
- See that?

860
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:45,710
Yes.

861
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,400
Black sesame soup is good for you.

862
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:49,270
It's packed with nutrients.

863
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,920
Sweet and creamy.

864
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,110
Open wide now.

865
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,190
Isn't this nice?

866
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,480
Oh, right. Liu.

867
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,270
I won't be going home with you.

868
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:00,550
Why?

869
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,960
What do you mean, "why"?

870
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,920
You burned your hand.
You have to keep it dry

871
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,920
to avoid infections.

872
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,400
I'll stay and do the chores

873
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,750
around the house.

874
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,590
Got it.

875
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,070
I tell all my friends.

876
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,150
No matter what it is.

877
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,710
Personal, business, important, trivial,

878
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,790
fun, or just idle chatter,

879
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,080
they need to make an appointment.

880
00:36:20,088 --> 00:36:21,311
You like Huang Lan, don't you?

881
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,190
- Who's that?
- I do. She's pretty...

882
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,360
She's not pretty.

883
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,880
Oh, don't lie.

884
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,440
It's just a tiny wound.

885
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,840
Did you really need to get your mother
to take care of you?

886
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,630
Tiny? Look at this!

887
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,110
It's a whole patch!

888
00:36:44,422 --> 00:36:46,311
My mom's the only one
who worries about me.

889
00:36:46,355 --> 00:36:47,270
Your father?

890
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,920
He didn't care at all.

891
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,670
I turned off the fire for him.

892
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,150
Fine, fine.

893
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,440
Here.

894
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,360
Let's wipe your face.

895
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,190
The towel's too dry.

896
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,630
My skin hurts from the rubbing.

897
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,240
Too dry?

898
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,880
Wet enough for you?

899
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,040
Now it's too wet.

900
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,040
Look! It's dripping!

901
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,480
It's fine. I'll do it myself.

902
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:19,800
Just give it a twist.

903
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,955
I'll leave you to it, then.

904
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,310
Are you actually leaving?

905
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,400
You told me to leave,
so I'm not going to stay.

906
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,000
I can't even twist the towel!

907
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,920
What's wrong?

908
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,400
What's going on here?

909
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,960
- Mom.
- It's nothing.

910
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,090
I was just asking Shen Qing
to twist the towel for me.

911
00:37:33,155 --> 00:37:35,060
Shen Qing, you get busy.
I'll take care of this.

912
00:37:35,066 --> 00:37:35,680
I'll do it.

913
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,800
Mom told me to go.

914
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,022
I'm just doing what she said.

915
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,088
I'm going back to my work.

916
00:37:40,088 --> 00:37:40,933
This should do it.

917
00:37:40,955 --> 00:37:41,800
I'll wipe you off.

918
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:42,950
All right.

919
00:37:43,644 --> 00:37:44,977
Get some rest after we're done.

920
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,070
All right.

Shen Qing.

923
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,960
Working late?

924
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,710
Here.

925
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,840
Have a glass of milk.

926
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,790
Here you go.

927
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,550
Thanks, Mom.

928
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,080
You should go to bed.

929
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,840
When you get to my age,
you barely sleep.

930
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,480
I'm not disturbing you, am I?

931
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,710
Not at all.

(RF Work Chat)

933
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,560
Why are you still getting

934
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,840
so many messages at this hour?

935
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,030
It's the work chat.

937
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:48,950
You've worked hard.

938
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,310
Work is tough.

939
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,150
Shen Qing.

940
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,230
Your father's been glowing lately.

941
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,670
It's a relief.

942
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,000
I was worried about him.

943
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:04,950
Yes.

944
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:06,430
He's in much better spirits.

945
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,400
Did Gou introduce

946
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,880
another girlfriend to your dad?

947
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,790
I see him going out every day.

948
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,320
I... I'm not sure.

949
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,190
I think

950
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,040
when it comes to matchmaking,

951
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:29,360
it's best if family handles it.

952
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,440
Remember

953
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,320
Lian Yilian?

954
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,840
I have a colleague.

955
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,230
Peng Yulan.

956
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,560
Your dad's met her.

957
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,190
She's incredibly capable

958
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,520
and still in good health.

959
00:39:42,555 --> 00:39:44,466
And she doesn't want anything in return.

960
00:39:44,511 --> 00:39:45,511
That's rare.

961
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,190
Why don't you put in

962
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,190
a good word to your dad?

963
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:53,880
Mom, I think we should just let things
take their natural course.

964
00:39:54,933 --> 00:39:56,333
Right. Let it happen naturally.

965
00:39:58,288 --> 00:39:59,670
I think I should call it a night.

966
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,590
I have work tomorrow.

967
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,320
Oh, right.

968
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,790
You should get some rest.

969
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,800
Letting things take their course

970
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,459
is fine and all, but family should still
keep an eye on things.

971
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,329
Or if those
so-called "friends" start meddling,

972
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:13,133
trying to set him up with someone,
what then?

973
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,480
I'll stop talking.

974
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,960
You go get some rest.

975
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,360
I'll be here for a couple more days.

976
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,400
We can talk another time.

977
00:40:20,755 --> 00:40:22,355
You should sleep soon too, Mom.

978
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,270
It's only 6 AM.

979
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,040
Where would he be off to?

980
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,430
Mom?

981
00:41:21,733 --> 00:41:24,333
What are you doing, Mom?
Performing some sort of ritual?

982
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:27,630
You scared me!

983
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,111
Why did you slap me on the shoulder?

984
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,070
What were you doing?

985
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,920
Practicing the fan dance.

986
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,280
Sheesh.

987
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,430
What's up?

988
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:36,720
Your father-in-law went out

989
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,840
early this morning.

990
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,440
At 6 AM sharp.

991
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,790
Are you here to take care of me
or spy on him?

992
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:46,630
He's just out for his morning walk.

993
00:41:47,111 --> 00:41:48,710
Has he ever gone out this early before?

994
00:41:48,911 --> 00:41:50,488
Has he ever taken morning walks?

995
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,920
Not really.

996
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,590
That's it, then!

997
00:41:53,822 --> 00:41:56,450
There's always a reason when something
out of the ordinary happens.

998
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,590
As his children,
you need to pay attention.

999
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,459
You don't want to be the ones
handing over money

1000
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,230
while your father-in-law
gets tricked, do you?

1001
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,440
I don't think it's that serious.

1002
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,880
Why not?

1003
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,920
Listen to me.

1004
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,960
Tragedies have happened before.

1005
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,150
Right?

1006
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,280
All right, all right.

1007
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,920
I'll keep an eye on him for you.

1008
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,110
I already made breakfast.

1009
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,280
It's over there.

1010
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:17,190
- You can go back to sleep.
- Where?

1011
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,110
I'll go wash up.

1012
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,150
I'll head to the morning market
in a bit.

1013
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,360
What should I get your father-in-law?

1014
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,920
You decide.

1015
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,590
All right.

1016
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,840
I didn't hit you, did I?

1017
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,070
No.

1018
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,400
- You're up.
- Yes.

1019
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,070
I made breakfast. Go eat it.

1020
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,880
I... I'll have some water first.

1021
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,110
All right.

1022
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,190
- I...
- Carry on.

1023
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,110
All right.
