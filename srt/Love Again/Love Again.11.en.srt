3
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,110
Your dad was practically on his last leg
not long ago.

4
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,490
Then, he came back yesterday,
all worked up and fuming.

5
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,110
Did Mr. Gou feed him gunpowder?

6
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,480
I'm talking to you. Did you hear me?

7
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,800
What?

8
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,000
Couldn't you announce yourself?

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,150
I almost had a heart attack.

10
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,710
Is my mask that scary?

11
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:58,750
Come on, look at you.

12
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,920
What did you just say?

13
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,320
I was talking about your dad.

14
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,510
He left and hasn't come back yet.

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,110
Aren't you worried?

16
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,480
My dad went out?

17
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,560
When did he leave?

18
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,510
How would I know?

19
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,710
Call him and find out.

20
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,790
What?

21
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,630
Hello?

22
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,790
Dad?

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,920
Where are you?

24
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,670
- Outside the house.
- I'm back.

25
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,630
Dad.

26
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,550
Where did you go?

27
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,950
I went to the library.

28
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,270
I picked up a bunch of

29
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,190
books on Kun Opera.

30
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,030
Take a look.

31
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,960
Dad.

32
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,300
You're going to study opera again?

33
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,070
This is Lina.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,480
Like a lotus in clear water,
pure and unadorned.

35
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,990
Stop putting weird stuff on your face.

36
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,670
You look terrifying.

♪A Stroll in the Garden:

39
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,080
Calling me stubborn?

40
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,870
Fine.

41
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,590
I'll stay stubborn to the end.

(I came across
a remarkable female scientist.)

47
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,580
(She dabbled across industries,
and made reviews...)

48
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,060
(Not only is she bossy and opinionated,)

49
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,100
(but her sharp tongue rivals any man's.)

50
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,030
Sun, the paper's here.

51
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,040
Here's your paper, Mr. Shen.
Morning edition.

52
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,560
- Great.
- Let me have a look.

53
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,480
There it is.

54
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,030
"Going up Against A Female Scientist"

55
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,190
"I came across

56
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,880
a remarkable female scientist."

57
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,510
"She dabbled across industries,
and made reviews like a pro."

58
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,020
"Not only is she bossy and opinionated,
but her sharp tongue rivals any man's."

59
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,600
Mr. Shen.

60
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,320
Did you write this article?

61
00:04:39,688 --> 00:04:40,880
It got published in the paper!

62
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:41,990
That's amazing.

63
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,510
"Going Up Against A Female Scientist."

64
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,240
This character is pronounced "duì" here.

65
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,910
In "Shuowen Jiezi", it says

66
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:49,900
"Duì"

67
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,870
means "to resent."

68
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,590
So who is this female scientist?

69
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,510
Some arrogant woman.

70
00:04:55,844 --> 00:04:57,244
She thinks she knows everything.

71
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,640
She thinks she owns the world.

72
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,950
But that sounds like an arrogant guy!

73
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,640
Not in this case.

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,320
Here, it just means

75
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,680
she is full of herself.

76
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,350
Did she offend you or something?

77
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,640
Not at all.

78
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,390
I get it now, Mr. Shen.

79
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,080
You wrote this piece

80
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,310
for the manuscript fee.

81
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,590
Mr. Shen! Mr. Shen!

82
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:21,910
It's great to be educated.

83
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,600
You make money praising people

84
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,000
or criticizing them.

85
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,590
I better start studying.

86
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Hello?

87
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,520
Professor Shen.

88
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,040
Ms. Nie.

89
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,080
You're up early.

90
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,310
Something wrong?

91
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,720
Professor Shen.

92
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,590
"Going Up Against A Female Scientist".

93
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,120
That was your piece, right?

94
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,880
In my opinion, your opinion

95
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,240
was narrow and harsh.

96
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,830
You blew a simple argument

97
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,030
into a full-on public takedown.

98
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,640
Do scientists need
to be divided by gender?

99
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,390
Even arguing has to be about
male and female now?

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I think

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,880
that's discrimination from a high horse.

102
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,830
Ms. Nie.

103
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,830
Good morning.

104
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,800
First of all,

105
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,350
I need to correct your pronunciation.

106
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,750
This character

107
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,660
"Dui"

108
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,640
was pronounced wrongly.

109
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,310
That character

110
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,350
should be pronounced "duì."

111
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,470
Not "duǐ."

112
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:30,800
Like in "The sky rages in fury".

113
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,720
This is a character

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,510
even the security guard at our complex

115
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,680
pronounces wrongly.

116
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,030
But I can forgive him for that.

117
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,120
When you say it wrong though,

118
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,120
I find it kind of unbelievable.

119
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,160
Right?

120
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,080
Think about it.

121
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,750
You can't even pronounce a common

122
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,844
Chinese character correctly.

123
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,390
Where did you get

124
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,080
the confidence

125
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,200
to critique Kun Opera?

126
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,390
I don't think the two are even related.

127
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,240
Ms. Nie,

128
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,120
can you let me finish first?

129
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,640
Go ahead.

130
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:03,950
Second of all,

131
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,070
right now,

132
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:06,680
it's half past six in the morning.

133
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,990
When you're calling at this hour,

134
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,230
have you thought about
the person picking up?

135
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,950
What if they were just hitting

136
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,800
deep sleep?

137
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,950
And what if they had a heart condition?

138
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,440
Getting startled by a call

139
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,080
could be dangerous.

140
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,630
And just so you know,
I happen to have both.

141
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,950
So based on that alone,

142
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,590
don't you think you owe me an apology?

143
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,190
I'm sorry.

144
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,590
I apologize.

145
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,110
Once you've had enough sleep,

146
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,000
and your heart is

147
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,350
in a stable condition,

148
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,640
we'll talk.

149
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,280
Ms. Nie.

150
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,830
You...

151
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,000
Ms. Nie?

152
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,870
I have nothing to fear
when reason is on my side.

153
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,520
I'm not afraid of you.

154
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,120
Dad, are you reading the paper?

155
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,480
Let's keep lunch simple today.

156
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,030
How about shredded potatoes stir-fry?

157
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,680
And maybe some veggie meatballs?

158
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,320
Anything works for me.

159
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,550
Hello?

160
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,360
Hello?

161
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,400
Hello? Hello?

162
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,000
Shen Qing.

163
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,920
Come look at your dad.

164
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:43,240
- Hello?
- Come on, hurry!

165
00:09:43,355 --> 00:09:45,000
- He's testing the phone.
- Hello?

166
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,830
Weird, right?

167
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,230
Maybe he's waiting on a call?

168
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,470
At least he's not bored.

169
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,920
It's better than lying
in the recliner all day.

170
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,000
That's true.

171
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,950
Have you eaten yet?

172
00:09:58,266 --> 00:09:59,440
What did you eat? Show me.

173
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,390
Here, look.

174
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,390
Lunch box.

175
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,320
Braised pork, shredded potatoes,
and two greens.

176
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:06,870
Too greasy and too salty.
Totally unhealthy.

177
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,160
Even you are getting oily.

178
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:14,950
Dear, it's not like
I want the greasy stuff.

179
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,280
What else can I do?

180
00:10:16,644 --> 00:10:17,850
I'll bring you lunch next time.

181
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,870
Alright. You'd better bring it.

182
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,000
I'll be waiting.

183
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,320
I need to go.

184
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:24,870
Let me check what Dad's up to.

185
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,670
Dad?

186
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,040
Waiting for a call?

187
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,420
No.

188
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,240
No call.

189
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,110
Let me know if the phone rings.

190
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,240
Lin Haoxuan's mom got scammed.

191
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,350
She lost 500 grand.

192
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,040
That's heartbreaking.

193
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,430
Exactly.

194
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,920
So, you have to stay alert.

195
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,160
Don't worry.

196
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,590
After years of being raised
by your granny,

197
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,870
there's only ever been one person

198
00:11:06,977 --> 00:11:08,680
who managed to get money
out of my pocket.

199
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,040
And that's you.

200
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,080
Mom.

201
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,400
Be honest when you speak.

202
00:11:13,977 --> 00:11:15,440
Then give me a hundred right now

203
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,990
and prove you mean it.

204
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,150
No way!

205
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,130
I'm not falling for that.

206
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,120
I'm back.

207
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,490
- Welcome back.
- Dad.

208
00:11:22,911 --> 00:11:23,870
I'll get you some food.

209
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,470
No need. I've already eaten.

210
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,590
- Already?
- Yep.

211
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,880
Duole.

212
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:29,990
Your aunt sent over

213
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,200
some real TOEFL exam papers.

214
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,333
I'll print them out for you.

215
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,440
She is really enthused.

216
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,920
Lina.

217
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,190
Lina?

218
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,070
Mom.

219
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,840
Mom.

220
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,510
Why'd you bump into me so hard?
That hurt.

221
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,080
- Did it hurt? Sorry!
- No, I'm okay.

222
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,000
I didn't know you were
standing in the doorway.

223
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,880
Here, give me that.

224
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,230
Is the old man home?

225
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,400
He should be.

226
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,640
Good.

227
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,630
I invited Ms. Peng over
to catch up a bit.

228
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,320
Let's not.

229
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
Why invite Ms. Peng?

230
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,430
Why not?

231
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:02,960
Don't go stirring things up.

232
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,222
Why are you inviting Peng Yulan?

233
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:05,133
Come on, let's go.

234
00:12:05,177 --> 00:12:06,040
Don't do it!

235
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,870
Why do you never learn your lesson?

236
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,950
You bumped yourself.

237
00:12:13,755 --> 00:12:15,550
- Baoqin, are you alright?
- Are you alright?

238
00:12:15,577 --> 00:12:17,280
- Are you okay?
- I'm alright.

239
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,470
You never change.

240
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,150
The moment I knocked,
you opened the door.

241
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,910
And I was just about
to head out when you knocked.

242
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,870
Talk about timing.

243
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:25,910
Dad, are you going out?

244
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,830
Are you coming back for lunch?

245
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:28,960
No, I'm not.

246
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,360
I made plans with Mr. Gou.

247
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,644
We're playing chess at his place.

248
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,800
Wait.

249
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,030
I bought so much food.

250
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,630
Can't you come home to eat?

251
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,600
- Yeah.
- Nope.

252
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,710
We've already made plans.

253
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:39,750
Eat without me.

254
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,590
Don't worry about me.

255
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,309
- Dad, your shoelace is untied.
- Oh, right.

256
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,440
- Tie it up.
- I'm tying it.

257
00:12:43,444 --> 00:12:44,622
- Hurry. Tie it.
- Okay.

258
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,110
A whole group of retirees.

259
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,350
Alright. Let's go.

260
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,390
The goat milk powder's still there.

261
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,630
I brought it over.

262
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,150
The old man's been
sneaking around lately.

263
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,533
He probably didn't even notice.

264
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,240
He didn't? Hold up.

265
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,920
What are you doing?

266
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,040
What now?

267
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,710
I'll have Peng Yulan deliver it again.

268
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,400
Your father-in-law is
always running off lately.

269
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,470
I bet that Gou is fixing him up
with someone again.

270
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,230
How would I know?

271
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,440
I'm not trying to speak up for Ms. Peng.

272
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,830
But, she got her head on straight.

273
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,550
She's clear about everything.

274
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,600
She doesn't want a house

275
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,040
or his salary card.

276
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,030
Just some monthly allowance, right?

277
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,440
She'll handle all the chores.

278
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,030
But that Mr. Gou?

279
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,911
Can you really trust someone
he introduced?

280
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,480
Your father-in-law is getting old.

281
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,560
Sometimes he gets confused, you know?

282
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,870
Anyway, I'm telling you,

283
00:14:21,044 --> 00:14:23,470
we cannot let another
Lian Yilian situation happen again.

284
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,430
Hello?

285
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,200
Hello, Professor Shen!

286
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,920
This is Yang Lei from the literary
section of Literature Daily.

287
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,710
Ah, Yang!

288
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,550
Sorry.

289
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,760
How can I help you?

290
00:14:57,911 --> 00:15:00,000
Someone submitted
a response to your article.

291
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,710
The piece is titled

292
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,740
"Refuting A Male Literary Scholar."

293
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,710
The author is an astronomer

294
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,030
named Nie Juanjuan.

295
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,950
You know her, right?

296
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,240
Of course I do.

297
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,320
I know her very well.

298
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,640
Professor Shen.

299
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,630
I just wanted to ask
before we go ahead.

300
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,040
You're not upset, are you?

301
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,150
I don't argue with women.

302
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,230
Why would I be upset?

303
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,320
Not at all.

304
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,920
That's great to hear.

305
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,080
Then, we'll publish it.

306
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,240
Goodbye.

307
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,640
Yang?

308
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,000
She's declared war on me!

309
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,440
Fine!

310
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,360
So be it!

311
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,350
- Hello, Ice.
- Hello, Mr. Shen.

312
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,750
- This way, please.
- Sure.

313
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,640
Mr. Shen.

314
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,110
Your data is impressively accurate.

315
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,150
Working with your company is a breeze.

316
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,800
You flatter us.

317
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,600
Mr. Shen.

318
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,640
Your coffee.

319
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,950
Thanks.

320
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,830
I really like their coffee.

321
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,350
And their logo too.

322
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,530
"From a tree to a forest."

323
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,630
Mr. Shen asked me
to get it from this shop.

324
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,760
I saw it in your Moments post.

325
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,920
That explains it.

326
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,840
I'll leave you to it.

327
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,430
I saw your post too.

328
00:16:33,888 --> 00:16:35,688
You went to
Normal University on Monday.

329
00:16:36,933 --> 00:16:38,755
I took my dad there to run some errands.

330
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,870
He used to be a professor there.

331
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,310
When I first moved to Nanjing,

332
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,480
I lived near the campus too.

333
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,190
I remember

334
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,560
there was a little pond
behind the Yifu Building?

335
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,000
I used to take walks there.

336
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,190
Maybe we even crossed paths back then.

337
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,360
Indeed.

338
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,630
Can you still get in and out
of the campus freely?

339
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,800
Family members can.

340
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,240
Sometimes I go running there.

341
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,230
You run too?

342
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,280
After my mom passed away,

343
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,022
I started having trouble sleeping.

344
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,000
Sometimes, a good run helps a little.

345
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,480
That's why I started too.

346
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:16,910
I couldn't sleep well.

347
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,430
Looks like we're in the same boat.

348
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,510
Yeah.

349
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,240
That just reminded me of a book.

350
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,240
"What I Think About
When I Am Running."

351
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:31,280
What do you think about when you run?

352
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,400
Honestly,

353
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,390
probably nothing.

354
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,230
I'm just

355
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,400
feeling the wind,

356
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,350
feeling my breath,

357
00:17:42,866 --> 00:17:44,280
and feeling that moment of freedom.

358
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,070
What about you?

359
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:49,990
What's on your mind?

360
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,800
Me?

361
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,350
I think about my reports.

362
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,560
My receivables.

363
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,600
My payables.

364
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,670
Sometimes, I feel more tired

365
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,960
after a run.

366
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,080
You need to let your mind
wander a little.

367
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,590
I joined a running club.

368
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,830
You should try it sometime.

369
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,240
When you're running with a group,

370
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,670
you'll naturally try to keep pace.

371
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,030
And when you do that,

372
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,870
all your worries just disappear.

373
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,640
Sounds good.

374
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,880
But I'm not sure I can keep up

375
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,800
with you guys.

376
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,030
You'll be fine.

377
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:28,755
I know a great pair of running shoes.

378
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,750
This is the brand. These shoes

379
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,800
are lighter than paper.

380
00:18:33,377 --> 00:18:34,590
And super comfy on your feet.

381
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,240
Lots of colors too.

382
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,480
- Whoa, it's really that light?
- Yeah.

383
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,390
It's designed for marathon runners.

384
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:45,830
Well,

385
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,720
I'm only doing under 10 km for now.

386
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,920
Son!

387
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,270
I'm back! Come try these shoes on!

388
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,910
Quick, look what I got you!

389
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,590
Wow, today must be when pigs fly.

390
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,239
Do you even know what size his feet are?

391
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,720
Dad called me to ask.

392
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,760
Try them on.

393
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,710
Here.

394
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,390
Well? Feel light?

395
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,350
Feels like nothing at all, right?

396
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,280
I give them five stars.

397
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,310
What got you all gleeful today?

398
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,230
Did you fall in love?

399
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,200
Dad's in love?

400
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,120
Mom, what about you?

401
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,240
Your mom is the love of my life.

402
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,960
Mom, was Dad your first love?

403
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,270
Of course.

404
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,830
He once had a crush
on his English teacher.

405
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,830
But that doesn't count.

406
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,240
A crush still counts.

407
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:45,511
Mom, you don't get to decide.

408
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:46,400
We have to ask Dad.

409
00:19:46,422 --> 00:19:47,955
If your mom says it counts, it counts.

410
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,670
She's my one and only.

411
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,640
You all have shoes.
Why am I left out?

412
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,190
You don't even run.

413
00:19:59,711 --> 00:20:01,040
I'll start running if I get them.

414
00:20:02,044 --> 00:20:03,350
I'll get you a pair tomorrow.

415
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,830
Are they expensive? How much?

416
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,350
Well, you get what you pay for.

417
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,200
You must have money to burn.

418
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,390
Duole already has so many sneakers.
Why buy him more?

419
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,630
These shoes are high-tech
and super light.

420
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,040
But his feet grow fast.

421
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,510
However,

422
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,150
I'm happy if you're happy.

423
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,590
If you like it, I like it.

424
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,800
You're the true master of this house.

425
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,430
However,

426
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,910
if you could give it some thought
before you speak,

427
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,190
your words will carry even more weight.

428
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,430
Fine.

429
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,390
What was that for?

430
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,670
Isn't she the master of this household?

431
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,350
This boy is unbelievable.

432
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,800
She's clapping back.

433
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,030
Nie Juanjuan's going head-to-head
with me in public!

434
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,030
Look at this.

435
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:49,950
Take a look.

436
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,320
"Refuting A Male Literary Scholar."

437
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,000
Well, who would've thought?

438
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,070
Nie Juanjuan always seemed so bookish.

439
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,390
Turns out, she's a real fighter.

440
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,150
She's not fighting. She's writing.

441
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,390
That's what they call
fighting with words.

442
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,560
Mr. Lu Xun used to fight this way too.

443
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,920
It's even more brutal.

444
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,910
Shen, we support you. Keep writing!

445
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,800
Take that scientist head-on.

446
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,430
And if you need backup, we can publish

447
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,040
a joint response.

448
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,880
This doesn't need to escalate

449
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,822
to the level of a literature
department showdown.

450
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,960
"It all started
during one of our meetings."

451
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,080
"We disagreed over how a line
in Kun Opera should be pronounced."

452
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:33,680
"That's what sparked this whole thing."

453
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,600
See that?

454
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,560
This is a personal grudge.

455
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,190
Don't get involved.

456
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,760
I can take her on solo.

457
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,400
Shen!

458
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,920
You crack me up.

459
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,920
- Hello, Professor Shen.
- Hello.

460
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,700
(Welcome to the Old Teahouse)

461
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:37,830
Why isn't Grandpa back yet?

462
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,320
He's been completely
absorbed in his studies lately.

463
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,720
Call your dad for me.

464
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,960
I'll give him a call.

465
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,830
- Dad, you're back.
- I'm home.

466
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,030
- You're so late.
- Grandpa!

467
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,266
You didn't answer your phone.

468
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,910
Yeah! Why didn't you pick up?

469
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,000
Go on, eat. Don't wait for me.

470
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:17,470
Ms. Nie.

471
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,920
This is Shen Zhuoran.

472
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,240
I want to offer you a formal apology.

473
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,360
These past few days,

474
00:23:25,422 --> 00:23:27,110
I've been digging
into a lot of material.

475
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,190
Just this afternoon,

476
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,720
I even went to our department

477
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,720
and spoke with a Kun Opera expert.

478
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,120
Turns out,

479
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,190
you were right.

480
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,080
In opera, what matters most

481
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,670
is authenticity and tradition.

482
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,800
It's passed down from master
to apprentice.

483
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,110
Even if a senior performer
got a line wrong,

484
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:48,000
that still became part
of the art's original form.

485
00:23:48,288 --> 00:23:50,320
It carries emotional weight
and historical meaning.

486
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,630
I owe you an apology too.

487
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,430
I got a bit carried away.

488
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:01,390
I guess squabbles
do bring people together.

489
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,510
Now about that...

490
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:05,510
I've actually been curious.

491
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,920
You're an astronomer.

492
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,040
How did you end up
so deep in Kun Opera studies?

493
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,040
Astronomy has the Cowherd
and the Weaver Girl.

494
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:18,280
Opera has Du Liniang and Liu Mengmei.

495
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,080
The Cowherd and Weaver Girl
are 16 light-years apart,

496
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,670
but they meet once a year
in the Qixi tale.

497
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,360
Du Liniang

498
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,040
died for love,

499
00:24:28,355 --> 00:24:29,560
and came back to life for it.

500
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,030
See?

501
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,280
Astronomy and opera

502
00:24:32,422 --> 00:24:34,670
speak the same emotional language
in different forms.

503
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,760
Let me recommend a book

504
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,760
by Mr. Mei Lanfang,

505
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,870
"Forty Years on Stage."

506
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,470
Sure.

507
00:24:46,044 --> 00:24:47,190
You'll send it to me?

508
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,830
Sure. Write down my address.

509
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:53,000
No. 103 Ninghai Road, Gulou District.

510
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,760
Building 50, Unit 3, Apartment 301.

511
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,360
Great.

512
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,430
Alright, I'll be waiting.

513
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,360
Thank you, Ms. Nie.

514
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,560
Thank you so much.

515
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,920
Goodbye.

516
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,510
Goodbye.

517
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,320
What are you waving at me for?

518
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,430
Dad, there are scammers everywhere.

519
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,720
Duole's classmate's mom
just got scammed out of 500 grand.

520
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,750
You can't give out our address

521
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,800
to strangers.

522
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,960
She's not a scammer.

523
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,080
She's a master.

524
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,880
A master?

525
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,480
From which temple, exactly?

526
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,190
A master with a State Council stipend.

527
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,000
She studies astrophysics.

528
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,520
Yet, she knows even more
about Chinese opera.

529
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,750
Cross-disciplinary genius? Impressive.

530
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,533
- I told you so.
- An academic powerhouse.

531
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,480
She's more than just that.

532
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,480
She's a PhD advisor.

533
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:46,040
The mother of all elite students.

534
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,280
A real master.

535
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,270
Oh, right.

536
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,240
Duole.

537
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,160
I have a quiz for you.

538
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,960
The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl,

539
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,240
how far apart are their stars?

540
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,910
Grandpa, let's eat.

541
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,190
Yeah, knowledge won't fill your stomach.

542
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,230
Eat up.

543
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,150
This is food for the soul.

544
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,240
We need both kinds.

545
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,720
And we've got to be good at both.

546
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,190
Grandpa.

547
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,377
I have a quiz for you too.

548
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,160
- Go ahead.
- What class am I in?

549
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,240
You're in...

550
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,280
Class Three!

551
00:26:22,533 --> 00:26:23,600
Stop changing the subject.

552
00:26:24,822 --> 00:26:26,422
Which class you're in doesn't matter.

553
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,070
But learning some astronomy

554
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,750
- is important.
- Exactly.

555
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,200
What do you mean it doesn't matter?

556
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,560
If you don't know the class,

557
00:26:32,577 --> 00:26:34,090
what about the parent-teacher meetings?

558
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,022
How do you pay tuition?

559
00:26:35,022 --> 00:26:36,500
How do you fill out the student forms?

560
00:26:36,533 --> 00:26:37,444
Or the health records?

561
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,000
You two only care about
"masters" and whatnot.

562
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,030
But you leave everything at home to me.

563
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,300
And you say it's not important?

564
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,630
Lina's right.

565
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,640
We'll do better.

566
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,800
I should've remembered.

567
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,230
Alright.

568
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,510
I remember now.

569
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,670
Class Three.

570
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:55,160
I remember.

571
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,110
You're in Class Three.

572
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,030
Class Three.

573
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,670
Exactly.

574
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:01,240
Even the Cowherd
and the Weaver Girl meet once a year.

575
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,030
Duole is already in high school.

576
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,511
Have you met his homeroom teacher?

577
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,240
From now on, don't leave me alone

578
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,760
to get scolded at every parent meeting.

579
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,960
We're taking turns.

580
00:27:12,955 --> 00:27:14,310
Try the eggplant fritters I made.

581
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,160
One for everyone.

582
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,960
- Here, Dad.
- First time I've made these.

583
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,910
Give me some honest feedback.

584
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,520
See how humble I am?

585
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,040
Humility is good.

586
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,080
Otherwise, you end up

587
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,160
having to apologize.

588
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:28,110
Dad, try it. Is it too salty?

589
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,480
What's going on?

590
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,440
What now?

591
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,360
Little Du!

592
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,560
Opera Channel.

593
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,920
We are now playing

594
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,030
Opera Channel.

595
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:43,700
♪So it turns out all those
vibrant blossoms have bloomed♪

596
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,640
Right on time.

597
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:51,380
(A Stroll in the Garden)

598
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:58,940
♪Only to be given up♪

599
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,080
A Stroll in the Garden.

600
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,720
Your dad got over heartbreak real quick.

601
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,240
Now, he's totally obsessed with opera.

602
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,280
Don't you find that weird?

603
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,800
What's weird about it?

604
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,080
My dad's sharp and eager to learn.

605
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,560
He's self-aware.

606
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,160
He knows how to overcome pain.

607
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,190
That's a good thing.

608
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,960
Going for a run this late?

609
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,560
I have to try the new shoes.

610
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,270
Alright, go on.

611
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,110
Grab me a loaf of toast bread.

612
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,240
I'm making sandwiches in the morning.

613
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,160
Got it.

614
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,960
Are you wearing perfume?

615
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,110
Who wears perfume to go running?

616
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,030
Well...

617
00:28:42,644 --> 00:28:43,911
It's the one our son gave me.

618
00:28:43,977 --> 00:28:45,640
If I don't use it, it'll go bad.

619
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,630
One good sweat and it's all gone anyway.

620
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,800
Well, isn't that called fragrant sweat?

621
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,120
Watch yourself, okay?

622
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,390
Flies only buzz around cracked eggs.

623
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,760
Alright. Got it.

624
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,670
Just the regular sliced bread, okay?

625
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,830
Can you do it?

626
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,880
I won't mess it up.

627
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,830
It really is kinda strange.

628
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:50,870
Is your father-in-law seeing someone?

629
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:51,990
No way.

630
00:29:52,222 --> 00:29:53,640
All he does is carry a water bottle

631
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,110
and a steamed bun
to the library every day.

632
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,960
He's got it rougher than Tang Sanzang.

633
00:29:58,577 --> 00:29:59,640
There's nothing going on.

634
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,355
When things feel off,
something probably is.

635
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,520
You two better keep your eyes open.

636
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,350
Don't let some new

637
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,960
but false love

638
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,280
catch you guys off guard.

639
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,640
Oh, come on, Mom. Seriously?

640
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,280
You're getting way too involved.

641
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,320
Because you two won't.

642
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,240
That family of yours

643
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,390
almost got taken apart
by that Lian woman.

644
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,000
Alright, enough.

645
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,920
Shen Qing's back.

646
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,160
Okay.

647
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,070
You're back.

648
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:31,990
Did you get the toast?

649
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,120
Yeah, I got it.

650
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,720
Running is great for you.

651
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,910
You look totally refreshed.

652
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,280
And those pecs are so cute.

653
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,190
Then, run with me tomorrow.

654
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,800
I'm not built for running.

655
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,000
Doing housework is already a workout.

656
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,960
That was pretty direct.

657
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,880
Keep your voice down.

658
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,320
Adorable, right?

659
00:31:08,177 --> 00:31:09,360
And he even cooks for me.

660
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,200
Sorry!

661
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,150
I'm late again.

662
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,710
Late again.

663
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,800
I ordered for you.

664
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,080
Thanks.

665
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,720
So today,

666
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,150
I dropped off my son.

667
00:31:23,244 --> 00:31:25,422
Then, I went to get medicine
for my father-in-law.

668
00:31:25,444 --> 00:31:27,640
I asked Shen Qing to go ahead
and grab us a spot in line,

669
00:31:27,644 --> 00:31:28,377
but he refused.

670
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,800
So there I was,
huffing and puffing alone in the queue.

671
00:31:31,844 --> 00:31:33,610
My father-in-law just had
his heart broken.

672
00:31:33,622 --> 00:31:35,311
I'm the only woman
in the whole household.

673
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,590
Lina,

674
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,190
Zhou Jing and I already made a deal.

675
00:31:38,266 --> 00:31:39,270
At our girls' gatherings,

676
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,480
no talk about husbands, sons,

677
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,400
or fathers-in-law.

678
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,280
So basically, we don't talk about men?

679
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,790
No male relatives.

680
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,750
Other men are fine.

681
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:48,200
Secretary Zhou summed it up well.

682
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,190
Then, I have nothing to talk about.

683
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,910
What about the waiter?

684
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,560
How about that guy having coffee?

685
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,390
What about those people outside?

686
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,710
Aren't those all men?

687
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,390
What's your point?

688
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,960
Are you trying to take me
down a dark path?

689
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,680
Zhou Jing, you have
a husband and kid too.

690
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,720
When did you turn wicked?

691
00:32:13,155 --> 00:32:14,733
Look, I think we shouldn't be talking

692
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,160
- about petty stuff.
- Exactly.

693
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,550
- We should talk about the dreams.
- Agreed.

694
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,070
Then, I have nothing to contribute.

695
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,070
You two carry on.

696
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,266
I'll go get some work done.

697
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,960
My son's teacher is calling.

698
00:32:27,711 --> 00:32:29,750
Wait, if the teacher's a man,
can we talk about him?

699
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,880
- Yes.
- Totally allowed.

700
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,320
So the male teacher said

701
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,150
our son's grades were in trouble.

702
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,360
Alright then.

703
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,360
Hello?

704
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,400
Commander Zhang?

705
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,000
Sure, where should I meet you?

706
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,110
Okay, I'll call you when I get there.

707
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,960
Next time, let's bulk order some rice.

708
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,680
Make it organic.

709
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,240
Okay.

710
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,720
What?

711
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,680
It's nothing.

712
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,110
I know a group-buy leader.

713
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,790
He has serious connections.

714
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,150
Aksu apples,

715
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,200
Zhoushan cutlassfish,

716
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,480
he can get it all.

717
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,000
And the quality is top-notch.

718
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,110
Do you want his WeChat?

719
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,150
No thanks.

720
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,400
He's a man.

721
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,360
Mr. Shen!

722
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,480
Mr. Shen!

723
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,320
Your mail.

724
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,240
Hello, Sun.

725
00:33:29,266 --> 00:33:30,520
Look at that. Kun Opera stamps!

726
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,900
(Ninghai Road, Nanjing)

727
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:33,990
"Washing Brook Song".

728
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:35,440
Mail delivered. I'll get back to work.

729
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,670
Thank you so much.

730
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,000
To: Shen Zhuoran.

731
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:01,140
(Forty Years on Stage)

732
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,550
Ms. Nie.

733
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,070
I received the book

734
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,470
you sent me.

735
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,070
Thank you.

736
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,590
Everything moves too fast these days.

737
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,400
It's really been ages

738
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,710
since I last got a letter.

739
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,400
It feels like that old poem.

740
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,000
"Only the water by the door remains,
untouched by spring winds."

741
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,310
I was afraid you couldn't wait.

742
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,480
Some feelings

743
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,110
can only be understood

744
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,710
once you've lived long enough.

745
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,680
So true.

746
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,070
Absolutely.

747
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,960
When I was 18,
I went to the countryside.

748
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,230
I went to Inner Mongolia.

749
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,150
Back then,

750
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,460
I worked on the waterworks team.

751
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,790
After we went back to the dorm

752
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,310
after work,

753
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,920
the wind would slam
the doors and windows

754
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,000
with this loud banging.

755
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,630
It went on all night long.

756
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,080
I couldn't sleep at all.

757
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,030
I was homesick.

758
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,000
There was a girl in the dorm next door.

759
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,240
She played the flute.

760
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,400
Guess what she played?

761
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,520
A Stroll in the Garden.

762
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,710
On those stormy nights,

763
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,880
when I missed home,

764
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,920
that flute's melodies

765
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,840
brought so much comfort
to us Jiangsu kids.

766
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,310
It was like a salve for the soul.

767
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,400
That's when I first

768
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,720
fell in love

769
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,560
with Kun Opera.

770
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,400
I've been listening for decades.

771
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:12,000
The more I listen,
the more I taste its depth.

772
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,750
I've had a similar experience.

773
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:19,440
I used to work at
an observatory in Qinghai.

774
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,670
A few of us from the same province

775
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,000
would sing "A Stroll in the Garden"

776
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,960
under the stars.

777
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,920
In the vastness of the universe,

778
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,110
homesickness

779
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,110
hits even harder.

780
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,750
We really are kindred spirits.

781
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,470
Ms. Nie,

782
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,080
I've got quite a few
special stamps in my collection.

783
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,750
I'd love to send you some.

784
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,480
Can I send them to 237 Yihe Road?

785
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,630
Will that reach you?

786
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,360
Yes, it will.

787
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,680
Perfect.

788
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,430
Just like that old line,

789
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,880
"A bluebird comes west
and flies east again."

790
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,920
Let me send a letter with it

791
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,080
to thank you.

792
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,070
Oh, by the way,

793
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,360
I forgot to ask.

794
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,710
Do you prefer kaffir lilies,

795
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,440
or moth orchids?

796
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,200
Plum, orchid, bamboo, or chrysanthemum,

797
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:20,790
I like them all.

798
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:22,430
Great.

799
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,150
Then I'll send you this special stamp...

800
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,480
I shan't tell you.

801
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,680
Ms. Nie,

802
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,560
I can't spoil the surprise.

803
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,480
I want you to feel it

804
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,040
the moment you open it.

805
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,800
You'll know right away.

806
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,920
It's actually

807
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:43,480
a special-shaped perforated stamp.

808
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,800
Dad.

809
00:37:44,866 --> 00:37:47,088
- You know what?
- I was yelling downstairs for you...

810
00:37:47,088 --> 00:37:49,350
- The earliest stamp perforations...
- Are you on the phone?

811
00:37:49,355 --> 00:37:50,688
were actually poked one by one

812
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,360
with a sewing needle.

813
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,310
I bought some apples.

814
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,520
Let me know when it arrives.

815
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,240
Alright.

816
00:38:04,911 --> 00:38:06,080
I'll wait for your call then.

817
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,800
Goodbye.

818
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:29,780
(What a beautiful day,
what a lovely scene...)

819
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:39,580
(Whose courtyard...)

820
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:06,380
(What a beautiful day,
what a lovely scene. Whose courtyard...)

821
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,190
Ms. Nie, it's me.

822
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:26,310
Sorry to call so late.

823
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,150
I just couldn't help myself.

824
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,360
I had to tell you.

825
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,840
The stamp I sent you
is "Magpie on Plum Blossom."

826
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,400
Magpies mean joy, of course.

827
00:40:36,666 --> 00:40:38,044
And plum blossoms stand for grace.

828
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,790
I just know you'll like it.

829
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,560
These are nature's little joys.

830
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,110
Zhuoran,

831
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,670
do you grow flowers?

832
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,800
I do.

833
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,911
My balcony is full of them.

834
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,400
But my favorite is
a pot of moth orchids.

835
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,960
Orchids have such elegance.

836
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,440
And moth orchids

837
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,110
bring so much life into a space.

838
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,320
It's just...

839
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,960
Ever since my wife passed,

840
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,520
that orchid has never bloomed again.

841
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,360
I have a pot of moth orchids too.

842
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,000
They're blooming with spirit.

843
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,000
Just follow what I tell you,

844
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,400
and I promise

845
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,220
it'll be full of blossoms.

846
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,200
Really?

847
00:41:16,490 --> 00:41:18,040
You have to teach me.

848
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,800
Of course.

849
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,480
Hang on, I'll grab a pen and notebook.

850
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,740
(Postal mailbox)

851
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:03,220

00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,140
