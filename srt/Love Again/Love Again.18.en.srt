2
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,140
=Episode 18=

3
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,550
You're still awake?

4
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,490
I thought you had forgotten
the way home.

5
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,840
I got you some congee.

6
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,410
It's good for your stomach.

7
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,790
Come and have some.

8
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,630
Have some pickled vegetables.

9
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,350
Your dad's getting old.

10
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,950
It's normal for him

11
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,110
to overlook things.

12
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,670
Let's not fight over this, okay?

13
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,910
We should stick together

14
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,630
and talk to him as a team.

15
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,830
Did you see his attitude today?

16
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,750
How are we supposed to reason with him?

17
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,440
Then

18
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,440
we'll do it your way.

19
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,160
Your dad visits Ms. Nie

20
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,000
at the nursing home every day.

21
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,100
You drop him off and I'll pick him up.

22
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,990
You're okay with that?

23
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,870
There's a Jacky Cheung concert
on Friday.

24
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,580
If you're willing to go with me,
I'll do it.

25
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,040
Friday?

26
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,630
I've got an industry conference.

27
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,470
It's going to be all day.

28
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,620
- Even in the evening?
- Yes, even in the evening.

29
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,910
We had a deal.

30
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,300
So, no backing out.

31
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,760
I'm not backing out. Didn't we agree

32
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,320
to make a plan and take it slow?

33
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,600
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?

34
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,830
Just look at Ms. Nie.

35
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,350
There's no time to waste.

36
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,950
Lina, I really don't have time.

37
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,830
You've got time to run

38
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,880
and time to drink.

39
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,070
But no time for your wife?

40
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,760
Where does all your time go?

41
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,880
Ms. Nie has a terminal illness,

42
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,210
and your dad still sticks by her.

43
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,440
I'm still in my prime.

44
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,880
But you won't even look at me
when you come home.

45
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,280
It's not like I'm slacking off.
I'm just busy.

46
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,160
Look.

47
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,440
look at all these meeting alerts.

48
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,680
See? Just look.

49
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,750
- Look.
- I don't want to look at it.

50
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,240
I'll do it.

51
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,020
- Let me do it.
- Be careful. It's hot.

52
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,590
I didn't mean it.

53
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:38,320
Can

54
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,050
you still switch it on?

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,810
Give me your phone.

56
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,270
What's Jin's phone number?

57
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,470
I have Jin's number.

58
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,440
You have it?

59
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:29,880
Jin,

60
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,760
- Yes, Mr. Shen.
- Tell Dong Gong

61
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,470
to call this number right away.

62
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,320
It's urgent.

63
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,270
Okay, I'll let him know.

64
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:46,590
Try again.

65
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,030
Dong Gong?

66
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,240
I need to ask you a tech question.

67
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:55,930
What is it?

68
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,560
I dropped my phone in the congee.
Can the data still be recovered?

69
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,860
Isn't there a cloud backup?

70
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,240
Normally, there's a backup in the cloud.

71
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,810
You see, we're reviewing a contract with the client,

72
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,360
and we signed an NDA.

73
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,630
All the related data can't be uploaded

74
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,200
to the cloud.

75
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,280
I usually back it up
to my computer every day.

76
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,519
But I've been swamped
and skipped the last couple of days.

77
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,400
And we collected a lot of data
during that time.

78
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,390
Then it's hard to say.

79
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,910
We'll have to check tomorrow morning.

80
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,150
Can you come in early tomorrow?

81
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,500
Okay, I'll be there early.

82
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,880
So, can it be recovered?

83
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,810
I don't know!

84
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,320
So, can the message

85
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,720
I sent you earlier still be found?

86
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,950
That's what you care about right now?

87
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,710
What's your problem?

88
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,559
You come home
and drop your phone in the congee.

89
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,950
Are you hiding something from me

90
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,680
on your phone?

91
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,730
Did you do it on purpose?

92
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,760
Yes! I did it on purpose!

93
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,360
I have secrets on my phone!

94
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,030
My phone is full of secrets!

95
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,830
I wanted to destroy the evidence, okay?

96
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,270
If you leave, don't ever come back!

97
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,000
Mr. Shen?

98
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:51,830
Mr. Shen.

99
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,760
Why are you here?

100
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,810
Why didn't you go home?

101
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,000
I came

102
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,560
to find a report.

103
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,760
And what are you doing here?

104
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,680
After you and Ice left,

105
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,879
we just sat around in silence.

106
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,510
It was sort of pointless
so everyone left.

107
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,100
I came back to grab something.

108
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,440
Okay.

109
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,630
Go ahead.

110
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:19,470
(Male: Shen Qing. Female: Liu Lina.
Together forever.)

111
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:47,840
(Ms. Nie's medication schedule. Monday.
Valsartan. Morning. Noon. Evening. Felodipine. Evening)

112
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,710
Ms. Nie, do you know

113
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,350
Professor Shen

114
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,590
got into a fight with his kids

115
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,830
just to find you a good nursing home.

116
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,560
We're both women.

117
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,110
I've lived over half my life.

118
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,280
But no one ever cared
about me like that.

119
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,830
Ms. Nie,

120
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,830
you're really lucky.

121
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,870
Dong Gong, so?

122
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,590
Can you fix it?

123
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:12,870
It's hard to tell.

124
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,280
I can only try.

125
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,520
I don't care about the phone.

126
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,520
I only care if the data
can be recovered.

127
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,210
How about this?

128
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,280
I'll take a look at it
after I take it apart.

129
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,919
I'll get you a backup phone.

130
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,520
Okay.

131
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,439
I'm counting on you.

132
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,040
Wait here.

133
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:39,750
Ms. Nie.

134
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:40,640
Yulan.

135
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,870
I am here to see you.

136
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,309
Thank goodness you're here.

137
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,940
Please try to talk some sense
into Ms. Nie.

138
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,070
She insists on going downstairs
to the garden.

139
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,230
With her health condition, is it safe?

140
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,680
You want to go to the garden?

141
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,590
I made a promise to Professor Shen.

142
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,300
How about this?

143
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,710
I'll take Ms. Nie to the garden.

144
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:10,870
Okay.

145
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:11,950
Let's go.

146
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,230
Ms. Nie,

147
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,540
do you want to put on a little lipstick?

148
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,110
It'll brighten up your complexion.

149
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,280
Okay.

150
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,160
Here.

151
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,600
I'll help you put it on.

152
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,800
I've got one right here.

153
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,830
If anything happens, it's on you.

154
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,800
Of course.

155
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,870
Take a look. Is it pretty?

156
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,440
Beautiful.

157
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,520
You look pretty.

158
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,470
It smells so nice.

159
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,260
It sure does.

160
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:06,870
Easy now.

161
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,830
Gently.

162
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,300
It smells lovely.

163
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,350
Yulan,

164
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,590
I don't know how to thank you.

165
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,640
Oh, don't be silly.

166
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,750
This pen

167
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,680
is my favorite.

168
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,440
I'll give it to you
as a little keepsake.

169
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,470
It's so beautiful.

170
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
Thank you so much.

171
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,840
I'll accept it then.

172
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,230
Then I'll use this pen to learn from you

173
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,680
and practice my writing.

174
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,750
You're too kind.

175
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,870
Professor Shen is here.

176
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,040
Ms. Nie.

177
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,470
you look much better.

178
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,040
Really?

179
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:02,800
Of course.

180
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:03,950
Please, have a seat.

181
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,070
You too.

182
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,070
What did I tell you?

183
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,450
With how advanced medicine is

184
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,040
these days,

185
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,560
we'll definitely beat this illness.

186
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:15,740
Oh right,

187
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,870
look at this.

188
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,680
I recorded

189
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,870
our rehearsal.

190
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,040
Watch it.

191
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,440
♪What a beautiful jasmine flower♪

192
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:36,800
♪No flower in the whole garden
smells as sweet♪

193
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,040
Everyone sings very well.

194
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,200
Not bad, right?

195
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,470
♪I want to pick one and wear it♪

196
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,350
I was thinking

197
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,590
we could swap out that Kunqu lyric

198
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,320
for a better line.

199
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,230
Let me think.

200
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,160
No rush so take your time.

201
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,280
You missed the last rehearsal.

202
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:16,710
But it's okay.

203
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,440
We'll go together

204
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,410
for the real performance.

205
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,710
Gou will definitely

206
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,200
thank our literary advisor,

207
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,280
Ms. Nie Juanjuan,

208
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,800
during the opening speech.

209
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,200
Speaking of Gou,

210
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,940
here is Gou's wedding confection.

211
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,780
A bit of good luck.

212
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,470
Gou is married?

213
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,070
Yes.

214
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,920
He had a wedding reception.

215
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,680
It was lovely.

216
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,350
At the ceremony,

217
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,790
he got really emotional and said,

218
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,690
"Tianzhen and I met halfway

219
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,680
through life,

220
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:54,950
and now we'll walk

221
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:56,750
the second half

222
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,280
together."

223
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,470
That line

224
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:09,640
really moved me.

225
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:14,590
Ms. Nie,

226
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,380
I want to say the same to you.

227
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,350
Let's walk

228
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,480
the second half of life together.

229
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,200
Ah,

230
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,700
there's one more thing

231
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:47,920
to tell you.

232
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,400
My life plan.

233
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:51,920
This

234
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:53,520
and this too.

235
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,870
My daughter found

236
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,870
many rehabilitation nursing homes

237
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,230
for me online

238
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,950
and through various channels.

239
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,470
I've checked out several in person.

240
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,440
You wouldn't believe
how nice the places were.

241
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,880
I am really impressed.

242
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,220
So I was thinking,

243
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,790
once you're discharged,

244
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,310
we could move there together.

245
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,200
If you think

246
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,650
these two are too far

247
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,920
from home.

248
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,310
There are others.

249
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,400
Here,

250
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,880
these are good too.

251
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,310
And these.

252
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,380
Take a look at these.

253
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,260
Look at this one.

254
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,549
It was you who suggested to Dad

255
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,220
about moving into a nursing home,
wasn't it?

256
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,880
Can you stop causing trouble back here
while you're overseas?

257
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,470
I'm not causing trouble.

258
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,680
I may live abroad.

259
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:19,550
But

260
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,790
I am still a Chinese.

261
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:23,510
Besides,

262
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,080
you should try to understand Dad.

263
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,200
Mr. Shen.

264
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,839
Whatever, I'm busy now.

265
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,700
I have to hang up now.

266
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,269
How did it go?

267
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,370
I managed to fix the phone.

268
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,030
But

269
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,470
the data can't be recovered.

270
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,700
Remember to back up
your data regularly from now on.

271
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,360
Okay, I will.

272
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,440
So

273
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,920
after I swap out the SIM card,

274
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,680
I'll have Jin return your phone.

275
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:46,270
Okay.

276
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,310
Come in.

277
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:00,880
Ice.

278
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:02,510
You're here.

279
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,270
I'm sorry.

280
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,200
It's okay.

281
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,180
We'll redo everything quickly
so we can still pass tomorrow's review.

282
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,270
Have a seat.
I'll send you the contract file.

283
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,950
We'll each fill in our part.

284
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,810
Thank you for helping out.

285
00:19:18,177 --> 00:19:19,710
(ICE Investment Terms List)

286
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:21,880
I got it.

287
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,550
What's the matter, Mr. Shen?

288
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,120
It's just my back acting up again.

289
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,230
Old problem.

290
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,880
How about taking a break?

291
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,790
No need.

292
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,940
I just need to move a little.

293
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,080
Just loosen up a bit.

294
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,260
Come on.

295
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,080
Try a plank.

296
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,750
A plank helps with back pain?

297
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,880
Yeah, it works.

298
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,480
It can help stabilize
the core of the spine.

299
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,680
It's to grow the muscles
in the waist, right?

300
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,230
Exactly.

301
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:35,269
Why don't you head back?
I'll finish filling out the rest of the data.

302
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,440
How could I let you do that?

303
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,030
It was my mistake.

304
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,790
Technically,

305
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,920
your mistake is my responsibility too.

306
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,600
We're a team.

307
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:47,080
You pulled me back to the right pitch
when I sang off-key.

308
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,660
You even helped prompt me
when I forgot the lyrics.

309
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,030
We clicked.

310
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,090
When you sang "Solace" that day,

311
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,080
it really moved me.

312
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,200
You said it was a song

313
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,600
for your mom?

314
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,900
Plank is too hard.

315
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,360
You sure can hold a plank.

316
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,680

I really

385
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,020
do feel much better.

386
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,810
Let me take this call.

387
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,960
(Lina)

388
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:07,680
Yes?

389
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,230
What are you doing?

390
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:10,610
Working late.

391
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,920
Until what time?

392
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,360
Pretty late.

393
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,920
Seriously?

394
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,160
You're not a young man anymore.

395
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,640
Working like this will kill you.

396
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:24,880
Just go to sleep.

397
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,440
Don't wait up.

398
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,280
I need to get back to work.

399
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,990
He hung up pretty quick.

400
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,360
We're finally done.

401
00:26:00,865 --> 00:26:02,550
(Seed Capital)
Ice, thanks

402
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,310
for staying up with me all night.

403
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:05,030
No big deal.

404
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,710
Are you hungry?

405
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,840
How about some bun?

406
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,120
There's a breakfast spot nearby.

407
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,680
Their beef potstickers are amazing.

408
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,740
Do you want to try it?

409
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:27,950
Sure.

410
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:28,780
Let's go.

411
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,500
This is the place.

412
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,310
Mister,

413
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,750
we'll have two bowls of wontons

414
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,180
and four liang of beef potstickers.

415
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,640
Two wonton bowls,
four liang of potstickers!

416
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:46,469
Coming right up!

417
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,950
They've got a cat here too.

418
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,600
So chubby.

419
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,500
You came at the perfect time.

420
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,230
These just came out of the pan.

421
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,000
Still hot.

422
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,989
- Thanks.
- All right.

423
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,970
Please enjoy your meal.

424
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:04,940
It's really good.

425
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,840
It's a branch of a famous old shop.

426
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,270
But the flavor
is just like the original store.

427
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,260
When I was little,

428
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,790
my mom used to take my sister and me
to the original store.

429
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,230
They had a big tabby cat there too.

430
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:20,790
Back then,

431
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,840
my mom had just given birth
to my sister.

432
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:24,309
And I was always pestering her

433
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,510
about where babies come from.

434
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,710
So she told me

435
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,230
kissing makes

436
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,360
people pregnant.

437
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,270
One day, I was teasing the cat

438
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:34,950
and

439
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,880
it suddenly licked my lips.

440
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,740
Not long after,

441
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,790
it had five kittens.

442
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,300
It scared the life out of me.

443
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,240
What happened after that?

444
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,840
I brought them food every day.

445
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:47,640
I thought

446
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:48,990
as long as I had food,

447
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,750
I'd never let them go hungry.

448
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,160
You were a pretty responsible daddy cat.

449
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,710
The shop owner gave
all the kittens away.

450
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:02,640
I bawled my eyes out.

451
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,650
I still remember
how much I cried that day.

452
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,470
It may be funny.

453
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,680
But

454
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,840
that sadness was so real.

455
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,230
Comedy really is rooted in tragedy.

456
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,950
I know a lab founder

457
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,400
who loves cats too.

458
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,920
His WeChat profile pic

459
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,160
is a big old Garfield. It's super cute.

460
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,150
Here, I'll show you.

461
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,510
You mean Aiden from Maoli, right?

462
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,300
He has a huge Garfield in his office.

463
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:27,700
Yeah, that's him.

464
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,680
You know him too?

465
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,600
An Ruifeng was planning
to acquire their lab.

466
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,550
We were all set for due diligence.

467
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,600
But the price was a bit steep

468
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,510
and we were also raising funds
ourselves.

469
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,710
So we shelved it.

470
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,510
I always think

471
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,790
your company spends a lot
on research each year.

472
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,310
If you could acquire

473
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,510
a lab of your own,

474
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,790
that money

475
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,440
wouldn't just be spending,
it'd be an investment.

476
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:57,550
Plus,

477
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,270
you'd have full control
over data quality.

478
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,750
It's a win-win.

479
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,200
That's exactly what we thought.

480
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,920
But the biggest issue

481
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,230
was funding.

482
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,290
Well, that's perfect timing.

483
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,030
This year,

484
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,600
we've been closely watching
the biopharma sector.

485
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,790
Mr. Lu has been looking
to invest in labs

486
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,320
to integrate the whole supply chain.

487
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,400
If Maoli is really worth it,

488
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,640
our firm could fund the acquisition.

489
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,420
Then you'd get to use the lab too.

490
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,030
As co-investors,

491
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,710
it'd be way easier to collaborate.

492
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,440
That's great.

493
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,230
It's the perfect solution.

494
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,910
It is, isn't it?

495
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,269
So when should we go

496
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,230
to Yangzhou

497
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,120
for an inspection?

498
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,120
Sure.

00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,160
So we're going.

502
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,270
Yes, we're going.

00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,330
Let's go with this place.

504
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,770
I think it's a good choice.

00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,880
(Zhuoran,
I hope this letter finds you well.)

560
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,120
(There's so much I want to say.)

561
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,680
(But the moment I pick up the pen,)

562
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,710
(I shrink back.)

563
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,710
(Things have come to this point,)

564
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,400
(what more is there to say?)

565
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,220
(Things have come to this point,)

566
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,120
(would you still want to hear it?)

567
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:38,790
(I once wanted to visit the place
where you grew up.)

568
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,920
(To see if the stars there shine)

569
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:45,160
(as brightly as your eyes.)

570
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:50,360
(I once wanted to go
to the school you studied at.)

571
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,230
(To see if the tall trees there stand)

572
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,550
(as straight as your character.)

573
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,360
(Could I go?)

574
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,360
(I couldn't.)

575
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,950
(I wanted to say,)

576
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,990
(I wish to spend
the rest of my life with you,)

577
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:13,520
(without fearing death.)

578
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,390
(But)

579
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,520
(I'm selfish.)

580
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:24,310
(I only wanted to share with you)

581
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:28,080
(the joys and the triumphs.)

582
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,830
(As for illness and aging,)

583
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:35,600
(I chose to endure them alone.)

584
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,910
(I don't want you)

585
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:43,310
(to see me wasting away.)

586
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,870
(I want you to remember me)

587
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:50,230
(looking all healthy.)

588
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,120
(Forgive me)

589
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,000
(for leaving without a word.)

590
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:02,560
(I have gone abroad with my son.)

591
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,730
(So this letter will have
to stand in for a final toast.)

592
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:11,390
(From now on,)

593
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,830
(we part ways.)

594
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,600
(Just one thing,)

595
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,040
(please believe me.)

596
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,960
(My fragile old age)

597
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:28,200
(found its poetry)

598
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,270
(because of the days I spent with you.)

599
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,220
(By the way,)

600
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,230
(I finally thought of the line.)

601
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,910
(How would one know
the beauty of spring)

602
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,430
(without visiting the garden?)

603
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,590
(How would one know the worth of life)

604
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,870
(Without coming into this world?)

605
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,310
(What do you think?)

606
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:53,310
How would one know the worth of life

607
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:58,120
without coming into this world?

608
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,790
(Wishing you peace.)

609
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,220
(Don't miss me.)

610
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,310
(Don't reply.)

611
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,480
Ms. Nie went abroad?

612
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,530
You're making it up, right?

613
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,850
Hard to tell what's real
and what's not anymore.

614
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,680
She's a fairy, after all.

615
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,080
She just flew away like that.

(Centennial Cultural and Artistic Performance
Wind and Rainbow Choir)

617
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:38,880
(Congratulations on the 100th Anniversary of Normal University)

618
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,560
Please welcome
the Wind and Rainbow Choir

619
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,270
with a performance of "Jasmine."

620
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,960
On behalf of the choir,

621
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,680
a special thanks
to our literary advisor,

622
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,000

626
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,430
You sang that word wrong.

627
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,850
It's not authentic.

628
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,230
That's the wrong pronunciation.

629
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,310
You should've pronounced it this way.

630
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,790
The universe is so vast.

631
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,560
Earth is just a tiny speck.

632
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:01,040
But every time I look up at the stars,

633
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,390
I feel completely free.

634
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,580
How does that sound?

635
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:11,620
It sounds lovely.

Cross it!

642
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,310
Shoot! Shoot!

643
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,000
Shoot!

644
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:44,710
Nice shot!

646
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,600
You should've crossed earlier.

My mom says we're changing our flight.

648
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,780
We're leaving for London tonight.

649
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,330
Can you guys see me off?

650
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:02,640
Yes.

651
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,710
Of course, we can.

652
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,279
Definitely.

653
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,319
- For sure.
- No question.

654
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,359
We'll definitely send you.

655
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,180
Of course, we will.

656
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:10,350
We'll see you off.

657
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,200
I love you guys.

658
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,270
We will miss you.

659
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,180
I will miss you too.

660
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:13,830
I'll miss you.

661
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,080
When are you coming back?

662
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,560
Su Shan, I'll miss you.

663
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,910
I'll miss you too.

664
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,430
Don't skip your meals.

665
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,480
Remember not to miss your meals too.

666
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:23,520
You must take care.

667
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,910
You too.

668
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,390
Take care over there, okay? Be happy.

669
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,110
I will come and visit you.

670
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,750
Why are you still not in bed?

671
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,040
Just getting some water.

672
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,680
Hurry up.

673
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,310
Okay.

674
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,390
We're ready. Take action now.

675
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:06,230
Hello?

676
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,960
Hello, I'm your neighbor
from the opposite.

677
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,160
I think you left your headlights on.

678
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:13,000
My lights are on?

679
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,520
Thanks.

680
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,389
Good neighbors are better
than distant relatives.

681
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,670
I'll go turn them off right now.

682
00:41:44,350 --> 00:41:45,740
I guess sure she saw the wrong car.

683
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,829
You guys better not forget me.
I'll be back during summer vacation.

684
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:56,910
Don't forget us.

685
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:57,260
I won't.

686
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,700
- Send photos.
- We'll video call.

687
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,860
You guys better not forget me either.

688
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,640
Su Shan.

689
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:05,710
Su Shan.

690
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,180
He's here.

691
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:07,750
Sorry, I'm late.

692
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,730
All of us came to send you off.

693
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,790
So we'll pick you up when you come back.

694
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,310
You said so. Let's pinky swear.

695
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,910
Pinky swear that lasts forever.

696
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,910
You can only break it when I'm dead.

697
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,840
Don't spout nonsense!

698
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,400
Don't say anything inauspicious.

699
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,090
How about a group photo?

700
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:34,330
Okay.

701
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:35,679
Dad, can you take a photo for us?

702
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:35,910
Okay.

703
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:36,599
All right.

704
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,690
Use my phone or yours?

705
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:38,890
- Use mine.
- Stand right here.

706
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,720
Launch your camera.

707
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,160
Oh, okay.

708
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,600
Wait.

709
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,560
Let your mom hold your bag.

710
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,300
Give your bag to your mom.

711
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:50,640
Thank you, Mommy.

712
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:54,260
Okay, ready?

713
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,870
Come on, stand closer.

714
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:58,560
Okay, ready?

715
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,680
One, two, three. Say cheese!

716
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,910
