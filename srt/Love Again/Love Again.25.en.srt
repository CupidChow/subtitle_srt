=Episode 25=

3
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,190
Thanks for looking out for our company.

4
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,400
It is my duty.

5
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,600
Qing.

6
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,790
I should give you a heads-up.

7
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:48,840
Right now,

8
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,560
the company questions
RF Pharmaceuticals'

9
00:01:51,022 --> 00:01:51,790
Series B+ funding.

10
00:01:52,911 --> 00:01:54,750
You should work on
solving the issue soon

11
00:01:55,044 --> 00:01:56,190
and get the product ready.

12
00:01:58,644 --> 00:01:59,880
Then, I'll need you to put in

13
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,790
a good word for us with the investors.

14
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:02,910
I will.

15
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,160
Your united determination is inspiring.

16
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,400
I'm looking for solutions

17
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,040
to cut costs

18
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,560
and boost efficiency.

19
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,350
You can use the lab in Yangzhou.

20
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,560
We also have labs in Suzhou, Hangzhou,

21
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,000
and California as backup options.

22
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:25,600
That's great.

23
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,350
Thanks.

24
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Actually, my grandpa

25
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,470
passed away from lung cancer.

26
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,000
So,

27
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,000
both personally and professionally,

28
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,670
I really hope M701 and M703

29
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,670
can be developed successfully

30
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,280
as soon as possible.

31
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,350
You seem a little anxious lately.

32
00:02:54,555 --> 00:02:56,080
Is your back still okay for running?

33
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,350
I run around Xuanwu Lake

34
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,430
every night these days.

35
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:00,600
It takes the edge off.

36
00:03:01,044 --> 00:03:02,200
You should try it too.

37
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,520
Sure.

38
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,720
I might bump into you sometimes.

39
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:06,990
Deal.

40
00:03:07,222 --> 00:03:08,155
I'm heading out.

41
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,470
See you.

42
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,430
What's wrong?

43
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,230
You...

44
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,720
Thank you.

45
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,640
That is heavy. Let me help you.

46
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,110
Careful!

47
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:58,160
Got it.

48
00:03:58,244 --> 00:03:59,090
This is really heavy.

49
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:03,640
Slow down.

50
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,670
Open that thing.

51
00:04:09,711 --> 00:04:10,470
What do you need?

52
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,720
No, this won't work.

53
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,310
What is it?

54
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,720
The glass is too thick.

55
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,280
Thicker is better.

56
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,400
Better soundproofing.

57
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,430
This is tempered glass.

58
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,550
Safer too.

59
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,600
Safety is good. Safety matters.

60
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:23,760
No,

61
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,200
the glass has to be uniform.

62
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,760
It needs to match all the others.

63
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,670
Otherwise,

64
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,350
uneven heating might make it explode.

65
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,870
That a real thing?

66
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,310
Not my field of expertise.

67
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,200
But I know about it.

68
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,910
We have a special glass workshop
at our factory.

69
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,670
When it comes to glass,

70
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,670
don't take it lightly.

71
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,280
Alright.

72
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,550
I'll figure it out.
I'll get a new piece.

73
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:52,400
Liu.

74
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,470
Come.

75
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:53,720
Okay.

76
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,040
Let's just do this.

77
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,200
You know what? Just leave it alone.

78
00:04:57,866 --> 00:04:59,200
We'll get someone to fix it.

79
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
No need.

80
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:06,790
Bai.

81
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,200
I did the math.

82
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,640
If I take this training school's order
for uniforms,

83
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,720
I'll earn

84
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:12,777
thirty grand.

85
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,870
However,

86
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,230
I have to cover 200 grand first.

87
00:05:17,755 --> 00:05:19,670
That business loan
would be perfect for this.

88
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:21,088
I'll file an urgent request.

89
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,040
Urgent? Even rushing it now
won't be fast enough.

90
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,040
I called Director Yu
a million times yesterday.

91
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,470
I practically talked my lips off.

92
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,350
But, he insists

93
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,280
I pay him 80% upfront

94
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,400
before he'll rush the production for me.

95
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,720
And I can't afford
to let this order slip away.

96
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:41,550
Ms. Liu.

97
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,200
How about I try borrowing some for you?

98
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:45,760
Borrow?

99
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,550
No way.

100
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,840
The interest is too high.

101
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,160
I'll end up with no profit.

102
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,400
True.

103
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,760
I'll figure it out.

104
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:54,955
There are always
more solutions than problems.

105
00:05:57,866 --> 00:05:58,666
The contract.

106
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:10,670
Qing?

107
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,520
Miss Lv.

108
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:15,670
Why aren't you going home?

109
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,400
I was just feeling a little tired,

110
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,133
so I sat here to listen to some music.

111
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,960
Head home early after work.

112
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,430
I know you're busy,

113
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,960
but everything has a limit.

114
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,230
When men and women
don't go home after work,

115
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,200
working late turns into

116
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,430
a breeding ground for affairs.

117
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,870
Eventually, trouble follows.

118
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,870
Qing,

119
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,160
heed my advice.

120
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,640
I understand, Miss Lv.

121
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,444
You should head home.

122
00:06:48,244 --> 00:06:48,760
Alright.

123
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,480
Welcome home.

124
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,240
Why are you back so late?

125
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,360
I went with An Ruifeng
to meet some investors.

126
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,040
How did it go?

127
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:27,830
Not great.

128
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,160
We're not going to lose all the money
our family invested, right?

129
00:07:33,777 --> 00:07:35,933
Did you talk to An Ruifeng
about the investment?

130
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,910
I did. He seemed really touched.

131
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,240
Anyway,

132
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:43,155
the financial plan hasn't matured yet.

133
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,310
We can still back out, right?

134
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,360
Or maybe invest a bit less.

135
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,120
Why are you going back on your word?

136
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,710
How do you expect me to face people?

137
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,640
How am I the problem here?

138
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,360
Aren't you the one always overreacting?

139
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,830
I never said I wouldn't invest.

140
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,280
I was just asking, is that not allowed?

141
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,910
It's 800 grand, not just 80 yuan.

142
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:01,550
Our family's putting in so much,

143
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,190
and we can't even get a smile from you.

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,400
Alright.

145
00:08:06,155 --> 00:08:07,000
We gave our word.

146
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,160
We'll keep it.

147
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:09,360
You...

148
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,280
Come in.

149
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:30,910
Ms. Lv Yuan.

150
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,120
Just now,

151
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,670
I went out to buy milk.

152
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,160
I saw Shen Qing.

153
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,520
He just got off work.

154
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,760
He was zoning out downstairs
and didn't want to go home.

155
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,480
Mr. Shen,

156
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,710
I think

157
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,120
you should have a talk with your son.

158
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,520
Shen Qing knows where to draw the line.

159
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,280
As parents, we can't expect

160
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,670
to know or interfere in everything.

161
00:08:56,977 --> 00:08:57,910
At the end of the day,

162
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,790
kids have their own lives to live.

163
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,400
You know, Liu's really something.

164
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,830
With just a few moves,

165
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,310
and the sofa's fixed.

166
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,590
It's getting late.

167
00:09:16,888 --> 00:09:18,000
You should get some rest.

168
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,360
No.

169
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,950
No.

170
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
I'll take the sofa.

171
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,520
You stay in the room.

172
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,040
I insist.

173
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:24,640
That won't do.

174
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,040
If you sleep on the sofa,

175
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,670
what if you break it again?

176
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,160
You're still not fully healed.

177
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,280
I'm almost recovered.

178
00:09:31,288 --> 00:09:33,000
It's not right for you
to sleep out there.

179
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,280
I'm fine.

180
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,000
No.

181
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,040
Please listen to me.

182
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,040
No, you don't...

183
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,790
Listen to me.

184
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,910
Ms. Lv Yuan,

185
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,830
as you always say,

186
00:09:42,355 --> 00:09:43,830
we follow the organization's order.

187
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:56,710
Goodnight.

188
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,120
Hello?

189
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,880
Lina's dad?

190
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,520
This is Lv Yuan.

191
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,280
I just wanted to ask you

192
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,280
about the window glass.

193
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,790
Any updates?

194
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,710
Mr. Shen.

195
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:54,240
Mr. Wang.

196
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,280
The financing amount
is 800 grand, right?

197
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,120
Yes.

198
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:57,950
Didn't we

199
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,360
sign the financing

200
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,240
consent form?

201
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:01,360
Yes.

202
00:12:01,577 --> 00:12:03,000
Your wife transferred the money.

203
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,360
That's great.

204
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,910
But it's only 600 grand.

205
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,360
Are you sure?

206
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,400
Yes, I'm sure.

207
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,790
I needed some money
for a business deal.

208
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,000
So, I moved 200 grand over temporarily.

209
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:18,000
Just for a week.

210
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,240
They'll pay me back in a week.

211
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,044
It won't take long.

212
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,000
You could have told me first.

213
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,880
I just thought
I'd move it around a little.

214
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,000
I already gave the company my word.

215
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,670
Liu Lina, listen.

216
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,360
You can't rush into business deals.

217
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,670
There are scammers out there.

218
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,360
Do you even know
who you're dealing with?

219
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,710
Mr. Bai is not a scammer.

220
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,640
I've already checked out the school.

221
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,600
We signed the contract.

222
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,480
The payment goes
directly to the factory.

223
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,670
He doesn't even touch the money.

224
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,550
What is there to scam?

225
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,280
Shen Qing, I agreed
to give you 800 grand.

226
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,640
I only used 200 grand of it.

227
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,240
Why are you making such a fuss?

228
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,190
Me? Making a fuss?

229
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,160
Why would a financial advisor

230
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,240
grab brunch

231
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,480
with clients all the time?

232
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,950
So it's fine for you
to toast your client over coffee,

233
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,640
but I can't have brunch

234
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,520
with my advisor?

235
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,520
You're always working late
and socializing.

236
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,511
You don't come home
until you're passing out.

237
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,888
But look at that, it's light out.

238
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:07,880
You're home early for once,

239
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:08,888
and it's just for money.

240
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,000
Don't turn around.

241
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,550
Face me!

242
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,280
Fine, I'm facing you now.

243
00:13:19,311 --> 00:13:20,240
Don't underestimate me.

244
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,670
You'll have the money in a week.

245
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:24,910
Alright.

246
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,040
It's finally done.

247
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,520
Liu.

248
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,520
You really are clever and skillful.

249
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,520
There's nothing you can't fix.

250
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,910
Not to brag,

251
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,000
but give me a toolbox

252
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,670
and in no time,

253
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,830
I can fix anything for you.

254
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,190
You're amazing.

255
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,310
Thanks.

256
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,360
Ms. Lv.

257
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,830
You don't have to
sleep on the sofa anymore.

258
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,550
Did I say something wrong?

259
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,280
Did they pay you back

260
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,760
for the glass yet?

261
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,550
They did.

262
00:14:30,355 --> 00:14:31,120
Just a few hundred.

263
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:32,430
He kept asking me.

264
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,280
I even fixed their sofa for them.

265
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,070
What happened to the sofa?

266
00:14:38,866 --> 00:14:39,590
It collapsed.

267
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,950
The leg broke.

268
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,590
The sofa leg broke?

269
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,590
The sofa leg broke.

270
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:48,950
Yeah.

271
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,670
And the study room...

272
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
The window's broken.

273
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,240
Then, where is Ms. Lv staying?

274
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,240
Oh my god.

275
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,040
Don't tell me she's staying
with Mr. Shen.

276
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:07,790
No way.

277
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,280
Why not?

278
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,400
Under one roof,

279
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,360
feelings grow over time.

280
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,590
Right?

281
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,830
What's so funny?

282
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,240
First,

283
00:15:25,555 --> 00:15:26,280
it costs money.

284
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:27,790
Second,

285
00:15:27,911 --> 00:15:28,760
no money involved.

286
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,040
Third,

287
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,240
pays out of pocket.

288
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,040
Oh my god.

289
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,680
Mr. Shen's doing better
and better these days.

290
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,200
No way.

291
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,040
I must share this with Lina.

292
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,760
Don't be nosy.

293
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,040
Hey,

294
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,830
how is this being nosy?

295
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,960
If he finds a gold digger,

296
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,040
she'll want a share
of Lina's inheritance.

297
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,480
If it's someone with cancer,

298
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,355
and Lina must spend time
in the hospital.

299
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,240
But if she's healthy,

300
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,200
then Lina can enjoy her life.

301
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,550
So, how's that meddling?

302
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,440
Everything is connected!

303
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,280
I'm back.

304
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:19,870
How's it going?

305
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,440
Is your injury better now?

306
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,720
All good.

307
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,440
I went to the hospital

308
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,533
to get you some nourishing
herbal medicine.

309
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:30,390
Herbal medicine?

310
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:32,550
To boost qi and energy.

311
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,110
Didn't you say

312
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,680
exercise and dietary therapy
were the best?

313
00:16:36,755 --> 00:16:39,200
Have you been walking 10,000 steps
these past few days?

314
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,390
You've been sick.

315
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,720
I was taking care of you.

316
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,040
I'm fine now. You go.

317
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,390
I was...

318
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,200
You...

319
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,680
Stop nagging. Just go.

320
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,150
Okay, I'm going.

321
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,150
I'm going.

322
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,960
I still need a few more days
to get the 200 grand.

323
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,680
Tell Mr. An it will take

324
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,280
a week at most.

325
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,550
Just one week.

326
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:30,870
Dad.

327
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,040
What's up?

328
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,070
You...

329
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,870
Why are you not going home?

330
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,070
I'm tired. Just zoning out for a bit.

331
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,350
And you?

332
00:17:43,444 --> 00:17:44,533
What are you doing?

333
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:46,310
I...

334
00:17:49,088 --> 00:17:49,790
I'm tired too.

335
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,200
Let me zone out with you for a bit.

336
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,110
What got you so tired?

337
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,150
Ms. Lv Yuan

338
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,390
told me to walk 10,000 steps.

339
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,480
I haven't hit the target yet.

340
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,155
I still have to walk.

341
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:07,480
Come on.

342
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,350
You're seventy already.

343
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,800
You're not training for the Olympics.

344
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,830
Why walk every day
with a step count like that?

345
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,630
Yeah, you're right.

346
00:18:15,222 --> 00:18:16,280
But look at it this way.

347
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,680
I didn't use to like exercising.

348
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,280
Now, someone is

349
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,150
pushing me to stay active.

350
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,150
That's a good thing.

351
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,630
Think positive.

352
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,590
But it's tiring.

353
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,720
Dad.

354
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,480
Grandpa.

355
00:18:41,111 --> 00:18:42,377
What are you two doing?

356
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,040
We are...

357
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,040
Just zoning out, father and son.

358
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:48,790
Zoning out.

359
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,040
Let me join you.

360
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,590
This is the men's club.

361
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,000
Don't you need to do your homework?

362
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,150
No overtime today?

363
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:11,280
Grandpa.

364
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,644
Still walking 10,000 steps?

365
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:15,520
Well...

366
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,520
Alright, I'll go now.

367
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,110
10,000 steps, huh?

368
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,960
You can do it.

369
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:24,622
All the best.

370
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,110
Dad...

371
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,000
Go finish your homework.

372
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:32,790
Okay.

373
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,960
Guess I'll head back to work too.

374
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,590
Xinghuo.

375
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:57,590
Mr. Shen.

376
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,070
We just got back today.

377
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,280
I'll tidy up the house today,

378
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,520
and pick up my mom tomorrow.

379
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,920
Could you inform her for me?

380
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,110
Thank you so much
for everything these days.

381
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,000
What for?

382
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,520
We're all comrades.
We help each other

383
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,630
through tough times.

384
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,550
I'll tell her.

385
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:17,390
Mr. Shen.

386
00:20:18,266 --> 00:20:19,440
Still working on the task?

387
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:20,630
Sun.

388
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,760
I'm about 2,000 steps short.

389
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,070
Look.

390
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,190
(Shen Zhuoran. Steps Today: 8,150)

391
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,840
How about this?

392
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,680
I'm delivering files to Professor Ma.

393
00:20:28,955 --> 00:20:29,866
I'll walk the steps.

394
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,110
Does that work?

395
00:20:31,555 --> 00:20:32,550
Of course it does.

396
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,760
That's perfect.

397
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,280
Here.

398
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:34,680
Okay.

399
00:20:34,688 --> 00:20:35,870
Mr. Shen, sit and rest here.

400
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:36,870
- Leave it to me.
- Okay.

401
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:37,710
Okay, I'm starting now.

402
00:20:37,711 --> 00:20:38,280
Okay.

403
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,000
I didn't know it'd work.

404
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,960
That's great!

405
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,940
(Ms. Lv Yuan)

406
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,590
Hello, Ms. Lv.

407
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,390
Sun!

408
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,590
Have you seen

409
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,390
Grandpa Shen?

410
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,520
It's so late and he's still not home.

411
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,110
He's not picking up his phone either.

412
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,280
I saw him.
He's walking near the gate room.

413
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,280
I'll go find him.

414
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,110
No, Ms. Lv.

415
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,390
I'll go. I'm faster.

416
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,960
Tell him to hurry home.

417
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,822
I need to talk to him.

418
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,550
Don't worry, Ms. Lv. I got it.

419
00:22:04,555 --> 00:22:05,410
I'll get him for you.

420
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,222
Tell him to move it.

421
00:22:06,422 --> 00:22:07,280
Don't worry, Ms. Lv.

422
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,680
Don't worry.
I can run 100 meters in 12 seconds.

423
00:22:16,155 --> 00:22:16,790
Mr. Shen!

424
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,150
The only fitting description is

425
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,830
"heart-pounding".

426
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,422
What happened?

427
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,110
As soon as I left,

428
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,390
the second the elevator door opened,

429
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,590
and Ms. Lv was there!

430
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:28,830
And she told me

431
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,830
to tell you to hurry home.

432
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,480
I told her I hadn't seen you.

433
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,920
Then, why would she ask you?

434
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,760
Did you tell her anything?

435
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,480
No, I didn't.

436
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,822
Your secret is safe. Don't worry.

437
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,630
That was close.

438
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,350
Here, take a look.

439
00:22:43,617 --> 00:22:47,000
(Shen Zhuoran. Steps Today: 10,080)

440
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,720
I hit the goal.

441
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,200
I surpassed it.

442
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,630
Alright.

443
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:50,590
You're the best.

444
00:22:52,088 --> 00:22:53,288
She really doesn't know, right?

445
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,220
She doesn't. Don't worry.

446
00:22:54,222 --> 00:22:54,644
Alright.

447
00:22:54,688 --> 00:22:55,022
Good.

448
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:55,720
Thanks, Sun.

449
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:56,520
No problem.

450
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,200
So, can I count on you again?

451
00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:01,350
No problem.

452
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,110
Great.

453
00:23:02,755 --> 00:23:03,440
We're good then.

454
00:23:03,511 --> 00:23:04,310
Bye, Mr. Shen!

455
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,200
Bye!

456
00:23:05,266 --> 00:23:06,040
See you, Mr. Shen!

457
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,550
Young folks really are quick thinkers.

458
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,870
The whole hallway
smells like herbal medicine.

459
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:18,920
Yep.

460
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,550
It's ready. Come on.

461
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,630
Drink it.

462
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,790
Wait, this is for me?

463
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,240
Correct.

464
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,040
But I'm not even sick!

465
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,920
If you're sick, it heals you.
If not, it nourishes you.

466
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,555
Come on.

467
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,630
What is this stuff anyway?

468
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,520
It's good for you. Come on.

469
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:43,240
Hurry up.

470
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,040
This is really bitter.

471
00:23:55,088 --> 00:23:56,150
Good medicine tastes bitter.

472
00:23:56,150 --> 00:23:57,644
Just drink it all in one go. Come on.

473
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,310
Wait.

474
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:58,790
I...

475
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,133
- All in one go.
- I just need to...

476
00:24:00,155 --> 00:24:00,830
Hold your breath.

477
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,480
Finish it.

478
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:07,110
That was awful.

479
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,240
I need to rinse my mouth.

480
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,520
Coming!

481
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,110
Put that down!

482
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,590
I was about to get it.

483
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,390
It's fine.

484
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,200
You're still recovering
from your injury.

485
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,870
I've been fine for a while now.

486
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,680
I'm not some pampered coward.

487
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,240
I'm not that fragile. Come on.

488
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,480
I'll do it myself.

489
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:41,720
Sit down.

490
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:43,240
Alright.

491
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:43,790
Sit down.

492
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,240
Is that okay?

493
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,040
Perfect. Just right.

494
00:24:51,177 --> 00:24:52,350
A foot bath is good for you.

495
00:24:52,755 --> 00:24:53,680
It promotes circulation.

496
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,070
Exactly.

497
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:55,920
Ms. Lv Yuan.

498
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:57,920
Sometimes,

499
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,830
a woman should just

500
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,480
let herself be a little soft

501
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,390
and a little vulnerable.

502
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,520
Yeah.

503
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,390
When people said that back then,

504
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,000
I was totally against it.

505
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,870
But now,

506
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:13,960
I think

507
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,870
we need to look at things dialectically.

508
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:23,280
Right. We have to learn
from each other's strengths.

509
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,150
Yes.

510
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,000
To hear all sides...

511
00:25:29,777 --> 00:25:30,520
is to gain wisdom.

512
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,240
Ms. Lv Yuan.

513
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,000
What exactly did you give me?

514
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,520
I've been thirsty ever since.

515
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,310
My throat's bone dry.

516
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,960
Look, I almost finished all this water.

517
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,200
And I'm still thirsty.

518
00:25:50,866 --> 00:25:51,777
I'm sweating all over.

519
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:52,920
That means

520
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,760
the medicine's working.

521
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,070
Just look at all the sweat on your head.

522
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,070
Here.

523
00:26:02,466 --> 00:26:03,440
Let me wipe it for you.

524
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,830
I've been wiping nonstop.

525
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,630
Come, come.

526
00:26:05,844 --> 00:26:06,377
Come on.

527
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,480
It's all...

528
00:26:07,577 --> 00:26:08,240
All this sweat.

529
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,550
Look at your neck.

530
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,390
Your whole neck's drenched. Look.

531
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,040
Ms. Lv Yuan...

532
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,200
Wait, this is...

533
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,350
Ms. Lv Yuan, I...

534
00:26:24,311 --> 00:26:25,480
What about your foot bath?

535
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:26,040
Forget it.

536
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,550
Don't go just yet!

537
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,110
It helps with circulation.

538
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:30,960
Oh my.

539
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,070
Buddy.

540
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,244
The company's been
burning money all year.

541
00:26:46,488 --> 00:26:47,630
We're stuck in a dead end.

542
00:26:48,311 --> 00:26:50,040
Do you ever regret
going into this with me?

543
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,000
Ruifeng, are you drunk?

544
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,150
I do what I love
with the people I like.

545
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,150
How could I regret that?

546
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,150
From now on,

547
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,070
drink less, and eat more.

548
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,830
Worry less, and make more money.

549
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,480
Go home.

550
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:18,280
Tired?

551
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Have a glass of milk.

552
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,040
Bai.

553
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,040
Okay.

554
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:02,755
I'll come down right now.

555
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,440
Wait for me.

556
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,040
Bai.

557
00:28:16,911 --> 00:28:17,555
Hey, Ms. Liu.

558
00:28:17,666 --> 00:28:18,720
I was just passing by.

559
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,720
I brought the files.

560
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,590
Thanks.

561
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,311
What's wrong?

562
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,422
You look upset.

563
00:28:28,844 --> 00:28:29,822
Sit with me for a bit.

564
00:28:36,822 --> 00:28:38,022
I'm just mentally drained.

565
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,310
To be honest,

566
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,920
that 800 grand is all the money

567
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,070
my family has right now.

568
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,070
I struggled for a long time.

569
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,310
I didn't tell my mom.

570
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,920
I gave all of it to my husband.

571
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,680
The pressure on me was huge.

572
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,000
I made a huge decision.

573
00:28:53,755 --> 00:28:54,550
And look at him.

574
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,550
Not a shred of gratitude.

575
00:28:57,133 --> 00:28:58,960
He even blamed me
for not giving it sooner.

576
00:28:59,240 --> 00:28:59,920
He did what?

577
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,280
I only moved 200 grand

578
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,520
to cover the cost of those uniforms.

579
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,280
It was just normal cash flow.

580
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,790
Exactly.

581
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,630
But, he doesn't see it that way.

582
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,480
He thinks I went back on my word.

583
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,680
This life is seriously exhausting.

584
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,390
Ms. Liu, to be honest,

585
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,240
men are just like kids.

586
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,680
Back when I was on the swim team,

587
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,920
training was really tough.

588
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,590
One day,

589
00:29:26,644 --> 00:29:27,733
the coach showed mercy

590
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,040
and gave us half a day off.

591
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,590
Everyone was over the moon.

592
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,110
But, no one expected him

593
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,870
to call us back ten minutes early.

594
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,150
And all the guys

595
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,390
completely forgot
they had the half day off.

596
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,920
They only remembered the ten minutes.

597
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,000
They made the coach so mad

598
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,590
he never gave us another day off.

599
00:29:46,711 --> 00:29:47,440
Serves them right.

600
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:50,240
Ms. Liu,

601
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,280
don't worry.

602
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,310
I'll ask Headmaster Zhang tomorrow

603
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,630
to see if he can release the payment

604
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,550
early.

605
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,150
That would mean so much to me, Bai.

606
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,110
Please call me Director Bai.

607
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,350
Ms. Liu,

608
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,150
if there's nothing else for now,

609
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:07,960
I'll get going.

610
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,240
Have a great evening.

611
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:11,960
Thanks.

612
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:12,760
Ms. Liu,

613
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,040
take it easy.

614
00:30:15,222 --> 00:30:15,920
Count on me.

615
00:30:19,422 --> 00:30:20,110
Take it easy.

Very good.

634
00:31:42,666 --> 00:31:43,720
Take a ten-minute break.

635
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,110
I think this guy

636
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,390
has something going on.

637
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,310
He's really good.

638
00:31:56,377 --> 00:31:57,190
His pitch is spot on.

639
00:31:58,888 --> 00:31:59,790
Here, have some water.

640
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,390
Take a break.

641
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,310
Are you feeling okay?

642
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,720
You're sweating like crazy.

643
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,480
No, I'm fine.

644
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,150
Last night,

645
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,760
Ms. Lv Yuan insisted
I drink a bowl of herbal medicine.

646
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,350
After I drank it,

647
00:32:14,355 --> 00:32:16,070
I just felt overheated
and kept sweating.

648
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,310
I barely slept a wink all night.

649
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:18,960
What medicine was it?

650
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,550
No idea.

651
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:22,240
She just said it could be healing

652
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,520
or nourishing.

653
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,755
Do you have the prescription?

654
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,550
Nope.

655
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:28,222
I didn't check.

656
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,070
Isn't this the medicine?

657
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,110
I used the bag
to hold pickled mustard greens.

658
00:32:34,444 --> 00:32:35,520
The prescription is here.

659
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,480
What? What is it?

660
00:32:50,155 --> 00:32:50,844
What's wrong?

661
00:32:51,088 --> 00:32:52,040
This doesn't look good.

662
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:54,440
It's worse.

663
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,800
This is baffling.

664
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,150
You know what?

665
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,590
Even Tian got this for me before.

666
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:04,230
Useful for men and women.

667
00:33:06,644 --> 00:33:07,710
Just look at its effects.

668
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,000
Healthy seniors

669
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,750
always stay active.

670
00:33:14,777 --> 00:33:17,000
Sharing a five-herb tonic
to nourish yin and boost yang.

671
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,750
Desert-broomrape replenishes blood

672
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,590
and strengthens kidneys.

673
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,750
These herbs come straight from

674
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,911
Canon of the Yellow Emperor.

675
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,110
If one dose doesn't work, take more.

676
00:33:27,133 --> 00:33:28,488
Double up for stronger results.

677
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,590
Tonic for nourishing
yin and boosting yang.

678
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,110
This stuff really works.

679
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,110
Looks like Ms. Lv Yuan
is serious about Mr. Shen.

680
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,070
She's going all in.

681
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,040
She's ready to seal the deal.

682
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,000
You carry on.

683
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:17,630
Shen,

684
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,710
we're rooting for you tonight.

685
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,750
Don't be ridiculous!

686
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,110
Old rascal.

687
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,630
You're back.

688
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,480
Perfect timing.
Time for your medicine.

689
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,440
Ms. Lv Yuan,

690
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:55,480
why are you making me
drink this virility tonic?

691
00:34:58,155 --> 00:34:59,440
Go home and do your homework.

692
00:34:59,777 --> 00:35:00,270
You hear me?

693
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,480
Got it.

694
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:03,920
Lina!

695
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,480
Xinghuo.

696
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,320
Welcome.

697
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,840
Say hi to Auntie.

698
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,520
Hi, Auntie and sir.

699
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,520
Taotao, you look so pretty today.

700
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,230
Ms. Lv Yuan,

701
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,710
can you please show me some respect?

702
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,270
How am I not respecting you?

703
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,320
If you're sick, you should get treated.

704
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,110
If something's not working,
you should go see a urologist.

705
00:35:40,222 --> 00:35:41,480
I figured you'd feel embarrassed,

706
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,520
so I went for you.

707
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,000
The doctor made it clear.

708
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,000
This is a very important indicator.

709
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,710
Healthy seniors

710
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,000
must stay active for life.

711
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:52,000
Even at eighty, men can still go strong.

712
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,440
You're only seventy,

713
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,630
and you still walk 10,000 steps a day.

714
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,550
Why wouldn't you be capable?

715
00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,400
No!

716
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:03,630
We're not at the point
of talking about this.

717
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,480
Ms. Lv Yuan,

718
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,630
what we have is
a revolutionary friendship,

719
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,550
not a romantic relationship.

720
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:13,750
Who cares what feelings they are?

721
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,270
They come from the heart.

722
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,360
Don't you feel that

723
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,400
ever since I came into your life,

724
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,400
you've become healthier?

725
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,670
And I've been so much happier?

726
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,880
You're a man.

727
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,270
I'm a woman.

728
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,440
When men and women pair up,

729
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,800
yin and yang are in balance.

730
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
It's just the natural order of things.

731
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,480
I'm not interested in you.

732
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:42,750
No, that's not what I mean.

733
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,440
I'm just not interested
in that kind of thing.

734
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:47,750
Alright?

735
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:51,150
I get it.

736
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,040
The real issue is still...

737
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,880
Lian Yilian.

738
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,230
Forget it. Let's not talk about her.

739
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,480
Let's start over.

740
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,190
Comrade Shen,

741
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,230
I'm doing this for your own good.

742
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,230
This medicine is a powerful tonic.

743
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,750
A national treasure.

744
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,190
It nourishes yin and boosts yang.

745
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,920
Even I take it.

746
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,150
The results are certainly...

747
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,150
Remarkable.

748
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,840
I'm not drinking it.

749
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,320
How could you call it remarkable?

750
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,270
Can you cut it out?

751
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,110
Seriously?

752
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,520
I'm really tired.

753
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,040
I'm exhausted every single day.

754
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,670
I walk 10,000 steps a day.

755
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,110
I can't even sleep at night.

756
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,520
And now this stuff?

757
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,590
It'll make it worse.

758
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:40,270
I absolutely won't drink it.

759
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,150
Whether you want it or not, you have to.

760
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,360
You men are all the same.

761
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:47,360
You see some seductress
and your mind starts to wander.

762
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,360
But when it's a strong working woman,

763
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,550
you lose all interest.

764
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,710
I have to cure this disease of yours.

765
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,150
I'm not sick.

766
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,000
I...

767
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,320
I'm just not into that kind of thing!

768
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,710
I'm not up for it, okay?

769
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,880
I'm seventy.

770
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:03,800
This is beyond me!

771
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,360
I'm not up for it, alright?

772
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,270
Unbelievable!

773
00:38:11,888 --> 00:38:12,880
You're not up for it?

774
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:20,800
Duole,

775
00:38:20,888 --> 00:38:22,480
take Taotao home to play for a bit.

776
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,550
Taotao,

777
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,911
let's go home and play with Legos.

778
00:38:24,911 --> 00:38:25,333
Come on.

779
00:38:25,355 --> 00:38:25,844
Taotao.

780
00:38:25,866 --> 00:38:26,920
- Play with Duole.
- Dad.

781
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,440
What's wrong?

782
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,840
Mr. Shen.

783
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:03,000
Dad.

784
00:39:03,977 --> 00:39:04,670
Are you alright?

785
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,400
Calm down, okay?

786
00:39:08,577 --> 00:39:09,150
Take a break.

787
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,190
Mom, let me help you.

788
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,000
Get out of my way.

789
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,750
Mom, that's enough!

790
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,520
Mom.

791
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,880
Let me be honest with you.

792
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,710
When I took Taotao to Disneyland,

793
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,750
I went with that man

794
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,550
you disapprove of.

795
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:32,800
I wore a dress.

796
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,710
I wore high heels.

797
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,400
Taotao even painted her nails.

798
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:36,880
We had a great time together.

799
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,590
Everyone was happy and relaxed.

800
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:39,710
It was really enjoyable.

801
00:39:39,955 --> 00:39:41,577
When Taotao had acute gastroenteritis,

802
00:39:41,622 --> 00:39:43,400
he stayed up with me
to take care of her.

803
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,070
I think he's a good man.

804
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,920
I like him.

805
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,840
Is that wrong? Is that a crime, Mom?

806
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,400
You dared go to Disneyland with him?

807
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,710
This man...

808
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,670
I've already looked into him.

809
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,320
He got divorced because he cheated.

810
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,630
And you still like him?

811
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,750
I'm telling you,

812
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,150
a man who cheats once will cheat again.

813
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,670
The man will never change!

814
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,230
He says he loves Taotao.

815
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,400
But how often does he
see his own daughter?

816
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,070
Do you even know?

817
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,040
I do know.

818
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,750
He picks her up every weekend.

819
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,550
She even went to Disneyland with us.

820
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,270
She and Taotao became good friends.

821
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,920
Look at yourself right now.

822
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,550
Do you even look like a decent woman?

823
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,360
Mom.

824
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,070
You wear hair clips too.

825
00:40:30,622 --> 00:40:31,590
Mind your own business.

826
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,270
I can say the same to you!

827
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,040
If this man cheats, I'll get a divorce!

828
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:36,800
Besides,

829
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,800
Dad is with Madam Liang now.

830
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,550
He hasn't cheated again.

831
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,360
You visited your dad?

832
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:44,590
Yes.

833
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,480
I met him.

834
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,590
He and Madam Liang are
living a happy life.

835
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,320
Are you saying I was the reason

836
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,440
that your dad

837
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,960
cheated on me?

838
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:56,710
Yes.

839
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:59,400
Did Taotao's dad cheat because of me?

840
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,750
It was all me, alright?

841
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,440
It was all my fault, okay?

842
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,670
I checked Taotao's dad's phone every day

843
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,480
because you told me

844
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,670
that all men were no good,

845
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,960
and that men had to be watched.

846
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,150
But now I understand, Mom.

847
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,550
You cannot control love.

848
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,550
The more you try to hold on,
the faster you push them away!

849
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,110
Why do people
need to control each other?

850
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:26,360
How can I not do that?

851
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,750
I gave your dad freedom,

852
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,670
but he was framed for embezzlement

853
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,150
while he was doing sales work.

854
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,040
If I didn't stand up for him,
who would have helped him?

855
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,800
And you?

856
00:41:38,555 --> 00:41:40,022
You were a high school senior,

857
00:41:40,688 --> 00:41:43,511
and you wanted to hitch a ride
to Tibet with an online stranger!

858
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,440
You're a mom now.

859
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,960
What would you have done?

860
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:53,110
Back then,

861
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:55,150
when you gave birth to Taotao,

862
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,040
you were in pain for two full days.

863
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,000
That cheating ex of yours
told you to tough it out.

864
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:06,550
If I hadn't run to the hospital
in the middle of the night,

865
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,550
and begged them on my knees,

866
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,920
you wouldn't even be alive right now!

867
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,000
How can I not worry about you?

868
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,320
How could I possibly stay out of it?

869
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,150
Mom.

870
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,070
Mom, you are just...

871
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,800
You are just

872
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,320
complicating everything in life.

873
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,110
You've lived such an exhausting life.

874
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,150
And it breaks my heart to see it.

875
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,480
I'm grown up now.

876
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,670
I've grown up, Mom.

877
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,440
I'm Taotao's mom.

878
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,630
I understand how you feel.

879
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:43,840
Let's both live better from now on.

880
00:42:44,422 --> 00:42:46,000
Let's stop trying to control each other.

881
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,630
Let's just love each other.

882
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:49,920
Okay?

883
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:55,550
Mom.

884
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,110
Let's go home.

885
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,000
Let's go home.

886
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,520
Let's live a better life.
