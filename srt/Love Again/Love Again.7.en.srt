00:01:35,333 --> 00:01:38,000
=Episode 7=

3
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:41,980
Ms. Lian.

4
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:43,740
You've met.

5
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,340
This is my son, Lian Jin.

6
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,400
Come on, call her Mrs. Shen.

7
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,220
Mrs. Shen?

8
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,980
He should call her Lina.

9
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,940
Yes. Look at me.

10
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,460
Call her Lina.

11
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:00,860
Hello.

12
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,540
Hello.

13
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,420
Sit there.

14
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,155
You're having dinner here, right?

15
00:02:05,733 --> 00:02:07,888
I'll check
if there's any food in the refrigerator.

16
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:08,780
By the way, Lina.

17
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,380
Lian Jin isn't feeling well,

18
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,830
so he'll be staying here for a while.

19
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,180
Shen Qing comes home late.

20
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,250
I won't be able to see him.

21
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,740
Tell him about this later.

22
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,980
Your sister just left,
and a younger brother came.

23
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,460
How shall we handle this?

24
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,580
You have to ask Dad.

25
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,660
Is he here temporarily

26
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,244
or visiting Ms. Lian?

27
00:02:45,222 --> 00:02:46,933
He's not staying here forever, is he?

28
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,940
Why didn't you ask him?

29
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,620
You...

30
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,420
You could have asked during the day.

31
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,340
You're his birth son.

32
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,660
He's right there in Dad's house.

33
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,940
You have to talk to Dad.

34
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,100
I'm busy these two days.

35
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,470
I'll deal with it two days later.

36
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,060
Two days later?

37
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,660
Okay, I'm sleepy. I'm going to sleep.

38
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,220
Fine, go to sleep.

39
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,060
Ms. Lian moved in first.

40
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,780
Now, her son is moving in.

41
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,460
My mom is right.

42
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,420
All she said came true.

43
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,620
My mom said...

44
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,660
Don't tell Mom.

45
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,220
Stop meddling.

46
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,700
I'll talk to Dad this weekend.

47
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,777
You'll talk this weekend.

48
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:28,860
Go to sleep.

49
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:29,900
Hurry.

50
00:03:30,022 --> 00:03:30,740
Don't touch me.

51
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,420
Don't touch me. I'm sleepy.

52
00:04:28,888 --> 00:04:30,500
Take medicine on time after you go back.

53
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,220
Look.

54
00:04:31,466 --> 00:04:33,620
I've written down
the instructions and dosage here.

55
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,380
Three times a day.

56
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,380
Got it.

57
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:36,780
Mom.

58
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:37,800
Don't worry.

59
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,510
I'm always taking medicine.
I have experience.

60
00:04:39,511 --> 00:04:40,940
You're talking nonsense.

61
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,340
You should be careful at all times.

62
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,260
Don't hunch your back.

63
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,380
Okay.

64
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,511
I'm not at home,
so take care of yourself.

65
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,060
Eat on time.

66
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,740
Okay, Mom. Don't worry.

67
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,260
Yilian.

68
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:58,700
Don't ask him to leave.

69
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,300
Let him stay here.

70
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,900
We can take care of each other.

71
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,780
It's okay.

72
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,022
You...

73
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,740
Listen to me.

74
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,700
I thought about it.

75
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,060
If we rearrange

76
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,220
the study,

77
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,300
we can fit a small bed in there.

78
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,100
And he can stay here.

79
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,460
How can that work?

80
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,340
If he occupies the study,

81
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,140
where are you going to write?

82
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,660
Writing?

83
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:23,540
Let me tell you.

84
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,940
If you have no idea,

85
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,980
you can't write anything
even if you're in a palace.

86
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,660
If you have profound insights,

87
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,660
you can write in the balcony,

88
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,340
living room,

89
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,340
and kitchen.

90
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,300
You can even write in the bathroom.

91
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,580
You'll be wronged.

92
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,380
Wronged?

93
00:05:41,844 --> 00:05:42,711
It's settled then.

94
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,100
Zhuoran.

95
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,340
Thank you.

96
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,100
Zhuoran.

97
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:56,900
Lian Jin.

98
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:57,620
Here.

99
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,460
Thank Mr. Shen.

100
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,400
Thank Mr. Shen.

101
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,140
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

102
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,133
No need to say that.

103
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,660
Jin, remember.

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,977
No need to say that.

105
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,180
We're a family.

106
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,820
I'll buy a bed tomorrow.

107
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:14,860
Okay?

108
00:06:15,155 --> 00:06:16,349
No need to put away your stuffs.

109
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,400
You'll move them in anyway.

110
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,460
I'll see how to rearrange it now.

111
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,980
No need to buy a bed.

112
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,500
He can just make do with it.

113
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,220
No,
I'll buy a small bed and put it here.

114
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:25,660
Look.

115
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,780
Let's study which side he can sleep.

116
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,020
Ding, did you see this?

117
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,380
What?

118
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,020
This is the power of love.

119
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,420
You can fight tigers in the mountains.

120
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,780
For whom do wildflowers
on the mountain...

121
00:06:47,822 --> 00:06:48,520
Here we go again.

122
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,740
Can you be serious?

123
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,580
Ding.

124
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,500
Can you control this unreliable

125
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,340
old jerk?

126
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,420
I've given up on him.

127
00:06:54,644 --> 00:06:55,700
I've given up on you too.

128
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:57,540
Shen.

129
00:06:57,644 --> 00:06:59,140
What are you busy with these days?

130
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:00,780
I've indeed been busy lately.

131
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,260
Haven't I

132
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,900
moved in

133
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,540
with Yilian for a while?

134
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,420
But I can't bear

135
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,140
to separate the mother and child.

136
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,740
Her son is sick

137
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,800
and in poor health.

138
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,980
I recently asked her son
to move in as well.

139
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,980
Her son has moved in too?

140
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,420
Yes.

141
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,220
I bought a bed

142
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,780
and freed up the study

143
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,940
for him to stay in.

144
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,980
I just settled it.

145
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,460
Shen.

146
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,780
This seems a bit inappropriate.

147
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,580
It's nothing.

148
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,820
Just get married.

149
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:31,355
You don't want to get married?

150
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,980
Of course I do.

151
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,020
The problem is I don't know

152
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,060
what she thinks.

153
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,540
Yes.

154
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,060
We've been getting along

155
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,700
pretty well lately.

156
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,620
I'm not bad either.

157
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,060
I know how to buy groceries

158
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,140
and cook now.

159
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:50,533
- Good job, Shen.
- It's not easy.

160
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,500
Good job.

161
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,340
It's not easy.

162
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,620
Her son has also moved in.

163
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,380
This shows

164
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,340
that she wants

165
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,020
to advance your relationship.

166
00:07:59,260 --> 00:07:59,620
Right?

167
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:00,620
Ding.

168
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,580
I think your analysis
is absolutely correct.

169
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:03,500
Right?

170
00:08:05,244 --> 00:08:05,940
Don't just think.

171
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,620
We must do it.

172
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,220
Move when it's time to move.

173
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,590
Propose when it's time to propose.

174
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,660
We'll help you.

175
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,500
We'll be your movers.

176
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:14,540
Yes.

177
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:15,740
Let's go.

178
00:08:16,111 --> 00:08:16,500
Let's go.

179
00:08:17,933 --> 00:08:18,940
These are quite heavy.

180
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,288
(Normal University
Music Experimental Education Base)

181
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,260
Shen.

182
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,940
Do Shen Qing and the others

183
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,660
agree to Lian's son moving in?

184
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,860
Shen Qing

185
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,500
should be aware of it,

186
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,820
but he's been too busy with work lately.

187
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,060
We never had a proper conversation.

188
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,620
Shen Qing
has to take care of you and his family,

189
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:47,060
which is troublesome enough.

190
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,140
You got him another brother.

191
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,100
Will he be happy?

192
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,300
I don't think

193
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,911
this matter should even be discussed.

194
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,700
Just

195
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,060
hold a family meeting and announce it.

196
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:56,860
Yes.

197
00:08:57,533 --> 00:08:58,288
A meeting is good.

198
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,420
A meeting is good.

199
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:01,340
You'll convey your idea,

200
00:09:01,488 --> 00:09:04,220
clarify your goal, and achieve twice
the result with half the effort.

201
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:07,460
I'll think about it.

202
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:07,900
Okay.

203
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,460
I almost forgot.

204
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,180
This is for you.

205
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:15,820
What is it?

206
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,700
It's a four-piece bedding set
my wife got for you.

207
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:22,700
It's appropriate to use a new set

208
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,020
since he's moving in.

209
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,700
Look how thoughtful your wife is.

210
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,580
Thank you.

211
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,580
Good job.

212
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,580
Of course.

213
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,780
Look at me. I was so busy
buying a new bed

214
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,940
that I forgot the bedding.

215
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,977
Now, I have everything.

216
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,260
Okay.

217
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,340
Shen.

218
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,460
Your happy life can't do without me.

219
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,740
Of course, it can't do
without Ding and his wife either.

220
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,420
Yes.

221
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,020
That's right.

222
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,580
When you hold a wedding,

223
00:09:46,755 --> 00:09:48,190
you must assign us at the main table.

224
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:48,940
You must do it.

225
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,620
Of course.

226
00:09:49,711 --> 00:09:50,140
Of course.

227
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,580
You two played a crucial role

228
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,260
in this matter.

229
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,020
That's right.
We work so hard that we're like cattle.

230
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,060
Yeah.

231
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,340
You're the one who's like cattle.

232
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,700
I'm fine.

233
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,260
I used the time you spent chasing ladies

234
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,380
to exercise.

235
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,780
This song is good.

236
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,460
This...

237
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,340
Louder.

238
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:15,620
Yes.

How nice.

256
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,340
You finally moved over.

257
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,900
I feel at ease now.

258
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:05,777
Otherwise,
I'll be worried about you all day.

259
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,140
This bed

260
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,740
is purely made of solid wood.

261
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,180
It doesn't have any weird smell.

262
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,900
Mr. Shen

263
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,100
picked it out for you.

264
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,380
He really likes you.

265
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,940
It's not like

266
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,660
at home here.

267
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,660
You can't keep throwing a tantrum.

268
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,740
Okay, Mom.

269
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,660
I know.

270
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,900
I know you understand me.

271
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:54,820
Mom.

272
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,060
Sorry.

273
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,340
I'm a big burden.

274
00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:08,644
I'll give you a beating
if you say that again.

275
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,260
No matter how old you are,

276
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,860
no matter what you become,

277
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,620
no matter whether you look good or not,

278
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,780
you're precious to me.

279
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:40,666
Do you know that?

280
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:41,940
I know.

281
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:43,700
You too.

282
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,740
Is this computer in the way

283
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,860
if it's placed here?

284
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:57,940
I'll move it.

285
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,380
No, don't worry. It's light.

286
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,020
He can

287
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,700
sit here, right?

288
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,540
Be careful.

289
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,355
You know what?

290
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,220
I was alone at first.

291
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:09,940
Later, there are two of us.

292
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,820
Now, great.

293
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,740
Your son is here too.

294
00:13:11,911 --> 00:13:13,780
Life is finally
starting to feel like life.

295
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:14,580
It's warm.

296
00:13:16,688 --> 00:13:18,060
It feels especially like home.

297
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,940
I enjoy this too.

298
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,540
It felt lonely
when it was just my son and me

299
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,355
in the dormitory.

300
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,140
It's good now.

301
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,380
It really feels like home.

302
00:13:28,288 --> 00:13:29,088
Let me do it.

303
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,500
Come and see.

304
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,180
Mr. Shen prepared this for you.

305
00:13:33,466 --> 00:13:34,180
It's pure cotton.

306
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,580
He has sensitive skin

307
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:37,260
and likes things made of pure cotton.

308
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,780
It's pure cotton. Feel it.

309
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:40,740
Thank you.

310
00:13:42,377 --> 00:13:43,620
Why are you thanking me again?

311
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,980
Didn't I tell you?

312
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,500
We're a family.

313
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,688
No need to thank me.

314
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,340
Okay.

315
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:53,420
Alright, you should rest early.

316
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:54,755
Speaking of,

317
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,180
if you need

318
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,580
or want anything,

319
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,540
just tell me.

320
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,220
You can also tell your mom.

321
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:02,700
Okay.

322
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,460
Get some rest.

323
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,100
Okay.

324
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,940
Look, it's warm and cozy.

325
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,000
Go to bed early.

326
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:09,820
Okay, Mom.

327
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,909
There's still a problem with this door.

328
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,933
We can't close it tightly.

329
00:14:16,133 --> 00:14:17,100
Okay, let me handle it.

330
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,100
It's fine.

331
00:14:19,244 --> 00:14:21,133
He's a child.
Having a door is good enough.

332
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:21,822
Don't bother.

333
00:14:23,088 --> 00:14:24,844
I have to fix the things one by one.

334
00:14:24,888 --> 00:14:25,422
Take a break.

335
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:26,510
I'll fix the door tomorrow.

336
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,044
There are so many things.

337
00:14:29,288 --> 00:14:30,460
Here. Let's tidy up together.

338
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,140
No, hurry up.

339
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,540
Hurry and sit down.

340
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,740
No need to help me out.

341
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,500
Alright?

342
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,140
Fine.

343
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,060
I'll just rest my old back.

344
00:14:38,422 --> 00:14:39,720
You've been busy for half a day.

345
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,980
Did Lian Jin paint these?

346
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,140
Yes.

347
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,460
He likes to paint.

348
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:57,900
This is very special.

349
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,380
These paintings are interesting.

350
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,700
I can take Lian Jin's paintings

351
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,780
to my old friends
at the publishing house

352
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,940
to show them one day.

353
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,380
I'll ask them

354
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,700
to give Lian Jin some illustration jobs.

355
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,540
Isn't that great?

356
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,300
Can Lian Jin

357
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,180
draw illustrations?

358
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,900
Why not? Look how interesting

359
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,020
these paintings are.

360
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,260
Editors like artists with personality.

361
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,540
Is that so?

362
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,980
I didn't expect it.

363
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,300
It's really...

364
00:15:30,866 --> 00:15:32,980
Lian Jin will definitely be happy
if he finds out.

365
00:15:33,622 --> 00:15:34,540
Did he also paint that?

366
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,940
Yes. He painted this

367
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,740
when he was in Year 4.

368
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,940
He painted himself.

369
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,580
A self-portrait?

370
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,260
Yes.

371
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,540
He loves to draw paintings like this.

372
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,540
Interesting.

373
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:51,780
I

374
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,300
read a book

375
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,980
about the psychology of painting.

376
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,060
It says

377
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,020
that painters blur the eyes consciously.

378
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,900
It's a way for the painter

379
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:07,820
to cover up.

380
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,580
They hide themselves,

381
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,380
unwilling to reveal their true self.

382
00:16:13,355 --> 00:16:15,660
I have to admit
that what you said is pretty accurate.

383
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,380
Lian Jin is introverted.

384
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,980
He doesn't tell me anything.

385
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,660
I don't know what he's thinking.

386
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,380
Unlike Dai,

387
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,580
who says whatever she wants.

388
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,940
After arguing with everyone,

389
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,600
she still gets along with them.
How nice.

390
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,540
In this vast world,

391
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,140
how can everyone be the same?

392
00:16:35,177 --> 00:16:37,180
All that matters is the children
are well-behaved.

393
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:37,820
Yes.

394
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,980
I like this painting.

395
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,500
We should hang it up.

396
00:16:44,955 --> 00:16:45,711
Speaking of,

397
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,420
there's another important thing.

398
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,220
Let's find time

399
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,460
to have a meal together.

400
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,420
Invite all the children.

401
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,500
We'll

402
00:16:55,888 --> 00:16:57,060
formally introduce Lian Jin.

403
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,380
Great.

404
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:03,940
Thank you.

405
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,060
Shen Qing, bring Lina and Duole

406
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,260
to my place next weekend

407
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,900
for a family meeting.

408
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,933
I have something to discuss with you.

409
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,100
What can it be?

410
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,660
Is it about Ms. Lian's son?

411
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,420
What should we do?

412
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,220
This is a formal meeting.

413
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,020
Should we give him a red envelope?

414
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,500
What red envelope?

415
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,955
We're of the same status.

416
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,460
Yes.

417
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,955
He's considered your younger brother.

418
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,260
Discuss?

419
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,740
It's a done deal.

420
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,020
What's there to discuss?

421
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:48,740
Duole.

422
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,177
Don't join the meeting.

423
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,940
I'm joining.

424
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,620
I want to meet Lian Jin.

425
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,860
Dad asked Duole to go.

426
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,540
Besides, he should join out of courtesy.

427
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:01,740
Shen Duole.

428
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,260
He's considered your uncle.

429
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,800
Don't talk too much when you go.

430
00:18:07,177 --> 00:18:08,866
I don't have to call him Uncle, right?

431
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:10,660
He's only a few years older than me.

432
00:18:10,866 --> 00:18:11,580
Alright, Duole.

433
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,420
Go to bed.

434
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:25,000
Are you not going to bed?

435
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,500
I'm not sleepy at all.

436
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,900
What did you say?

437
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,340
Her son moved in?

438
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,340
You're doomed.

439
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,900
What did I say?

440
00:18:43,711 --> 00:18:45,333
Ms. Lian has favorable qualities.

441
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:46,740
What did she see in that old man?

442
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,260
The truth is out now, right?

443
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,660
She's about to show her true intentions.

444
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:53,060
Keep your voice down.

445
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,580
Shen Qing is still asleep.

446
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,660
Their company recently

447
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,020
bought a foreign patent

448
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,260
and is holding international meetings
every day.

449
00:19:01,288 --> 00:19:02,644
Their day and night are reversed.

450
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,500
He works hard.

451
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,740
He works so hard.

452
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,060
By the way, you should tell Shen Qing

453
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,580
not to work so hard.

454
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,780
I've said it many times. It's useless.

455
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,260
I'm making soup for him.

456
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,140
Ms. Lian's health-preserving recipe.

457
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,700
Ms. Lian

458
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,380
reached out
to everyone in the Shen family.

459
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,820
She first
got close to you and Shen Qing.

460
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,220
Later,

461
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,580
she conquered Shen Dai.

462
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,180
In the end, the mother and son

463
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,460
have a triumphant reunion
in the Shen family's place.

464
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,340
Listen to yourself.

465
00:19:35,755 --> 00:19:37,300
You make it sound like a spy movie.

466
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,340
Are they getting married?

467
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,980
Or does she want the old man
to raise her son?

468
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,020
Or is she

469
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,220
after the free housing?

470
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,780
How would I know?

471
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,980
You must know.

472
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,660
You all need to be on...

473
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,980
On high alert.

474
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,100
Protect the family property. Got it?

475
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:58,540
Well...

476
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:00,940
Mom, you came.

477
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,780
You woke up.

478
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,060
Na just mentioned you.

479
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,890
She said
you've been working very hard lately,

480
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:06,911
so she made soup for you.

481
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,940
Drink it later.

482
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,660
I bought some baby spinach today.

483
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,866
They're very fresh.
I'll stir-fry a plate for you later

484
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,666
to boost your iron.

485
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,540
Mom.

486
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:18,100
Well, it's convenient for us
to buy vegetables.

487
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:18,780
Thank you.

488
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,511
No need
to buy vegetables for us anymore.

489
00:20:21,422 --> 00:20:22,580
My vegetables are different.

490
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,860
I buy vegetables from farmers.

491
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,860
They're organic.

492
00:20:26,111 --> 00:20:26,711
Speaking of...

493
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:27,980
Well...

494
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,300
Shen Qing.

495
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,020
I want to ask you.

496
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,860
Ms. Lian's son

497
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,220
has moved in, right?

498
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,060
Is your father going

499
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,020
to marry Ms. Lian?

500
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,533
I don't know either.

501
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,020
I respect

502
00:20:47,444 --> 00:20:49,000
my dad's opinion on this matter.

503
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,660
Well, I have to wash up first.

504
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,620
Mom, you two chat.

505
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,380
Okay. Go ahead.

506
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,620
Idiot.

507
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,340
You two...

508
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,780
You two are a pair of idiots.

509
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,460
You know nothing when asked.

510
00:21:06,644 --> 00:21:08,622
- Mom, try it.
- Help someone else raise their son.

511
00:21:08,622 --> 00:21:09,244
- I...
- Try it.

512
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:10,755
- I don't want to drink it.
- Try it.

513
00:21:11,044 --> 00:21:11,680
It smells good.

514
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,644
It smells good, right?

515
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,422
Isn't the painting Lian Jin painted
when he was a child interesting?

516
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,060
Look at the lines

517
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,100
and colors.

518
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,860
How creative.

519
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,260
It's really good.

520
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:22,860
Right?

521
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,380
Let me take a photo to study.

522
00:21:26,222 --> 00:21:27,600
- Here.
- You're even taking a photo?

523
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:28,955
You two, get to know each other.

524
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,140
You must be Lian Jin.

525
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,180
I'm Shen Duole.

526
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,466
That's a nice painting. You painted it?

527
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:38,980
You two

528
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:40,260
are only five years apart.

529
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,020
From now on,

530
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,740
call each other by your first names.

531
00:21:43,977 --> 00:21:45,220
It makes communication easier.

532
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:45,500
Okay.

533
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,111
Duole, come here.

534
00:21:47,155 --> 00:21:48,688
Be good. Come over and sit down.

535
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,100
Lian Jin, let me tell you.

536
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,660
Duole is good at basketball.

537
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,300
You can go play basketball with him.

538
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,220
Ms. Lian, sit down.

539
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,300
- Yes.
- Ms. Lian.

540
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:00,700
No need.

541
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,090
No need to squeeze with each other.

542
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,020
I'll just sit here.

543
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,540
- Sure.
- I'll sit here.

544
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,100
Okay, everyone is seated.

545
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,355
I will now formally introduce to you.

546
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,820
This is Lian Jin.

547
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,260
Ms. Lian's son.

548
00:22:12,355 --> 00:22:13,380
You can introduce them.

549
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,260
Call Qing and Lina.

550
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:18,820
Hello.

551
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,170
- Speak louder.
- Hello.

552
00:22:20,177 --> 00:22:20,622
Hello.

553
00:22:21,155 --> 00:22:22,133
-Hello.
- Hello.

554
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,300
I'm sorry.

555
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,020
He's a bit introverted.

556
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,700
Lian Jin has officially moved in.

557
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,340
I feel good.

558
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:33,980
We're now

559
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,500
a big happy family.

560
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,820
By the way, he's staying in the study.

561
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,380
I've cleared out the study.

562
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,740
The study faces south

563
00:22:42,977 --> 00:22:44,180
and has plenty of sunlight.

564
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,620
It will help him recover.

565
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,420
Lian Jin is bookish.

566
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,180
He's a literary youth.

567
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,300
Grandpa.

568
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,660
You found someone to recite poetry
this time.

569
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,300
That's right.

570
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,100
Lian Jin.

571
00:23:01,311 --> 00:23:02,410
Do you play Honor of Kings?

572
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,377
What's your account?

573
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,860
I don't play that.

574
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,060
All you know is play games.

575
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,540
Lina.

576
00:23:08,711 --> 00:23:10,790
They just started chatting.
Look at what you've done.

577
00:23:13,688 --> 00:23:15,300
By the way, Lina,
there's one more thing.

578
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,100
Ms. Lian has to go to work
during the day.

579
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,860
Lian Jin...

580
00:23:19,977 --> 00:23:20,660
I'll handle it.

581
00:23:20,955 --> 00:23:22,500
It's just adding a pair of chopsticks.

582
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,260
Yes.

583
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:24,860
Thank you.

584
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,300
That's what I mean.

585
00:23:27,288 --> 00:23:28,860
Alright, you can rest assured now.

586
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,740
This is why we bought our houses

587
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,540
opposite each other.

588
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,288
It's convenient
to take care of each other.

589
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,340
Sorry to bother you.

590
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:36,740
No.

591
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:38,580
Look at you.

592
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,420
Why keep saying things like this
when we're family?

593
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,780
How is it a bother?

594
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,780
Don't say it anymore.

595
00:23:47,577 --> 00:23:48,711
Speaking of,

596
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,900
move the desk

597
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,780
from that room

598
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,140
to the living room.

599
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,422
I'll be writing and reading here
from now on.

600
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:57,377
Besides,

601
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,100
I bought a bed too.

602
00:23:59,577 --> 00:24:00,755
I installed it afterward.

603
00:24:00,777 --> 00:24:01,844
Somehow it keeps shaking.

604
00:24:01,844 --> 00:24:02,466
Check it out.

605
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:04,620
Also,

606
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,620
tell Dai about this.

607
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,020
Grandpa, let me move it.

608
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,540
You're really smug.

609
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,420
Sit down.

610
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,311
Open your shoulders.

611
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,820
I'll go. I'll move it.

612
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,260
By the way, move the books first.

613
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:24,580
Alright.

614
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:27,900
I'll go help.

615
00:24:31,222 --> 00:24:32,822
You can talk about Honor of Kings now.

616
00:24:32,822 --> 00:24:33,660
He doesn't play it.

617
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,380
Really?

618
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:35,780
So good.

619
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:38,700
Dad.

620
00:24:39,422 --> 00:24:40,333
I took everything out.

621
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,140
You moved everything, right?

622
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:43,820
Okay.

623
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,600
Look at you, you're so inactive
that you're tired and gasping for breath.

624
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,866
You just did a little bit of work.

625
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,044
You're even worse than me.

626
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,460
Have you stopped running recently?

627
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,820
I haven't had time to run recently.

628
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,140
Practice Tai Chi then.

629
00:24:57,444 --> 00:24:58,577
It's dynamic and static.

630
00:24:59,044 --> 00:25:00,080
It's good for your health.

631
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,180
Dad.

632
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,100
Your main job now
is health preservation.

633
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,060
How can Shen Qing compare with you?

634
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,260
He's busy in the office all day.

635
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,300
Standing up and walking

636
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,400
can be considered exercise.

637
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,620
Only you can order him around.

638
00:25:14,777 --> 00:25:16,400
Mr. Shen
is a level-one protected species

639
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,340
in our home.

640
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,380
I do all the heavy work.

641
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,740
Okay, stop talking.

642
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,380
Alright, stop talking.

643
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,100
Here. Go home.

644
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:24,940
I...

645
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:25,780
Alright, go home.

646
00:25:25,822 --> 00:25:26,311
I'll do it.

647
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,580
Go home. Go back and rest.

648
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,020
Okay.

649
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,100
Go.

650
00:25:32,177 --> 00:25:33,140
Ms. Lian, we're leaving.

651
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,260
I wanted to serve you some water.

652
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:35,940
It's fine.

653
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,180
Bye, Dad.

654
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:46,540
We were kicked out just like that?

655
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,300
Do you want to complain about it?

656
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,700
Silence at last.

657
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,220
You worked hard.

658
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,780
You worked hard.

659
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,540
Thank you. My son and I
have someone to rely on now.

660
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:11,660
Look.

661
00:26:11,866 --> 00:26:13,488
Why are you saying thank you again?

662
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,220
Thank you.

663
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,540
No, don't say it. Look.

664
00:26:19,666 --> 00:26:21,222
If you say it, he will say it too.

665
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:21,900
Didn't I say it?

666
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,450
We're a family. No need to be formal.

667
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,577
We're a family.

668
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,420
Lian Jin, I'll get two books

669
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,220
from your room,

670
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,820
and you can go back to rest. Okay?

671
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,100
Sure.

672
00:26:56,733 --> 00:26:58,500
Can you
please stop fiddling with the door?

673
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,980
No, what's wrong with this door?

674
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,660
The rail on top of this door

675
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,740
is quite smooth.

676
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,460
Why can't it be closed tightly?

677
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:05,660
It's fine.

678
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,800
It can't be closed tightly.

679
00:27:06,844 --> 00:27:07,940
Lian Jin can't sleep well.

680
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,020
He's a child.

681
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,820
He can sleep like a log. It's okay.

682
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,140
No.

683
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:13,940
We need

684
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,300
to find a carpenter to fix this.

685
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,380
I can't fix it.

686
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,500
Go rest. You've had a busy night.

687
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,340
Lian Jin.

688
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,540
Rest early.

689
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,180
Okay, Mom.

690
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:37,740
Okay.

691
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,380
Look.

692
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,380
I

693
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,020
prepared everything for you.

694
00:27:46,577 --> 00:27:47,444
Look at me.

695
00:27:47,444 --> 00:27:48,266
Check the temperature.

696
00:27:48,288 --> 00:27:49,488
You even brought the water over.

697
00:27:49,511 --> 00:27:50,222
Here, let me do it.

698
00:27:50,911 --> 00:27:51,460
Look at this.

699
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,220
Here.

700
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,540
Here.

701
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,266
You exhausted yourself today.

702
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,180
No.

703
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,500
Almost there.

704
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:02,780
Is it hot?

705
00:28:02,955 --> 00:28:04,066
- Is it okay?
- It's good.

706
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,740
Soak your feet more often
when you're free.

707
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,940
Isn't this only possible
because of your presence?

708
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,940
Be serious.

709
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,100
Dear, drink some water.

710
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:48,940
It's alright

711
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,780
that the child is in poor health,

712
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,980
but he has a weird temper.

713
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,460
Why didn't Ms. Lian

714
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,660
tell us?

715
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,460
She must know that we won't agree to it.

716
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,420
Why does she need to tell you?

717
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,100
She just needs to tell Dad.

718
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,660
Why didn't Dad tell me then?

719
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,060
How would I know?

720
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,500
Your dad tells everyone everything.

721
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,860
This matter
is closely related to you and me.

722
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,980
You now have a new brother.

723
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:20,820
Shen Qing.

724
00:29:21,088 --> 00:29:23,060
If I bring back
a child I had with someone else,

725
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,420
will you accept them?

726
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,860
Yes.

727
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:27,740
They're the future of the country
after all.

728
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,620
What's that supposed to mean?

729
00:29:29,644 --> 00:29:31,020
Do you already have one outside?

730
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:31,980
I'm telling you.

731
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,500
I won't tolerate any nonsense.

732
00:29:34,577 --> 00:29:36,180
I'm telling you. Let me know in advance

733
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,620
if you have one.

734
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:39,820
I'll get divorced
and make room for you right away.

735
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,700
What is that?

736
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,239
What time are you going to bed?

737
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,133
- I'm not sleeping.
- You can never finish work.

738
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:47,580
Jeez.

739
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,540
Lian Jin.

740
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:51,740
Lian Jin.

741
00:29:56,688 --> 00:29:57,620
What's wrong, Mom?

742
00:29:57,688 --> 00:29:58,466
You're not asleep?

743
00:29:59,180 --> 00:29:59,900
Not yet.

744
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:02,688
I know you're not asleep
when I see you've got the light on.

745
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,180
Were you reading again?

746
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:09,777
Get up early and go to bed early.
Don't stay up late all the time.

747
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,060
Your body can't take it.

748
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:11,900
Okay.

749
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,180
Mom.

750
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,460
I'm not used to
new bed.

751
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,060
You'll adapt to it after some time.

752
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,740
The house keys.

753
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,733
Keep it well.

754
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,355
Do I have to put them
around my neck like this?

755
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:34,460
Mom.

756
00:30:35,288 --> 00:30:36,822
Do you think I'm a three-year-old kid?

757
00:30:38,822 --> 00:30:39,888
What's the matter?

758
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,888
Even if you're 80 years old,
you're still my son.

759
00:30:41,933 --> 00:30:42,888
You want to rebel?

760
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:44,620
No.

761
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,060
But you remind me

762
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,020
of when you were a kid.

763
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,000
You wore a bunch of keys
around your neck.

764
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:51,780
You have a big head

765
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,100
and a thin neck.

766
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,860
They jingled.

767
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,340
I knew from afar that my son was home.

768
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,140
And I felt at ease.

769
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,460
I

770
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,100
jingled the keys

771
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,100
so that you knew I was home.

772
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:09,700
Really?

773
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,860
You're quite thoughtful.

774
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:13,820
Hurry. Go to bed.

775
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,500
You need to rest.

776
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:19,900
It's my fault

777
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,410
for not taking good care of you

778
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:22,820
and troubling you.

779
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,340
I was busy
with work and hometown matters.

780
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,740
I didn't bother
with my most beloved child.

781
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,020
Mom.

782
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,500
Don't say that.

783
00:31:35,622 --> 00:31:36,780
Take good care of yourself.

784
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,180
When you recover,

785
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,220
we'll go traveling.

786
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,355
Where do you want to go?

787
00:31:43,177 --> 00:31:45,060
By the way,
you mentioned Sanya last time.

788
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,340
Why don't we go to Sanya?

789
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:48,620
Sure.

790
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,660
Can we not bring that old man?

791
00:31:54,911 --> 00:31:55,955
That old man?

792
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,620
Is he that old?

793
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,700
Will you two get married?

794
00:32:11,222 --> 00:32:12,220
What do you want to say?

795
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:15,500
I...

796
00:32:17,511 --> 00:32:18,740
I don't want to say anything.

797
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,260
I have no idea.

798
00:32:24,155 --> 00:32:26,355
I have never had any idea
since I was a child.

799
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,140
You have ideas.

800
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,500
You're just too sensible

801
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:41,940
and obedient.

802
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,380
Sometimes,

803
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,380
you're so sensible

804
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,220
that you distress me a little.

805
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:56,660
Alright.

806
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,400
Go to bed early.

807
00:33:02,933 --> 00:33:04,220
I'll turn off the light for you.

808
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,260
Okay.

809
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,220
Mom.

810
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:16,111
Good night.

811
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,666
Good night.

812
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,140
Have you ever played

813
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,860
with Lian Jin?

814
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:07,900
No.

815
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,540
I only met him once.

816
00:34:09,622 --> 00:34:11,044
Every time I go to Grandpa's place,

817
00:34:11,044 --> 00:34:12,740
he stays in the study
and doesn't come out.

818
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,580
That kid is a little weird.

819
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:15,740
Right? Shen Qing.

820
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:20,700
Mom, I'm done.

821
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,340
Enjoy your meal.

822
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,300
I'm talking to you,
but you're ignoring me?

823
00:34:24,577 --> 00:34:25,620
I need to make a report.

824
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,380
You have to work?

825
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,660
Close the door.

826
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,940
Don't let us bother you.

827
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:30,860
Okay.

828
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,300
Don't just sit there
after you finish eating.

829
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,300
Walk around.

830
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,180
He already sat down.

831
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,940
Look, what did I say?

832
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,980
Don't make trouble.
Let your father work.

833
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,420
Did they mention marriage?

834
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,140
No.

835
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,340
I guess...

836
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:02,700
Duole.

837
00:35:02,911 --> 00:35:03,940
Why are you lying there?

838
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,580
It's genetics.

839
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:08,860
Ignore him for now.

840
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:10,820
I guess

841
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,020
the old man is still under observation.

842
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,260
If I were Ms. Lian,

843
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,500
I'd like to observe too.

844
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,180
Right?

845
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,740
Can this stepfather
tolerate his stepson?

846
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,340
Ms. Lian is amazing.

847
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,740
Okay, just perform well.

848
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,577
I'll play a game with Lian Jin

849
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,911
and give Grandpa extra points.

850
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,540
Shut up.

851
00:35:33,088 --> 00:35:34,911
Go. Go back to your room and play.

852
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:36,700
Hurry up.

853
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,420
Hurry.

854
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,060
Go.

855
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:46,860
Mom.

856
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,260
Lian Jin
doesn't seem to be in good health.

857
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,620
Be careful with this.

858
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,340
If they really get married,

859
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,100
he becomes your brother.

860
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,260
Maybe he'll change his last name.

861
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,380
If your father-in-law...

862
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,500
who will take care of this child?

863
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,220
Definitely you and Shen Qing.

864
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,377
When that happens,

865
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,100
well...

866
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,300
Work, marriage, and children...

867
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:19,422
It's a one-stop service.

868
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,090
Anyway, you'll have
a lot to worry about.

869
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,300
It's indeed a problem.

870
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:30,580
Okay.

871
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:31,580
Okay.

872
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:32,380
Alright.

873
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,660
Thank you two.

874
00:36:33,955 --> 00:36:34,500
Thank you.

875
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,500
You worked hard.

876
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,220
Dad.

877
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,460
What are you doing?

878
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,422
I changed the door.

879
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,700
The study door

880
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:43,511
is an old problem.

881
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,340
I took advantage of Lian Jin's arrival

882
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,500
to solve it.

883
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,060
Actually, he can just fix

884
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,220
the old door,

885
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,100
but...

886
00:36:52,488 --> 00:36:54,100
It's better to find
a permanent solution.

887
00:36:54,177 --> 00:36:55,244
Look how good it is now.

888
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,340
Lian Jin can rest well.

889
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,600
Look at this door again.

890
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,460
Pull it.

891
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,940
Look how smooth it is.

892
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,860
It's quiet.

893
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,180
Silent technology.

894
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,060
Dad, how much did it cost?

895
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,133
A little over 5,000 yuan.

896
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,500
This door costs more than 5,000 yuan?

897
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,460
Is it cheap?

898
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,620
It's expensive.

899
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,060
Let me check online.

900
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:19,860
Look.

901
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:20,740
It's

902
00:37:20,955 --> 00:37:21,740
the same, right?

903
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,940
It's only 2,980 yuan,
including installation.

904
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,620
- Ms. Lian, take a look.
- Let me take a look.

905
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:28,200
It's true.

906
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,180
This is oak, solid wood.

907
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,060
It's environmentally friendly.

908
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,340
You get what you pay for.

909
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,700
You still have to compare prices.

910
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,620
It also says solid wood.

911
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,740
Don't believe the advertisement online.

912
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,540
Could I be wrong?

913
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,500
I compared them one by one.

914
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,540
How could I not know?

915
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,500
Besides,

916
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,140
I call the shots in my house.

917
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,380
Ding, eat.

918
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,660
Shen.

919
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,100
Shen.

920
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,060
You should introduce

921
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,580
your love story.

922
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,140
Yes.

923
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:16,980
Right?

924
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,040
How should I put it?

925
00:38:20,044 --> 00:38:22,260
I had a serious illness a while ago.

926
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:24,044
Getting hospitalized

927
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,540
is like getting a major repair.
You know?

928
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,155
One problem was cured,
but another one appeared.

929
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,380
Thanks to our head nurse, Yilian,

930
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,540
for taking good care of me.

931
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,740
Without her,

932
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,540
I may not be here today.

933
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,500
So how has the hospitalization been

934
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,860
during this period?

935
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,020
I cured my disease

936
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,700
and gained love.

937
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,460
This is a double harvest!

938
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,980
- Yes, double harvest.
- Double harvest.

939
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,620
If we're not feeling well,

940
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,420
can we ask Lian to help

941
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,860
get us an appointment?

942
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,500
No problem. You can cut in line.

943
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:02,940
Okay.

944
00:39:03,577 --> 00:39:05,577
It's all electronic registration now.

945
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,920
But feel free to find me anytime
if you're not feeling well.

946
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,260
Okay, I'll create a chat group.

947
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,420
Yes, create a group.

948
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,220
I can send the photos I took today

949
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,380
to the chat group.

950
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,820
- Yes.
- That's right.

951
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,420
These old folks

952
00:39:17,844 --> 00:39:19,150
are trying to gain favor with her.

953
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,100
How arrogant.

954
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,100
Yeah.

955
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:22,860
Modern medicine
is extensive and profound.

956
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,860
Even a doctor won't ask you

957
00:39:25,466 --> 00:39:27,311
to find them if you're not feeling well.

958
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,740
It's too much.

959
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,140
Yes.

960
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:29,955
Come, let's drink.

961
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,860
Don't forget to take a photo for us.

962
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,340
Take a photo for us.

963
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,980
Look at Shen.

964
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,980
He was all dramatic

965
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,180
during the Mid-Autumn Poetry Festival.

966
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:40,900
Yeah.

967
00:39:41,644 --> 00:39:43,980
He even needed his grandson
to support him as he walked.

968
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,740
I thought he couldn't recover.

969
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,180
Men

970
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,300
must love even after death.

971
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,740
Love keeps them alive.

972
00:39:59,220 --> 00:39:59,980
Let's eat.

973
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,180
Let's dig in.

974
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,940
Look.

975
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,900
Your dad, who is nearly 70 years old,
is enjoying life.

976
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,100
What are you doing?

977
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:22,980
What am I doing?

978
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:25,700
I'm earning money to support my family.
What am I doing?

979
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,420
If one day I die first,

980
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,900
you'll definitely be like your dad.

981
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,420
You'll dye your hair,

982
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,300
date,

983
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,020
and bring home
someone 20 years younger than you.

984
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,340
Ms. Liu Lina.

985
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,380
I've had enough of you lately.

986
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,260
I'm telling you very seriously

987
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,260
that my mom's position in my dad's heart

988
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,620
is irreplaceable.

989
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,420
How do you know?

990
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,340
Don't ask me how I know.

991
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,140
I just know.

992
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,140
Lina.

993
00:40:59,288 --> 00:41:01,100
We've known each other
since freshman year.

994
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,780
We've experienced many things together.

995
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:03,820
Without you,

996
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,460
I wouldn't even quit the Big Four
to start my own business.

997
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,690
I wouldn't be able to hold it together
over the years while Mom was sick.

998
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,340
A married couple is not only partners.

999
00:41:12,444 --> 00:41:13,444
But more importantly,

1000
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,300
we're comrades-in-arms.

1001
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,220
The bond where we fight side by side

1002
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,460
and support each other
through thick and thin,

1003
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,740
is irreplaceable.

1004
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,460
I still envy Ms. Lian.

1005
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,060
Look how good your dad is to her.

1006
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,940
That's what love looks like.

1007
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,740
Every relationship

1008
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,460
has its honeymoon period.

1009
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:37,100
Dare you say we didn't have that?

1010
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,340
Stop reading those inspirational stuffs.

1011
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,100
Mutual empathy and understanding?

1012
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,460
I'm doing a lot of confusing work.

1013
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,844
I don't even understand it myself.

1014
00:41:47,844 --> 00:41:49,133
How can I make you understand?

1015
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,260
But none of this matters.

1016
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:56,340
I know you'll pick me up from work
if my car breaks down.

1017
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,933
You'll prepare supper for me
when I work overtime.

1018
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,020
You know you have my salary card.

1019
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,220
We all know

1020
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:04,644
that no matter who falls ill,

1021
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,820
the other will do whatever it takes

1022
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,800
to treat and save them.

1023
00:42:07,844 --> 00:42:09,300
Isn't that enough?

1024
00:42:10,911 --> 00:42:13,711
We've had a pleasant cooperation
in the first half of our lives,

1025
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:15,000
and we'll be even more in sync

1026
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,060
in the second half.

1027
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,060
You, me, and Duole.

1028
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,460
The three of us

1029
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,180
will always be a family.

1030
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,220
Dear.

1031
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,940
Just make your request.

1032
00:42:28,377 --> 00:42:29,555
What do you want me to do?

1033
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,980
I want you to do nothing.

1034
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,460
Especially don't keep calling me

1035
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,860
in the daytime.

1036
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,220
Duole is back.

1037
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,740
- Mom, Dad.
- Duole.

1038
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:43,580
Wait.

1039
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,060
Your school uniform.

1040
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,980
Let me wash it for you.

1041
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,860
Are you okay?

1042
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:53,980
Dad.

1043
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,860
What came over my mom?

1044
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:56,820
She took her cure.

1045
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,260
Reassurance.

1046
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,420
