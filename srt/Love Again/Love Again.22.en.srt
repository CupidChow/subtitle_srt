00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,040
=Love Again=

2
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,140
=Episode 22=

3
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,410
Yuanda Technology Management Co., Ltd.
is hiring.

4
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,410
Below 35 years old?

5
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:48,450
This won't do.

6
00:01:49,022 --> 00:01:50,288
Is there a suitable job for you?

7
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:50,960
No.

8
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,760
It's either I'm too old

9
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,850
or the company is too far.

10
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,330
Why is it so difficult

11
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,680
for a middle-aged lady
to find a job again?

12
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,680
Don't rush. Take your time.

13
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,130
I finally figured it out.

14
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,730
Providing values

15
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,890
to one's family alone isn't enough.

16
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:10,800
We have to provide value to society too.

17
00:02:12,355 --> 00:02:14,377
In the end? Lin Fengyun
rained on my parade.

18
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:17,080
You didn't agree to let me
work in your company as well.

19
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,760
I have no choice but to work hard
and find a job myself.

20
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,480
It's good if you work hard.

21
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,680
However, it's not peaceful out there.

22
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,760
Every company has its own politics.

23
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,170
It's not as simple as you think.

24
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,733
It's not like I never worked before.

25
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,480
I used to be a top performer
at an import-export company.

26
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,890
That was back then.

27
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,200
Nowadays, all industries
are very competitive.

28
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:36,920
I just...

29
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,680
I just don't want you to suffer.

30
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,130
Suffer?

31
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,410
You think I didn't suffer
in your family?

32
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,170
I'm worried

33
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,210
that work might be too tough for you.

34
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,050
You know?

35
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,850
When you get home,

36
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,560
you'll be upset.

37
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:53,730
When you're upset,

38
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,970
there will be a series of consequences.

39
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,530
If I'm upset after working,

40
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,480
all the more I require my husband's
consolation when I come home.

41
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,210
Mr. Shen,

42
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:07,530
all these years,
you've been working hard out there.

43
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,050
How did I support you?

44
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,240
I gave you massages,

45
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,320
made you soup,

46
00:03:13,644 --> 00:03:15,650
and even bought you
an electric lumbar support.

47
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,850
We're husband and wife.

48
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,730
We have to look after each other.

49
00:03:24,244 --> 00:03:26,290
I've demonstrated it
for you for so many years.

50
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:27,970
Now,

51
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,320
this is your chance.

52
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:31,240
It feels good.

53
00:03:32,288 --> 00:03:33,660
Aren't you going to thank me, then?

54
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,120
Thank you.

55
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,170
Who am I?

56
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:38,920
Thank you, Dear.

57
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,730
Who's there?

58
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,560
Mr. Shen, don't move.

59
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:45,770
I'll get the door.

60
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:47,530
Who's there?

61
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,320
Coming.

62
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:51,650
Ms. Lv?

63
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,320
Lina.

64
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,120
I found you a job.

65
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,050
Is that so?

66
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:56,800
Please come inside. Have a seat.

67
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,560
Okay.

68
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,560
Wu from our factory's transport team

69
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,730
went into business last year.

70
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,610
He joined the business market.

71
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,850
These youngsters are very driven

72
00:04:08,888 --> 00:04:10,244
when it comes to business.

73
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,410
Now,

74
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,440
their company is doing great.

75
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,120
They're trying to hire an accountant.

76
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,410
They need someone professional

77
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,290
and trustworthy.

78
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,777
They want someone reliable.

79
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,650
His mother and I

80
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,480
were old friends.

81
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:25,970
That's why they sought my help.

82
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,210
They can definitely rest at ease

83
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,530
with my recommendation.

84
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,800
Yeah. That's right.

85
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,360
However,

86
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,240
I have to say this first.

87
00:04:38,822 --> 00:04:40,680
They just started
the company not long ago.

88
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,240
The wage won't be high.

89
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:43,650
However,

90
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,920
you guys can progress
together as a company.

91
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,850
That's something to look out for.

92
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:49,730
You know?

93
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:50,440
Yeah.

94
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,560
The wage isn't important.

95
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:53,730
But,

96
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,880
won't they mind my age?

97
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,610
You're just over 40.
You're not that old.

98
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,850
They want someone dependable.

99
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:02,970
You're right.

100
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,090
But it's been so long since I worked.

101
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:07,920
Will this work?

102
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,240
Why not?

103
00:05:09,644 --> 00:05:11,170
Can accountants even forget their job?

104
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,770
They're just doing accounts.

105
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,050
Of course not.

106
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,090
It's just that...

107
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,650
Ms. Lv, you see,

108
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,080
I might have quite a lot of questions.

109
00:05:18,088 --> 00:05:19,360
That's fine.

110
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,444
Let's solve them one by one.

111
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,355
Come on. Ask away.

112
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,666
Ask me one question at a time.

113
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:24,440
So,

114
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,800
for example,

115
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,090
if something were to happen at home,

116
00:05:28,644 --> 00:05:30,580
for example, Duole
has a parent-teacher meeting,

117
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,480
or my dad

118
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,480
has to visit the hospital

119
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,800
to take his medicine and so on...

120
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,410
I might have to apply for leave

121
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,680
or leave work early.

122
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,480
Is that okay?

123
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,770
Sure. That's negotiable.

124
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,880
I told you already.

125
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,240
It's someone I know.

126
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,530
You're not an employee.

127
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,120
You're joining their business.

128
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:53,100
(No. 83, Wenjing East Road, Xishan Street)
His address

129
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,711
(Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province)
and phone number.

130
00:05:54,711 --> 00:05:56,680
You can call him
after making up your mind.

131
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,210
Okay.

132
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,360
Thank you so much, Ms. Lv.

133
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,730
Don't be so courteous.

134
00:06:02,244 --> 00:06:03,200
Straighten your back.

135
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,170
Rest early.

136
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:07,880
Okay.

137
00:06:08,088 --> 00:06:09,850
Conserve your energy
and make preparations.

138
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:10,530
Get that job

139
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,650
tomorrow.

140
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,090
Okay.

141
00:06:13,244 --> 00:06:14,240
I'll make a move first.

142
00:06:17,266 --> 00:06:19,200
Ms. Lv, you should rest early too.

143
00:06:19,222 --> 00:06:19,711
Okay.

144
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:21,850
Thank you.

145
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,210
Don't stand on ceremony.

146
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,290
Rest well.

147
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,290
I'll get that job tomorrow.

148
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,240
Mom.

149
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,210
Where are you going?
You dolled yourself up.

150
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:48,377
I have something to do.

151
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,880
Your mother is going
to fulfill her societal values.

152
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,000
Really?

153
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,730
In the future,
I can't pick you up after school.

154
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,977
You have to come home yourself.

155
00:06:57,044 --> 00:06:59,350
No one will deliver
your things to you if you forget them.

156
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,170
No problem.

157
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,800
I just reloaded my metro card.

158
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,250
Take care.

159
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,080
Mom.

160
00:07:04,355 --> 00:07:05,440
You can focus on your work.

161
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:07,130
You don't even need to prepare dinner.

162
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,800
I can come home after dinner.

163
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:10,440
I promise I won't take any junk food.

164
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,050
No.

165
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,560
Don't cross the line.

166
00:07:13,511 --> 00:07:14,690
What time will you come back?

167
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,440
I can't say for sure.

168
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,440
You never know with work.

169
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,410
Since you're home,

170
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,300
it's time for you
to contribute to the family.

171
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,440
Alright. I'll come back earlier.

172
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,370
I'll cook.

173
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:29,920
Ms. Liu, I'll support the family
while you work.

174
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,530
Thank you.

175
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,370
That's called looking after each other.

176
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,422
See you.

177
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,010
Ms. Liu,

178
00:07:35,177 --> 00:07:35,920
you can do it.

179
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,088
Ms. Liu, you can do it.

180
00:08:11,422 --> 00:08:12,720
Hello. Who are you looking for?

181
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,720
Hello. Is Mr. Wu around?

182
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,050
Mr. Wu? He's over there.

183
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,050
Okay.

184
00:08:20,355 --> 00:08:20,770
Thank you.

185
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:21,540
Don't mention it.

186
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:29,770
Mr. Wu.

187
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:31,720
You must be Mrs. Liu.

188
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:32,560
Hello. That's right.

189
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,422
I was waiting for you.

190
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:34,840
This is your desk.

191
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:35,920
I just sanitized it.

192
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:38,290
Sorry about that.

193
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,530
Come.

194
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,600
Have some water.

195
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,010
Thank you.

196
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:44,890
Please have a seat.

197
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:45,320
Okay.

198
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:47,720
Thank you.

199
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:48,800
Therefore,

200
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,300
we have to use the opportunity
to expand our business.

201
00:08:51,311 --> 00:08:53,377
We need a professional accountant
to help us out.

202
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:54,800
I heard from Ms. Lv

203
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,200
that you were a proper finance major.

204
00:08:58,266 --> 00:09:00,700
That's right. From Normal University's
Faculty of Accounting.

205
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,010
That's great.

206
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:03,960
Our company

207
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:04,890
might be new,

208
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,650
but it has great potential.

209
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,290
Look.

210
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,890
These are

211
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,170
the tax documents we need to fill out.
It's this thick.

212
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,720
I even studied the new tax laws

213
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,490
last night.

214
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,410
The way you filled out this form
is not standardized.

215
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,080
The immediate tax collection
and refund section is blank.

216
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,920
And, the serial numbers are random.

217
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,600
You're right.

218
00:09:26,688 --> 00:09:28,888
It's almost time for us
to declare our income tax.

219
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,711
That's why we're in a hurry
to hire someone.

220
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,770
I heard from Ms. Lv

221
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,920
that you have no specific requirements

222
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,490
regarding your wage, right?

223
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,050
Yes. It's negotiable.

224
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,490
Our company is small.

225
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,720
We just started it not long ago.

226
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,890
Your basic salary isn't high.

227
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:43,733
It's 3,000 yuan.

228
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:44,650
However,

229
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,800
we can give you some shares.

230
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,650
My wage is negotiable.

231
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,720
Let me tell you about
my family situation.

232
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,250
My husband

233
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,250
is quite busy.

234
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,111
He's the COO of
a pharmaceutical company.

235
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,800
My son is in
the 2nd year of high school.

236
00:09:56,866 --> 00:09:57,960
That's a crucial period.

237
00:09:58,088 --> 00:10:00,440
Therefore, there are quite a lot
of things I need to handle.

238
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:03,170
Therefore, I want to ask you
if it's possible to make

239
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,250
my working hours

240
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,840
more flexible.

241
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:07,370
It's no problem during normal days.

242
00:10:07,444 --> 00:10:09,349
Just tell us if you need to leave early.

243
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,770
But not at the end of the month
when we need to file our taxes.

244
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,080
You have to work overtime. Look.

245
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:15,555
All these tax invoices came in
at the end of the month.

246
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,010
The working hours are from 9-5, right?

247
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,490
8-5.

248
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,044
With one rest day per week.

249
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,200
We're in our start-up phase.

250
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,770
It's a tough period.

251
00:10:25,933 --> 00:10:27,050
For the finance department,

252
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,400
besides tax preparation,
there's some office work too.

253
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,370
We get five days of vacation a year.

254
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,250
Only five days?

255
00:10:34,577 --> 00:10:35,560
Is that not enough?

256
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,650
That's fine. It's negotiable.

257
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,410
Sorry about this.

258
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,720
Maybe the season just changed.

259
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
My rhinitis is acting up.

260
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:45,600
Our company

261
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:46,960
is quite dusty too.

262
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:17,170
Friday, okay?

263
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:20,060
The steakhouse Steven's mother
is operating is doing a promotion.

264
00:11:20,066 --> 00:11:21,090
I'll buy you a meal there.

265
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:22,770
Did someone beat you up?

266
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,410
It's rhinitis.

267
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,250
You belittled me, right?

268
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,410
Ms. Lv

269
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,770
introduced a new job to me.

270
00:11:29,911 --> 00:11:32,250
I'm working as an accountant
for a logistics company now.

271
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,410
This company is located

272
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,650
in a warehouse of a clothing factory.

273
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:37,490
It's so dusty.

274
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,933
It might be triggering my allergy.

275
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,888
How much is your wage?

276
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,680
3,000 yuan per month.

277
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,350
But there's a bonus
at the end of the year.

278
00:11:43,355 --> 00:11:45,530
I think it's about 100,000 yuan.

279
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,320
That sounds pretty good.

280
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,933
When will you start your work?

281
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,800
I'm still hesitating.

282
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,080
You know this too.

283
00:11:52,488 --> 00:11:53,866
I'm not doing it for the money.

284
00:11:53,888 --> 00:11:55,370
I just wanted to do something else.

285
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,890
I can't just focus on my family 24/7.

286
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,044
But you see, I need to apply for leave

287
00:12:00,044 --> 00:12:01,511
if Duole has a parent-teacher meeting

288
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:03,577
or my father-in-law
needs to head to the hospital.

289
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,911
You're an employee, you know?

290
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:08,010
You negotiated your off-days
with your boss instead of your wage?

291
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,530
What can I do about it?

292
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,010
The family can't function without me.

293
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,130
How's the progress with Ms. Lv?

294
00:12:15,644 --> 00:12:17,290
I'll hang up first. I need to drive.

295
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,320
Son.

296
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,680
What did you buy?

297
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,320
Isn't this...

298
00:12:39,711 --> 00:12:41,770
Didn't your mother tell you
not to buy junk food?

299
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,770
What is this?

300
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,888
Didn't my mom tell you
to come back and cook for me?

301
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,800
My cooking is not as good
as outside food, you know?

302
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,490
Yeah.

303
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,080
Okay.

304
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,560
Hurry up, then.

305
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,733
Throw everything away
once you're done with it.

306
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:53,560
Alright.

307
00:12:54,444 --> 00:12:55,222
You want one?

308
00:12:55,844 --> 00:12:56,750
Is it a small serving?

309
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,720
That's a given.

310
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,770
- Only this time, okay?
- I...

311
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:02,960
You took all of my food.

312
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:09,960
Here.

313
00:13:11,622 --> 00:13:13,111
Take a drumstick and grow tall.

314
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,410
Thank you, Ms. Lv.

315
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,490
We can make do even if you didn't ask us
to join you for dinner.

316
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,770
I already ordered a food delivery.

317
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,010
There's nothing good about that.

318
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,222
All of them are junk food.

319
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,370
Go back and tell your mother

320
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,222
that the entire family
supports her decision.

321
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,666
Tell her to focus on her work.

322
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,800
"The strong pass of the enemy
is like a wall of iron,

323
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,044
yet with firm strides,
we are conquering its summit."

324
00:13:32,466 --> 00:13:34,529
The child is too young
to understand that quote.

325
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,050
Yeah.

326
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,050
Have some dumplings.

327
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,622
You love dumplings, right? Eat up.

328
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:39,250
Eat up.

329
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,290
You too, Dad.

330
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,560
I'm too full.

331
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,680
Lina, you're back.

332
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,010
Good job.

333
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,650
Come and eat.

334
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
Ms. Lv, I'm not that hungry.

335
00:13:57,844 --> 00:13:59,200
Food is essential for our survival.

336
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,600
Eat it even if you're not hungry.

337
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
The rice is still hot.

338
00:14:01,622 --> 00:14:02,490
I kept some for you.

339
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,560
Come and eat.

340
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:04,170
Come.

341
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,770
Your husband and your son
are eating with us too.

342
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,200
Okay.

343
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,800
Give it to her.

344
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:08,560
Mom.

345
00:14:09,377 --> 00:14:09,920
You're back.

346
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:10,920
Lina, come.

347
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,250
Come.

348
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:11,560
Dad.

349
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,770
Hurry and sit down.

350
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:13,600
Look.

351
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,600
Ms. Lv kept a drumstick for you.

352
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:16,600
Thank you, Ms. Lv.

353
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,040
- Mom, I kept my drumstick for you.
- I can't finish all of that.

354
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,600
Ms. Lv has prepared feast for us.

355
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,050
Yeah.

356
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,280
It must've been tough, Ms. Lv.

357
00:14:22,288 --> 00:14:24,080
Not at all. It was a piece of cake.

358
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,440
How was it? How was Mr. Wu?

359
00:14:26,977 --> 00:14:27,680
Tell us about it.

360
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,410
Mr. Wu was pretty nice.

361
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,890
Wu is close to me.

362
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,440
He'll look after you.

363
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,840
But you shouldn't seek
preferential treatment because of that.

364
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,130
You have to establish
good ties with the rest.

365
00:14:42,288 --> 00:14:44,000
You mustn't
apply for leave all the time.

366
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,130
Take this job

367
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,920
as your career.

368
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,320
Yeah.

369
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,530
Thank you, Ms. Lv.

370
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:52,288
Don't mention it.

371
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,200
Here, Lina. Have some soup.

372
00:14:55,355 --> 00:14:56,355
Have some soup first.

373
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,050
It smells great. Have some, Mom.

374
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:58,370
Here.

375
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:58,840
Okay.

376
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:01,410
Mom,

377
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:02,650
why is your nose

378
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,320
so red?

379
00:15:06,511 --> 00:15:08,050
The company is located in a warehouse.

380
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:08,840
It's quite dusty.

381
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,370
My nose was acting up again today.

382
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,311
Did you spray medicine?

383
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,170
It's fine.

384
00:15:13,466 --> 00:15:15,650
My daughter had the same condition
when she was young.

385
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,010
I took her jogging.

386
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,010
I took her to a car workshop.

387
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:21,700
I took her to all kinds of dusty places.

388
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,770
I fought fire with fire.

389
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,290
She recovered after that.

390
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,370
Look at her.

391
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:28,370
Diseases are just like coils of springs.

392
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,977
If you're weak, they grow strong.

393
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,200
Hurry. Eat up.

394
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,920
Ms. Lv,

395
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,490
I can tell
that Mr Wu's business is quite busy.

396
00:15:36,511 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm just worried that I have
too many family affairs to deal with.

397
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,155
I might affect their business.

398
00:15:40,177 --> 00:15:41,690
I'm still here, you know?

399
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,450
It'll be fine.

400
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:45,288
It's a good time for Duole
to get some exercise as well.

401
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,640
Duole, can you go to school
by yourself in the future?

402
00:15:49,288 --> 00:15:52,080
I'm fine with exercising. It's just
that I can't get there in time.

403
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,360
If so, you should wake up earlier.

404
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,244
You have to identify
your own weaknesses.

405
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,690
Lina, in the future, when you work,

406
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,010
Shen Qing and Duole
can come here for their meals.

407
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:02,530
Look.

408
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,110
We have four dishes and one soup here.

409
00:16:04,111 --> 00:16:05,577
The main course is dumplings.

410
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,800
It's quite nutritious, right?

411
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:08,360
Yeah.

412
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,530
Shen Qing, in the future...

413
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,530
If he needs some clothes
or materials from the house,

414
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:13,777
I can deliver them to him.

415
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,200
I can visit Duole at school
as well if he needs anything.

416
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,155
Parent-teacher
meetings must be attended by my parents.

417
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,690
Yeah.

418
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,840
It's not like you have that many
parent-teacher meetings in a year.

419
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:24,840
My goodness.

420
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:26,770
Lina.

421
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,970
You can attend it by
applying for leave occasionally.

422
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,080
If Shen Qing is free, he can attend it.

423
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,320
That's viable, right?

424
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,360
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

425
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:36,690
Dad, Ms. Lv,

426
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,988
I think her condition is serious.

427
00:16:37,988 --> 00:16:39,560
I'll take her back
to get her medication.

428
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,730
- Okay.
- It's quite serious.

429
00:16:40,955 --> 00:16:42,490
Ms. Lv, sorry for the trouble, then.

430
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:42,930
Okay.

431
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,010
Trouble is nothing to me.

432
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,250
Lina, take the dumplings with you.

433
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:48,360
You have two drumsticks.

434
00:16:48,377 --> 00:16:49,890
Take them with you. We didn't eat them.

435
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:50,560
They're cold now.

436
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,880
- You guys can reheat them.
- Okay.

437
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,800
Sorry, Ms. Lv.

438
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,840
- My nose is killing me.
- Take the dumplings. It's fine.

439
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,600
It's entirely blocked.

440
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,010
It's fine.

441
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,160
- Reheat them before you eat.
- Okay. Dad, we'll leave now.

442
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,970
Goodbye, Ms. Lv.

443
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,210
- Goodbye, Grandpa.
- Go ahead.

444
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:00,530
Goodbye.

445
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,010
Finish them, okay?

446
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,640
You guys didn't eat much at all.

447
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,360
We did.

448
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,688
We're even bringing them home.

449
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:13,320
Shen Qing.

450
00:17:13,755 --> 00:17:15,955
How could you let your son eat this
when I'm away?

451
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,450
Did he?

452
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,250
Didn't I tell you
to dispose of it downstairs?

453
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:20,690
Mom.

454
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:22,010
Actually, I didn't eat much.

455
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,010
Dad ate everything.

456
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,800
- You're heartless!
- You two are the same.

457
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,600
You finished my fried chicken, you know?

458
00:17:29,422 --> 00:17:32,400
People do not get off the line of duty
due to minor injuries.

459
00:17:33,022 --> 00:17:34,290
But Lina is something else.

460
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:36,590
She is making such a huge fuss
over her nose.

461
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,360
She's the daughter of
a working-class family.

462
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,970
Why is she acting like an aristocrat?

463
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:44,560
She has to change that.

464
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,210
You're being a bit one-sided here.

465
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,450
Listen.

466
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:51,160
Ever since Lina married into our family,

467
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:54,010
she did everything in the house

468
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,080
by herself.

469
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,880
She never complained about it at all.

470
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,640
And, it's been some time
since she worked.

471
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,840
Maybe she's just not used to it yet.

472
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,600
You should be able to understand that.

473
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,930
I do.

474
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,800
(Xinghuo is inviting you
to a video call)

475
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,880
Hi, Grandma. What are you doing?

476
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,970
We just finished dinner.

477
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:19,930
Have you guys eaten?

478
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,080
Yeah. Where's Mr. Shen?

479
00:18:23,111 --> 00:18:24,120
Grandpa Shen is over here.

480
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,450
Taotao.

481
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,080
Hello.

482
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,840
Grandpa Shen, look.

483
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,930
I drew an ice cream for you.

484
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,320
It's red, huh?

485
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,450
It's fire ice cream.

486
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,080
It looks great.

487
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,800
Listen.

488
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,560
Taotao, you're not allowed
to have ice cream in the future.

489
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,250
Did you hear me?

490
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,010
Okay.

491
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,530
It's just a drawing.

492
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:52,450
Mom, I'll take Taotao
to Disneyland next week.

493
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,690
I'll pick you up after that, okay?

494
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,360
You guys can look after yourselves.

495
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,840
Stay out of my affairs.

496
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,160
Taotao.

497
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:07,880
Mr. Shen.

498
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:09,690
Don't worry.

499
00:19:10,133 --> 00:19:11,511
Your mother is doing great here.

500
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,120
She's quite the leader.

501
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,360
Just let her stay here
for a few more days.

502
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,840
Grandpa Shen, I'll buy you a present
when I'm at Disneyland.

503
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,050
Okay. I'll wait for you.

504
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,840
This coffee pot

505
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,490
is easy to bring for vacations.

506
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,770
I use it every day when I'm in Yangzhou.

507
00:19:36,155 --> 00:19:38,290
Does that mean
you'll be staying in Yangzhou often?

508
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:39,530
That's not it.

509
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:41,530
Once the acquisition is completed,

510
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,560
the company will station John there.

511
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:47,530
Doesn't it smell nice?

512
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,730
You look like a pro.

513
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,320
Here, have a try.

514
00:19:53,377 --> 00:19:53,800
Thank you.

515
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,422
It smells great.

516
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,970
Thank you.

517
00:20:00,577 --> 00:20:01,450
Doesn't it smell nice?

518
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:04,560
Yeah.

519
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,290
It does.

520
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,955
Hand-brewed coffee
really hits differently.

521
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,010
Come.

522
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,970
Let's give our beautiful, capable,

523
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,880
and skillful Ice a toast.

524
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,690
Thank you for your coffee.

525
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,080
Here.

526
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,050
Thank you.

527
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,640
Wait.

528
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,080
Let's take a photo here.

529
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:17,770
Come.

530
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,930
Three, two, one.

531
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,690
Why is there an ape?

532
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,840
Everyone,

533
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,450
the hiking event is about to start.

534
00:20:28,688 --> 00:20:30,360
The first person
to cross the finish line

535
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:31,970
will win a huge prize!

536
00:20:32,111 --> 00:20:33,290
He has a headstart! Let's go!

537
00:20:33,355 --> 00:20:33,930
Let's hurry.

538
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:35,109
- He has a headstart!
- Let's go!

539
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,044
We haven't eaten yet.

540
00:20:36,088 --> 00:20:37,577
I'll be leaving now. Goodbye, boss.

541
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:39,800
Slowly.

542
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,530
Shen, hurry up.

543
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,490
Even the water tastes sweet
in a high-class restaurant.

544
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,010
It's Alpine spring water.

545
00:21:02,088 --> 00:21:03,730
You're quite a nice mother-in-law-to-be.

546
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,970
Our age gap is merely eight years.

547
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,050
When we first met,

548
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,120
she told me

549
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,400
about how difficult it was

550
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,400
to raise her son.

551
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,080
I said,

552
00:21:14,377 --> 00:21:15,840
my mother was a single parent as well.

553
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,050
I understand your feelings.

554
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:17,690
After that,

555
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,530
she hugged me

556
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,450
and cried.

557
00:21:20,866 --> 00:21:22,160
Esteemed guests, here you go.

558
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,880
Order whatever you want.

559
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,360
I'm quite hungry indeed.

560
00:21:27,226 --> 00:21:28,499
(Taste Buds Feast Set – 228 RMB)

561
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,920
(Romantic French Set – 488 RMB,
Prestige Set – 688 RMB)

562
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,800
I think I'll get a salad.

563
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,688
I'm not that hungry.

564
00:21:34,844 --> 00:21:36,250
Lina took a lot of bread as well.

565
00:21:37,311 --> 00:21:40,010
Yeah. It's our first meeting,
yet you want us to indulge like this?

566
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,320
I don't think that's appropriate.

567
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,250
Don't be shy, okay?

568
00:21:43,311 --> 00:21:45,044
Order the most expensive meal
you can find.

569
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,970
I topped up 100,000 yuan
into my card when it first started.

570
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:49,120
100,000 yuan?

571
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:49,970
What? 100,000 yuan?

572
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:50,930
Lower your volume.

573
00:21:51,133 --> 00:21:53,210
Give me 100,000 yuan,
and I'll hug you and cry.

574
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,600
Please give me a Prestige Set.

575
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:07,600
Me too.

576
00:22:08,644 --> 00:22:09,777
Make it three Prestige Sets.

577
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:11,120
Okay. Please wait a moment.

578
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:12,560
Thank you.

579
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,080
Lin Fengyun.

580
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,360
This is a high-class restaurant,

581
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,320
yet the waiter's outfit
is a bit underwhelming.

582
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,250
Her cuffs were especially wide.

583
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,490
It was sliding across
the top of my glass.

584
00:22:27,755 --> 00:22:29,288
The fabric looks ordinary as well.

585
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,533
I don't think it's custom-made.

586
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:31,530
I have no idea.

587
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:32,880
I don't know.

588
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:36,377
It's garlic bread.

589
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:41,490
Ms. Sunny.

590
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:42,050
Ms. Sunny.

591
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,880
Try our mousse cake.

592
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,440
- Ms. Sunny, congratulations.
- Thank you.

593
00:22:45,444 --> 00:22:45,770
Thanks.

594
00:22:45,777 --> 00:22:46,509
It's so exquisite.

595
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,580
You guys are so supportive.

596
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,250
Thank you.

597
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,600
Ms. Sunny.

598
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,530
Lina's eyes are sharp.

599
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,250
She said the waiter's outfit
wasn't fitting.

600
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,080
When she came, her cuffs

601
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,050
were sliding across
the top of her glass.

602
00:22:59,050 --> 00:22:59,840
That's not good.

603
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:01,800
Indeed.

604
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,640
The devil is in the details.

605
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:05,320
However,

606
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,640
staff turnover
is pretty high these days.

607
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,600
The restaurant in front of our unit

608
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,800
changes their waiters every two weeks.

609
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,690
So, their uniform
can't really be customized.

610
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:14,730
Yeah.

611
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,010
We considered the same issue before.

612
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,730
So, for the procurement,
we chose one-size-fits-all

613
00:23:19,755 --> 00:23:21,400
and didn't pick anything too expensive.

614
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,560
Actually, it's simple.

615
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,730
It would be better to add some elastic

616
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,050
or a hidden button

617
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:28,560
around the waist and cuffs.

618
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:30,210
This way, they can adjust it easily.

619
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,840
Why didn't we think of that?

620
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,050
Ms. Sunny,
Lina is an expert in this field.

621
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,560
During our university days,

622
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,840
she was the one handling

623
00:23:37,888 --> 00:23:39,600
all of our outfits
for all kinds of events.

624
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,400
She has great taste.

625
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,320
Amazing.

626
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:46,010
Lina, you should customize
fifty sets of them for Ms. Sunny.

627
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:46,880
My treat.

628
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:48,970
Fengyun.

629
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,970
Thank you so much.

630
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:50,777
Don't mention it.

631
00:23:51,466 --> 00:23:53,120
Lina, I'll be depending on you, then.

632
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,400
No problem. I'm just lifting a finger.

633
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,490
Shen Qing.

634
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,160
Hurry up.

635
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:04,266
You guys go ahead. I'll cover the rear.

636
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,250
Are you okay?

637
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,930
Ice, you can go ahead. Just ignore me.

638
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,210
I'm considered a handicap.

639
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,290
I'll just take a stroll.

640
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,360
I also wish to slow down my pace

641
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:15,560
and enjoy the view.

642
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,822
I suppose the trip to Yangzhou
went well, right?

643
00:24:21,844 --> 00:24:22,711
It went pretty well.

644
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,160
Aiden has an active mind.

645
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:27,600
He's good at putting himself
in other people's shoes.

646
00:24:27,688 --> 00:24:30,022
If so, I'm sure you two
will have a great collaboration.

647
00:24:32,844 --> 00:24:35,066
The three most important things
in Aiden's life are

648
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,120
data, video games, and cats.

649
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,640
Look.

650
00:24:41,177 --> 00:24:42,577
There are mushrooms over here.

651
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,930
It's red and bright.

652
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,730
- Eat it, and die you might.
- Die you might.

653
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,080
Be careful.

654
00:24:56,044 --> 00:24:58,266
We can collect the mushrooms
we encounter along the way,

655
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,010
just like Chekhov.

656
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,450
I truly think

657
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,770
that he wrote
the best short stories in the world.

658
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,690
His sarcasm and humor

659
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,490
transcend time.

660
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:10,770
Yeah.

661
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,490
I love the rich layers
contained in his stories.

662
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,400
He has an extraordinary humor.

663
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,800
However, just like

664
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,490
all comedians,

665
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,488
they're not actually happy
in their private lives.

666
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:24,730
He offered himself
as the target of scrutiny

667
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,822
when he wrote about
human nature sarcastically.

668
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:27,970
And, in my opinion,

669
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,930
it's likely that he suffered
from insomnia.

670
00:25:33,222 --> 00:25:35,955
His writing style became
quite gloomy in his later years.

671
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,600
It might be because of insomnia.

672
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,000
That's why he stopped
pretending to be happy.

673
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,640
He had a crazy female fan
who was a writer as well.

674
00:25:43,866 --> 00:25:46,250
She was married, but she
loved him for the rest of her life.

675
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:49,120
She gave him
a book-shaped pendant as a gift.

676
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,510
If you find a specific page and line
in a book by Chekhov

677
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,639
according to the numbers above,

678
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,490
you'll see the quote,

679
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,560
- "If...
- "If,

680
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,640
you need my life,

681
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,210
you may come and take it."

682
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:08,600
Mr. Shen.

683
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,840
We're almost catching up to your team.

684
00:26:11,377 --> 00:26:12,640
Why are you guys still there?

685
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,600
You guys are glancing at the view
without taking in the details.

686
00:26:15,644 --> 00:26:18,120
We focus on admiring the views.

687
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,400
The sample

688
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,770
is made according to your request.

689
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,690
The waist and cufflinks

690
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,600
are adjustable.

691
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:34,600
That's pretty good.

692
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,320
All of them are hidden buttons, huh?

693
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:37,770
The button is here.

694
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,770
S, M, L, three sizes.

695
00:26:39,777 --> 00:26:41,120
With this adjustable button strap,

696
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,080
it can fit everyone.

697
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,400
The fabric weighs 240 g.

698
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,530
It's quite durable,

699
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,844
and still comfortable to wear.

700
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,010
This is good.

701
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,133
The stitching needs to be finer.

702
00:26:51,155 --> 00:26:53,530
There shouldn't be any loose threads.
Look at this one here.

703
00:26:53,533 --> 00:26:54,450
Don't worry about that.

704
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,840
You have my guarantee.

705
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,930
So, if you're happy with the quality,
you can make the payment.

706
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,200
We'll proceed with the order.

707
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,422
Alright. I'm happy with it.
Proceed with the order.

708
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:05,490
Mr. Yu.

709
00:27:06,244 --> 00:27:07,044
Are you busy?

710
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,050
Bai, you're here.

711
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:09,560
Come. Have a seat.

712
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,120
Okay.

713
00:27:10,177 --> 00:27:11,400
Ms. Liu, you may take a look.

714
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:11,770
Okay.

715
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,770
Here, have some water.

716
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:19,800
Alright. Thank you.

717
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,600
Ms. Liu, come and have a drink.

718
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:23,640
Okay.

719
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,733
Let me introduce you two to each other.

720
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,290
Ms. Liu,

721
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,560
this is Bai, who's responsible
for our business loans.

722
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,800
He's lively and energetic.

723
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,210
- Ms. Liu.
- Hi, Mr. Bai.

724
00:27:37,933 --> 00:27:38,970
Sorry about this, Ms. Liu.

725
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:39,600
I have rhinitis.

726
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,840
Me too.

727
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,730
You can put it on.

728
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:42,010
No.

729
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,490
I have to show everyone my sincere face.

730
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,290
My sister often says

731
00:27:46,355 --> 00:27:49,079
that people with rhinitis are
people who are particular about life.

732
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,800
My rhinitis

733
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,210
encourages me to maintain
the hygiene of places I've been to.

734
00:27:53,377 --> 00:27:54,066
My surname, Bai,

735
00:27:54,088 --> 00:27:55,360
implies that I have to be clean.

736
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,880
Your sister is quite interesting.

737
00:27:58,955 --> 00:28:01,133
She taught her brother well
just with three sentences.

738
00:28:01,844 --> 00:28:03,259
You have to learn from your sister.

739
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,290
It's the same when I work.

740
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,840
Clear as day, and crystal clear.

741
00:28:06,755 --> 00:28:08,866
Do you want to know more
about our business loans?

742
00:28:08,866 --> 00:28:11,190
As long as you have a business license,
you can get a loan.

743
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:14,080
Ours is a tiny business.
We don't require loans.

744
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:14,970
Ms. Liu,

745
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,050
the essence of doing business
is exchange and circulation.

746
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,120
All large enterprises

747
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,800
started from humble beginnings.

748
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:21,880
Ms. Liu.

749
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:23,450
Mr. Bai is right.

750
00:28:23,466 --> 00:28:24,770
Why are you calling me that?

751
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,050
I'm just doing my friend a favor.

752
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,640
You'll become a director
after enough time, you know?

753
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,600
Yeah.

754
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:30,970
You're such an expert.

755
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:32,640
Why aren't you starting
your own company

756
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,022
and doing a custom clothing business?

757
00:28:34,022 --> 00:28:36,133
You can collect orders
while we'll make them for you.

758
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:36,880
Yeah.

759
00:28:37,155 --> 00:28:39,969
Mr. Yu has now shifted his focus
and no longer holds inventory.

760
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,290
He's encouraging others
to help him with product promotion.

761
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:42,840
Is that so?

762
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,210
Even so, the quality must be good.

763
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:46,988
There must be many varieties.

764
00:28:46,988 --> 00:28:48,840
Only then will you be able
to promote your product.

765
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,955
That's a given.

766
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,770
You already saw
the quality for yourself.

767
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,930
The fabric and
craftsmanship are excellent.

768
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,160
We're friends.

769
00:28:56,177 --> 00:28:57,500
If you're ordering a large amount,

770
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,711
we can negotiate a deal.

771
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:00,730
If the price is negotiable,

772
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,930
everything is negotiable.

773
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,560
Seems like Ms. Liu is interested.

774
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,730
Zhou,

775
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,360
brew a pot of my finest Longjing tea

776
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,490
for Ms. Liu.

777
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,120
It's fine.

778
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,730
I'll have this.

779
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,250
We can chat while having tea.

Guys,

784
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,690
I'm back!

785
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,120
My dad sings at home every day.

786
00:29:34,177 --> 00:29:35,777
He insists on visiting his old friends.

787
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,010
Welcome.

788
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:39,250
Guys, don't worry.

789
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,400
From today onward,

790
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,290
I'll carve all of your names

791
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,490
and the lyrics of our songs

792
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:45,880
into my brain.

793
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,160
Excellent!

794
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,840
Ding, you don't need to do so.

795
00:29:50,177 --> 00:29:51,560
Everything we're singing right now

796
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,530
is already in your brain.

797
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,080
Really?

798
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,080
We'll travel back in time with you.

799
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,080
We're returning to our youth days.

800
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:58,560
Am I right?

801
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,160
That's right.

802
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,400
Ding, tell us.

803
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,880
What lyrics do you remember?

804
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:04,688
That's right.

805
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,250

810
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,450
You did the right thing

811
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,880
by sending your father back here.

812
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:23,050
Yes. My dad is doing his best nowadays.

813
00:30:23,111 --> 00:30:24,660
He plays with a Rubik's cube every day.

814
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,080
He said it could train his mind.

815
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:26,880
That's good.

816
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,530
By the way, you're busy with work.

817
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,320
You don't need
to send him here in the future.

818
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,080
Just call us.

819
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,160
Mr. Gou and I will pick him up.

820
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,050
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

821
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,930
But my dad is getting
more and more forgetful.

822
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:42,311
I wish to keep him company
as much as possible.

823
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,930

She's very spirited.

841
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,010
That's Lv Yuan.

842
00:31:40,111 --> 00:31:41,133
Of course she's spirited.

843
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:42,490
Listen.

844
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:43,800
She's very vigorous.

845
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,250
She fears nothing.

846
00:31:47,711 --> 00:31:49,044
She's even living with me.

847
00:31:50,688 --> 00:31:52,450
Don't tell me
you guys will become a family.

848
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,010
That's impossible.

849
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:57,290
Her family has encountered
some difficulties.

850
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,590
She's just living with us
for the time being.

851
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,790
Cut the chatter.

852
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,970

00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,479
There's an adjustable
button strap at the waist too.

859
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,770
Now, you can see the figure line.

860
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,730
I've also upgraded the fabric.

861
00:32:29,266 --> 00:32:30,111
She looks great.

862
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,210
She looks spirited now.

863
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,050
You even look slimmer.

864
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,688
You can return to work.

866
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,890
This time, after deducting the gas fee,

delivery charges,

868
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,010
and all the other
miscellaneous expenses,

869
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,640
there's still 2,548 yuan left.

870
00:32:48,222 --> 00:32:49,340
I'll transfer it back to you.

871
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,955
My goodness. You didn't spend it all?

872
00:32:50,977 --> 00:32:52,170
I thought it wasn't enough.

873
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,680
I'm great at calculations, you know?

874
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,330
I'm registering for a business license.

875
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,890
I plan to start my own company.

876
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,010
You're something else.

877
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,760
In the future, we'll call you Ms. Liu.

878
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,600
Okay, Ms. Liu?

879
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:06,560
Ms. Liu.

880
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,280
Ms. Liu, congratulations.

881
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,490
Thank you, Ms. Sunny.

882
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,819
It's just a small business.
Thank you for being my patrons.

883
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,450
Small businesses
grow eventually, you know?

884
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,120
Precisely.

885
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,160
Lina.

886
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,490
Ms. Lv.

887
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,080
I was looking for you.

888
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,010
Wu said you quit your job.

889
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:32,850
Yes.

890
00:33:34,266 --> 00:33:34,850
That's right.

891
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:35,970
But why?

892
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,120
Is it too tiring for you?

893
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,640
Is the wage too little?

894
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:40,970
Ms. Lv, that's not it.

895
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,490
Why, then?

896
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,240
Don't think

897
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,640
that you can indulge in life

898
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,560
just because Shen Qing
is supporting the family.

899
00:33:47,622 --> 00:33:48,330
That doesn't mean

900
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:49,680
you can slack off, you know?

901
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,450
That's going overboard.
That's not the case.

902
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,280
Lina wouldn't do that.

903
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,930
Who said so?

904
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:58,240
Wu sent me a text message

905
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,680
expressing regret.

906
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,200
What should I say, then?

907
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,120
I had no choice but to keep apologizing.

908
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,970
Ms. Lv, I'm sorry about that.

909
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:06,890
It's been tough on you.

910
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,850
Others are always
rising to the challenge.

911
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,370
But you're backing off instead.

912
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:11,810
You...

913
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,680
You're more than just

914
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,370
stuck in place.

915
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,120
It's a rapid decline,

916
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,930
a steep drop.

917
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:21,280
Ms. Lv, you misunderstood me.

918
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,330
Under your encouragement,

919
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,160
I already started my own company.

920
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,370
Look at her.

921
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:27,760
You started a company?

922
00:34:27,888 --> 00:34:28,850
What kind of company?

923
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,080
A clothing company.

924
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,600
We specialize in custom uniforms
and performance costumes.

925
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,330
I was a dancer before this.

926
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,330
I know the field well.

927
00:34:36,466 --> 00:34:38,640
From now on, I'm going
to make a living by myself.

928
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:40,288
I'm starting my own business. Look.

929
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,720
You're leveraging your own strengths

930
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:44,450
and becoming self-reliant.

931
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,970
This is the flourishing
socialist market economy.

932
00:34:46,977 --> 00:34:49,200
That's right. You should
do things that you're good at.

933
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:49,810
That's right.

934
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:52,370
Dad, why don't you name my company?

935
00:34:52,577 --> 00:34:53,600
Give me four words.

936
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,850
Don't make it too fancy.

937
00:34:54,911 --> 00:34:55,911
I want something

938
00:34:55,955 --> 00:34:57,022
that's easy to remember.

939
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,490
If so, why don't we give it

940
00:34:59,160 --> 00:34:59,930
a joyous name?

941
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,450
Sure.

942
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:02,050
Duoduolele.

943
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,560
Duoduolele sounds great.

944
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,311
I'm sure Duole
will be happy to hear that.

945
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:06,680
Yes.

946
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,600
Mr. Shen, I...

947
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,666
You're truly impressive.

948
00:35:12,688 --> 00:35:13,577
You're exaggerating it.

949
00:35:13,577 --> 00:35:15,120
- You're truly talented.
- You flatter me.

950
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,720
I'm serious.

951
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,680
I'll head to the entrance

952
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,680
and borrow a trolley
from the security guard.

953
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,280
Why?

954
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:22,080
What are you up to?

955
00:35:22,111 --> 00:35:23,120
Are you taking this home?

956
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:24,330
It's quite heavy.

957
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,050
It's not that far.

958
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,560
My goodness. Ms. Lv, you mustn't.

959
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:28,600
This...

960
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:29,720
It's heavy.

961
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,370
Why not?

962
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:31,120
Give it to me.

963
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:32,240
I'm fine!

964
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,720
I can even carry Shen Qing on my back.

965
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,330
This is nothing to me.

966
00:35:35,688 --> 00:35:36,800
- My goodness.
- Be careful.

967
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:38,200
Wait!

968
00:35:38,866 --> 00:35:40,720
Is there a better alternative
for this set?

969
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,810
This doesn't look as good as the cover.

970
00:35:42,866 --> 00:35:43,844
It doesn't look good?

971
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,010
What about this?

972
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,160
This is fine.

973
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:46,930
And this.

974
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,330
Don't do that. Yeah.

975
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,450
288.

976
00:35:49,644 --> 00:35:50,600
You can do it.

977
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:56,680
Take care.

978
00:36:03,577 --> 00:36:04,140
(Duoduolele)

979
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,333
(Select product: Women's costume,
one-size-fits-all)

980
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,080
Fluff up your skirt.

981
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,640
Excellent.

982
00:36:21,688 --> 00:36:23,280
She looks like
one of the Seven Goddesses.

983
00:36:23,288 --> 00:36:25,190
I think this is a great dress
for the dance we do.

984
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:26,530
By the way,

985
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:29,010
Lina, give me 12 of these.

986
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:29,930
Alright.

987
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:30,450
I need them.

988
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,660
Where will the contest be held?

989
00:36:31,666 --> 00:36:33,080
Hanzhong Gate Square. We're the host.

990
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,850
What a splendid opportunity.

991
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:35,240
Indeed.

992
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,490
Everything will surely be fine.

993
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,810
Yeah. Send me the sizes after this.

994
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:39,200
Alright.

995
00:36:39,244 --> 00:36:39,720
One more.

996
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,450
Two more pictures.

997
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,380
- Should I put my hand on my waist?
- Yeah.

998
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,280
Okay.

999
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,560
Mom, hold the pose.

1000
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,240
Mind your expression.

1001
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,890
When you smile,
you shouldn't show your teeth.

1002
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,370
That's right.

1003
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,370
A smile.

1004
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,890
Hurry up. I'm getting numb.

1005
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:57,640
Hurry up.

1006
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,733
I'll be done in a second.

1007
00:36:59,280 --> 00:36:59,720
Liu Debao.

1008
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,280
Liu Debao!

1009
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:01,844
What's wrong?

1010
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:02,970
Look at my hair.

1011
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,490
How can I take a photo in this state?

1012
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,050
Just look at me.

1013
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,490
My wrinkles are exposed because of you.

1014
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,280
You shouldn't blame
the hair dryer for this.

1015
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:11,930
Liu Debao.

1016
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,560
What are you up to?

1017
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:14,370
Mom.

1018
00:37:18,088 --> 00:37:18,711
We're done.

1019
00:37:18,711 --> 00:37:19,680
Ms. Lv.

1020
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,890
- It's your turn.
- Yeah.

1021
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,560
Come, Ms. Lv.

1022
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:24,555
I don't know how to do poses.

1023
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:26,450
Very good.

1024
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,160
Very dashing.

1025
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:29,760
Good.

1026
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,050
One more pose.

1027
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:32,560
Cool.

1028
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:33,760
Alright. We're done.

1029
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:34,490
Dad.

1030
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:36,370
Dad, it's your turn.

1031
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:37,810
This...

1032
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,680
I can't buckle it.

1033
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,879
- Look at it.
- In-law, look.

1034
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,350
- It's a little...
- It's out of thread.

1035
00:37:42,355 --> 00:37:44,020
- It's too low. I'll alter it later.
- Yeah.

1036
00:37:44,022 --> 00:37:45,640
You have to monitor the quality.

1037
00:37:45,688 --> 00:37:46,280
You're right.

1038
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:46,850
Mr. Shen.

1039
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:47,970
Look at me.

1040
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,640
I can pretend to be a cowboy, right?

1041
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,010
You don't need to. You are a cowboy.

1042
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:54,760
You're muscular
and have broad shoulders.

1043
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,240
Alright.

1044
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,010
It's my turn.

1045
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,050
Let's take a photo together.

1046
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,450
Okay.

1047
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:02,600
Let's take a photo.

1048
00:38:02,644 --> 00:38:03,777
You guys should stand closer.

1049
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:05,400
Dad, your expression is too serious.

1050
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,080
Ms. Lv is so cool.

1051
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,850
Dad, you should smile a little.

1052
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,330
Here. Very good.

1053
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:14,810
Alright.

1054
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,010
Shen Qing is back.

1055
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,120
Hurry. Shen Qing is back.

1056
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,720
Come.

1057
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,450
Get him an outfit.

1058
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:20,377
We were waiting for you.

1059
00:38:20,377 --> 00:38:20,866
For what?

1060
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:21,444
Shen Qing,

1061
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:23,810
try on this set of Hanfu for me.

1062
00:38:24,044 --> 00:38:25,510
- Try this.
- Take off your clothes.

1063
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,177
That's right.

1064
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:26,755
What is this?

1065
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:27,760
Hanfu.

1066
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,050
- Yeah, Hanfu.
- Come on.

1067
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:30,530
Go.

1068
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,240
That's right.

1069
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:32,680
That looks nice.

1070
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,240
They have long sleeves.

1071
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,410
Where's mine?

1072
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,280
My goodness.

1073
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,240
What is this?

1074
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,930
He's so handsome.

1075
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,530
He's blushing.

1076
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,777
He's handsome and talented.

1077
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:43,930
Very good.

1078
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,080
Make way!

1079
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,810
Make way!

1080
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,970
Make way!

1081
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:56,890
Mrs. Liu.

1082
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,330
Ms. Lv!

1083
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,280
What is that?

1084
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,370
We bought a vacuum cleaner.

1085
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:02,050
Vacuum cleaner?

1086
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,850
Shen has one, right?

1087
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,720
Theirs is too small.
I don't really like it.

1088
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,010
I need a bigger one.

1089
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,490
Alright. This is very durable.

1090
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,200
Listen.

1091
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,050
This won't break down
even after ten years.

1092
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:14,080
Ten years?

1093
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,810
Of course.

1094
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,755
I'll make a move first.

1095
00:39:15,777 --> 00:39:16,810
- Let me carry it.
- Okay.

1096
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:17,200
No!

1097
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:18,330
Lv!

1098
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,760
Lina.

1099
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,120
Mom.

1100
00:39:26,688 --> 00:39:28,490
Liu, keep the vegetables
in the refrigerator.

1101
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:28,850
Alright.

1102
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:32,200
Listen.

1103
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:35,050
Ms. Lv Yuan bought
a giant vacuum cleaner.

1104
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,680
It was gigantic.

1105
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,850
We have one at home.

1106
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:40,200
I bought it on 11 November.

1107
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,680
She said it was too small.

1108
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,160
She liked the bigger ones better.

1109
00:39:43,288 --> 00:39:44,622
It's not small for us.

1110
00:39:44,911 --> 00:39:46,080
You can give it to us, then.

1111
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,088
We'll take it back home.

1112
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,890
Alright. I'll bring it here later.

1113
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:50,530
Lv Yuan.

1114
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,810
Ms. Lv Yuan is truly exceptional.

1115
00:39:53,355 --> 00:39:54,160
She's really good.

1116
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,450
She's healthy and
she can do labor chores.

1117
00:39:56,555 --> 00:39:58,330
The thing is,
she spends money on the family.

1118
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,490
Mom, don't spout nonsense.

1119
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,370
Her daughter will
pick her up next Friday.

1120
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,160
That won't happen.

1121
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,720
She even brought her own cleaning tools.

1122
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,890
It's a battle of attrition.

1123
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,240
It'll last at least ten years.

1124
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,450
How are they even related?

1125
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:19,010
That's nonsense.

1126
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,600
My father-in-law has no feelings

1127
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,490
for Ms. Lv at all.

1128
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,680
Yeah.

1129
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,760
Do you have nothing else to talk about?

1130
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:28,890
Hurry.

1131
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,600
Remember to pay your daughter
for the costumes.

1132
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,600
I forgot about it.

1133
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,050
Ten dresses, right?

1134
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,280
12 dresses.

1135
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,160
The total is 1,200 yuan.

1136
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,410
Count them yourself.

1137
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,010
No one uses cash nowadays.

1138
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,810
I went to the bank
just to withdraw cash for you.

1139
00:40:48,977 --> 00:40:50,050
Do you know what it means?

1140
00:40:50,177 --> 00:40:52,760
This is a great start.
It's a sign of good luck and prosperity.

1141
00:40:53,066 --> 00:40:54,955
Mom, you do have a lot
of tricks up your sleeves.

1142
00:40:54,977 --> 00:40:55,400
Thanks.

1143
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:56,930
Don't mention it.

1144
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:00,120
How much money have you invested

1145
00:41:00,488 --> 00:41:01,720
in this company of yours?

1146
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:02,680
It's new.

1147
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,560
Only tens of thousands.

1148
00:41:05,622 --> 00:41:06,644
If so, you...

1149
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:09,490
I usually make an order
after receiving the deposit.

1150
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:10,555
It's not that risky.

1151
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,450
That's good.

1152
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:13,240
But

1153
00:41:13,422 --> 00:41:15,630
how much can you make
from selling one piece of clothing?

1154
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,530
Why are you so nosy?

1155
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,890
That's confidential, you know?

1156
00:41:19,222 --> 00:41:20,560
Lina, if you lack an assistant,

1157
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:21,760
you can recruit her.

1158
00:41:22,222 --> 00:41:23,240
What do you mean by that?

1159
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,080
You want me to work for my daughter

1160
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,720
while you can slack off?

1161
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:28,760
Lina.

1162
00:41:28,844 --> 00:41:30,679
Tell me when you're done
with the costumes.

1163
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,190
I'll tell your father to collect them.

1164
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:32,640
Okay?

1165
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,240
If so, I have to give Dad a wage.

1166
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:35,720
Dear daughter!

1167
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,410
I got you a business deal, you know?

1168
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,850
Shouldn't you pay me as well?

1169
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,280
Fine. You can take all of my money.

1170
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,370
That's more like it.

1171
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:45,280
My goodness.

1172
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,160
Lina,

1173
00:41:46,488 --> 00:41:48,330
you can seek my help
when you're overwhelmed.

1174
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,930
Your mother and I
are free labor workers.

1175
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:51,850
Got it.

1176
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,760
Dad, you should sit down and rest.

1177
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,530
I'll bring the vacuum cleaner here.

1178
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:55,970
Alright.

1179
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,560
Ms. Lv,

1180
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,777
my mother said
you bought a new vacuum cleaner.

1181
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,850
Are you using it already?

1182
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:11,810
Yeah.

1183
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,850
Its suction is quite strong, huh?

1184
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:15,560
Yeah.

1185
00:42:16,111 --> 00:42:17,530
If so, I'll give the previous one

1186
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,810
to my mother, then.

1187
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,120
Go ahead.

1188
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:20,560
Okay.

1189
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,810
It's in the storeroom.

1190
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:22,200
Got it.

1191
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:42,930
Lina.

1192
00:42:45,511 --> 00:42:46,755
Here's your hair clip.

1193
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:47,850
It's not mine.

1194
00:42:48,622 --> 00:42:49,777
Who does it belong to, then?

1195
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,560
Professor Shen,
you're so good with your hands.

1196
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:58,490
I think it's Shen Dai's.

1197
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:02,240
Ms. Lv, please continue.
I'll make a move first.

1198
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:02,930
