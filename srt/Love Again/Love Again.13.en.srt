00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,110
=Episode 13=

3
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,149
It's already time.

4
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,130
Should be here soon.

5
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,389
There he comes.

6
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,060
Look.

7
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,810
Speak of the man.

8
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,499
- Zhang.
- Good morning, Mr. Shen.

9
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,280
- Good work.
- Were you waiting for your letter?

10
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,410
No, not really.

11
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,850
Let's see
if there's a letter for you today.

12
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,250
Is there?

13
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,029
Sorry. No, sir.

14
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,010
All for the neighborhood.

15
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,219
All for the neighborhood.

16
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:00,940
All right.

17
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,180
Just leave them inside the guardhouse.

18
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:03,709
Thanks.

19
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,660
Someone will handle them.

20
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,060
Ms. Baoqin!

21
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,059
Here to cook for Lina again?

22
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,029
Yes.

23
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,709
Take care.

24
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,869
- I will.
- I'm heading back.

25
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,500
All right. Goodbye.

26
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,500
All right.

27
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,220
Good morning, ma'am!

28
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,850
Good morning!

29
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,659
I saw

30
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,219
a small goods store having a sale

31
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:26,779
over there!

32
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,200
A sale?

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,979
They were announcing it
on a loudspeaker! Hurry!

34
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:30,059
Really? Chat another time!

35
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,109
I have to check it out!

36
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,939
Take it easy, ma'am!

37
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,090
Will do!

38
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,130
How long is your mother
going to stay here?

39
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,500
What's that supposed to mean?

40
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,989
She wouldn't sleep last night.

41
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,220
Kept watching me work.

42
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,740
She even asked about my dad.

43
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,690
She wanted to set him up with someone.

44
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,339
I think

45
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,380
the name was Peng-something.

46
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,629
Give me a break.

47
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,659
Peng Yulan.

48
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,250
She's my mom's ex-colleague.

49
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,210
She's just concerned about your dad.

50
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,860
Well, I thank your mother
for her concern on his behalf.

51
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,650
Can we ask her to stop worrying so much?

52
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,210
I couldn't even

53
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,100
finish the financial statement.

54
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,380
How can you blame my mother

55
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,650
for that?

56
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,890
Are you going to blame her

57
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,330
if you can't get
your company listed too?

58
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,069
She came to look after
her injured daughter.

59
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,219
Can't you give her some grace?

60
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,770
Be a better son-in-law.

61
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,380
I've been taking care
of this household for over 20 years.

62
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,010
Have I ever complained?

63
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,589
Well, you're complaining right now,

64
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,779
aren't you?

65
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,570
I do the chores. Do you?

66
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,899
If you don't manage the house,
you don't get to complain.

67
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,620
You're eating my mom's cooking.
Show some respect.

68
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,130
Where's your gratitude?

69
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,620
I have it right here. I'm grateful.

70
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,219
She can stay for as long as she wants.

71
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,300
She can stay for 20 years.

72
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,200
You think I like
having her here all the time?

73
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,099
I wouldn't need her here

74
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,770
if you were more reliable.

75
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,859
Go cut up an orange.

76
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,100
Duole likes oranges.

77
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,540
For Duole?

78
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,330
Mom.

79
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,010
Where are my football socks?

80
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,420
I put them in the shoebox for you.

81
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,130
We're having egg pancakes?

82
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,540
Granny's the best.

83
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,740
Your granny got up early
and started busying herself.

84
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,500
She went out to buy groceries.

85
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,420
Guess all that flattery was for nothing.

86
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,189
Here, Duole, have an orange.

87
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,600
What else do you need me to do?

88
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,629
Here, Mom.

89
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,570
Have a slice of orange.

90
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,380
See?

91
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,650
Only my son and my mom

92
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,690
spoil me in this house.

93
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,100
Have some milk.

94
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:37,980
Here.

95
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,269
He's almost as tall as I am.

96
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,010
He can pour his own milk.

97
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,219
Even if he grows
as tall as a utility pole,

98
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,339
he's still my son.

99
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:44,949
Right, Duole?

100
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,740
That's right.

101
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,829
My hand's still healing.

102
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,010
I asked you to help blow-dry my hair,
and you wouldn't.

103
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,749
But look at your dad.

104
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,770
He was massaging Ms. Lian's shoulders
and even blow-drying her hair.

105
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,300
You're not even as considerate
as a 70-year-old man.

106
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:02,330
Well, Ms. Lian also gave Dad
foot baths and massages.

107
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,130
Well, I gave you a son!

108
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,300
What's so funny?

109
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,180
Everybody's up and having breakfast.

110
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:12,539
Mom.

111
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,760
Don't get up.

112
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,659
- Don't worry about me.
- Let me help you.

113
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,099
- Just leave them there.
- All right.

114
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,060
I'll be right over.

115
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,540
I bought

116
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,450
a ton of things today.

117
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,940
Spare ribs, oxtail.

118
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,300
All of Duole's favorites.

119
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,380
Le.

120
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,339
Isn't it great that I'm here?

121
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,450
Yes!

122
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,130
Granny,
you should just live here with us.

123
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,180
All right. I'll stay.

124
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,690
She's serious.

125
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:42,940
Duole,

126
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,810
your hair is growing back.

127
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,860
Tonight, I'll take you to get a trim.

128
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,219
Yes. The weather's getting hot.

129
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,810
Might as well shave it all off.

130
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,860
Save some money.

131
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,440
I'm going to be late for school.
I have to go.

132
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:58,899
Take care.

133
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,879
- Take care.
- Easy there.

134
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,589
- Did you finish your breakfast?
- Yes.

135
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,690
All right. Be careful.

136
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,829
Bye, Granny!

137
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,300
Goodbye.

138
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,450
Slow down.
Put your shoes on properly first.

139
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,859
Take it easy, Duole. Slow down.

140
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,570
Right.

141
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,570
Shen Qing.

142
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,690
Do take to heart

143
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,890
what I told you last night.

144
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,219
You're your father's son.

145
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,330
You have to help your dad

146
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,770
steer his ship properly.

147
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,450
Got it.

148
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,250
I need to send an email.

149
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,540
- Have breakfast, Mom.
- Oh, all right.

150
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,269
Mom,

151
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,860
what did you tell Shen Qing last night?

152
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,299
I...

153
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,189
You can be

154
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,330
quite tactless when you speak.

155
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,029
Vixens spout all the honeyed words.

156
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,029
Honest folk like us...

157
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:47,979
Shush.

158
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,979
We tell it like it is.

159
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,250
Stop talking.

160
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,810
Zhuoran!

161
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,300
I'm coming in!

162
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,010
Baoqin.

163
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,930
Peng Yulan.

164
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,340
I'm at your old prince charming's place.

165
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,269
Listen.

166
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,179
He collects stamps too.

167
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,010
Check it out.

168
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,410
Such a cultured man.

169
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,380
Of course.

170
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,269
Who do you think Zhuoran is?

171
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,050
He's a university professor.

172
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,349
Listen to me, Peng Yulan.

173
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,469
A house is not a home without a woman.

174
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,580
Look at this place.

175
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,220
Dirty, dirty, dirty.

176
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,130
All right. I won't keep you any longer.

177
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,650
I have to mop the floor.

178
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,380
Baoqin, you have a lot on your hands.

179
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,460
You have to help out with a lot.

180
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,770
Peng Yulan, you just reminded me.

181
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,740
Here's what we'll do.

182
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,410
Stay on standby.

183
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,620
Be ready anytime I call.

184
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:52,899
You're home.

185
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,700
Baoqin...

186
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,820
It's you.

187
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,130
Morning.

188
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,500
It's not morning anymore.

189
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,389
I bought you some fresh liver.

190
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,700
It's in the fridge.

191
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,899
Oh, thank you.

192
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,299
Your floor was filthy,
so I figured I'd wipe it for you.

193
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,220
Put your feet up and change
into your slippers.

194
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:08,980
Don't move

195
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,819
while

196
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,170
I mop the floor.

197
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,469
You can move after the floor dries.

198
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,059
All right?

199
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,250
Feet up, please.

200
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:19,629
Yes.

201
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:20,749
That's good.

202
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,200
Let me wipe that spot for you.

203
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,100
I saw a fan on the desk.

204
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,460
The painting on it is really well done.
Who painted it?

205
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,930
A friend of mine.

206
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,100
I know who it is.

207
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,380
You do?

208
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,010
Du Liniang.

209
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,989
Feet up.

210
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,170
Yes.

211
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,620
That is Du Liniang.

212
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,899
Judging by the delicate brushwork,

213
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,299
it's obviously done by a woman.

214
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,580
It's a woman, right?

215
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,170
Yes.

216
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,860
Feet up.

217
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,899
I'll be done in no time.

218
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,469
Here.

219
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,629
Take your shoes off.
Let me see if the soles are dirty.

220
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,539
- Let me clean them for you.
- It's all right...

221
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:03,989
Zhuoran.

222
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,290
This is fine.

223
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,299
Wait, Zhuoran...

224
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,539
- Your shoes...
- You carry on.

225
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,100
I'm not done yet.

226
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,250
Lina.

227
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:14,939
Dad.

228
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,700
Lina.

229
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,419
Your mom came to my place

230
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,250
early in the morning to clean the floor.

231
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,220
And she rummaged through everything...

232
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,749
You need to talk to her.

233
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,220
This is inappropriate.

234
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,179
My mom just has to stay busy.

235
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:26,629
You see...

236
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,629
My hand got burned, Dad.

237
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,290
My mom came over
to help me out with some chores.

238
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,860
You burned your hand?

239
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,579
And pretty badly, too.

240
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,469
When did that happen?

241
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,860
Where did you get burned?

242
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,410
At your place.

243
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,170
At my place?

244
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,050
I wasn't aware of this.

245
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,349
Do you need to go to the hospital?

246
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,290
It looks bad.

247
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,469
Did you put anything on it for the burn?
You can't just leave it like that.

248
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,939
I'm fine. Don't worry about it, Dad.

249
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,770
Go back and enjoy your opera. I'm fine.

250
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,700
But I...

251
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:57,109
Forget about the opera.

252
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,980
Your mother's louder than any opera.

253
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,460
She scares me.

254
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,659
My mom's not a tiger.
Why are you guys so afraid of her?

255
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,050
It's not about that.

256
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:08,740
She...

257
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,650
Never mind...

258
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,410
Almost forgot what I came for.

259
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,029
Your mother made me keep my feet up
the entire time she mopped.

260
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,340
She said my shoes' soles are dirty.

261
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,059
Do you have a cloth
or something I can use?

262
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,860
Oh, yes. I'll get it for you.

263
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,410
My phone's ringing!

264
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,100
Don't run!

265
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,539
Don't run! The floor's slippery!

266
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,269
- I...
- The old man that lives across from us

267
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,130
- had a fall and was paralyzed!
- Hello?

268
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,290
Please leave.

269
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,890
Hello?

270
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,010
Ms. Nie?

271
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,130
I got your postcard.

272
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,500
I lost

273
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,860
the game.

274
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,530
I went to the gatehouse
early this morning.

275
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,349
There wasn't any mail for me,

276
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,740
so I knew you must've lost.

277
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,650
Did you read it?

278
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,460
"Days were slower in the past.

279
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,620
Carriage, horse, and mail

280
00:12:24,621 --> 00:12:25,620
did not reach fast.

281
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,500
You needed a lifetime

282
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,460
just to love the one who is right."

283
00:12:31,111 --> 00:12:33,980
(Days were slower in the past.
Carriage, horse, and mail did not reach fast.)

284
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,200
(You needed a lifetime
just to love the one who is right.)

285
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,930
I borrowed some lines
from Mu Xin's poem.

286
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,700
Ms. Nie, please hold.

287
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,980
Someone's at the door.

288
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,149
I need to check.

289
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,980
I'll be right back. Don't hang up.

290
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,380
Mr. Shen.

291
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,779
- Coming! Sun.
- Mr. Shen. Postcard for you.

292
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,079
Thank you.

293
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,000
I know you were waiting,
so I brought it to you myself.

294
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,930
You came at the right time. Thank you!

295
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,310
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Can't talk! Thank you!

296
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,620
Ms. Nie!

297
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,700
I got your postcard!

298
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,380
It's lovely.

299
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,460
"The lock was fine in the past.

300
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,930
The key was exquisite and fit.

301
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,620
You locked it,

302
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,500
and he understood."

303
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,410
I never

304
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,629
expected us to borrow

305
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,620
different stanzas of the same poem.

306
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,170
Mr. Zhuoran,

307
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,220
we live on opposite ends of the city.

308
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,290
Different professions.

309
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,980
Different fields.

310
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,580
Even different personalities.

311
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,740
We were like two parallel lines,

312
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,980
but thanks

313
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,890
to general relativity,

314
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,250
space and time curved,

315
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,460
and we

316
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,250
intersected.

317
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,980
It would appear fate is predetermined.

318
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,980
You and I were meant to meet.

319
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,340
General relativity.

320
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,380
I get it.

321
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,460
Ms. Nie,

322
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,010
I understand everything now.

323
00:14:38,582 --> 00:14:41,880
(Days were slower in the past. You needed
a lifetime just to love the one who is right.)

324
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,199
(The lock was fine in the past.
The key was exquisite and fit.)

325
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:45,630
(You locked it, and he understood.)

326
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,509
Hey!

327
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,869
I was using the toilet!

328
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,469
My mom was right.

329
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,100
That phone's your real wife.

330
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,740
What are you looking for?

331
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,890
It's your dad, Shen Qing.

332
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,059
I burned my hand
shutting off the stove for him,

333
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,349
and he didn't even notice!

334
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,930
He even asked me where I got burned!

335
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,899
You'd at least notice if a working animal

336
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,890
on your farm got injured!

337
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,029
Ignoring something
and being completely unaware

338
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,410
are two different things.

339
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,539
My dad is old.

340
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,299
He's slow to react.

341
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,580
He genuinely didn't know.

342
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,460
Slow to react?

343
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,939
He went all the way to Nanhu Park
to dig up lotus root mud!

344
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,340
Try digging one up yourself!

345
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,010
The steps there are this high.

346
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,469
Without ten years of training,

347
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,860
there's no way you could climb down.

348
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,410
But your dad did it.

349
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,339
Now I see it clearly.

350
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,029
You and your father
are exactly the same.

351
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,379
Your minds are never on this family.

352
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,260
What nonsense are you talking about?

353
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,509
How am I talking nonsense?

354
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,989
You sit on the toilet all day
playing on your phone.

355
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,579
Your dad? The moment the phone rings,
he runs faster than a rabbit.

356
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:49,450
He did that just now.

357
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,580
Found it.

358
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,029
Close the door!

359
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,260
Enjoy your phone!

360
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,060
Mom.

361
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,909
You're not getting any younger.

362
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,410
Can you take it easy?

363
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,210
Take it easy?

364
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,650
How?

365
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:10,579
All these household chores.

366
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,930
This huge mess to handle.

367
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:14,299
Your father-in-law's situation
on top of that. Right?

368
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,380
If I don't do it, who will?

369
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,620
The moment
I finished cleaning the floor,

370
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,890
your father-in-law stomped all over it.

371
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,669
Then the phone rang.

372
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,269
Whoosh! He practically flew over!

373
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,260
Seriously.

374
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,299
I wonder who called.

375
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,450
Beats me.

376
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,509
Truly.

377
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,709
I think

378
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,210
Peng Yulan needs to step in.

379
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,340
Otherwise, your father-in-law's soul
is going to get snatched away.

380
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,380
Mom.

381
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,890
Thank you, but don't get involved.

382
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,580
Go home, rest, dance.
Wouldn't that be nice?

383
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,949
Go home and dance?

384
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:46,970
Then what about your house?

385
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,099
Who'll mop the floors?

386
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,989
Who'll cook?

387
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,539
Will your whole family

388
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,340
just starve?

389
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,260
We'll figure something out.

390
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,450
We can always

391
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,580
just hire a helper.

392
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,620
A helper.

393
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,930
We can hire Peng Yulan.

394
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,029
You wanted me to make my signature dish,

395
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,930
right?

396
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,059
No problem.

397
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,300
We'll just infiltrate

398
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,410
that old man's stomach first.

399
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,229
Got it.

400
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:15,930
Look!

401
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,340
Pork knuckles!

402
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,170
Don't worry.

403
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:21,410
Owner.

404
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,709
Give me a big bag.

405
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,539
I'm buying in bulk.

406
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,300
All right.

407
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,380
It's raining.

408
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,490
- Mom.
- This rain...

409
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,600
- You're back. It's raining.
- It's raining cats and dogs!

410
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,690
It's pouring!

411
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,619
Hurry!

412
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,339
The weather was fine when I went out.

413
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,059
Dry your hair.

414
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,859
No, no, no.

415
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,620
- I have to change my shoes first.
- Here.

416
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,780
This is heavy. What's in here?

417
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,100
Braised pork knuckles?

418
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,339
It smells wonderful.

419
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,060
Don't touch it!

420
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,260
Why?

421
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,490
Peng Yulan made this
for your father-in-law.

422
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,909
I'm the one with the wounded hand!

423
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,100
Why does my father-in-law
get a special meal?

424
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,690
Infiltrate,

425
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,620
get it?

426
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:08,819
No.

427
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,539
All I know is that

428
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,650
my father-in-law spends all day
making phone calls and writing letters.

429
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,029
His soul is probably bewitched
by some fairy.

430
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,379
He's already detached
from the mortal realm.

431
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,410
Tell Ms. Peng to call it quits.

432
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,100
Can letters fill a stomach?

433
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,730
Everyone's got to eat.

434
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,780
That means Ms. Peng still has a chance.

435
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:30,590
Enough chit-chat. I have to bring
this over to your father-in-law.

436
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,139
Don't stop by his place too often.

437
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,539
- My father-in-law likes his peace and quiet.
- I know!

438
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,410
Mom!

439
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,170
Mom!

440
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,490
Zhuoran!

441
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,690
Zhuoran!

442
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,650
I'm here.

443
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,269
Oh, you're eating! Perfect timing!

444
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,029
You're here, Baoqin.

445
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,820
I brought you an extra dish.

446
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,730
Another?

447
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,099
Thank you.

448
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,890
Not at all.

449
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,749
I can't take credit for this.

450
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,930
Look.

451
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,540
Peng Yulan made this.

452
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,540
She insisted I bring some for you.

453
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,620
Iberian pork.

454
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,410
Tastes amazing!

455
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,300
Smells good.

456
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,210
Peng Yulan?

457
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,260
Who's that?

458
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,170
You met her at the florist's.

459
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,669
- I remember her.
- You remember her.

460
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,949
You brought her here once.

461
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,300
Yes.

462
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,989
Peng Yulan's a capable woman.

463
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,540
Look at her cooking.

464
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,340
It's perfect in color, aroma, and taste!

465
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,099
Lina's here.

466
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:27,730
Dad.

467
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,619
You came at the right time.
There's still some noodle soup in the pot.

468
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,429
Your mom brought over
some pork knuckles.

469
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,339
You should try some too.

470
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,860
I already ate. My mom wouldn't let me
have the pork knuckles.

471
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,780
Look, Zhuoran,

472
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,100
what do you

473
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,210
think

474
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,060
of Peng Yulan?

475
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,580
She's nice.

476
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,709
Very polite.

477
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,619
Yes.

478
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,650
The more you get to know her,
the more you'll like her.

479
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,709
Stop it.

480
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,780
Don't meddle.

481
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,450
You like Huangmei opera now, Zhuoran?

482
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,189
Mom, my father-in-law is currently
obsessed with Kunqu opera.

483
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,469
- Yes.
- I know.

484
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,780
This is Kunqu.

485
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,780
Kunqu, traditional opera, same thing.

486
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,730
Well, that's right too.

487
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,450
- Your mom knows her stuff.
- Yes.

488
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,970
Of course.

489
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,059
Oh, right. Zhuoran.

490
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,970
Do you know there's a theater troupe

491
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,020
at Nanhu Park?

492
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,100
There's a troupe at Nanhu Park?

493
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,620
Every day,

494
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,189
there's a small pavilion

495
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,410
in the bamboo grove

496
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,579
where people

497
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,469
sing opera.

498
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,269
It's always lively.

499
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,340
I'll take you there someday
when you're free.

500
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,130
I'm free right now!

501
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:36,269
Let's go!

502
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,989
You should finish your food first...

503
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,669
I'm finished.

504
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,690
Have some of Peng Yulan's cooking.

505
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,139
I'm done.

506
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,299
You're done? Wait. Listen.

507
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,269
- Look outside. It's raining.
- Dad. It's raining. You should stay inside.

508
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,450
It's just a little drizzle.
It won't stop us.

509
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,099
But...

510
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,340
Right now?

511
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,540
Right now.

512
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,429
Listen.

513
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,450
I'm really into opera these days.

514
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,989
It's raining!

515
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,650
But...

516
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,170
What's gotten into him?

517
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,059
Is it the fairy?

518
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,509
Is the fairy at Nanhu Park?

519
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,429
Maybe.

520
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,300
My goodness!

521
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,299
- Zhuoran! Wait for me!
- Mom!

522
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:06,709
I'm off!

523
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,580
- I'm coming with you!
- Bring an umbrella!

524
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,579
That way. Over there.

525
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,450
Right there.

526
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,780
Slow down.

527
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,210
I hear it.

528
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,949
Yes.

529
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,819
Right behind the bamboo forest.

530
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,469
This way?

531
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,650
Yes. Behind the bamboo forest.

532
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,380
Slow down!

533
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,819
Zhuoran!

534
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,380
Slow down!

535
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,100
Zhuoran?

536
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,780
Zhuoran?

537
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,730
Where is he?

538
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,300
Zhuoran!

539
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,989
What are you doing there?

540
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:33,579
Don't shush me!

541
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,540
Come up here! It's raining!

542
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,170
I want to record

543
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,020
the performance coming through
the bamboo forest.

544
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,260
Through the...

545
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,730
Your husband knows his stuff.

546
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,820
What? My husband?

547
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,059
He's not my husband.

548
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,380
If he were my husband...

549
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,890
Gosh, this man...

550
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,260
If he were my husband,
I'd break his legs.

551
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,300
Crazy man!

552
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,130
Ms. Nie.

553
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,130
Of course, I knew it was you.

554
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,820
You're always on Beijing time.

555
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,820
I always call at the exact same time.

556
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,930
How could I be late?

557
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,450
Guess

558
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,170
where I went today?

559
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,450
I went to Nanhu Park to listen to opera.

560
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,820
Scholars shouldn't confine themselves
to academia alone.

561
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,580
Folk Kunqu carries

562
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,580
its own unique charm.

563
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,060
Would you like to hear it?

564
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,170
I knew it.

565
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,730
I recorded it for you.

566
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,299
Give me a second.

567
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,540
I'll play it for you.

568
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,210
You're back.

569
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,340
I'm back.

570
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,410
Listen to this.

571
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,580
Your father-in-law.

572
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,020
Your father-in-law is out of his mind!

573
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,060
He ran out into the rain

574
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,580
just to record some opera!

575
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,749
Record?

576
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,890
Yes!

577
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:21,170
Dragging mud with his every step.

578
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,020
Where is he?

579
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,059
He left.

580
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,490
Ran off in a flash.

581
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,930
As if the fairy fed him an elixir.

582
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,269
He came back for his call.

583
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,130
Every day at exactly 3 PM.

584
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,580
I knew it...

585
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,380
Mom.

586
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,059
No wonder...

587
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,060
Dry your hair.

588
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,340
I was wondering why he ran off so fast.

589
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,100
Like he'd been injected with adrenaline.

590
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,859
Peng Yulan put in so much effort

591
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,170
to prepare these pork knuckles,

592
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,730
but she still lost
to a phone call from that fairy.

593
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,029
I just don't get men.

594
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,709
Men

595
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,690
are so easily obsessed.

596
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:03,859
Mom, this is different.

597
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,860
How?

598
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,620
Either way,
obsessions make you lose your appetite.

599
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,730
Even pork knuckles don't tempt him.

600
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,779
I think this is a good thing.

601
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,859
Look at my father-in-law.

602
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,060
Now he's listening to opera,
writing letters...

603
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,730
He's young again.

604
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,450
Full of energy.

605
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,130
"Full of energy"?

606
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,509
That's not energy.

607
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,780
That's being possessed.

608
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,260
Peng Yulan...

609
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,139
Peng Yulan will be heartbroken again.

610
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:29,860
I mean,

611
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,509
she managed to outlast Ms. Lian,

612
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,860
and now another fairy has appeared.

613
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,860
She had her hopes up, too.

614
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,229
I don't even know
how to break it to her.

615
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,380
With things like this,

616
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,989
the sooner you tell her,

617
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,130
the better.

618
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,100
You're right.

619
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,139
Hesitation only

620
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,490
makes things worse.

621
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:49,970
All right.

622
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,410
I'll make a trip home.

623
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,669
Don't bother coming back.

624
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,170
My hand is almost healed anyway.

625
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:55,509
What?

626
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,620
Are you kicking me out?

627
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,539
I've been staying here every day,
doing chores and cooking for you.

628
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,619
You've had it easy.

629
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,410
Don't you enjoy having me here?

630
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,450
But what about Dad?

631
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:09,130
He doesn't know how to cook.

632
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,269
- He's just making do every day.
- He's fine...

633
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:15,100
Older men are in high demand these days.

634
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,650
My dad has a good temper.

635
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,020
Well...

636
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,620
I'll head back then.

637
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,540
It's raining outside. Be careful.

638
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,690
Got it.

639
00:28:33,582 --> 00:28:35,509
(Chief Operating Officer)

640
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,260
The patent we acquired

641
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,890
can improve the stability
of the M701 targeted drug.

642
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,890
It's also crucial
for the development of M703.

643
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,949
Why can't we launch both together?

644
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,580
Dr. Qin said we can.

645
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,539
Dr. Qin is only responsible for R&D.

646
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,379
He doesn't handle
the market side of things.

647
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,339
Right now,
M701 is in a critical trial phase.

648
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,029
For a blockbuster drug like this,
any delay in launch means

649
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,509
competitors will take market share.

650
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,509
The potential losses
to the company are immeasurable.

651
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:04,039
But M703 is a blockbuster drug too.

652
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:06,080
We have the capability
to develop both simultaneously.

653
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,229
We don't.

654
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,300
We're not short on money.

655
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,060
- We're short on human resources.
- Then hire!

656
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,139
Have HR search worldwide!

657
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,690
Spare no expense.

658
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,580
That still takes time.

659
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,779
How about this?

660
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,650
Ask Ice.

661
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,410
See if the investors

662
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,890
are willing to give M703 more time.

663
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,340
Qing.

664
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,509
Why are you silent?

665
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,859
Can you ask her now?

666
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,620
Right now, at this very moment.

667
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,539
Hurry!

668
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,820
Time waits for no one!

669
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,210
Please?

670
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,340
Over here.

671
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,970
I'm here.

672
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:55,930
It's windy.

673
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,690
Did I pull you away from work?

674
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:02,580
It's fine. I was just about
to come down for a cup of coffee.

675
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,299
About the M703

676
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,450
you mentioned on the phone,

677
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,060
my suggestion is for you

678
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,490
to put together a report first.

679
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,210
Explain the drug's
pharmacology and efficacy,

680
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,669
and why it should be developed

681
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:18,780
alongside M701.

682
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,260
Also,

683
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,619
break the development
into different stages,

684
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,709
detailing the time and budget for each.

685
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,650
So we'll have a basis for judgment,

686
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,490
and our fund can make a quick decision.

687
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:32,650
That's great!
I'll prepare it as soon as I return.

688
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,500
(Li Ya)

689
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,170
You can take that.
I'll go put in our orders.

690
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,490
It's fine.

691
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,490
It's my ex.

692
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,130
Nice ringtone.

693
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,860
Really?

694
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,020
I composed it myself.

695
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,170
I can send it to you.

696
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,780
You compose music too?

697
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,780
Just for fun.

It sounds nice.

711
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,380
What song is that?

712
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,260
Just something I hummed.

713
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,349
Qing! Check out
this trendy shoe polish I bought!

714
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,340
It makes old shoes look brand new.

715
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,259
Stop.

716
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,949
Your hand isn't fully healed yet.

717
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:23,789
It's fine now.

718
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,349
Stop fussing.

719
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,450
Come on, stop.

720
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,780
How is this fussing?

721
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,739
Your dress shoes are all dirty.

722
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,539
People will say your wife is lazy.

723
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,890
Let them say whatever they want.

724
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,970
No one gets to talk about my wife.

725
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,010
No more polishing.

726
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,490
It really works.

727
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,610
Lina.

728
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,340
I'm in the mood for some watermelon.
Let's go buy one together.

729
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,869
Aren't you going for a run today?

730
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:52,660
Not today.

731
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,829
Always come in hot but never last long.

732
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:57,820
I'll get changed.

733
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,890
Wait for me.

734
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,010
Shen Qing.

735
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,610
If I leave this world first,

736
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,909
find another who will shine
your shoes for you.

737
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,619
Don't find someone like the fairy.

738
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,619
You'll outlive me.

739
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,300
You have the longevity gene
in your family.

740
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,860
And if you go first?

741
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,450
Then you find someone
who will dry your hair for you.

742
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,349
I won't bother looking.

743
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,610
Took so long to finally get rid of you.

744
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,389
After a lifetime of work,

745
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:28,220
I should get to rest.

746
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:31,180
You've never been in tune
even when we were in university. Stop singing.

747
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,700
Let's hurry home.

748
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:37,780
What is it?

749
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,780
Listen...

750
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,380
Professor Shen is in love again?

751
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,050
Looks like it.

752
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,530
I can't say for sure.

753
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:55,930
But they only write and call each other.

754
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,930
What's with that?

755
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,140
I don't know either.

756
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,820
Peng Yulan, you...

757
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,970
You should heed my advice.

758
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,869
Maybe you should just

759
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:12,890
let things go

760
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,450
with Zhuoran.

761
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,450
He didn't even take a single bite

762
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,380
of your pork knuckles.

763
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,059
There are plenty of fish in the sea.

764
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,949
I think you'd be better off

765
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,179
finding someone a little younger

766
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,450
than Zhuoran.

767
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:34,530
Someone to dance with you

768
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,180
and all that.

769
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,570
Peng Yulan.

770
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,820
Peng Yulan?

771
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,820
Baoqin.

772
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,820
I'm stubborn.

773
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,220
I like Professor Shen.

774
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,259
If she's enchanting his soul,

775
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,380
then I'll enchant his stomach.

776
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,490
It's a fair competition.

777
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,450
Peng Yulan...

778
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,989
I...

779
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,389
I'm seeing you in a new light!

780
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:08,570
You've got my respect.

781
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,700
You've got it.

782
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,300
If that's the case,

783
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,860
then we can't be subtle anymore.

784
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:17,610
When it's time to act,

785
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,010
we act!

786
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,740
This place is filthy.

787
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,349
That aside,

788
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,179
you...

789
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,989
You're wasting your nightgown.

790
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:05,139
You should unbutton a few more.
Don't be shy.

791
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,699
You need to show more skin.

792
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,619
- It's fine...
- Show some more skin. More!

793
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,869
This is fine... Enough...

794
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,340
Please!

795
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,909
Stop teasing me!

796
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:15,340
Act natural.

797
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,340
Zhuoran.

798
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,340
Look who's here!

799
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,450
Peng.

800
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,029
Professor Shen.

801
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:24,930
Hello.

802
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,010
Nice to see you.

803
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,140
How can you let a guest...

804
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,989
Here's the thing.

805
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,469
I bought a big fish head today

806
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,139
and I wanted to make it for lunch.

807
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,389
But I don't know

808
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,579
how to prepare it,

809
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,219
so I invited Peng Yulan over.

810
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,349
She's such a diligent homemaker.

811
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,219
A virtuous woman.

812
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:41,700
The moment she saw the floor,
she just started cleaning it.

813
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,139
Thank you.

814
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,099
Please sit down.

815
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,179
It's all right.

816
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,660
I like being busy.

817
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:48,090
She's so diligent.

818
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,660
Look how clean it is now.

819
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,389
My shoes are dirty.

820
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:56,440
I better not step in. I'll read the newspaper
while I wait in the other house.

821
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,530
Wait! Zhuoran!

822
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,179
You don't have to do that.

823
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,890
Peng Yulan cleaned all the soles too.

824
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,700
Yes, all of them.

825
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,699
Step however you want.

826
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,309
- Come in.
- All right.

827
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:11,259
Please have a seat, Professor.

828
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,139
Please don't.

829
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,209
I live here.

830
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:15,129
- Let me pour you some water.
- Don't mind me.

831
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:17,180
- Let me get you some water.
- Don't have to do that.

832
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:20,869
I'll get that.

833
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:21,530
I...

834
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,860
Professor Shen! Are you...

835
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,450
Hello?

836
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,740
Gas company?

837
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,389
- Wrong number!
- Are you all right?

838
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,389
This isn't a gas company.

839
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,869
- Are you all right?
- Sit down!

840
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:34,659
Easy, easy.

841
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,909
Zhuoran, slowly now.

842
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,700
Easy there.

843
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:39,220
Check his leg.

844
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,219
How is it?

845
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,300
Let's see it.

846
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:44,949
It's swollen!

847
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,570
There's bruising!

848
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,949
I told you to slow down.

849
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,949
What's the rush?

850
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,029
You're too old for this.

851
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,610
You need to ice this.

852
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,010
Do you have any ice?

853
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,789
In the freezer.

854
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,490
- It's in the fridge.
- Let's go.

855
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,410
Quickly!

856
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:01,530
Here.

857
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,220
Got the ice.

858
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,140
Here's the ice.

859
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,570
Let me see that.

860
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,259
How's that? Too cold?

861
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,469
Wrap it in a towel.

862
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,820
Right, the towel.

863
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,530
That's better.

864
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:13,860
Thank you.

865
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:14,829
Thank you, Peng.

866
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:15,780
Better?

867
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,530
Are we sure this is fine?

868
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,139
Maybe he should

869
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,820
get this checked at the hospital.

870
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,179
Get an X-ray

871
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,739
just in case.

872
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,380
To be sure.

873
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:26,570
You have money on your medical card.

874
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:28,410
It's just a bump.

875
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,789
I just need to ice it.

876
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,309
Don't take this

877
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,509
so lightly!

878
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,699
The old man that lives across
from us fell the other day.

879
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,440
He thought he was fine too.
He found himself paralyzed the next day.

880
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:42,250
Getting to the hospital
could be a hassle too.

881
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,309
Let's leave a cold compress on it
and see what happens.

882
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,890
Right. Let's do that.

883
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,970
Fine.

884
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,509
You won't listen to me,
but you'll listen to Peng Yulan.

885
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,450
Oh, you...

886
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,260
Does it still hurt?

887
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,579
No, I feel much better now.

888
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,700
Thank you, Peng.

889
00:39:59,100 --> 00:39:59,989
Don't mention it.

890
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,700
You seem experienced, Peng.

891
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,539
Were you a doctor?

892
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,780
No.

893
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,300
I couldn't possibly be a doctor.

894
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,989
My grandson does roller skating.

895
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,789
He's always getting bumps and bruises.

896
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:13,410
So I know learned how to handle this.

897
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,179
For swelling,

898
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,259
ice packs work best.

899
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,140
You're right.

900
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,570
Also helps with the pain.

901
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,860
You learned through experience.

902
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,610
How old is your grandson?

903
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,820
He's in kindergarten.

904
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,820
He's as mischievous as a little monkey.

905
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:33,219
Duole was the same at that age.

906
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,029
Is that so?

907
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:36,340
Always climbing and jumping

908
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,660
all over the place.

909
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,469
Boys will be boys.

910
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:44,259
Bring your grandson over sometime.

911
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,099
Have Professor Shen

912
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,429
teach him some calligraphy.

913
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,890
Put a band-tightening spell on him.

914
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,539
I can teach him calligraphy,

915
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,260
but I can't put a golden hoop
around his head.

916
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,010
I'm not the Jade Emperor.

917
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,740
You're so funny.

918
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,509
Leave him to me.

919
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,490
Take it easy.

920
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,380
You have a good chance.

921
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,989
I don't recognize this character.

922
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,660
How do you read this?

923
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,860
Zhuoran.

924
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,509
Made you some tea.

925
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:16,570
I'll leave it here.

926
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:18,890
Thank you.

927
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,099
Oh, don't mention it.

928
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,309
We're in-laws.

929
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,909
Don't be so courteous.

930
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,739
I just feel bad that I keep troubling you.

931
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,820
It's not a problem.

932
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,140
Listen.

933
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,139
At our age,

934
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,789
we need to slow down.

935
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,450
You can't be hasty.

936
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:32,909
All right.

937
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,570
You should get some rest.

938
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,050
I think I'll do a little reading.

939
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,530
All right. I'll take my leave.

940
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:40,349
Call me if you need anything.

941
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,450
I know.

942
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:42,660
All right.

943
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:50,789
Is he asleep?

944
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,260
No.

945
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:56,659
Still reading. He's already old. It's not like
he's studying for college entrance exams.

946
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,699
Doesn't he get tired of those books?

947
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,820
You don't get it.

948
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,309
Scholars

949
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,700
are different.

950
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,660
How is he different?

951
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:06,539
Wait.

952
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,970
Let me see what this is.

953
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,740
Check this out.

954
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:15,260
That fairy

955
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,660
painted this.

956
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,050
This is so pretty!

957
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:26,930
I wonder

958
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,700
what she looks like.

959
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:31,010
No idea. I've never seen her.

960
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,490
We call her a fairy for a reason.

961
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,880
(Addressed to Shen Zhuoran,
Drum Tower District, Nanjing, Jiangsu)

962
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,139
Look at this.

963
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,480
Look at the address.

964
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,225
Nie Juanjuan.

965
00:42:46,226 --> 00:42:48,120
(Addressed to Nie Juanjuan,
237 Yihe Road, Nanjing)

966
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:50,740
237 Yihe Road.

967
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,300
Odd.

968
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:53,490
Just a mailbox.

969
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,890
No specific home address.

970
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:56,890
Come on.

971
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,340
Let's see this "fairy" in person.

972
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,139
See her in person?

973
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:00,989
Yes.

974
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:01,890
Let's go!

975
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,930
- Are you sure about this?
- Come on!
