3
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,670
Once you sign up for a membership,
you can't cancel it.

4
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,070
If I can't cancel it,

5
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,110
I'll just cancel Liu Debao!

6
00:01:49,488 --> 00:01:50,950
Someone in your house into fishing?

7
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:52,422
You've got a fishing rod here.

8
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,040
Fishing rod?

9
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,590
Oh, that's my son's.

10
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,510
He used to go fishing,

11
00:01:57,533 --> 00:01:59,577
but not anymore.
Now it sits there collecting dust.

12
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,333
I feel the urge
to snap that thing in half.

13
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,510
Go ahead then, snap it.

14
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,880
Are you serious?

15
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,950
Yes.

16
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,750
Do it to vent your frustration.

17
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,230
It's useless to me anyway.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,920
Then...

19
00:02:21,244 --> 00:02:22,480
I'm really going to do it.

20
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,270
Just do it.

21
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,270
One, two, three.

22
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,360
Don't end up hurting yourself.

23
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,280
Are you okay?

24
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,880
Unbelievable!

25
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,280
Break!

26
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,270
Break! Break!

27
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,040
This is unbelievable.

28
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,030
Why is it so tough?

29
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,950
Oh, right.

30
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,360
I just remembered,
this stuff cost hundreds of yuan.

31
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,590
It was some fancy brand.

32
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
Really?

33
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:53,800
It's true.

34
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,080
Peng Yulan,

35
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:57,630
you are really
not using it anymore?

36
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,880
Yes.

37
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:00,333
My son isn't using it anymore.

38
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,230
Can I have it then?

39
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,520
Sure, you can keep it.

40
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:05,750
Okay!

41
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,110
I'm going to give this

42
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,240
to the owner of Big Fish Countryside.

43
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,830
Since it's a gift,
let me wipe it clean then.

44
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,555
Let's try to cancel the membership.

45
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,710
Let me be honest with you,

46
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,750
Liu,

47
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,310
after all this time,

48
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,120
I've never properly thanked you.

49
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,333
There's no need for thanks.

50
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,088
No, you really don't have to thank me.

51
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,080
Thank you for all your help.

52
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,310
You see,

53
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,830
you brought so many friends here

54
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,150
and joined our membership.

55
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,840
So, here's to you.

56
00:03:31,088 --> 00:03:32,422
I'm going to empty the glass, okay?

57
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:33,190
No...

58
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,030
Oh my, that was strong!

59
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,200
I'm... I'm just going to eat.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,200
Sure, sure.

61
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,640
You know what, I have to go.

62
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,120
You guys enjoy the food.

63
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm going now.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,155
I'll come again another time.

65
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,390
But you haven't finished your food.

66
00:03:58,950 --> 00:03:59,870
Someone's calling me.

67
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,990
I have to take this.

68
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,680
Let's eat.

69
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,710
Come on. Let's eat.

70
00:04:08,888 --> 00:04:10,320
Have you canceled the membership?

71
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,960
Well...

72
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,440
It's not that easy.

73
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,040
Not that easy?

74
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,600
Stay put.

75
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,640
I'll be right over.

76
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:24,070
I can only perform tomorrow.

77
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,480
- You're here.
- Yes.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,320
Come on.

79
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,350
Shuishan, you're here.

80
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,080
Where have you been?

81
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:40,600
You haven't been answering my calls.

82
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,800
I've been worried about you.

83
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,830
I went on a trip
with a colleague for a few days.

84
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,750
Ms. Le,

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,910
we're practicing a new song,

86
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,880
"Farewell."

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,622
- Come on.
- You know the song, right?

88
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,350
Yes.

89
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,880
Come.

90
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,830
I have an idea.

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,880
- I think "Farewell" really...
- Have some tea.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,311
Has a beautiful vibe to it.

93
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,560
Maybe we could try
rearranging the formation.

94
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,480
And

95
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,710
maybe find some kind of...

96
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,230
Shen,

97
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,200
how about asking Lina to come by again?

98
00:05:25,466 --> 00:05:26,733
- She's a pro.
- She's good.

99
00:05:26,755 --> 00:05:29,288
- She can help us figure something out.
- Yes.

100
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,288
That's right, Shen.

101
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,240
Give her a call.

102
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,750
Okay, I'll give her a call.

103
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,670
Awesome!

104
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,160
Hello, Dad.

105
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,270
Hello, Lina.

106
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Here's the thing.

107
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,390
We're practicing a new song.

108
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,710
Tian thought

109
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,320
we could

110
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,080
add some dance moves.

111
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,040
Dad, I...

112
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,000
Lina,

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,270
this is Mr. Gou here.

114
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,240
Just come.

115
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,240
Let's have fun together.

116
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,240
Yes, Lina. We need your help.

117
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,480
Everyone's dancing
like wild animals here.

118
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,190
We're amateurs in this.

119
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,810
- Please come.
- Come help us, okay?

120
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,660
Please come!

121
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,350
You heard them, right?

122
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,440
Ms. Le also wants you here.

123
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,880
Okay, I'm coming.

124
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,660
(Xitian Fishing Village)

125
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:23,720
Mr. Liu, here.

126
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,800
Have some water.

127
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,660
I'm fine.

128
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,550
Okay.

129
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,640
You're wasted.

130
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,920
Liu?

131
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,840
Here you are!

132
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,720
- Liu!
- You're drunk.

133
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,510
I was wondering
why you didn't invite us.

134
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,480
Turns out you've been
sneaking off for a solo feast!

135
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,590
Come on, don't talk nonsense!

136
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,670
I...

137
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,590
I just came here

138
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,120
to ask the owner something.

139
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,470
Had a little question for her.

140
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,920
Oh right! I forgot about that.

141
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,400
Guess I drank too much and spaced out.

142
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,800
What was it you wanted to ask me?

143
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,760
I just wanted to check...

144
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,190
So...

145
00:07:00,644 --> 00:07:03,044
Is it possible to get a refund
on the prepaid card?

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,910
Unfortunately, I don't think so.

147
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,320
You've had so many meals here.

148
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,000
Was our food not good?

149
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,350
- No, no.
- Liu.

150
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:13,155
If you don't want to treat us,
just say so.

151
00:07:13,177 --> 00:07:14,080
No, it's not like that!

152
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,200
I...

153
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,990
Liu, are you really that broke now?

154
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,360
Out of cash?

155
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,280
Yes.

156
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,750
Is it necessary?

157
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,870
Asking for a refund
after eating that many meals?

158
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,360
No, it's just...

159
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,280
I...

160
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,870
It's okay, Liu.

161
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,950
Don't stress. Take a breath.

162
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:29,200
Just tell us what's going on.

163
00:07:29,311 --> 00:07:30,600
You're sweating bullets here.

164
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,320
Take your time.

165
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,590
Look at you.

166
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,960
- I...
- Look at you.

167
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,880
Liu!

168
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,750
What are you doing?

169
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,360
No wonder

170
00:07:43,688 --> 00:07:45,680
you dropped five grand
on that prepaid card!

171
00:07:46,688 --> 00:07:49,577
Now it all makes sense, it's because
of all these "extra services," huh?

172
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,920
And you are?

173
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,590
Me?

174
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,790
I'm his wife.

175
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,960
Oh! Please have a seat!

176
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,040
No, thanks.

177
00:08:02,044 --> 00:08:03,200
You're the owner here, right?

178
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,080
Yes.

179
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,160
Your name is Yu Meijiao?

180
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,190
Yes.

181
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:10,311
So this is how you roped
my husband into signing up,

182
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,040
wiping his sweat and all that, huh?

183
00:08:13,022 --> 00:08:14,920
That's enough, Baoqin.
Don't talk nonsense.

184
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,000
Ma'am,

185
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,790
our place has been around for years.

186
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,311
We've built a really solid reputation.

187
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,280
Our signature clay pot fish head

188
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,590
is one of the top-rated dishes online.

189
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,440
Top-rated, huh?

190
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,280
Top-rated, really?

191
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,920
Take your card out.

192
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,560
This place feels more like

193
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,160
a scam shop targeting old men!

194
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,440
Now that's not a very nice thing to say.

195
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:41,822
What do you mean, "scam shop"?

196
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:43,800
Look around. The front and
back doors are wide open.

197
00:08:43,888 --> 00:08:45,000
Everything's out in the open.

198
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,933
We have nothing to hide.

199
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,120
And for the record,

200
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,200
the fish head we use comes
from Tianmu Lake, genuine stuff.

201
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,670
As for the veggies,

202
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,940
they're all organic,
straight from the nearby eco farms.

203
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,150
Gentlemen, you tell me, how's our food?

204
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,360
- Do you like our food?
- Yes.

205
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,280
They're delicious.

206
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,800
Now don't gang up on me.

207
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,280
I'm not buying it.

208
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,590
Just refund the card.

209
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,680
Give me back the 5,000 yuan.

210
00:09:21,222 --> 00:09:22,360
Why are you looking at me?

211
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,680
Why are you looking at him?

212
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,230
He doesn't have any money.

213
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,160
I have his payroll card.

214
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,870
All his money is with me.

215
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,590
So give me the refund.

216
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,080
I don't think I can do that.

217
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,470
I can't.

218
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,470
Everyone, listen up.

219
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,950
He got that 5,000 yuan

220
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,230
from my daughter.

221
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,590
My daughter's business has failed.

222
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,750
And now my son-in-law wants a divorce.

223
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,960
They really need the money.

224
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,880
Yes.

225
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,440
The audacity of you to spend that
money eating out and having fun.

226
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,590
Have you got no shame?

227
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,830
What kind of father are you?

228
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,520
Give me the card!

229
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,920
Hurry!

230
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,080
Here.

231
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,000
Refund the card.

232
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,240
Ma'am,

233
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,310
look,

234
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,150
first of all,

235
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,350
we would never

236
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,950
pressure any customer

237
00:10:35,311 --> 00:10:36,430
into topping up the card.

238
00:10:36,955 --> 00:10:38,360
I've never forced you guys, right?

239
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,200
- No.
- Right?

240
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,120
I've never done that.

241
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,760
Second,

242
00:10:43,422 --> 00:10:45,955
I had no idea your family was
going through such a hard time.

243
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,280
And you've made it clear to me now.

244
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,550
Yun,

245
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,800
help her process the refund.

246
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,880
Liu,

247
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,350
I won't charge you
for those previous meals.

248
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,400
They're on me.

249
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,710
Give the full refund, all 5,000 yuan.

250
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,230
The dinner tonight is on the house,

251
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,670
gentlemen!

252
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,160
Eat well, drink well!

253
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,830
Grab the menu.

254
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,160
Come on.

255
00:11:16,244 --> 00:11:17,710
Tonight I'll join you all for dinner.

256
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,630
You can order whatever you want.

257
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,270
Chubby, go grab the menu.

258
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,190
Madam,

259
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,390
forget about Liu.

260
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,310
You've got us!

261
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,310
Okay.

262
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,680
She even tried to embarrass me.

263
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,920
Well, I don't care.

264
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,750
What matters is

265
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,040
that I got the money back.

266
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,710
Listen to me, Liu Debao...

267
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,640
Liu Debao...

268
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,160
You're always causing trouble.

269
00:11:43,444 --> 00:11:45,680
And who ends up cleaning
up the mess? Me. Every time.

270
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,560
Can you please give me a break?

271
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,750
Seriously.

272
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:54,520
Why are you standing so far away?

273
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,710
Come over here already.

274
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,670
Come on, get your card out.

275
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,870
The bus is here.

276
00:12:16,244 --> 00:12:17,533
Have you gotten it ready?

277
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,800
Listen to me, Liu Debao,

278
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,790
you'd better

279
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,270
behave yourself.

280
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,800
Keep your distance
from that owner.

281
00:12:25,422 --> 00:12:26,830
If you get involved with her again,

282
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,200
I will divorce you.

283
00:12:39,177 --> 00:12:40,280
You're sitting in the back?

284
00:12:40,311 --> 00:12:42,190
Not worried about getting
your butt bumped around?

285
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,622
You want to sit by the window?

286
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,400
Alright, okay.

287
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,670
Bus's departing!

288
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,940
(131 Terminus - Guli Reservoir Station)

289
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:04,830
It's your phone.

290
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,520
Answer it.

291
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,700
(Liu Dong)

292
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,040
Hello.

293
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,790
Hello, Liu Dong...

294
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,000
Let me talk to him.

295
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,950
Liu Dong,

296
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,230
why are you calling your uncle again?

297
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,320
Buying a burial plot, huh?

298
00:13:35,422 --> 00:13:36,800
Liu Dong, listen to me carefully.

299
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,680
I'll make this crystal clear.

300
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,440
We are absolutely

301
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,920
not buying a burial plot.

302
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,230
If your family ancestors
have a problem with that,

303
00:13:47,355 --> 00:13:49,133
they can come talk to me themselves.

304
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,280
Otherwise, they better
just rest in peace.

305
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,750
They're dead.

306
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,320
What else do they want?

307
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,240
Bye!

308
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,750
I think he's got our message now.

309
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,750
Take it back.

310
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,920
Liu Debao!

311
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,333
Why did you do that, Liu Debao?

312
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:15,750
Why did you throw the phone out?

313
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,560
Sir, please pull over!

314
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,470
- Sir!
- I can't pull over here.

315
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,710
My phone...

316
00:14:21,733 --> 00:14:23,030
If you don't pull over, I'm going

317
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,950
to jump out the window.

318
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,360
I had to say something like that

319
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,560
just to get you open the door.

320
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,670
Unbelievable.

321
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,200
Liu Debao,

322
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,120
get out!

323
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,600
Why are you still sitting there?

324
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,710
Come on!

325
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,230
Liu Debao, get out!

326
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,440
Stop the bus!

327
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,710
Stop it!

328
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,120
Liu Debao!

329
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,910
This song, "Farewell",

330
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,590
has a touch of sadness to it.

331
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,480
So when you're performing,

332
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,160
try not to smile too much.

333
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,310

Thank you.

354
00:16:45,222 --> 00:16:47,890
I picked out a gift for you.
Not sure if you'll like it.

355
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,030
Can I open it now?

356
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,230
Go ahead.

357
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,400
And there's this card.

358
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,230
It's

359
00:17:03,311 --> 00:17:04,720
filled with messages from our team,

360
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,950
all wishing you

361
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,030
the best.

00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:15,420
(To the dearest Ice)

363
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,080
Thank you.

364
00:17:37,644 --> 00:17:39,000
Please thank everyone for me.

365
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,840
It's very sweet.

366
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,800
Your gift's perfect.

367
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,150
I can take it back home

368
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,222
and use it to brew
our Minnan-style kung fu tea.

369
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,950
That's great.

370
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:57,560
A change of environment,
and a change of flavor.

371
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:12,600
I've been pushing myself

372
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,840
too hard these years.

373
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,710
I'm exhausted.

374
00:18:17,622 --> 00:18:19,040
I want to go home for a while,

375
00:18:19,622 --> 00:18:20,870
and spend some time with my dad.

376
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,030
That's good.

377
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,710
That's good.

378
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,560
It's just a shame

379
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,688
we won't be running together anymore.

380
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:36,088
Sure we can.
We'll run together on the fitness app.

381
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,120
Let's see who's faster.

382
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I surrender now.

383
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,470
Come.

384
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,640
Let's clink our cups.

385
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,830
I should be heading to my gate.

386
00:19:20,088 --> 00:19:21,230
I'll walk you to security.

387
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,510
No need.

388
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,340
It's not like we'll never
see each other again.

389
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,320
This is far enough.

390
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,270
Take care.

391
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,600
Take care.

392
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,030
Ice.

393
00:20:07,711 --> 00:20:08,990
I don't have insomnia anymore.

394
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,150
And when I run,

395
00:20:11,355 --> 00:20:12,760
I don't think about reports or data.

396
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,400
I just

397
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,390
focus on my breath,

398
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,720
on the air,

399
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,800
and on the freedom of that moment.

400
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,190
Thank you.

401
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:19,180
(Guli Reservoir Station)

402
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,080
Sir?

403
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,360
Sir?

404
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,640
This is the last stop.

405
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,040
Is this the 131 terminal?

406
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,120
Yes, it is.

407
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,133
Finally! I've been trying
to get through to you.

408
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,920
Earlier, my husband and I

409
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,720
were riding your bus.

410
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,030
But then

411
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,040
he got mad and threw
his phone out the window.

412
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,080
Your bus just drove off after I got off.

413
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,630
I was shouting, but you didn't stop.

414
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:20,160
My husband ended up following the bus,

415
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,480
So I'm trying to find out,
at which stop did he get off?

416
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,720
Are you talking

417
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,720
about the older guy
in the royal blue T-shirt?

418
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,680
Yes, that's him!

419
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,520
He rode all the way to the last stop.

420
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,870
He looked very distracted.

421
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,240
When he got off,

422
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,577
he was walking like a lost soul.

423
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,480
Alright, got it.

424
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,430
Please stop!

425
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,400
Stop!

426
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,760
- Thank you.
- Senior card.

427
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,230
Shuishan.

428
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,630
Lina,

429
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,190
can you and your dad

430
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,760
give Shuishan a ride home?

431
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,510
I didn't drive here today, Mr. Gou.

432
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,430
It's fine, really.

433
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,470
I can go home myself.

434
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,910
How about I walk with you then?

435
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:04,190
It's fine. I actually feel
like going shopping.

436
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,800
You wouldn't be interested in that.

437
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,480
Shan, how about I come with you?

438
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,170
I was thinking of
shopping for some clothes.

439
00:23:10,177 --> 00:23:11,310
- Sure!
- Okay.

440
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,630
Gou, I'm going with her then.

441
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,350
Don't forget about Ding.

442
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,600
- Got it.
- Bye.

443
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,960
You two can ride with me.

444
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:18,230
We'll drop Ding off first.

445
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,750
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

446
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,070
Ding, let's go.

447
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:21,990
Okay.

448
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,300
(Guli Reservoir Station)

449
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,430
Guli Reservoir Station?

450
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,630
Sir, is your last stop

451
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,280
Guli Reservoir Station?

452
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,320
Yes.

453
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,120
Hello, mom.

454
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,150
Lina,

455
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,800
listen,

456
00:24:07,977 --> 00:24:09,670
I have a really bad feeling about this.

457
00:24:10,711 --> 00:24:13,022
I think something is going
to happen to your dad.

458
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,080
What? Where are you guys?

459
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:18,800
I'm coming over right now.

460
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,880
Send me the location.

461
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,040
What's wrong, Lina?

462
00:24:22,244 --> 00:24:24,511
My mom said something was going
to happen to my dad.

463
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:26,950
Huh?

464
00:24:27,044 --> 00:24:28,955
Did she say what was
going to happen to him?

465
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,880
She didn't.

466
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,560
Okay.

467
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,790
We've set the location.

468
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,066
How long till we get there?

469
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:39,200
A little over 20 minutes.

470
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,400
Go faster.

471
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,320
Okay.

472
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,110
He never picks up.

473
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,222
I've called so many times.

474
00:24:59,711 --> 00:25:02,460
Maybe Shen Qing was tied up with
something and didn't hear his phone.

475
00:25:02,466 --> 00:25:03,333
Don't worry,

476
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,790
you've got us.

477
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,710
He's going to be fine.

478
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,320
Yes, don't panic.

479
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,760
Please drive faster.

480
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,160
Okay.

481
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,230
My dad is over there!

482
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,600
It's him!

483
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,640
Liu!

484
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,670
Liu!

485
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,120
Dad!

486
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,360
Dad!

487
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,800
Come back, Dad!

488
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,190
Dad!

489
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,270
Dad!

490
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,910
Please save my dad, Mr. Gou!

491
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,960
Liu, hang in there!

492
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,910
Gou is coming to you!

493
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,400
Dad!

494
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,070
Liu!

495
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,720
- Gou!
- Liu!

496
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,790
Go faster! He's drowning!

497
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,710
I'm coming!

498
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,510
Liu!

499
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,430
Hang in there!

500
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,640
He got him!

501
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,840
Mr. Gou!

502
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,230
- Yes!
- Get him back, Mr. Gou!

503
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:47,040
Hang in there!

504
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,000
Mr. Gou!

505
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,670
I need a hand!

506
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,030
Dad!

507
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:57,550
Dad!

508
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,550
Come on!

509
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,470
Give me a hand!

510
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,600
Dad!

511
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,110
- Dad!
- Come on.

512
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,480
Come on.

513
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,360
Here.

514
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,600
Dad!

515
00:27:09,577 --> 00:27:10,750
Put him down on the floor.

516
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,270
Come, Liu.

517
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,160
Spit the water out.

518
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,533
- Did you get choked?
- Dad...

519
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,080
Liu Debao!

520
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,080
Get the water out.

521
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,310
Yes, get it all out.

522
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:27,320
Liu Debao! Liu Debao, are you okay?

523
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,920
He's fine now.

524
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,440
My dad was drowning.

525
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,590
Mr. Gou saved his life!

526
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,640
You were trying to kill yourself?

527
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,720
What are you talking about?

528
00:27:37,311 --> 00:27:39,079
Was it really his choice to want to die?

529
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,733
Wasn't it you
who pushed him to the edge?

530
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,750
Liu,

531
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,800
you're okay now.

532
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,320
Liu Debao...

533
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,400
Liu Debao...

534
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,320
Get the water out.

535
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,400
- Pat him harder.
- Ding,

536
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,430
what are you doing?

537
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,880
Mr. Ding?

538
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,470
Ding?

539
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,400
Get back here!

540
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,080
Ding?

541
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,960
Stop!

542
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,280
Gou, be careful!

543
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,520
Let's get him

544
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,800
back to the car.

545
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,990
Come on.

546
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,190
Ding!

547
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,510
Ding!

548
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,350
Ding, come back!

549
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,270
Gou,

550
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,800
don't panic.

551
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
He can swim.

552
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,800
Just get him back.

553
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,360
Ding,

554
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,590
please listen.

555
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,630
Please listen to me, Ding.

556
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,400
Come on.

557
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,350
Let's get back.

558
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:43,320
The competition is over.

559
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,830
Come, easy, easy.

560
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,800
Ding's mind

561
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,200
might be a little foggy now,

562
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,444
but he's still a happy guy.

563
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:12,155
This must have reminded him of
his younger days at the academy.

564
00:29:12,155 --> 00:29:13,590
He used to be a swimming champion.

565
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,030
Ding!

566
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,000
Come back!

567
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,560
Mr. Gou! Come back!

568
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,080
Come back!

569
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,720
Shen and the guys are calling us!

570
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,080
Let's get back!

571
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,560
Come back!

572
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:39,760
You've had enough fun now.

573
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,040
- Get out of the water, Ding.
- Come back.

574
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,640
- Come on.
- Alright now.

575
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,670
That was so fun!

576
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,350
You're still a champion.

577
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,870
Put your clothes on.

578
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,920
Come on.

579
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:09,950
Let's go.

580
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:37,950
Mr. Gou!

581
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,670
Gou!

Please take your seat in there.

586
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,430
Who is this?

587
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,150
Who is Gou Bingqiang?

588

(Farewell, Gou Bingqiang)

589
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,350
He looks like Gou.

590
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:09,960
Yes.

591
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,880
That's Mr. Gou.

592
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,320
Why is he grinning like that?

593
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,590
Why isn't he with us?

My love,

597
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,280
are you seeing this?

598
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,920
So many people came to say goodbye.

599
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,430
Dad,

600
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,070
rest in peace.

601
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,440
Thank you all so much

602
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,400
for coming today to see Gou off.

603
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,800
Before we got married,

604
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,230
Gou recorded a video.

605
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,400
He said

606
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,520
if one day

607
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,520
he suddenly kicked the bucket,

608
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,190
it'd be my job

609
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,270
to make sure

610
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,190
everyone got to see it.

611
00:33:42,755 --> 00:33:44,622
How do I look in this outfit?
Not bad, huh?

612
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,790
Tian and I are
getting married tomorrow.

613
00:33:53,777 --> 00:33:55,400
So I figured I'd film this today.

614
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,440
Because once tomorrow comes,

615
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,440
we're tying the knot.

616
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,840
Tian,

617
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,110
I love you.

618
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,790
Even though I never admit it out loud,

619
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,310
I'm 70 already.

620
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,440
I'm an old guy.

621
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,400
My heart

622
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,760
isn't that great.

623
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,110
I could drop dead anytime.

624
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:24,990
So Tian,

625
00:34:25,555 --> 00:34:26,800
if that day ever comes,

626
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,510
don't blame anyone.

627
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,270
Don't blame yourself either

628
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,080
for not shoving heart meds

629
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,150
into my mouth in time.

630
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,110
My savings

631
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,560
go to my son.

632
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,200
My saxophone

633
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,590
goes to Shen.

634
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,750
The house goes to Tian.

635
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,080
It's not inheritance.

636
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,040
That's her dowry.

637
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,110
Tian,

638
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,590
keep moving forward.

639
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,110
Don't look back.

640
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,840
Oh,

641
00:35:04,022 --> 00:35:05,509
and my corneas are in great shape.

642
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,977
My vision's always been excellent.

643
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,670
Don't forget to donate them.

644
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,760
Everyone,

645
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,750
thank you all for making time

646
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:23,360
to attend my funeral.

647
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,800
Sadly,

648
00:35:27,288 --> 00:35:28,550
I'm tied up at the moment,

649
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:31,270
developing a new business venture.

650
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,560
I'm too busy to show up in person.

651
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,150
But don't feel sad.

652
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,920
I'm just going there early to check
things out for the rest of you.

653
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,480
Sooner or later, we'll meet again
in the afterlife.

654
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,960
I'm not afraid of dying.

655
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,920
What is scary, though,

656
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,400
is when you're at the banquet
after my funeral,

657
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,840
and when you think of me,

658
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,110
you couldn't enjoy
all the food and drinks

659
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,190
because you're too busy crying.

660
00:36:12,466 --> 00:36:13,520
So let's not fear death.

661
00:36:13,955 --> 00:36:15,630
Let's live the best of your life first.

662
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,666
No sad funeral music
at my funeral, please.

663
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,270
I want Tian to sing

664
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,040
"Cheers, My Friend" for me.

665
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,030

666
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,040

693
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,630
have some tea.

694
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,030
Mom.

695
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,190
Is Dad okay?

696
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,800
No.

697
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,480
He just sits there
and doesn't say a word.

698
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,550
Liu.

699
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,110
- Dad.
- Your daughter is here.

700
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:31,990
Lina.

701
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,030
Have you had lunch?

702
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:36,950
Yes.

703
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,480
Come sit here.

704
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,840
I bought you a new phone.

705
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,880
You shouldn't have.
My old one still works.

706
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,270
It's broken.

707
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,190
Why spend money on that?

708
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:52,360
You and Shen Qing are drowning in debt.

709
00:40:56,422 --> 00:40:58,510
Fine. I won't say anything more.
I'll shut up.

710
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,710
I won't interfere in
your business anymore.

711

I'm going to go cut up
some fruit for you.

714

Okay.

717
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,400
Set it for me.

718
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,360
Okay.

719
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,590
Use your birthday.

722
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,520
I set your birthday.

723
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,430
Don't tell Mom.

724
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,110
Got it. I won't.

725
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:39,950
I...

726
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,270
I really admire Gou.

727
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,360
He lived his life on his own terms.

What are you talking about?

Who are you admiring?

730
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:06,430
Dad was saying

731
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,880
he really admires Mr. Gou
for having such a free spirit.

732
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,110
Oh, Gou...

733
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,080
I really feel bad now.

734
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:24,080
I said so many harsh things to him,

735
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,000
but in the end,

736
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,190
