(International, Hongkong, China,
Macau, China, Taiwan, China Boarding)

4
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:01,820
Shen Duole.

5
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,020
Write to me.

6
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,270
Handwritten letter.

7
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,580
Got it.

8
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:08,910
Bye.

9
00:02:14,377 --> 00:02:14,750
Let's go.

10
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:19,940
Let's go.

11
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,380
Welcome back, Mr. Shen.

12
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,140
It's fine if you don't come back,

13
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,930
but when you do,
you're throwing things around.

14
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:02,800
Duole is asleep.
Can't you be a little quieter?

15
00:03:04,377 --> 00:03:05,230
You're not asleep yet?

16
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,590
These days, all you say to me is,

17
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,910
"You're not asleep yet?"

18
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,470
Why are you running away?

19
00:03:18,977 --> 00:03:20,155
This home isn't an Airbnb.

20
00:03:20,155 --> 00:03:21,377
Do you think you can come

21
00:03:21,377 --> 00:03:23,100
and go as you please in this family?

22
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,170
When you book a hotel room,

23
00:03:24,177 --> 00:03:25,590
don't you have to say hello?

24
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,030
What do you mean?

25
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,070
You lock me out? Where do I sleep then?

26
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,230
I'm exhausted after a whole day of work.

27
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,030
What do you mean?

28
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:40,466
Sleep on the sofa for the rest
of your life if you dare.

29
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,540
Grandpa.

30
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,270
Why aren't you home?

31
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,100
You just got back?

32
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,390
Susan left.

33
00:04:59,955 --> 00:05:01,533
I went to the airport to see her off.

34
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,710
Ms. Nie left too.

35
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,088
She didn't even let me see her off.

36
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:23,830
Grandpa.

37
00:05:25,111 --> 00:05:26,420
Let me sit with you for a while.

38
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:27,660
Don't.

39
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,390
You have school tomorrow.

40
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,733
Hurry up and go back to sleep.

41
00:05:31,244 --> 00:05:32,790
Anyway, I can't sleep when I go back.

42
00:05:33,022 --> 00:05:34,577
I'd rather sit with you for a while.

43
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,500
Okay.

44
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,100
Grandpa.

45
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,620
Can you still find

46
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,860
Cowherd and Weaver Girl now?

47
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,030
Of course.

48
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:57,540
There.

49
00:05:58,377 --> 00:05:59,466
And there.

50
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,150
I'm seventy

51
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,500
and I feel like I've never
properly enjoyed the starry sky.

52
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,500
Now when I look up,

53
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,620
it turns out

54
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,420
so many stars

55
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,590
have been accompanying us.

56
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,910
Ms. Nie is truly a fairy.

57
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,590
Sent down to teach you to see the stars.

58
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,860
She left after teaching you.

59
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:26,540
What's wrong?

60
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,950
What else can it be?

61
00:07:29,177 --> 00:07:30,644
Gastric pain. I'm taking medicine.

62
00:07:32,688 --> 00:07:33,933
What's wrong with you?

63
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,980
I hurt my back.

64
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,288
Looking for Safflower Oil.

65
00:07:39,244 --> 00:07:40,350
We're out of Safflower Oil.

66
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,733
I haven't had time to restock.

67
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,350
I'll get some from Dad.

68
00:07:48,693 --> 00:07:51,120
(Xiang Sha Stomach Nourishing Pill)

69
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,540
Dad, you're not asleep yet?

70
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,470
I'm on my phone, still.

71
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,860
Do you have Safflower Oil?

72
00:08:07,466 --> 00:08:08,540
Shen Qing hurts his back.

73
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,950
It's an old issue.

74
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:11,620
I do.

75
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,910
I just got a bottle a few days ago.

76
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:14,950
I forgot

77
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,860
where I put it after using it.

78
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:17,980
I... I'll find it.

79
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,980
No, no, I can find it.

80
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,470
I... I can remember.

81
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,100
Dad, you have to talk to Shen Qing.

82
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,950
He's always working overtime.

83
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,590
He doesn't care about home.

84
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,830
When he comes home,
Duole is already asleep.

85
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,230
Living under the same roof,

86
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,866
but it feels like
we're living in different time zones.

87
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,470
Found it.

88
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,020
Ms. Nie

89
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,100
left me a farewell letter.

90
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,350
She's very brave.

91
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:10,980
Lina,

92
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,830
life is like this.

93
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,310
Sometimes you have to find
some poetry in it.

94
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,100
Tell Shen Qing

95
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,900
not to worry about anything.

96
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,230
Take it slow.

97
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,430
I'm going abroad with my son.

98
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,310
Let's say goodbye.

99
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,100
My weak old age

100
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,950
only had some poetry

101
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,644
because of the days I spent with you.

102
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,310
Oh right,

103
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,710
I've thought of the line.

104
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,830
Unless you visit the garden,

105
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,780
how can you know
how beautiful spring is?

106
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:05,980
Unless you come to this world,

107
00:10:07,088 --> 00:10:08,740
how can you know this world is worth it?

108
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,310
Do you think it's good?

109
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,620
A garden full of spring.

110
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,950
This world

111
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,740
is worth it.

112
00:11:12,788 --> 00:11:23,420
(A garden full of spring.
This world is worth it.)

113
00:12:11,128 --> 00:12:15,640
(Magnolia flowers are in full bloom.)
(Shen Zhuoran)

114
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:51,830
(Magnolia flowers wither.)

115
00:13:16,826 --> 00:13:22,550
(Magnolia flowers, thank you.)

116
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,470
Yulan. Carry on.

117
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:02,710
Yulan.

118
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,350
You haven't come to dance for days.

119
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:07,070
What have you been busy with?

120
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:10,830
Dou Dou is starting elementary school.

121
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,830
I'm moving to Xianlin.

122
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,470
I probably won't be coming back.

123
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,100
Peng Yulan,
why didn't you say so before?

124
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,980
We only got in last week.

125
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,780
We were lucky.

126
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,980
The school is good.

127
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:30,830
Then,

128
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,860
how about

129
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,710
Professor Shen then?

130
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,260
It's your opportunity now.

131
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,260
Baoqin,

132
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,310
don't laugh at me when I say this.

133
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,070
I...

134
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,310
If Ms. Nie hadn't left,

135
00:14:51,244 --> 00:14:54,066
I would have been willing to
take care of her and Professor Shen.

136
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,190
But now that Ms. Nie has left,

137
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,620
she truly loves Professor Shen.

138
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,260
And Professor Shen went to find her.

139
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,350
I think

140
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,500
Professor Shen also
truly loves Ms. Nie.

141
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,550
They are

142
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,100
true love.

143
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,230
Peng Yulan.

144
00:15:34,681 --> 00:15:38,360
(Inpatient)

145
00:15:41,727 --> 00:15:44,100
(Ice Li)

146
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,830
(Met a cutie while jogging.
How's your back?)

147
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,100
Dr. Jiang,

148
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,980
how's my back?

149
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,780
This is lumbar muscle strain.

150
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:05,780
It's caused by accumulated strain.

151
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,550
The thing is

152
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,710
even if it's cured,

153
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,140
it's easy to relapse.

154
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,980
You must be careful in the future.

155
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,190
Can he still exercise in the future?

156
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,310
Yes, after it's cured.

157
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,822
You can do some moderate exercise,

158
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:19,177
like Tai Chi, and Baduanjin.

159
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,644
Combine movement and stillness.

160
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,190
You have to take care of your own body.

161
00:16:22,222 --> 00:16:22,860
That's right.

162
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,550
How can you know
how beautiful spring is?

163
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,310
Unless you come to this world,

164
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:54,190
how can you know this world is worth it?

165
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,070
Mr. Shen,

166
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,310
are you

167
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,430
Mr. Shen
from the Wind and Rainbow Choir?

168
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:05,830
Yes, I am.

169
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:06,950
You are?

170
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,177
I'm a fan of the Wind and Rainbow Choir.

171
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:11,780
Look.

172
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,390
I was just watching your videos.

173
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,020
Oh, yes.

174
00:17:16,355 --> 00:17:16,950
That's us.

175
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,950
You sang so well.

176
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,980
Especially the opera excerpt
in the middle.

177
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:24,540
Unless you come to this world,

178
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:26,430
how can you know this world is worth it?

179
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,430
Amazing.

180
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,540
It sounds like it was written
by someone who has experienced life.

181
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:33,688
It really touches the heart.

182
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,710
I agree.

183
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,670
The person who wrote this line
is remarkable.

184
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,430
We also

185
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,670
spent a lot of time practicing it.

186
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,870
As the saying goes,
practice makes perfect.

187
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,820
I'm Lv Yuan.

188
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,780
Lv, same as Lv Bu.

189
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,888
Yuan, same as the proverb,
a spark can start a fire.

190
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:53,820
Nice to meet you.

191
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,470
I'm so happy today.

192
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,020
So nice to meet you.

193
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,300
Mr. Shen,
are you from the Normal University?

194
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,340
Yes.

195
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,060
Chinese Studies.

196
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,470
Normal University isn't just any school.

197
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,390
It's the teacher's teacher.

198
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,430
That's what they say.

199
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:11,390
Mr. Shen,

200
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,780
could I

201
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,150
add you on WeChat?

202
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:15,980
Sure.

203
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,500
You're so kind, not pretentious at all.

204
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:20,800
Thank you. I'll scan your code.

205
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,710
Alright.

206
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,020
Okay.

207
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:22,740
Are you here

208
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,540
to exercise?

209
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,110
Yes, I'm here to kick the shuttlecock.

210
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,190
Look.

211
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,950
So agile.

212
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,670
I'm from the North.

213
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:39,780
Naturally big-boned.

214
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,060
Whenever I stand in front of the mirror,

215
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,340
I think of the Chinese working people.

216
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,260
And that slave-like appearance
of the past?

217
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,780
It's gone.

218
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,580
They have become the masters.

219
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:54,470
A quiz for you.

220
00:18:55,044 --> 00:18:56,022
Whose article is that?

221
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,540
Chairman Mao.

222
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,710
Correct!

223
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,500
Introducing a Co-operative.

224
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,180
Chairman Mao's masterpiece.
That's right.

225
00:19:02,288 --> 00:19:03,020
Thumbs up for you.

226
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:04,710
- Thank you.
- Mr. Shen,

227
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,190
can you kick the shuttlecock?

228
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,710
I'm ashamed to say, I can't.

229
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,820
It's okay. I can teach you.

230
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:10,870
No, it's okay.

231
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,390
I can't learn at my age.

232
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,630
Don't be polite.

233
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:16,430
It's fate that we met today.

234
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,580
Come, I'll demonstrate.

235
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:18,980
Come.

236
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,300
You're back.

237
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:35,580
Mom.

238
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,820
You came all this way to cook for us.

239
00:19:37,822 --> 00:19:39,190
- What do you mean?
- Thank you.

240
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,470
Don't be so polite. We're family.

241
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,710
Come, sit here. Slowly.

242
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,300
Get a cushion.

243
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,950
I haven't changed my shoes yet.

244
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,460
It's okay, I'll mop the floor later.

245
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,780
Get the bigger one.

246
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,710
What did the doctor say?

247
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,150
It's an old issue. It's nothing.

248
00:19:52,311 --> 00:19:53,580
What do you mean it's nothing?

249
00:19:53,622 --> 00:19:55,740
The doctor said
you have to be careful in the future.

250
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,450
It'll be troublesome
if it happens again.

251
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,430
If that's what the doctor said,

252
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,870
you have to pay attention.

253
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,630
Your health is the capital of your life.

254
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:06,066
Without a healthy body,
even God couldn't do anything.

255
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:07,630
Look at Ms. Nie and your dad,

256
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,060
- a match made in heaven...
- Mom...

257
00:20:09,066 --> 00:20:09,955
Is the food ready?

258
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,340
Waiting. There's a very special dish.

259
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,020
What special dish?

260
00:20:15,644 --> 00:20:16,622
It's for your health.

261
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,910
Here it comes.

262
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,260
Stir-fried kidney.

263
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,430
Kidney, for your health.

264
00:20:24,355 --> 00:20:24,950
Let's eat.

265
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:25,910
Give it to me.

266
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:26,630
Lina.

267
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,955
Where's your father-in-law?
Call him to eat together.

268
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,150
He's not at home.

269
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,533
I knocked on the door earlier on.

270
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:32,630
I'll get you some soup.

271
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,910
Ever since Ms. Nie left,

272
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,340
he has been in a bad mood.

273
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,780
Shen Qing always tells his dad
to go out for a walk.

274
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,400
Maybe he went for a stroll.

275
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:42,933
Let me get you some.

276
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,430
Eat more vegetables.

277
00:20:44,888 --> 00:20:46,470
There's more. I'll get you more later.

278
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,340
Look at my knife skills, look.

279
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,870
Eat more kidneys.

280
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,500
Thanks, Mom.

281
00:20:50,888 --> 00:20:52,390
Eat kidneys to nourish your kidneys.

282
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,390
Thanks, Mom.

283
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,910
This is very nourishing.

284
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,060
I cook three kidneys.

285
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:57,950
Shen Qing.

286
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,870
A chef counts on his knife,

287
00:20:59,955 --> 00:21:01,190
and a man counts on his back.

288
00:21:01,488 --> 00:21:03,450
Right? How will you spend
the rest of your life?

289
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,980
Will you spend it
lying down or standing?

290
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,190
It depends on how you live now.

291
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,820
Mom, stop nagging.

292
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,044
Can't you let him eat in peace?

293
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,740
Eat, then.

294
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,288
Let's dig in.

295
00:21:10,355 --> 00:21:10,800
Eat.

296
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,740
Quick.

297
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,390
Eat more.

298
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,260
Enough, mom.

299
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:13,710
Eat more.

300
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:17,710
How is it?

301
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:18,340
How is it?

302
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:19,670
Good.

303
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:28,910
Got it.

304
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,060
Look.

305
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,340
Liu is amazing.

306
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,230
So-so, third in the country.

307
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:36,150
Oh right.

308
00:21:36,177 --> 00:21:37,822
A farmhouse restaurant opened up ahead.

309
00:21:37,844 --> 00:21:39,110
The fish stew is especially good.

310
00:21:39,111 --> 00:21:39,933
Let's give it a try.

311
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:40,740
Sure.

312
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,670
Let's go.

313
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,740
Okay.

314
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,630
Let's pack up.

315
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,060
Oh right!

316
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,060
We'll share equally.

317
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,190
50 yuan per pax.

318
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,870
- Okay.
- Cool?

319
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:50,780
Yes, sure.

320
00:21:52,622 --> 00:21:53,820
I'll transfer the money to you.

321
00:21:53,822 --> 00:21:54,644
You order the dishes.

322
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:55,260
Sure.

323
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,060
Okay.

324
00:21:56,088 --> 00:21:56,688
Hello, Baoqin.

325
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,060
I'm fishing.

326
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,780
I brought pastry.

327
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,100
- I'll eat that later.
- Liu.

328
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,110
It's biting, it's biting.

329
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,670
Another big one.

330
00:22:09,977 --> 00:22:10,910
At least five kilograms.

331
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,820
One minute. I'll call you back.

332
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:22,390
I'll pay in cash.

333
00:22:25,088 --> 00:22:26,311
Alright. Start packing up.

Pause.

339
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,390
Pause.

340
00:22:49,422 --> 00:22:50,190
Let's change a song.

00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:51,950
"Cheers, My Friend".

342
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,466

Listen,

352
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,470
I've already prepared
the pickled cabbage.

353
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,470
Just waiting for the fish.

354
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,260
Is this five kilograms?

355
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,630
Is this big?

356
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,580
It bit the bait.

357
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,260
But I was answering your call.

358
00:23:59,466 --> 00:24:00,390
The fishing rod slipped.

359
00:24:00,444 --> 00:24:00,910
It ran away.

360
00:24:01,244 --> 00:24:02,390
I'm going to the restroom.

361
00:24:35,134 --> 00:24:37,970
(Bill)

362
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,150
Hello.

363
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,020
Okay.

364
00:24:43,644 --> 00:24:44,488
Alright, let's go.

365
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:46,910
Shen.

366
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:49,950
What's wrong with you?

367
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:51,200
You were distracted just now.

368
00:24:51,266 --> 00:24:52,400
What were you thinking about?

369
00:24:55,822 --> 00:24:57,340
I don't know what happened just now,

370
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,910
but I suddenly thought of Ms. Nie.

371
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:01,910
I wonder

372
00:25:02,422 --> 00:25:03,355
if she's doing well.

373
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,430
If you're well, then she's well.

374
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:06,740
Right.

375
00:25:07,244 --> 00:25:08,020
Everything's fine.

376
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,300
Right.

377
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:18,970
(Lv Yuan invites you to a video call)

378
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,500
Who is it? So scary.

379
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,820
Hello, Lv Yuan.

380
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,340
Hello, Mr. Shen.

381
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,540
I'd like to treat you to a meal.

382
00:25:30,711 --> 00:25:31,950
Would you do me the honor?

383
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:33,260
A meal?

384
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,630
That won't be necessary.

385
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,230
I'm not just saying.

386
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,950
I'm sincere,
from the bottom of my heart.

387
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,110
I also like singing.

388
00:25:40,177 --> 00:25:41,780
I'd like to discuss some tips with you.

389
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,340
You wouldn't refuse me, would you?

390
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,110
No. It's not like that.

391
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,190
It's not about it.

392
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,580
Then it's settled.

393
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,230
12 PM, this Saturday.

394
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,740
See you at Restaurant Anle.

395
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,870
But on Saturday, we...

396
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,540
Who is it?

397
00:25:57,444 --> 00:25:58,133
Who is that?

398
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,060
A fan of our choir.

399
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,390
We have fans now.

400
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,950
This shows that our publicity work

401
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:09,950
is very effective.

402
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,230
They always give us likes.

403
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:12,780
Great.

404
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,110
Since they like us so much,

405
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,980
we can't snub them, right?

406
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:16,580
Right.

407
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:17,430
Yes.

408
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,230
A spark can start a prairie fire.

409
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,630
Maybe they'll become
a fan club in the future.

410
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,740
So, let's go.

411
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,688
We have to go.

412
00:26:24,755 --> 00:26:25,390
We have to go.

413
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,300
Mr. Shen, here.

414
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,150
Come.

415
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:35,390
Hello.

416
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,430
Hi, let me introduce her.

417
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,733
Let me introduce her.

418
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,670
This is Lv Yuan.

419
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,710
This is Gou.

420
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,540
Hello.

421
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,300
This is Ding.

422
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:45,740
Ding.

423
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:46,500
Hello.

424
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,150
Hello.

425
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,390
These two are the main force

426
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,190
of our choir.

427
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:53,820
Have a seat.

428
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:54,540
Have a seat.

429
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:55,580
Have a seat.

430
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,340
Although we are the main force,

431
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,340
Professor Shen

432
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,020
is the core.

433
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,190
Without Professor Shen,

434
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,710
there would be
no Wind and Rainbow Choir.

435
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,300
Three stakes for a fence,

436
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,260
and three helpers for a hero.

437
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,740
Wind and Rainbow Choir is so excellent

438
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,190
because it has an excellent team

439
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,870
that forms a synergy.

440
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,230
Well said.

441
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,470
I bet you were working on
the theoretical side of things.

442
00:27:33,622 --> 00:27:34,740
You're good at summarizing.

443
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:35,910
No.

444
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,150
I was a model worker
at the steel factory.

445
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:39,580
Look.

446
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,780
Theory first,

447
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,340
practice follows.

448
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,190
Both are indispensable.

449
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,740
True.

450
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:47,580
For example,

451
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:48,580
kicking shuttlecock.

452
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:49,780
I'm good at it.

453
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,260
Why?

454
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:54,340
There was a troublemaker in the factory
at that time.

455
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,150
He didn't even respect
the factory director.

456
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,060
I went to him to do some talking.

457
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,740
He wanted to compete with me.

458
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,670
I said okay, let's compete.

459
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,300
I didn't sleep

460
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,870
and practiced hard for a week.

461
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,020
And I won.

462
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:12,470
See.

463
00:28:12,870 --> 00:28:14,020
Respect.

464
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,060
She is amazing.

465
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,710
Well, this is me.

466
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,670
I'm like this.

467
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:19,911
When something happens,

468
00:28:20,422 --> 00:28:21,600
it's either I don't do it,

469
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,110
or I'll make it good.

470
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,670
Last time,

471
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,710
I couldn't do

472
00:28:27,155 --> 00:28:28,060
any house chores.

473
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,020
After I retire,

474
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,470
the family needs me.

475
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:32,630
So I learned.

476
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,950
Dumplings from the North,
and snacks from the South.

477
00:28:36,555 --> 00:28:37,500
I mastered them all.

478
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,020
Mr. Shen.

479
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,260
My daughter's classmate

480
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,430
works in the Normal University too.

481
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,340
I heard your wife passed away.

482
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,300
Who takes care of you usually?

483
00:28:51,488 --> 00:28:53,190
My son and I live across
from each other.

484
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,500
My daughter-in-law and my in-laws

485
00:28:55,511 --> 00:28:56,710
come over to take care of me.

486
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,110
I'm grateful for them.

487
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:00,870
Lv Yuan,

488
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,980
you and Shen met at Nanhu Park?

489
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:05,580
Yes.

490
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,780
What a coincidence.

491
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,430
It's quite a coincidence.

492
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,710
Right. Look.

493
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:13,260
Mr. Shen loves literature and art,

494
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,820
and I love sports.

495
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,980
We are both people who love life.

496
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,190
Exactly.

497
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,500
This isn't a coincidence.

498
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:27,150
This is inevitable on the road
to pursue happiness.

499
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,740
Well said.

500
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,150
My honor.

501
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:34,740
Honor.

502
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:38,780
Very honor.

503
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,340
Waiter.

504
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,630
Four people.

505
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:45,060
Serve the dishes.

506
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:45,950
Enjoy.

507
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,300
Here.

508
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,340
Sure, sure.

509
00:29:48,355 --> 00:29:49,190
- Lv Yuan.
- Sure.

510
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,340
So,

511
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,740
you've been single all these years?

512
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,740
Yes.

513
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,110
Someone wanted to introduce me
to a general before.

514
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,710
Very famous.

515
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,540
I carefully thought about it.

516
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,190
I'd rather spend my time

517
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,980
with scholars like you.

518
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:12,150
Understand.

519
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:14,710
Us?

520
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:18,150
Or one of us?

521
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,060
Gou.

522
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:25,870
This way of asking
is not straightforward.

523
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,110
You can ask me directly.

524
00:30:28,155 --> 00:30:29,444
I will answer everything I know.

525
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,740
Well said.

526
00:30:32,155 --> 00:30:34,244
Gou has always been glib.

527
00:30:34,244 --> 00:30:36,630
Someone should have put him in his place
a long time ago.

528
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,060
Right.

529
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,870
You wanted to ask

530
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:45,780
if I have feelings for Mr. Shen.

531
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:47,670
No.

532
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,430
No, Lv Yuan.

533
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,110
That's not what Gou meant.

534
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,110
Lv Yuan,

535
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,020
that's exactly what I meant.

536
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,110
Well,

537
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,780
let me reveal the answer.

538
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,950
The answer is

539
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:06,540
yes.

540
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,540
Let's just eat.

541
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,500
Let's dig in.

542
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:14,060
Alright.

543
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,870
Lv Yuan.

544
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,500
The two of us have

545
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,710
only just met.

546
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,820
To talk about this matter, it's...

547
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,780
It's inappropriate.

548
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,260
Mr. Shen.

549
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:34,630
You are a widower,

550
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:35,820
and I'm divorced.

551
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,300
We are single.

552
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,150
You love arts and culture,

553
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,580
and I love sports.

554
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,870
A balance of motion and stillness.

555
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,820
You are 177 cm tall,

556
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,060
and I am 168 cm.

557
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,470
We are similar.

558
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,630
You own a house,

559
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,430
and I do too.

560
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:53,340
Both of us

561
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,780
are equal.

562
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,670
You have a professor title,

563
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:58,980
and I am a model worker.

564
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,870
You have a slight edge.

565
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:04,300
But you're not good at housework.

566
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,390
Me?

567
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,230
I handle everything
inside and outside the home.

568
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,540
I'm far ahead.

569
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,150
Don't you think

570
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:14,870
the two of us

571
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,630
are quite a match?

572
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,430
You...

573
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,340
Wait, Lv Yuan.

574
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,430
You are indeed

575
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,670
decisive and bold.

576
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,390
Yes.

577
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,260
But I feel that matters
of the relationship

578
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,910
should probably take time.

579
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:34,390
Right?

580
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,090
- Right?
- Right.

581
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,020
Yes, he's right.

582
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:36,740
It's better.

583
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,190
I don't agree.

584
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,870
Today's work must be finished today.

585
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,910
It can't be delayed or be slow.

586
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:45,870
Together, Mr. Shen and I are

587
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,020
around 130 years old.

588
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,950
At our age,

589
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,670
we have to race against death.

590
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,190
I always taught my daughter

591
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,670
to cut ties quickly with bad men.

592
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,910
When you meet a good man,

593
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,630
you must go straight for it.

594
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,230
Am I right, Mr. Shen?

595
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,630
What should I do?

596
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:26,340
What should I do?

597
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,300
Say something. What should I do?

598
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,500
Who are you asking? Us?

599
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:36,110
She is coming after you.

600
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,910
Clearly, she came prepared.

601
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,540
I absolutely did not expect this.

602
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,430
This is...

603
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,190
Could this be

604
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,910
another spy?

605
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:47,670
No.

606
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:48,820
Listen.

607
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:49,910
This...

608
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,110
A chance meeting and a fleeting romance!

609
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,710
You need to be extra vigilant.

610
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,580
Ding, stop stirring things up.

611
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:01,230
He is studying the Song Dynasty.

612
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,430
A spy wouldn't be interested.

613
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,150
She is interested in Shen.

614
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:08,150
This is ridiculous.

615
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:08,820
Look.

616
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:10,150
A lady...

617
00:34:11,444 --> 00:34:12,740
She is more unrestrained than me.

618
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,780
An old lady.

619
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,630
This is really improper.

620
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,900
So I'm asking you all.

621
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,780
What should I do?

622
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,030
Try to avoid her.

623
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,300
Reduce contact.

624
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:28,466
I think it's better
not to contact her at all.

625
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,990
What if she comes looking for me again?

626
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:34,630
Just say,

627
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:35,740
you died.

628
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,380
No, no.

629
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,940
That's rude.

630
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:40,260
Come on.

631
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,230
Well, let me think.

632
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,860
How about you reply like this?

633
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:48,510
You tell her,

634
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,460
the owner is dead,

635
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,110
and burn some offerings if you want.

636
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,550
This meal...

637
00:34:57,755 --> 00:34:58,380
After the meal,

638
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,190
ended with three lunatics.

639
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,740
Where are you going?

640
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:25,940
I...

641
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,070
I need to go to Yangzhou
for due diligence.

642
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,900
You're going to Yangzhou?

643
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,550
Stand up, let me see.

644
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,733
Yesterday you couldn't even
stand up properly.

645
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:38,730
You can go to Yangzhou
after resting for one night?

646
00:35:38,733 --> 00:35:40,420
We're working, not selling our lives.

647
00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:41,644
You're not allowed to go.

648
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,630
It was arranged.

649
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:47,190
Well,
there can be special circumstances.

650
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,550
No, you can't go.

651
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,710
I'll call An Ruifeng.

652
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,460
Don't.

653
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,340
I...

654
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,460
I will be back in a day. Round trip.

655
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,644
I come back right after.

656
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,300
The investors have sent a car.

657
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,110
Jin is coming too.

658
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,340
We are meeting at Shide Capital lobby.

659
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,300
Fine, I'll send you to Shide Capital.

660
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,630
It's not that far.

661
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,088
I'll call a cab.

662
00:36:12,111 --> 00:36:13,670
You don't have to run around.

663
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,300
Taxi driver drives fast.

664
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,860
A bumpy ride will hurt your back again.

665
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,070
There's no cushion in the car.

666
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,460
Mr. Jiang said,

667
00:36:19,466 --> 00:36:21,600
lumbar muscle strain
comes from accumulated fatigue.

668
00:36:21,644 --> 00:36:23,044
It can relapse even after recovery.

669
00:36:23,044 --> 00:36:23,688
No.

670
00:36:24,444 --> 00:36:25,420
Are you going or not?

671
00:36:27,155 --> 00:36:28,230
Forget it, I'm not going.

672
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,260
I'm not going.

673
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,380
You were dying to go just now.

674
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,190
Now you say you're not going
just like that?

675
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,670
You're strange.

676
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,710
What do you mean?

677
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,533
You just don't want me to drive you,
right?

678
00:36:37,577 --> 00:36:38,780
What do I have to hide?

679
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,230
Mr. Shen, I've already departed.

680
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:49,888
Should I come to pick you up?

681
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:57,150
No need, my wife is driving me over.

682
00:36:59,822 --> 00:37:01,400
Okay, let's go. I'll drive you.

683
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,550
Is this the building?

684
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:16,340
Yes, right here.

685
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,420
What's the rush?

686
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,590
Just wait in the car.

687
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,260
Can your back handle standing outside?

688
00:37:21,511 --> 00:37:22,533
Don't try to be tough.

689
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,740
Are you okay?

690
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,550
I'm okay.

691
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,444
If you said you were going to Yangzhou
to see beautiful women,

692
00:37:28,444 --> 00:37:29,230
I can understand.

693
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,222
What's so great about seeing
some broken lab?

694
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,740
Is it worth dragging your sick body
to the front line of work?

695
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,070
Why isn't Jin here yet?

696
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,260
Call her.

697
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:39,740
Mr. Shen.

698
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,670
Not this entrance. It's the East gate.

699
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,820
Follow us.

700
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,420
East gate?

701
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,300
How is it? Able to pack?

702
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,550
Morning, Ice.

703
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:00,300
Morning.

704
00:38:04,222 --> 00:38:05,300
So pretty. Let me help you.

705
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,260
This is the East gate.

706
00:38:07,288 --> 00:38:09,600
Are you pretending not to know
or do you really not know?

707
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,860
We go straight into
the basement for the meeting.

708
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,600
How would I know which is
the East gate or the West gate?

709
00:38:14,644 --> 00:38:15,190
Wait.

710
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,230
Don't rush.

711
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,670
Slowly.

712
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,380
Mr. Shen is here.

713
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,260
Wait for me.

714
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,190
This...

715
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,380
Dear.

716
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:33,630
I'll help you.

717
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:35,740
Hi.

718
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:36,940
Let me introduce.

719
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,740
This is my wife, Liu Lina.

720
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,190
This is the investor's
person in charge, Ice Li.

721
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:43,460
Hello.

722
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:43,940
Hello.

723
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,510
Young and promising.

724
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,190
Thanks, Mrs. Shen.

725
00:38:47,511 --> 00:38:49,740
No trouble for me.
Shen Qing is the one working hard.

726
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,740
Can't even rest properly on sick leave.

727
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,780
Mr. Shen, are you okay?

728
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,230
Otherwise, we could...

729
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,260
I'm much better.

730
00:38:56,755 --> 00:38:57,820
Let's hurry and set off.

731
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,930
So we can come back early.

732
00:38:58,933 --> 00:38:59,400
Yes,

733
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,630
Slow down. I'll help you.

734
00:39:03,088 --> 00:39:04,422
- Slowly.
- I'm fine.

735
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:05,740
Jin.

736
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,080
You sit at the back, and I'll
sit in front to give directions.

737
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,230
Just sit at the back, you...

738
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:09,460
I...

739
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,590
So much trouble

740
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,990
to move over.

741
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:12,510
True.

742
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,300
Here's your cushion.

743
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,340
And your cup.

744
00:39:15,711 --> 00:39:17,644
Dear,
what time are you coming back tonight?

745
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:18,755
I'll come pick you up.

746
00:39:18,822 --> 00:39:20,644
I'll message you
when we're heading back.

747
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:21,550
Mrs. Shen,

748
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,340
we can drive Mr. Shen home.

749
00:39:23,733 --> 00:39:25,066
I just worried about his back.

750
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,510
Don't you worry, Lina.

751
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,630
I'll take care of Mr. Shen.

752
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:28,888
We'll have lunch with them

753
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:31,150
due diligence in the afternoon
and will be back at night.

754
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,000
It won't be too late.

755
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,600
Thanks.

756
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,420
Please take care of Shen Qing for me.

757
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,230
Don't worry.

758
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,860
Take care.

759
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:38,511
Drink water.

760
00:39:39,422 --> 00:39:40,630
Careful on your way back home.

761
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:41,300
Bye.

762
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:42,300
Bye.

763
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:40,590
Mr. Shen,

764
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,380
we thought you couldn't make it today.

765
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,940
Mr. Shi even volunteered.

766
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,422
He spent all day yesterday
researching Yangzhou delicacies.

767
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,190
He can't do it.

768
00:40:49,866 --> 00:40:50,844
He's afraid of cats.

769
00:40:50,888 --> 00:40:52,711
He jumps higher than a cat
when he sees one.

770
00:40:57,311 --> 00:40:58,900
What delicious food does Yangzhou have?

771
00:41:00,488 --> 00:41:01,777
Boiled and dried bean curd

772
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,590
crab-roe soup bun,

773
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,590
wensi tofu, and Yangzhou fried rice.

774
00:41:05,133 --> 00:41:06,940
Just hearing about it
makes my mouth water.

775
00:41:07,266 --> 00:41:08,420
Let's go eat that for lunch.

776
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:09,940
Sure!

777
00:41:10,355 --> 00:41:11,150
Let me tell you,

778
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,670
my aunt is from Yangzhou.

779
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,780
She's very particular about food.

780
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,590
When I went to her house as a child,

781
00:41:16,644 --> 00:41:17,400
she would ask me,

782
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,990
"Jinjin, are you hungry?

783
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:20,780
I'll make you
a simple Yangzhou fried rice,

784
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,300
okay?"

785
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,550
Then you'd see her

786
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,380
flying around the kitchen.

787
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,150
There were so many ingredients alone.

788
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,260
Then the oil heats up,

789
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,630
and hits the pan with a sizzle.

790
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:31,590
This Yangzhou fried rice

791
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,990
is not ordinary egg-fried rice.

792
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,820
It emphasizes "gold wrapped in silver".

793
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,300
Meaning the egg mixture

794
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:38,940
has to completely coat the rice grains.

795
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:41,300
The fried rice needs to have
separate grains.

796
00:41:41,311 --> 00:41:43,311
You can't have
two grains sticking together.

797
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,740
Wow, that's very particular.

798
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,940
Then the first item on our list today

799
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,933
is Yangzhou fried rice.

800
00:41:47,933 --> 00:41:48,150
Okay!

801
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:48,820
Okay!

802
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,190
Deal.

803
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,380
At first, I didn't understand

804
00:41:59,644 --> 00:42:02,340
why Shen Qing insisted on going on
a business trip with a bad back

805
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,644
and absolutely refused
to let me drive him.

806
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:06,990
When I got there, I found out

807
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:09,260
two beautiful women
were accompanying him.

808
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,670
Are you being too sensitive?

809
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,150
No way.

810
00:42:12,355 --> 00:42:13,670
My sixth sense is very accurate.

811
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,110
But Shen Qing

812
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,670
has neither money nor power.

813
00:42:18,066 --> 00:42:19,820
Which beauty would be interested in him?

814
00:42:20,822 --> 00:42:22,070
That's not necessarily true.

815
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,111
The director in our office

816
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,550
has a beer belly

817
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:26,844
and such a big head.

818
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,670
Still, many young girls admired him.

819
00:42:28,688 --> 00:42:29,422
I'm serious.

820
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:31,780
Wait.

821
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:33,510
Lina.

822
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,260
I think

823
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,110
you should also dress up sometimes.

824
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:40,070
You're so good-looking,

825
00:42:40,088 --> 00:42:42,266
just a little effort
and you'd be a great beauty.

826
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:44,150
Right? If you're a beauty yourself,

827
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:46,110
why would you
be afraid of other beauties? Right?

828
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,230
That makes sense.

829
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:50,460
Out of our ten dates,

830
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,940
you wore sportswear seven times.

831
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,990
You used to be the class beauty.

832
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:54,940
