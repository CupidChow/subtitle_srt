00:01:38,288 --> 00:01:40,133
You want to take out a loan to invest?

4
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,666
How is that any different
from borrowing money to gamble?

5
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,440
It's totally different.

6
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,040
Gambling is illegal.

7
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:48,350
Investing is a way to get rich
through hard work.

8
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,910
Lina, this doesn't make any sense.

9
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,133
You don't have much experience
in society,

10
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:54,511
so you need to be more cautious.

11
00:01:54,533 --> 00:01:57,111
Don't repeat the same mistake
as with the school uniform.

12
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,720
You look down on me.

13
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,470
You've never truly believed in me.

14
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,800
You think I can't do anything right

15
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,720
and I should stay at home
and serve your family.

16
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,440
You're taking this too far.

17
00:02:08,444 --> 00:02:10,511
You asked if this project
is worth investing in,

18
00:02:10,533 --> 00:02:11,679
and I gave you my opinion.

19
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,044
I don't think it is. I'm against it.
That's all, isn't it?

20
00:02:14,088 --> 00:02:15,720
I take the loan. I make the investment.

21
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,600
I'm the legal person.

22
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:17,866
Your objection is overruled.

(Xuanwu Lake Inner Ring Track)

24
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:41,840
Ice,

25
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,350
you've run a big lap.

26
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,070
I'm good.

27
00:02:47,088 --> 00:02:48,080
Adjust your breathing.

28
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,520
Enjoy this moment of freedom.

29
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,230
Ms. Gao,

30
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,400
everyone says you're the best designer.

31
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,080
You have to help me.

32
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,840
Look.

33
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,670
I've made some adjustments

34
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,040
to the collar

35
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,990
and pocket.

36
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,400
But the school

37
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,670
isn't satisfied.

38
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,080
They want the design to reflect
on the school's history.

39
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,870
They need the draft
by tomorrow afternoon.

40
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,600
Tomorrow afternoon?

41
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
That's obviously impossible.

42
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,350
I'll pay you 50,000.

43
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,470
Please.

44
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,870
Please help me.

45
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,640
50,000?

46
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,520
You don't make much profit, though.

47
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:48,990
True.

48
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,400
This is the biggest order I've taken.

49
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,840
I really want to get it done.

50
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,720
I've thought about it.

51
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,200
I won't make money on this.

52
00:03:58,355 --> 00:03:59,800
Consider it an experience.

53
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:08,870
If you rush the draft,
I can't guarantee good quality.

54
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:10,622
As long as you can make it in time.

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,288
I want to give it a shot.

56
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,720
Dad, look at this.

57
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:29,666
Mom really pays attention
to every detail.

58
00:04:30,555 --> 00:04:31,760
This time, we should...

59
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:35,400
Dad.

60
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,790
You're still up.

61
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,430
I... I'm going to bed soon.

62
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,822
Mom said she's staying up all night
to finish the draft,

63
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,133
so she's not coming back.

64
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,960
All right.

65
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,040
Dad.

66
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:53,160
Look at this.

67
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,640
This is Mom's sample.

68
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,670
It's quite nice.

69
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:00,711
Mom put in a lot of effort this time.

70
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,080
We should help her.

71
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,160
All right.

72
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,160
Go to bed.

73
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,470
Dad, get rest early.

74
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,530
(Dad, have you taken the meds?
Any strong reactions?)

75
00:05:52,531 --> 00:05:56,300
(You said Mr. Wang's nephew
is impressive. Send me his contact.)

76
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:06,220
(Dad, have you taken the meds?)

77
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,430
I studied

78
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,400
your school's history

79
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
and made some adjustments.

80
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,600
They highlight

81
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
the unique identity

82
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,600
of your school,

83
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,040
and at the same time,

84
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,230
I've incorporated

85
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,350
modern elements.

86
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:34,670
For example,

87
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,160
I've designed a touch logo

88
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,080
on the chest

89
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,110
of the uniform.

90
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,160
What? A torch?

91
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,110
Yeah.

92
00:06:42,244 --> 00:06:43,570
Did she really study the history?

93
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,400
That's a huge mistake.

94
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,160
The torch represents inheritance.

95
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,670
Liu,

96
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,870
didn't you study

97
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,870
the school's history?

98
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,110
Yes, Headmaster Zhang.

99
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,200
Twenty years ago,

100
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:53,870
there was a major fire at the school.

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,280
The damage was devastating.

102
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,640
Really?

103
00:06:56,711 --> 00:06:57,870
That wasn't in the materials.

104
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,400
Unity, fast-paced,

105
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,840
seriousness, and liveliness.

106
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,040
This torch

107
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,480
isn't serious at all.

108
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:05,950
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,760
I'll change it.

110
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,866
No need for the trouble.

111
00:07:08,955 --> 00:07:10,120
The sports day is coming up.

112
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:11,360
We don't have time for that.

113
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,520
We'll just buy ready-made uniforms

114
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,910
from a factory.

115
00:07:14,955 --> 00:07:15,666
Headmaster Zhang,

116
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,260
there's still time.
I can make it on time.

117
00:07:17,266 --> 00:07:18,520
Liu, you've worked hard.

118
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:19,590
We appreciate your effort.

119
00:07:19,688 --> 00:07:20,460
But this is final.

120
00:07:25,955 --> 00:07:27,310
I'm really sorry, Headmaster Zhang.

121
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,999
(Wutian Fish Village)
This place is nice.

122
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,520
Not bad.

123
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,520
Madam.

124
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,830
Coming.

125
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:47,910
Mr. Liu,

126
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,240
you haven't been here in a while.

127
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:51,710
The ancestral hall is under renovation.
I've been busy with that.

128
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,760
Liu is always busy with fancy stuff.

129
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,950
Your family has an ancestral hall?

130
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,880
Oh, my. You must be a big family.

131
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,177
No, small families in my hometown

132
00:08:01,177 --> 00:08:02,488
have their own ancestral halls.

133
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,160
Liu is being modest.

134
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:05,790
His fishing rod costs over a thousand.

135
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,240
He's rich.

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,488
My, my. Over a thousand...

137
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:11,266
We only use rods
that cost a few dozen yuan.

138
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,520
Stop teasing me.

139
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,400
We agreed on this before.

140
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,310
Don't turn me down.

141
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,760
Like I said last time,

142
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,520
today's my treat.

143
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:19,760
Order anything you want.

144
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,520
All right?

145
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,040
All right.

146
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,950
Liu,

147
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,590
you're generous.

148
00:08:26,377 --> 00:08:27,533
You know what this is called?

149
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,120
A low-key luxury.

150
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,520
Shut up.

151
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,070
So generous!

152
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,310
Come, let's order.

153
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:36,520
Take a seat.

154
00:08:36,866 --> 00:08:37,590
Come with me.

155
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,000
This way.

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,866
What's the matter?

157
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,830
How's the food here?

158
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,520
Good.

159
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:43,280
Not bad, right?

160
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,760
You and your friends come here often.

161
00:08:46,222 --> 00:08:47,533
Let me tell you this.

162
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:49,822
It's a good deal if you get
a membership card.

163
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,670
You get free stuff and discounts.

164
00:08:51,977 --> 00:08:52,755
Look at this.

165
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,590
Have a look.

166
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,000
Here.

167
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,430
For 500 yuan,

168
00:08:57,488 --> 00:09:00,022
(Top-up and get bonus gifts)
10 percent off and a free fruit platter.

169
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,640
For 1,000 yuan,

170
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
10 percent off

171
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,710
and vouchers.

172
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,670
For 3,000 yuan,

173
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,040
20 percent off.

174
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:06,830
See?

175
00:09:07,177 --> 00:09:07,910
For 5,000 yuan,

176
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,550
this is a steal.

177
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,360
20 percent off, free plain noodles,
a fruit platter,

178
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,520
and vouchers.

179
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:15,950
Worth it, right?

180
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,480
Yes.

181
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,160
Let me see.

182
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,070
Take your time.

183
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,310
I'll go check on the food.

184
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,670
Be careful.

185
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,088
The clay pot fish head is here.

186
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:27,760
Watch out.

187
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,790
Hold the pot carefully.

188
00:09:29,422 --> 00:09:30,244
The fish head is here.

189
00:09:30,977 --> 00:09:32,040
The fish head is here.

190
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,280
Slowly.

191
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,240
It's fresh out of the pot.

192
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,910
Some peanuts for you.

193
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,430
I'll bring more when you're done.

194
00:09:40,511 --> 00:09:40,949
All right?

195
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,400
Thank you.

196
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,070
Madam.

197
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,688
Thank you.

198
00:09:42,755 --> 00:09:43,911
Where's the payment code?

199
00:09:43,911 --> 00:09:45,488
I want to sign up
for a membership card.

200
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,790
Coming.

201
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,670
A second. I'll get it for you.

202
00:09:51,244 --> 00:09:52,340
Why are you sitting there?

203
00:09:52,422 --> 00:09:53,400
Come on and drink.

204
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,670
Open it up and pour.

205
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:57,790
Sure. Let's pour.

206
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,360
Do it.

207
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,070
I'll do it.

208
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,160
I'll pour for you.

209
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:01,790
Come.

210
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:02,400
Come.

211
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,240
Mr. Liu,

212
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,360
no rush.

213
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,910
Our restaurant

214
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,910
is about to be renovated.

215
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,590
Why don't you top up 3,000 yuan first?

216
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,550
Right?

217
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,040
3,000 is too little.

218
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,000
5,000.

219
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,430
Oh, my.

220
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,310
That's impressive.

221
00:10:27,177 --> 00:10:28,877
(Big Fish Countryside Restaurant,
5,000 yuan)

222
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,040
Thank you.

223
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,070
Let me pour the drinks.

224
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,190
I'll give you a proper toast.

225
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,400
A proper toast.

226
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,070
What happened?

227
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,040
Why are you crying?

228
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,040
Thanks to you,

229
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,790
the training school order fell through.

230
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,590
The professional design draft
got rejected?

231
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,830
They ended up going with

232
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,310
ready-made uniforms.

233
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,790
I thought I could secure the order

234
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,400
with the 50,000-yuan design fee.

235
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,670
However,

236
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,520
I lost money on the design fee,

237
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,160
fabric,

238
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,040
and factory deposits.

239
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,310
I'm down over a hundred thousand.

240
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,950
Everything I earned

241
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,400
was gone, and I had put in more money.

242
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,000
There, there.

243
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,590
Failure is common
when you start a business.

244
00:11:44,644 --> 00:11:46,622
Consider it a tuition fee
for a lesson learned.

245
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,950
The sample uniform Duole is wearing

246
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,120
looks pretty good.

247
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,670
I can tell you put effort
into the details.

248
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,280
But that little effort

249
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,790
isn't enough.

250
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,950
This tuition fee is way too expensive.

251
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,070
I worked so hard these days,

252
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,190
and now I'm back to square one.

253
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,550
Well, don't overthink it.

254
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:13,480
Take a shower and get some sleep.

255
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,911
Everything will be over.

256
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,950
Let's just consider it a paid lesson.

257
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,480
You can start with a small online store.

258
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,040
That's no problem at all.

259
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,590
Just don't go big all at once.

260
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,000
You're looking down on me.

261
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:26,670
I...

262
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,550
Enough. Just go.

263
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,760
Leave me alone.

264
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:29,710
No, I...

265
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,000
Wait, this...

266
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:33,910
Someone's calling me.

267
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,760
Ruifeng, go on.

268
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,280
Okay. I'll check it now.

269
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,310
This fabric is great.

270
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,070
Too bad no one appreciates it.

271
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:01,670
Lina,

272
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,790
I honestly think you're quite talented.

273
00:14:04,955 --> 00:14:06,244
You just lack experience.

274
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,160
I found out

275
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,280
that the fashion academy
has opened an adult design class.

276
00:14:10,577 --> 00:14:12,733
The designer you worked with
graduated from there.

277
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,120
I've got you a spot.

278
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,190
Really?

279
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:17,800
How much is the tuition?

280
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,310
About 800 yuan for the first semester.

281
00:14:20,355 --> 00:14:21,377
But that's not important.

282
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,444
You should check it out.

283
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:27,830
Lina,

284
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,070
I introduced you to the uniform gig.

285
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,190
Now you've lost money.

286
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,190
I feel sorry about it.

287
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:38,590
I must stand by you through this.

288
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,000
Bai,

289
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,670
you're making me

290
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,160
cry.

291
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:49,830
Lina,

292
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
my coach always said

293
00:14:53,222 --> 00:14:54,622
it's no big deal to hit a wall.

294
00:14:54,777 --> 00:14:55,950
You can always turn around.

295
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,520
You should improve your skills

296
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,120
and keep moving forward.

297
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:00,888
Then you'll be unstoppable.

298
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,520
Life never ceases,

299
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,711
fights never cease.

300
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,120
Say, Bai,

301
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,710
is the Joy Academy you mentioned
a good project?

302
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,550
Of course.

303
00:15:15,555 --> 00:15:17,044
Maybe I should invest a little

304
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,590
to make up for my losses.

305
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:19,790
Sure.

306
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,560
(Bo'ai Building)

307
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,640
Next week,

308
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,310
we have a charity performance
at the East Suburb Nursing Home.

309
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,480
So today,

310
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,000
we're filming a teaser

311
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,310
for the event.

312
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,150
So, Shen

313
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,200
invited Lina and Duole to join us.

314
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,680
They're professionals.

315
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,520
Bravo.

316
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:42,680
We're not that good.

317
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,620
I only won third place
in a national competition.

318
00:15:44,622 --> 00:15:45,760
Behave.

319
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,520
Everyone,

320
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,070
I'll teach you

321
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,550
a few dance moves that I choreographed.

322
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,440
They're simple and easy to learn.

323
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,440
Lina is a pro.

324
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,000
She used to be a dance student.

325
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,200
Thank you, Lina.

326
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,110
Duole,

327
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,200
get ready.

328
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,830
It's your turn now.

329
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,040
Real okay.

330
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,520
I'll teach you the moves now.

331
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,350
At the start, swing your body six times.

332
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,440
At a fast pace.

333
00:16:14,577 --> 00:16:15,630

leader to present the award.

352
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,480
Bravo!

353
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:04,830
Excellent!

354
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,680
Let's have the leader

355
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,111
come to the front for a photo
with the three contestants.

356
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,244
(Wear a smile on your face.)

357
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:18,911
We're preparing
for the municipal sports event.

358
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,390
I'll definitely

359
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:21,920
give you a gold medal.

360
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,288
I mean it.

361
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,110
Bai,

362
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,870
are you sure about using a business loan

363
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,920
to invest in the Joy Academy?

364
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,480
I invested it myself.

365
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,550
It'll be fine.

366
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,440
All right.

367
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,070
I trust you.

368
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,070
Lina,

369
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,830
trust is one thing,

370
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:59,022
but shouldn't you discuss it
with your husband?

371
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,350
I'm not using his money,

372
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,240
so it doesn't matter.

373
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,240
(Applicant: Liu Lina)

374
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:11,720
Ruifeng.

375
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:15,177
Has the payment come through yet?

376
00:18:15,444 --> 00:18:16,390
I just followed up.

377
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,280
They said it'd be delayed
until next week.

378
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,070
Oh, come on.

379
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,440
Drug research burns through money.

380
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,511
Why can't he give me the money?
What should I do?

381
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,040
Shen Qing,

382
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,870
the research has been going on
for eight years.

383
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,200
It's getting harder

384
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,390
and harder.

385
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,630
Is it really not going to work?

386
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,040
Ruifeng,

387
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,520
running a marathon

388
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,110
has its breaking points.

389
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,150
We're at that point right now.

390
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,440
But I believe

391
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,200
we'll push through

392
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,511
and see the finish line.

393
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,680
I'm so tired.

394
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,800
I've thought of something.

395
00:19:16,977 --> 00:19:18,044
We'll cut down the salary.

396
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,920
The R&D team's salaries will be delayed
by one month.

397
00:19:21,177 --> 00:19:23,822
The administrative team's salaries
will be cut by 30 percent.

398
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,390
If we do that, they might leave.

399
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,440
Yes, that's possible.

400
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,550
But I have faith in our team.

401
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,480
This is the only way.

402
00:19:38,555 --> 00:19:39,844
I'll get things ready.

403
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:42,870
Shen.

404
00:19:45,111 --> 00:19:46,150
You've worked hard.

405
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,310
You don't have to say that.

406
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:21,760
My dear brother,

407
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:24,488
why are you sitting in the car?
Why not go home?

408
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,920
I want some peace.

409
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,280
What do you mean?

410
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,680
Can you not be so tense every day?

411
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:32,920
Relax.

412
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,070
Cheer up.

413
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,920
Why do you look so happy?

414
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,310
I'm in a relationship now.

415
00:20:40,577 --> 00:20:41,310
You know what?

416
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,000
He's great in every way.

417
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,680
Your sister

418
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,070
is on the road to happiness.

419
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,150
There will only be potholes.

420
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,070
Why do you sound so negative?

421
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,630
No wonder Lina always nags you.

422
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,000
Qing,

423
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:03,830
look at Dad.

424
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,630
Look, he's happy.

425
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,760
Dad is also

426
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,310
on the road to happiness.

427
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,680
Does his road have potholes too?

428
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,830
Every road has potholes.

429
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,630
I'm ignoring you.

430
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,240
Enjoy your peace.

431
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:28,870
Dad.

432
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,680
- Finally, you're back.
- You gave me a fright.

433
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,310
Gave me a fright, seriously.

434
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,390
Muscles?

435
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,280
You've made real progress lately.

436
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,000
Not bad.

437
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:42,280
Looking good.

438
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,310
Check out this side too.

439
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,350
Impressive.

440
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,310
Jin, go ahead.

441
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,550
Mr. Shen.

442
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,310
The salary adjustment plan is done.

443
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,150
Thanks.

444
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,520
Jin.

445
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,070
If you have

446
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,440
a better opportunity,

447
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,920
Mr. An and I would understand.

448
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,590
Mr. Shen,
don't have to worry about me.

449
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,240
I don't rely on my salary anyway.

450
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,790
I rely on my dad.

451
00:22:14,377 --> 00:22:16,022
Let's just focus on
making good medicine.

452
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,110
My dad's getting older,

453
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,666
and every year his check-up shows
he's got all three high readings.

454
00:22:21,177 --> 00:22:22,390
Let's work hard together.

455
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,550
Take another look.

456
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:28,480
Still need to work hard.

457
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,240
Still need to.

458
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,930
You can start eating
low-fat meals with me.

459
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,240
How could I eat low-fat meals?

460
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,730
Fine, let's eat muscle-gain meals then.

461
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:34,280
Yes.

462
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:01,200
(ICE)
(Used to always say no.)

463
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,870
(Now I want to try saying, why not?)

464
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,310
That's Ice, right? Let me see.

465
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:15,911
Give it to me.

466
00:23:15,955 --> 00:23:16,590
Let me see.

467
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,200
Give it to me!

468
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,680
Let me see!

469
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,200
Can you give me a bit of space?

470
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,520
You want space?

471
00:23:22,711 --> 00:23:24,533
But you still want
the whole family's money.

472
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,310
Shen Qing,
you really do work in finance.

473
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,280
No career growth at the company,

474
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,266
but when it comes to calculating things
at home, you're sharp.

475
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,150
Invested 800,000 yuan...

476
00:23:34,222 --> 00:23:36,155
Are you using this
to transfer joint property?

477
00:23:36,155 --> 00:23:37,440
Our son is starting university.

478
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
How to pay the tuition?

479
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,644
What are you talking about?

480
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:40,644
Am I wrong?

481
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,680
You're always busy.

482
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,000
I treated your career as a top priority.

483
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,550
Have you ever cared about mine?

484
00:23:48,222 --> 00:23:49,830
I started my own business. I lost money.

485
00:23:50,155 --> 00:23:52,488
Our son's going to university now.
What about the money?

486
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,133
My dad wants to buy a burial plot.

487
00:23:58,155 --> 00:23:59,466
My mom wants a wall burial.

488
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,390
They argue about it all the time.

489
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,755
But the only thing they agree on

490
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,550
is saving the money for us.

491
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:06,955
There are financial holes everywhere
in this family,

492
00:24:06,977 --> 00:24:08,730
and they all
need to be filled with money.

493
00:24:08,733 --> 00:24:10,280
Every one of us is supporting you.

494
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,310
But you? You want your own space.

495
00:24:12,866 --> 00:24:14,200
You've got time to go for runs

496
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,440
and sit here ogling women.

497
00:24:15,466 --> 00:24:17,300
Shen Qing,
it must be nice living so carefree.

498
00:24:17,844 --> 00:24:19,222
I don't want to talk to you.

499
00:24:19,377 --> 00:24:20,309
What are you doing?

500
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,311
What do you mean by that?

501
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,920
You come and go
as you please in this house?

502
00:24:24,111 --> 00:24:26,240
You took the money
and now you want to disappear too?

503
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,440
Move aside.

504
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,390
No.

505
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:37,830
Move.

506
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:38,520
I said no!

507
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,550
Move aside!

508
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:40,920
Move aside!

509
00:24:42,377 --> 00:24:44,200
Shen Qing,
how dare you lay a finger on me?

510
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,480
Divorce!

511
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,550
Dad. Mom.

512
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,155
I won't use
the family's money for school.

513
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,350
I'm so angry I could explode.

514
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,680
He nearly hit me yesterday.

515
00:25:23,644 --> 00:25:25,830
I want to divorce Shen Qing.
I want to move out.

516
00:25:26,244 --> 00:25:27,177
You really want out?

517
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:27,870
I do.

518
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
Where would you live?

519
00:25:30,244 --> 00:25:31,577
Your parents' place?

520
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,680
No. My parents are fighting too.

521
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,070
I'm already forty years old

522
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,480
but I've got nowhere to go.

523
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,070
So don't just throw out
the word divorce.

524
00:25:42,155 --> 00:25:43,377
Even if you're done with him,

525
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,790
you've got to take your time.

526
00:25:44,822 --> 00:25:46,090
Act like you're already divorced.

527
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,590
Wean yourself off him emotionally first.

528
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:50,590
Seriously, impulsive divorces
only end up hurting yourself.

529
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:52,760
At least wait for Shen Qing

530
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,000
to bring the money back first.

531
00:25:54,022 --> 00:25:55,466
What if his company goes public?

532
00:25:55,511 --> 00:25:56,350
And you just got angry

533
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,090
and walked away
from your rich lady's future.

534
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,310
You're right.

535
00:26:01,755 --> 00:26:02,866
I need to calm down.

536
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,150
I can't waste my youth
on the Shen family

537
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,488
and end up with no money either.

538
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,680
And you've been ranting
for over an hour,

539
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,044
but I can sum it up in one sentence.

540
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:15,000
Shen Qing won't let you check his phone.

541
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,350
And that's not serious?

542
00:26:16,488 --> 00:26:18,240
If he's got nothing
to hide in his phone,

543
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,350
why won't he let me look?

544
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,960
His whole heart is on that phone.

545
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,960
I even caught a glimpse.

546
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,480
He was looking at pretty girls.

547
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,200
Was it some random girl online,

548
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,590
or a real woman in real life?

549
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,088
She's the project manager
from one of their investors.

550
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:32,888
I've met her.

551
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:33,920
Quite elegant.

552
00:26:34,088 --> 00:26:35,088
Show me the photo.

553
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:43,240
That's her.

554
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,022
Not bad looking.

555
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,310
Pretty attractive.

556
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,190
And she's got a good presence.

557
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,000
No makeup either.

558
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:54,870
Still,

559
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,550
what would she even want from him?

560
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,590
Right? A married man...

561
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,750
Whose wife controls the money
and spends it on their son.

562
00:27:00,755 --> 00:27:01,680
I really don't think so.

563
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,350
Exactly.

564
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:03,550
Shen Qing?

565
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,040
A middle-aged man

566
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,550
with no money, no time, and no youth.

567
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,150
Bad back too.

568
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:08,280
What is there to like?

569
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:10,790
Even if there's nothing going on,

570
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,666
just seeing Shen Qing
like that annoys me.

571
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,350
Let me ask you something.

572
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:16,830
So,

573
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,920
should a couple be stuck together

574
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,240
like conjoined twins,

575
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,520
or is it okay
to have a bit of personal space?

576
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,280
I think in a family,

577
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,680
there shouldn't

578
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,070
be a divide.

579
00:27:28,155 --> 00:27:29,590
Then why didn't you tell Shen Qing

580
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,590
about investing in Bai?

581
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,350
I...

582
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,350
No, that's... That's totally different.

583
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:36,711
How is it different?

584
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,110
Anyway, right now I'm just

585
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,630
a complete failure.

586
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
No job,

587
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,440
failed investment,

588
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,000
a son who struggles at school,

589
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,280
and a husband I never see.

590
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:49,790
Tell me,

591
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,720
Bai gave me two tickets to a concert,

592
00:27:53,044 --> 00:27:55,000
and I can't even
find someone to go with me.

593
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:58,350
That Bai has been
showing up a bit too often lately.

594
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,760
Seriously, it's a little much.

595
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,960
Come clean. What's the story?

596
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,200
Show the photo.

597
00:28:05,466 --> 00:28:07,540
You weren't even going
to show us if we hadn't asked.

598
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,440
Here, take a look.

599
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,310
She saved a photo?

600
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,000
Of course she did.

601
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,110
Not bad at all.

602
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,150
That body totally beats Shen Qing.

603
00:28:16,244 --> 00:28:17,040
He is good-looking.

604
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,150
He's a swimmer, you know.

605
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,280
Look at those muscles.

606
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,830
You're going completely off track.

607
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,200
We're just normal friends.

608
00:28:24,422 --> 00:28:26,000
I'll go to the concert with you.

609
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,680
I want to see this

610
00:28:27,888 --> 00:28:28,830
so-called normal friend.

611
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,390
Take a good look.

612
00:28:30,911 --> 00:28:32,390
See what his real intentions are.

613
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,150
Anyway, don't worry about work.

614
00:28:34,177 --> 00:28:35,444
Worst case, come work with me.

615
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,920
But I don't know how to do anything.

616
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:41,870
Even if you were useless,

617
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,280
I'd still love you. Happy now?

618
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,720
Thank goodness I have you two.

619
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,720
Hey, baby.

620
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,830
I didn't give him a like, I swear.

621
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,280
Don't get jealous
for no reason, alright?

622
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:04,488
Okay, I'm hanging up.

623
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:07,680
Take notes.

624
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,480
Hurry up. You're the last one.

625
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:14,720
Look.

626
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,830
This school uniform?

627
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:18,390
My mom designed it.

628
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,310
She's really professional.

629
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,466
Don't look down on my mom.

630
00:29:21,888 --> 00:29:23,550
Do you know what this pocket on the arm

631
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,240
is meant for?

632
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:24,955
What's it for?

633
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,590
No idea.

634
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,222
What's this?

635
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,790
Meal card.

636
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,830
What's it for?

637
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,550
Meal card.

638
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,350
For holding the card!

639
00:29:29,466 --> 00:29:30,790
You lose yours a lot, don't you?

640
00:29:30,844 --> 00:29:32,280
- Already lost three or four.
- Right?

641
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
And you too...

642
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,000
Me?

643
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,200
I saw you getting a replacement.

644
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,760
Yes.

645
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,000
And let me tell you,

646
00:29:37,022 --> 00:29:38,580
our uniforms didn't use to have hoods.

647
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,590
Look at this.

648
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,110
Put on the hood,

649
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,830
and it's seriously stylish.

650
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,533
It really is.

651
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:44,200
Let's get hyped.

652
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:44,790
Let's rap.

653
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,520
So fashionable.

654
00:29:46,866 --> 00:29:48,600
The first-generation drug was launched.

655
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:50,480
It saved many patients with ALK-positive

656
00:29:50,511 --> 00:29:52,066
anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.

657
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,790
But after about a year of use,

658
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,150
they all develop resistance.

659
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:58,280
What you're doing is truly meaningful.

660
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,440
It's not that noble.

661
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,680
After all, M701

662
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,280
could bring in huge profits

663
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,720
if it manages to get approved.

664
00:30:07,777 --> 00:30:09,390
You've all staked everything on this.

665
00:30:09,822 --> 00:30:11,200
And it still might not go to market.

666
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,920
This recruitment phase
is randomized and open-label.

667
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,310
An Ruifeng and I
already had a good cry about it.

668
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:17,790
Then we decided

669
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:19,644
to fight till the end.

670
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:23,733
I'll have the report out tomorrow.

671
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,200
We're recruiting

672
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,110
patients with central
nervous system metastases

673
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,630
for M701 diagnosis and treatment.

674
00:30:34,088 --> 00:30:36,580
There are several brain metastasis
patients in our department.

675
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,110
At this point, there are basically
no drugs left to try.

676
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,000
I'll go back and sort through the cases.

677
00:30:41,155 --> 00:30:42,590
Maybe I can recommend some of them.

678
00:30:42,755 --> 00:30:43,960
Give them one last chance.

679
00:30:44,022 --> 00:30:44,911
- No problem.
- Yes.

680
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,280
Now there's hope.

681
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,960
I've got a few eligible patients too.

682
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:48,520
Great.

683
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,911
We've probably got three
or four in our department as well.

684
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,240
Wonderful. Send me the list.

685
00:30:54,355 --> 00:30:55,800
I'll do my best to include everyone.

686
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,280
There's a nice restaurant nearby.

687
00:31:02,422 --> 00:31:03,400
Want to give it a try?

688
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,550
I'll pass.

689
00:31:04,888 --> 00:31:06,390
A friend's visiting Nanjing today.

690
00:31:06,644 --> 00:31:07,622
I'm showing him around.

691
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,280
That...

692
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,760
"Why not"?

693
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:15,555
You saw my Moments, didn't you?

694
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,240
He's the nephew
of one of my dad's friends.

695
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,760
My dad's been wanting to introduce us.

696
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,350
I always said no.

697
00:31:27,688 --> 00:31:29,070
Why do we have to get married?

698
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,390
I can live well on my own.

699
00:31:32,555 --> 00:31:33,830
Especially with my parents,

700
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:35,790
look at how things
turned out between them.

701
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,955
And they still keep pushing me to date.

702
00:31:38,288 --> 00:31:39,440
I really don't get it.

703
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:45,200
Excuse me.

704
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,680
After my dad got sick,

705
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:06,630
I realized

706
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,440
having someone by your side

707
00:32:10,755 --> 00:32:11,920
really makes things easier.

708
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,150
We finally managed

709
00:32:24,866 --> 00:32:27,244
to get a specialist appointment
at the cancer hospital.

710
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,110
He handled everything,

711
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,960
and drove us there and back.

712
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,830
Dad reacted badly.

713
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,520
He kept throwing up.

714
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,230
My proud, strong dad

715
00:32:45,311 --> 00:32:46,040
cried...

716
00:32:47,288 --> 00:32:48,977
He said he
didn't want treatment anymore.

717
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:54,360
I was about to break too.

718
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,230
But him?

719
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,320
He kept driving,

720
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,480
comforting my dad as he went.

721
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,400
He told him

722
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,040
cancer

723
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,400
is basically a chronic illness now.

724
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,670
New drugs come out every year.

725
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,960
Don't stress.

726
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,320
Stay positive.

727
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,230
Don't give up.

728
00:33:18,777 --> 00:33:20,777
I looked at him
through the rear view mirror.

729
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,440
So calm.

730
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:24,710
And I thought,

731
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:27,711
thank goodness he was here.

732
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:36,155
I've taken my mom to see doctors before.

733
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,320
It was never easy.

734
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:39,960
I get it.

735
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,190
While waiting for his test results,

736
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,520
I was incredibly anxious.

737
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,480
He stood by my side,

738
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,400
and I felt calmer.

739
00:34:02,555 --> 00:34:04,400
Seeing how much
you care about your family,

740
00:34:06,688 --> 00:34:08,070
I want a family of my own too.

741
00:34:25,866 --> 00:34:26,960
Where are you meeting?

742
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:27,960
I can drop you off.

743
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,590
It's alright.

744
00:34:28,622 --> 00:34:29,520
He's already there.

745
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,440
I'll be off then.

746
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:14,265
♪The silver boat swaying and arching♪

747
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:18,083
♪In the soft velvety sky♪

748
00:35:19,721 --> 00:35:24,835
♪Your disarrayed thoughts,

Stop, Mr. Shen.

766
00:36:47,755 --> 00:36:48,600
Let it down.

767
00:36:50,133 --> 00:36:51,150
With this much weight,

768
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,710
you're lifting too fast.

769
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,000
Your knees can't take it.

770
00:36:55,644 --> 00:36:56,630

773
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:00,960
No need to rush.

774
00:37:03,044 --> 00:37:03,710
Take a break.

775
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,550
How many sets have you done?

776
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,230
Hit the target.

777
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,670
You're impressive.

778
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:19,630
(Wind and Rainbow Choir)
Watch your step.

779
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:22,320
(A Charity Performance at East Suburb)
Careful. Mind your step going up.

780
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,710
Alright, I think it's good.

781
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,755
Let's secure it. Secure it.

782
00:37:26,755 --> 00:37:27,230
Come on.

783
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,960
Make way.

784
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,900
- Here come the chairs.
- Why are you carrying two?

785
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,440
What are you doing, Shen?

786
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,110
Working out?

787
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,480
Why would I work out here?

788
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,190
I go to the gym every day now.

789
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,230
Shen, not bad.

790
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:43,777
- Looking fit.
- Really noticeable.

791
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,400
In great shape.

792
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,480
It works.

793
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,070
Come on. Line those chairs up properly.

794
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,000
Fix this.

795
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:52,590
Hold on.

796
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,755
Alright, it's secured.

797
00:37:57,244 --> 00:37:58,800
You're just sitting there? Seriously?

798
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,800
Where did she go again?

799
00:38:00,422 --> 00:38:01,670
Come on, let's go check.

800
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,800
Move more chairs here.

801
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:03,630
Coming.

802
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:09,750
Heibao.

803
00:38:10,511 --> 00:38:11,844
What are you doing here?

804
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,840
I saw the choir video.

805
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,920
Said you were performing here.

806
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,400
So I came

807
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,800
to give you this.

808
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:23,920
What?

809
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,630
I promised you,

810
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,230
I'd give you

811
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,400
a champion's medal.

812
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,320
You won the championship?

813
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:34,920
Yeah.

814
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:35,630
Really?

815
00:38:36,888 --> 00:38:38,320
Last year's champion showed up too.

816
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,800
He's really good.

817
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,710
In the first half,

818
00:38:41,866 --> 00:38:43,230
I was one boat length behind him.

819
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:45,800
In the second half,
I gave it everything.

820
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,710
At the finish line,

821
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,150
I beat him by ten centimeters.

822
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,360
When I overtook him,

823
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,440
all I could see were stars.

824
00:39:00,111 --> 00:39:01,533
And all I could think about was you.

825
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:04,710
Really.

826
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,190
You did it.

827
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,270
I'm really proud of you.

828
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:19,190
Truly.

829
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:26,670
Heibao.

830
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,360
We've been together for three years.

831
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,670
And you've treated me
so well all this time.

832
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,960
I'm grateful for that.

833
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,630
But at our age, being together

834
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,070
isn't just

835
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,960
about you and me and a love story.

836
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,630
There are parents and children involved.

837
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,110
There's family.

838
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,590
And all kinds of social ties.

839
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,070
All we can be

840
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:00,444
is a beautiful regret.

841
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,840
Mr. Shen and I...

842
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,750
I get along well with his family.

843
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,270
His daughter really likes me.

844
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,230
Wish me well.

845
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,311
What's that hanging around his neck?

846
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:26,630
A gold medal?

847
00:40:28,711 --> 00:40:29,888
If that's the case, then...

848
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,960
Then Shen...

849
00:40:32,755 --> 00:40:33,440
What about him?

850
00:40:36,622 --> 00:40:37,710
The pressure, obviously.

851
00:40:47,466 --> 00:40:48,600
Come on, put a shirt on.

852
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:49,360
Why?

853
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,270
Just put it on. Come on.

854
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:50,710
I...

855
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:51,840
What are you doing?

856
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:52,960
What's your point?

857
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,750
We just saw Li Heibao.

858
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,630
His arms are thicker than your thighs.

859
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,630
Your arms are

860
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,710
barely the size of his wrists at best.

861
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,070
What are you even flexing for?

862
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,710
Don't listen to him.
It's not that dramatic.

863
00:41:06,711 --> 00:41:07,177
What?

864
00:41:07,266 --> 00:41:08,177
Stop talking nonsense.

865
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,590
So what if he's got big arms?

866
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,750
Everyone's got their strengths.

867
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,840
I'm doing it for your sake.

868
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:16,710
Come on.

869
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,577
Listen to yourself.

870
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,000
I said it for his own good.

871
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,710
For his own good.

872
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,480
Obviously.

873
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,480
You can't blame me.

874
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,244
Can you blame me?

875
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,270
Why did he show up?

876
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,270
Seemed like he came to hang that gold...

877
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,520
Waiting for the right moment

878
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,320
and ready to turn the tables.

879
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:33,590
Me?

880
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,270
Of course.

881
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:47,150
Shen Qing.

882
