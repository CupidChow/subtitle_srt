00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,140
=Episode 15=

3
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,970
I'm sorry, Ms. Nie.

4
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:56,600
I really am.

5
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,810
No need to be sorry.

6
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,320
I was

7
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:04,760
diagnosed with

8
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,570
breast cancer ten years ago.

9
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,290
I had

10
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,850
a mastectomy.

11
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,290
I lost my father

12
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,290
when I was

13
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,480
only a little child.

14
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,880
Then,

15
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,370
soon after I started working,

16
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,410
my brother had an accident.

17
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:39,880
After that,

18
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,810
my husband fell ill

19
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,370
and passed.

20
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:45,640
And then,

21
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,400
my son

22
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,080
moved overseas.

23
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,610
One by one,

24
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,880
everyone around me slowly left me.

25
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,050
Honestly,

26
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,810
I realized long ago

27
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,490
that life

28
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,400
is just a string of goodbyes.

29
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,370
As for death,

30
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,400
I've made peace with it.

31
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:17,930
But Mr. Zhuoran,

32
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,690
look at this.

33
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,610
Look at my left hand.

34
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,280
I can only...

35
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,470
raise it this high.

36
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,280
Sometimes, when I walk,

37
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,400
I lose my balance.

38
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,320
Death

39
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,730
doesn't scare me.

40
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,010
But living with this ailing body

41
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,370
is what I have to face every single day.

42
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:55,930
So, I figured

43
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,610
I should probably just

44
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:00,880
keep things simple.

45
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:32,250
What a beautiful day and scene,
yet the heavens seem so cruel.

46
00:04:33,760 --> 00:05:00,490
Who's lucky enough to enjoy
such pleasures in their own garden?

47
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,320
Shen Duole.

48
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,250
Why aren't you doing your homework?

49
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,930
Mom, come look!

50
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,880
Grandpa's already on his fifth lap!

51
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,690
It's so windy out today.

52
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:33,760
He might catch a cold.

53
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,010
Go on, get Grandpa inside.

54
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:36,690
Mom.

55
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,930
Judging by his vibe,

56
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,730
he's ruminating.

57
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:42,320
He is troubled.

58
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,960
So, he's just walking in circles.

59
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,180
What could be troubling him?

60
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,250
You wouldn't get it. He's in love.

61
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,840
Oh, and you do?

62
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:55,760
Not really.

63
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,880
You're in your sophomore year!

64
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,690
Don't get lovesick now.
Go do your homework!

65
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,440
Fine.

66
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,640
(Ten years ago,)

67
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,570
(I was diagnosed with breast cancer.)

68
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,840
(So I had)

69
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,610
(a mastectomy.)

70
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,330
(Chen Jingmin, Tumor Genetic
Test Report, Zijin First Hospital)

71
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:56,370
(Honestly, I realized long ago)

72
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,320
(that life)

73
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,370
(is just a string of goodbyes.)

74
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,400
(Death)

75
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,850
(doesn't scare me.)

76
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,010
(But living with this ailing body)

77
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,450
(is what I have to face
every single day.)

78
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,680
(So, I figured)

79
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,370
(I should probably just)

80
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,610
(keep things simple.)

81
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:42,880
Trust me,

82
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,640
you should never
send your kids overseas.

83
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:47,600
They're so far away.

84
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,010
If something happens,

85
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:50,970
you'll be worried sick.

86
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,760
My daughter's sister-in-law,

87
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,090
you know her, right?

88
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,400
Back home,

89
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,680
she was waited on hand and foot.

90
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:03,640
Now that she's abroad,

91
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,760
she has to do everything herself.

92
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,260
Every time she comes back,
she's all tan and skinny.

93
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,520
She looks like a refugee.

94
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,450
That girl...

95
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:14,560
Something's up.

96
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,280
Forget it.

97
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,210
I'm hanging up.

98
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,680
I called you, and you didn't pick up.

99
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,920
Wow, you bought so much stuff!

100
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,280
And there's more?

101
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,860
Let me give you a hand.

102
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,850
- Just lie down.
- I got it. Get some rest.

103
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,280
You lied on the couch doing nothing.

104
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,850
I carried all these bags myself!

105
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,130
Here.

106
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,560
- Don't you think...
- Sit down.

107
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,130
I'm so tired that I could pass out.

108
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,560
Honestly, with you,

109
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,800
it's the same
whether you're here or not.

110
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,610
Baoqin, come on.

111
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,560
You could've texted me.

112
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,040
I didn't know you bought so much.

113
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,130
What text?

114
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:49,920
You know what?

115
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,640
I fixed that shoe cabinet

116
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,730
by the door.

117
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,640
What do you want?

118
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:55,970
A medal or something?

119
00:08:58,730 --> 00:08:59,680
Who was on the phone?

120
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,010
A friend of Duan's.

121
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,730
Duole's planning to study abroad.

122
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,800
My advice was needed.

123
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,290
Was it a man or a woman?

124
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,450
Woman.

125
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,370
A woman?

126
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,230
Come back here.

127
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,280
Listen to me.

128
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,520
You should stay away from Duan.

129
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,140
He made some serious mistakes
when he was young.

130
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,500
He has issues with his conduct.

131
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,370
That was years ago.

132
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,090
His wife's already passed away.

133
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,430
Are you just waiting for me to die too?

134
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:52,830
They're here.

135
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,400
Liu!

136
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,130
Peng!

137
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,640
Come on in.

138
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,520
Wow, that's a lot of stuff!

139
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,650
Were you at the supermarket?

140
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,010
Let me help you unpack.

141
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,490
No, sit down. Take a seat.

142
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,110
We don't keep flowers at home anymore.

143
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:05,560
Go on.

144
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,400
It's not for you.

145
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,210
- It's a pretty flower.
- Sit down.

146
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:11,730
Isn't it lovely? I just bought it.

147
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,280
Baoqin, sit. Come on.

148
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:16,850
I'm exhausted.

149
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,160
Look at this magnolia.

150
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,210
It's so tough and hardy.

151
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,800
It's much easier to care
for than moth orchids.

152
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,020
And it smells great too.

153
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:27,760
Really?

154
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,210
Aren't you going to
Lina's place this afternoon?

155
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,880
Take it to Professor Shen
for me, will you?

156
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,110
And this chicken soup, too.

157
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,850
I spent the morning making it.

158
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,020
Take a taxi over, okay?

159
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,210
I'll cover the fare.

160
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,280
Peng Yulan.

161
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,520
Here's how I see it.

162
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,880
You really

163
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,130
shouldn't put your eggs in one basket.

164
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,800
Try different options.

165
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,520
Have a few backups ready.

166
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:56,560
Oh right.

167
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,090
Duan used to

168
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,040
drive the forklift at our factory.

169
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,850
Remember him?

170
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,130
He was quite the looker.

171
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,040
His wife passed away.

172
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,920
If you're even a little interested,

173
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:07,880
I could

174
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,340
fix you up with him.

175
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:10,920
Come on, Baoqin.

176
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:11,640
Are you...

177
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,130
Didn't you just say

178
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,430
not to get involved with Duan?

179
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,790
Because he has conduct issues?

180
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,880
Hey, is everything sorted?

181
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:22,920
All done.

182
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,130
I'm heading to my room.

183
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,610
Peng.

184
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:26,450
Chat away.

185
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:27,280
Sure.

186
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,040
Unbelievable.

187
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,850
What were you saying
about Professor Shen?

188
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,210
She is fine.

189
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,010
Why do you ask?

190
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,330
I heard from Lina that

191
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,010
he's barely eating or drinking.

192
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:50,610
All he does is walk in circles.

193
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,110
He won't respond to anything.

194
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,330
He's lost his spirit.

195
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,760
It must have something
to do with that fairy.

196
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,490
Did they have a falling out?

197
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:02,880
No idea.

198
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,090
Peng Yulan, trust me.

199
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,040
Save the flowers for yourself.

200
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,560
Enjoy growing them.

201
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:11,800
Right? Why get yourself disappointed?

202
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:13,760
It's so heavy.

203
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,199
And I still have to carry it back.

204
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,560
Taking another taxi
would cost even more.

205
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,280
How about this?

206
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,160
Take it over there for now.

207
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,450
Just leave it at Lina's place.

208
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,970
I'll swing by every few days
to take care of it.

209
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,970
Take the chicken soup too.

210
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,130
Just don't tell him I made it.

211
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,550
Doing good without asking for credit?

212
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,570
What is wrong with you?

213
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,730
Food is fuel, so people need to eat.

214
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,130
He needs to eat.

215
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,640
Didn't you say he's lost his soul?

216
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,280
Well, with this soup,

217
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,970
I'll bring his soul back.

218

225
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,560
Alright, let's take a break.

226
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,800
We'll continue later. Take a break.

227
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,130
Okay.

228
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,130
That's so sad.

229
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,130
Breast cancer.

230
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,010
Wait.

231
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,680
Ms. Nie had breast cancer too?

232
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,040
She said it herself.

233
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,370
She had it ten years ago.

234
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,130
She's better now.

235
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,610
Still, it's scary.

236
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:24,800
Shen...

237
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,800
Breast cancer has
a high cure rate nowadays.

238
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,560
But in Jingmin's case,
it had already spread.

239
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,970
She didn't have a chance.

240
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,330
Shen.

241
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,210
Think about it.

242
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,680
At our age,

243
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,330
who doesn't have
a few parts that are broken?

244
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:41,880
That's life.

245
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,400
It's really not a big deal.

246
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,850
That's not what I meant.

247
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,730
You don't understand how I feel.

248
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,560
Now, every time I hear the word cancer,

249
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,920
I feel dizzy, I swear.

250
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,830
What happened with Jingmin

251
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,850
left me traumatized.

252
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:58,560
Yes, of course.

253
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:02,970
How about...

254
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,020
How about this?

255
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,280
For now,

256
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,730
let's not bring up cancer.

257
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,450
We'll just tell Ms. Nie

258
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,330
that Tian

259
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,850
is a bit off with her Kunqu singing.

260
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,330
So we want Ms. Nie

261
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,590
to give her some guidance.

262
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,920
Tian, yes!

263
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:19,160
That's perfect.

264
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,920
We'll set up flowers,
banners, the whole deal.

265
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:22,490
You...

266
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,090
Call her right now.

267
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:24,950
We'll start singing.

268
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,010
Let her hear it, yeah?

269
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:26,449
Alright!

270
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,040
Let's go sing.

271
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,160
Call her.

272
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:28,950
We'll get ready.

273
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:29,370
Okay.

274
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:29,680
Okay.

275
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,690
Alright, come on!

276
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,250
Right now,

277
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,600
we're going live

278
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,690
with our Kunqu consultant, Ms. Nie.

279
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,010
Let's sing it for her

280
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,360
and get her feedback, okay?

281
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,250
Alright.

282
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:48,450
Great!

283
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:52,760
Ms. Nie.

284
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,320
"Jasmine Flower" is simple,

285
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:56,840
but in its simplicity

286
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,250
is real beauty.

287
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,840
We're rehearsing right now.

288
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,180
Please have a listen.

289
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:12,250
Even in a garden full of blossoms,
none smells as sweet.

290
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:17,970
I wanted to pick one and wear it,

291
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:26,080
but I feared it would not
bloom again next year.

292
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:32,490
Such a perfect moment,
such a cruel heaven.

293
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:43,210
Who gets to enjoy beauty
and joy in their own yard?

294
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,320
Ms. Nie.

295
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,320
About that Kunqu line

296
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,170
we added,

297
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,600
some say it sounds too melancholic.

298
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,600
Do you think we could swap it out?

299
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,930
We're rehearsing here every day now,

300
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,420
and everyone's really hoping

301
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,890
you'll guide us in person.

302
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,040
Right?

303
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,560
Yes, absolutely!

304
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,450
Ms. Nie, please come.

305
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:09,800
We need you.

306
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:24,890
I remember where we met
by the painted bridge.

307
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:38,930
The flowers were full of spirit
and the willows were tender and soft.

308
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,040
Lovely.

309
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,520
So lovely.

310
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:10,450
(Meeting again,
remembering the painted bridge.)

311
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:28,170
(The flowers were full of spirit
and the willows were tender and soft.)

312
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:29,760
Dad.

313
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,510
Did you finish eating? I'll do the dishes.

314
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,560
I washed the dishes.

315
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,800
You cleared the table too.

316
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,650
I cleaned the thermos and the bowls.

317
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,560
You finished all the soup.

318
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,850
You had a good appetite today.

319
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,410
You should say the soup today

320
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,560
was really good.

321
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:47,800
That's why I finished it.

322
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:50,690
Lina.

323
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,120
You got your hair permed?

324
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,730
It's been like this for a week now.

325
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,650
You just noticed?

326
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:58,600
A whole week?

327
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,210
It really suits you.

328
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:02,990
It looks great.

329
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,450
Where's the lid for the thermos?

330
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,730
Is it

331
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:08,930
by the sink?

332
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:16,600
Such a lovely jasmine flower.

333
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,600
Such a lovely jasmine flower.

334
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,080
Look at this.

335
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,490
He cleared the plate.

336
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,690
Did you hear what she said?

337
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:30,650
"Mom.

338
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,040
My father-in-law finished
all the chicken soup."

339
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,250
"He even washed the container clean."

340
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,090
"He's in such a good mood today
he's started singing!"

341
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,760
"None smells as sweet."

342
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,280
It's your soup.

343
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,900
Your soup revitalized his happiness.

344
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,320
I added codonopsis root.

345
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,210
Looks like Professor Shen
really liked the taste.

346
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,170
I'll make him

347
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:56,970
the soup again.

348
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,490
Peng Yulan...

349
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,690
Codonopsis is expensive!

350
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,250
You're going all in, huh?

351
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,650
I have to!

352
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,840
Didn't you say

353
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:07,890
he had

354
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,450
lost his soul?

355
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,890
Then, I have to bring it back.

356
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,490
You're bringing his soul back?

357
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,730
Love is adding poetry
to an ordinary life.

358
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,220
Did you blow-dry your hair?

359
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,760
Yeah, it took a while.

360
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,080
Shen Qing.

361
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,410
Can you do it or not?

362
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:40,650
Nope.

363
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:41,760
I can't.

364
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,650
What's that supposed to mean?

365
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,170
I'm exhausted
from back-to-back meetings.

366
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,360
Give me a few days.

367
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,460
I'll be good in a few days.

368
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,010
Alright.

369
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,760
That young guy can sing.

370
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,040
Even the old man can sing.

371
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,080
And you, a Top Ten singer,
is out of business.

372
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,560
Just look at them!

373
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,250
Then, look at yourself.
What a huge gap.

374
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,080
So how do I close that gap?

375
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,600
Quit my job and sing at home all day?

376
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,120
Is that gonna boost revenue
or cut costs?

377
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,840
Shen Qing, and you called me shallow?

378
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,490
You're the shallow one!

379
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:12,900
Come on.

380
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,010
Look.

381
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,970
What?

382
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,650
It's Steven. Lin Fengyun's boyfriend.

383
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,210
So full of emotion.

384
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,600
He recorded this in a studio.

385
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,490
♪The long summer blooms

386

391
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,490
That's it.

392
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,800
Shen Qing, you're getting corny.

393
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,650
Back in the day,
you were such an artsy guy.

394
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,080
Top Ten Campus Singers.
You ranked tenth.

395
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,010
Can you not be this lame?

396
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,890
Listen to that mix.

397
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,730
Listen to that backing vocal.

398
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,410
Can't you at least pick up the basics?

399
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,580
How exactly do I learn that?

400
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,560
Love is about adding poetry
to an ordinary life.

401
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,120
Back in college,
you used to write poetry too.

402
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
So many girls back then

403
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,760
said you were like walking poetry.

404
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:08,730
Now look at you.

405
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,170
You're a walking calculator.

406
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,270
By the way,

407
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,890
don't forget the ten promises.

408
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,600
You said you'd read poetry to me.

409
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,890
You used to be so romantic.

410
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:17,630
(Ice Li,)
And now...

411
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,199
(Outdoor jog: 4.41 kilometers)
You're barely reaching to your dad.

412
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,690
I'm serious.

413
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,600
What are you laughing at?

414
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,890
Did you even hear what I said?

415
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:27,450
What did you say?

416
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,280
What did you put in my drawer again?

417
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,280
Doesn't matter. Read me a poem.

418
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:38,450
Read.

419
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,410
Right now?

420
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,890
You promised you'd read me a poem.

421
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:42,320
I...

422
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,929
You can't perform your ''duties,''

423
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,180
and you won't even read a poem?

424
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,970
Alright, fine.

425
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:54,970
Wait.

426
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,480
Let me put on a face mask.

427
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,450
Wind and Rain

428
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,120
by

429
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:01,560
Shen Qing.

430
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,080
Behind the wind, there is more wind.

431
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,840
Ahead of the rain, there is more rain.

432
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,120
And my heart is full

433
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,490
of you.

434
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:15,930
Wait, hold on.

435
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,380
Let me record this.

436
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,360
Record what?

437
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,600
You reciting the poem, of course!

438
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,519
I'm in pajamas!
Why would you record this?

439
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,890
Seriously, who are you
even showing it to?

440
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,890
Stop recording!

441
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:31,490
Then,

442
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,800
at least record the audio?

443
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,660
Just the audio.

444
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:35,280
Fine.

445
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,830
But you're not allowed to post it.

446
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:40,410
From the top?

447
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:41,650
From the top.

448
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,080
Behind the wind, there is more wind.

449
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,120
"Ahead of the rain, there is more rain."

450
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,120
"And my heart is full

451
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,560
of you."

452
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,120
"I've walked across many bridges,

453
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,560
seen many clouds,

454
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:03,890
but I've only ever loved

455
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,040
you."

456
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,560
"You always ask me

457
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,170
why I chose you."

458
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,520
"The answer's too long."

459
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,840
"I'll need a lifetime to answer it."

460
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,280
"I used all my wits
just to create our encounter."

461
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,120
"At every intersection in this city,

462
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,650
I'd run into you."

463
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,800
"You'd run into me."

464
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:32,600
Silly girl.

465
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,250
"What you call fate,

466
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:35,840
was really just me

467
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,210
and my affection."

468
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:44,320
(Shen Qing, the vigor of youth
in a jaded old man!)

469
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,600
(What do you guys know?)

470
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:46,890
(Shen Qing and Liu Lina)

471
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,970
(are the last couple
standing from our class.)

472
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:49,970
(Now that's love.)

473
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,409
(I'm reposting that right now.)

474
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,550
(Spreading some positivity!)

475
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:57,710
The meeting is starting.

476
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,220
Are you...

477
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:01,040
What's wrong?

478
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,250
Oh...

479
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,080
The keyboard is acting up.

480
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,690
It might be out of battery.

481
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,030
I'll get someone
to change the batteries.

482
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,130
Let's head to the meeting.

483
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,970
Yes. Let's go.

484
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:14,830
Let's go.

485
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,250
Did you see Mr. Shen's Moments post?

486
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,730
Sorry I'm late, Mr. An.

487
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,170
Mr. Shen.

488
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:36,690
That was something.

489
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,350
I reposted it for you.

490
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,040
Literary model employee!

491
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,730
Oh, come on, don't make it worse.

492
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,170
Lina was just messing around
when she posted that.

493
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,360
Delete it. Take it down!

494
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:46,890
Ice.

495
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,040
Did you see what he posted?

496
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:49,860
Yeah, I saw it.

497
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,730
Mr. Shen's pretty poetic, huh?

498
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,760
Let's not let my private life

499
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,210
take up public time.

500
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,450
Ice's time is valuable.

501
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,520
Let's start the meeting.

502
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,890
Alright, let's begin the meeting then.

503
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:01,800
Okay.

504
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,280
So,

505
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,450
the investors

506
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,080
have approved

507
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,730
our plan to reduce costs by 10%.

508
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,840
Mr. Shen will
walk us through the details.

509
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,490
As of now,

510
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:17,800
our operating costs

511
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,010
have been cut by 18%.

512
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:22,010
We made specific adjustments
in three areas.

513
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,690
First, we reduced
the number of meetings.

514
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:28,490
All unnecessary ones will be scrapped.

515
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:29,690
Second,

516
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:30,930
we gave up office space

517
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,410
that wasn't being

518
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:34,520
fully utilized.

519
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,730
And third,

520
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,520
we lowered the travel standards
for all employees.

521
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,410
There's only one goal in doing this.

522
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,320
To protect R&D at all costs.

523
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,280
Mr. Shen, may I say something?

524
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,120
I know times are tough for everyone.

525
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,520
But I still have to say this.

526
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,840
I won't be able to finish
the trial in six months.

527
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:01,800
Why not?

528
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,450
We're short on people.

529
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,490
If we want the R&D to succeed,

530
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,490
we have to set up a dedicated lab team.

531
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,660
That's not possible.

532
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,210
You've already spent

533
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,250
over 15 million.

534
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,010
That much?

535
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,760
Do the math.

536
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,970
The test macaques
used to cost 30,000 each.

537
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,800
Now they're 200,000 a piece.

538
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,450
You need 10 monkeys
for one round of testing.

539
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,760
If you add another group,

540
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,280
that's just too risky.

541
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,960
If we're just trying to save money,

542
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,320
there's no point doing R&D at all.

543
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:41,690
Dr. Qin.

544
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,930
I'm anxious too.

545
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,890
Honestly, I'm so desperate I could

546
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,520
devolve into a monkey

547
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,930
just so you'd have
one more for your tests.

548
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,600
Then, let's both go be monkeys.

549
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:55,890
What monkey?

550
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,110
Being a monkey isn't easy.

551
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,210
Ice, what do you think?

552
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,730
R&D costs going up this fast
is a problem.

553
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,280
But, there's one way.

554
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,320
We've invested in
a few pharma companies this year.

555
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,420
I can connect
RF Pharmaceuticals with them.

556
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,520
Outsource some of the basic tests

557
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:19,800
to buy us some time.

558
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,250
What do you all think?

559
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:27,800
That's great.

560
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:28,840
That way,

561
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,730
we can use someone else's monkeys
to run our trials.

562
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,730
Most importantly,

563
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,320
you don't have to be the monkey.

564
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,800
Thanks, Ice.

565
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,560
I can go back to being human.

566
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,650
Alright. Stay human.

567
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,760
Let's move on.

568
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,010
Yeah, let's keep going.

569
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,890
See, moth orchids may look pretty,

570
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,210
but they're really hard to keep alive.

571
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,320
If you want a life, go with magnolias.

572
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:00,250
Right?

573
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,450
Look at the head nurse.

574
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:02,900
She wants a house.

575
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,970
That fairy lady wants his soul.

576
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,520
And even phone credit.

577
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,450
But Peng Yulan?
She doesn't want anything.

578
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,560
And the key is she makes pork knuckles

579
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,970
and soup too!

580
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,410
And they're both amazing.

581
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,320
Better than any chef.

582
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:14,860
You know why?

583
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,250
Because she cooks with love.

584
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,420
And that fairy?

585
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:19,560
She's special.

586
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,320
But what's the point?

587
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,270
She doesn't show up in person.

588
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,929
At least she's not getting in the way

589
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,730
of Peng Yulan becoming
your stepmother-in-law.

590
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,490
Don't be so surprised.

591
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,690
Sure, moth orchids
are nice on a windowsill.

592
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:34,030
Right? But...

593
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:34,970
But this is

594
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,210
the magnolia.

595
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,890
It purifies the air
when you keep it indoors.

596
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,080
That's a win-win situation!

597
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:41,970
Mom.

598
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,040
What kind of mindset is that?

599
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,450
What's wrong with it?

600
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:47,170
What did I say that's so bad?

601
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:48,360
Your father-in-law

602
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,080
and that fairy lady

603
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,120
don't even meet face to face.

604
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,210
They just write letters,

605
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:55,600
make calls,

606
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,929
and sing a little opera.

607
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:57,890
She can do

608
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:58,760
whatever she pleases.

609
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,210
And if

610
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,600
she wants to sing opera,
then let her sing.

611
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:02,520
Peng Yulan

612
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,010
likes doing housework,

613
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,449
loves taking care of flowers,

614
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,890
so let her do that too.

615
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,320
Let's be honest. At our age,

616
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:12,210
you won't find someone
with all the good traits.

617
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,490
Don't get in anyone's way.

618
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,320
Take what you need.

619
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,560
Isn't that for the best?

620
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,250
Then what if Shen Qing finds someone

621
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,800
to take what he needs? How about that?

622
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:21,890
Wait.

623
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,250
Did Dad put you in the living room

624
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,280
or in the kitchen?

625
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,040
I...

626
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,520
Liu Lina, I...

627
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:31,730
I...

628
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,650
You're such an ungrateful brat.

629
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:37,520
You think I'm saying this
for Peng Yulan's sake?

630
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,360
I'm thinking about you.

631
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,890
Peng Yulan can run
a household inside and out.

632
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:43,690
Right?

633
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:44,760
If she marries Shen,

634
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,840
your whole family gets to
live the easy life.

635
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:48,590
But that fairy

636
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:49,930
is a whole different story.

637
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,690
Aside from her academic work,
what else can she do?

638
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,450
She only chews on that giant bun.

639
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,790
How do you know
she chews on a giant bun?

640
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:57,730
I can see it.

641
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,320
I can see exactly

642
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,360
what kind of person she is.

643
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,360
Think about it.

644
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:07,860
If she cooks her meals,

645
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,120
there is no time
to write letters and paint.

646
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,380
She can't do her academic work.

647
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,280
Am I right?

648
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,040
But honestly,

649
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,010
doing housework

650
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:16,760
is exhausting.

651
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,080
We barely have time for anything,

652
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,650
let alone writing letters.

653
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,520
It's not realistic for us.

654
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:23,360
Yeah, that's true.

655
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:32,800
"Let's meet again
at the painted bridge."

656
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:42,680
"Blossoms full of spirit,
willows soft and slow."

657
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,930
Which one do you think I should wear?

658
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,410
Grandpa, why are you picking so many?

659
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:02,040
It's not even that formal of an event.

660
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,770
You know Ms. Nie's coming, right?

661
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,850
Shouldn't I at least
look a little presentable?

662
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,620
So, which one looks best?

663
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:15,430
This one.

664
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,090
It makes you look younger and energetic.

665
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,639
Maybe this one's better.

666
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,290
More formal.

667
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:20,680
And...

668
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,120
Your mom says this is the one

669
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,450
she got on sale at the mall.

670
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,120
It wasn't cheap.

671
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:24,970
Nope.

672
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,010
Mom only buys
those grandpa-style shirts.

673
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,240
These are no good.

674
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,570
- I'll just wear...
- Dad!

675
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,600
Zhuoran!

676
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:33,890
I'm coming.

677
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,370
I brought you some flowers!

678
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,330
What are these?

679
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,160
White magnolias!

680
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,810
You like growing flowers.

681
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:39,330
Indeed.

682
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,369
These are easy to grow.

683
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,080
They only need some water.

684
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:42,810
Okay.

685
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:43,720
Thank you.

686
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
Where should I put them?

687
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,970
On the balcony.

688
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,120
Okay.

689
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:47,970
Right away.

690
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,560
Over here?

691
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,140
Yes. On the balcony.
Thank you so much.

692
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,240
Don't be a stranger. You're welcome.

693
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,600
What are you two up to?

694
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,490
Why did you take out all these clothes?

695
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,240
We have a full run-through
scheduled for next week.

696
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,550
Ms. Nie will be there too.

697
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,370
The one who wrote you letters?

698
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,030
That Ms. Nie?

699
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:05,930
Yes.

700
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,330
She's our literary consultant now.

701
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,850
Then, go with the gray one.
It looks classy.

702
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:13,640
Very sharp.

703
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:16,850
Alright.

704
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,520
Mom.

705
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:18,660
Leave it there.

706
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,120
Put it right there.

707
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,720
Wear this one, Grandpa.

708
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,290
It makes you look younger.

709
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,290
Didn't you say she never showed up?

710
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:27,450
Well, now she is.

711
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,120
Things have changed.

712
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,200
Yeah.

713
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:32,560
Zhuoran.

714
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:34,720
Is it a full-dress rehearsal?

715
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,970
Zhuoran, this is
turning into a big deal.

716
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:38,770
Exactly.

717
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,720
It's getting pretty fancy.

718
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,240
Lina, tell me something.

719
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,330
When are the costumes arriving?

720
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,660
Tomorrow. They will be here tomorrow.

721
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:48,560
That's great!

722
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,450
But, we still have one problem.

723
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:51,850
Lunch.

724
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:54,200
The cafeteria is too far away.

725
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,239
It's hot outside.
The seniors won't make it.

726
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,020
But, we're not sure
if the cafeteria delivers.

727
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,160
You can order deliveries.

728
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,599
- Yeah.
- Food delivery.

729
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,680
Dad, let me check the price.

730
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,040
What's the budget per person?

731
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:03,680
Thirty yuan.

732
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,290
Thirty yuan.

733
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,239
Thirty? That's just right
for a burger combo.

734
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:07,810
Perfect.

735
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,450
That works for me.

736
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,120
They're all seniors.
Who wants to eat burgers?

737
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,600
Yeah, plus takeout

738
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,040
is not healthy.

739
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,290
Too much oil and salt.

740
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,010
Even the news says so.

741
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,740
It's especially bad for the elderly.

742
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:21,720
That's true.

743
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,970
Maybe everyone
can bring their own lunch?

744
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,120
Not ideal.

745
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,929
They rehearse so hard.
We can't even provide one meal?

746
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,120
It's bad for morale.

747
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,300
Let's cook ourselves.

748
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:36,700
Mom, they actually have a budget.
We can get reimbursed.

749
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,779
- Exactly.
- Reimbursement?

750
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,010
You said you needed more receipts.
Just collect a few.

751
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,080
I'll do it.

752
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,930
We're retired,
time to put our skills to use.

753
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,870
They put on a show,

754
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:46,640
and

755
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:47,490
we provide them

756
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,010
with energy!

757
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:51,680
Well said.

758
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:52,560
It's settled, then.

759
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:53,490
Great!

760
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:54,199
Wonderful.

761
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:54,520
Okay.

762
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,720
We'll start preparing.

763
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:57,490
Get cooking!

764
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,040
I'll follow up on the costumes.

765
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:02,970
Grandpa.

766
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:05,290
My mom's starting

767
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,680
to act more and more like my grandma.

768
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:13,390
Alright then,

769
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,560
I'll wear the one your mom picked.

770
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,639
But it doesn't look good.

771
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,490
What can you do?

772
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:21,770
Okay.

773
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:22,720
This is nice.

774
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:23,970
It looks decent.

775
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,020
- Coming!
- Open the door.

776
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:32,970
Coming!

777
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:37,520
What's up?

778
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:38,810
This Sunday,

779
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:41,720
Shen's choir is having
a dress rehearsal.

780
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,290
Ms. Nie's coming too.

781
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,200
For real?

782
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,010
I'm bringing them lunch.

783
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,640
Peng Yulan,

784
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:55,520
you might want to back out now.

785
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:01,290
You know what?

786
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,890
You need to think this through.

787
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,040
Shen can't lift a thing,

788
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,010
can't carry anything,

789
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,450
and always mops around.

790
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,410
Right?

791
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,850
If something really happens,

792
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,850
even my Liu Debao would be more useful.

793
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:16,160
Professor Shen is a cultured man.

794
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,040
See this?

795
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,200
His handwriting is beautiful.

796
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,850
He's refined,

797
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,640
full of knowledge,

798
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:25,010
and always so gentle and polite.

799
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:26,970
My ex

800
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:28,970
was a total brute.

801
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:32,010
He could haul 200 catties of rice
like it was nothing.

802
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,520
But, the moment he picked up a book,

803
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:36,290
he'd fall asleep.

804
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:38,850
Back then, at the factory,

805
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,490
I had the chance
to go to Beijing for training.

806
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:43,290
I could've become an accountant.

807
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,450
Yeah, I remember that.

808
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,240
But he said to me,

809
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,640
"Accounting?

810
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,220
What's so great about that?"

811
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,070
Once you're an accountant,
you're stuck in the office for life."

812
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:54,970
"You can't even

813
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:57,330
sneak out early if you wanted to."

814
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,160
And I told him,

815
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,640
"The more skills you have,
the more options you have."

816
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,370
Exactly.

817
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:04,770
Guess what he did?

818
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,450
He slapped me across the face.

819
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,490
He said I was getting wild ideas.

820
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,810
I had his handprint on my face.

821
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,240
It took half a month to fade.

822
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
With him,

823
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,490
there was no real
communication or understanding.

824
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:38,490
What's the point of reasoning with him?

825
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,850
It's pointless.

826
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,080
That's just awful.

827
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,290
He was so awful.

828
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:44,850
He actually hit you?

829
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:48,199
You know what?

830
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,390
You were right to divorce him.

831
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:50,490
A right decision.

832
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,640
What man would hold his wife back

833
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,680
from improving herself?

834
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:56,330
Unbelievable.

835
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:57,450
You know,

836
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,200
if it were Professor Shen,

837
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,040
he would never have
done something like that.

838
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,040
Of course not.

839
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:06,890
Professor Shen isn't that violent.

840
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:07,330
Indeed.

841
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:14,080
Baoqin.

842
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,370
When are you guys

843
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,120
going next week?

844
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:20,560
Next Sunday,

845
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,040
around noon.

846
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:27,470
How about this?

847
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,490
Maybe I should just go with you.

848
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,600
Peng Yulan,

849
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,120
I'm totally supporting you.

850
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,040
I mean it.

851
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,290
You should make a great impression.

852
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,720
Should I wear something bright.

853
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,010
Exactly.

854
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:42,560
Something eye-catching.

855
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:43,930
I have one.

856
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:44,520
You do?

857
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:45,519
Help me pick one.

858
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,160
- I'll take a look.
- Yeah, take a look.

859
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,970
Help me decide, okay?

860
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:54,720
Hello, welcome!

861
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,030
Please come in.

862
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:35,890
Grandpa,

863
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,740
how does this outfit look?

864
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:40,810
Nice!

865
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:41,680
Get changed.

866
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:42,890
I need to pack my stuff.

867
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:43,640
Leave that to me.

868
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:57,780
How much for the celery?

869
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:58,450
It's six-eighty.

870
00:40:58,770 --> 00:40:59,240
How much?

871
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,330
It's six-eighty.

872
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:01,890
That's too expensive.
Lower it a little.

873
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:02,810
How about three yuan?

874
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,849
I can't even get it for three yuan.

875
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:06,370
Three yuan, and I'll take it all.

876
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,290
I can't even cover the cost.

877
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:10,490
Okay, four yuan. Deal?

878
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:10,970
Take it all.

879
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:12,010
Yeah, I'll buy the lot.

880
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,520
Alright.

881
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:13,410
Thank you.

882
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:20,680
Some edamame?

883
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,160
No thanks.

884
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,160
Dai.

885
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:37,770
Hey, Lina.

886
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:40,290
I've been texting Dad lately,

887
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,119
but why does he

888
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,490
always take forever to reply?

889
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:43,810
He's busy.

890
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,890
The choir's rehearsing.
A big show is coming up.

891
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:46,520
Look.

892
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,810
Your dad's finally meeting Ms. Nie.

893
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:51,850
For real?

894
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,930
The one he's been writing letters to?

895
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,640
She is coming down to our mortal realm.

896
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:00,200
Line, trust me.

897
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,520
These seniors really know how to live.

898
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:05,410
I'm jealous over here in the US.

899
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,640
I won't be home for dinner tonight.

900
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:10,330
Dai.

901
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:11,080
Qing.

902
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,200
Dai, everyone has
their own thing going on.

903
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,200
Cooking, costumes,

904
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,370
and all sorts of tasks.

905
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,330
But, your brother

906
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:18,970
doesn't do a thing.

907
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,390
He's always working overtime.

908
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:22,640
Honestly, it makes no difference
whether he's here or not.

909
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,330
That's not fair.

910
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:25,660
I peeled the shrimp.

911
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,220
Don't always bring that up.

912
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:30,200
Brother.

913
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,720
You look like you've lost weight.

914
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,080
Yeah?

915
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:37,330
It's not weight loss.

916
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,080
I'm just more toned now.

917
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:41,890
I see.

918
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,510
I've started running again lately.

919
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,159
Carry on. I'm heading out.

920
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,490
Okay.

921
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:47,850
Stay safe.

922
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:49,330
Dai.

923
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:51,010
I have to hang up too.

924
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:51,680
I'm busy.

925
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,720
Look at all these clothes
I need to sort.

926
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:55,850
Don't forget to livestream for me.

927
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:58,250
Only if you send me a red envelope.

928
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,240
Easy.

929
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:00,080
