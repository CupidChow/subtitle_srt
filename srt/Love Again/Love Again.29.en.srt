00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,095
(Celebrating the Completion
of the Liu Ancestral Hall)

4
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,610
Come here.

5
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:46,040
Let me make the introduction.

6
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,690
This is my daughter's son.

7
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,622
His name is Duole.

8
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,450
Hello, Duole.

9
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,640
This is my eldest brother.

10
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,000
Hello, Grandpa.

11
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,400
This is my younger sister.

12
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,120
Hello, Grandma.

13
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,050
He is...

14
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,810
Your grandpa's brother-in-law.

15
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,840
Nice to meet you, Grandpa.

16
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,530
He's so well-mannered.

17
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,920
No, I cannot.

18
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,480
No, I don't smoke.

19
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,680
He doesn't smoke.

20
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,800
He's still a kid.

21
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,890
This is Debao's maternal grandson.

22
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,290
But he's still your grandson.

23
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,240
Duole is in his senior year now.

24
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,711
He needs to be focusing on studying.

25
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,760
I told you he didn't have to come.

26
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,330
He's not even from the Liu family.

27
00:02:25,022 --> 00:02:25,800
But your dad says

28
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:28,130
a maternal grandson makes no difference.

29
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,730
So he must be here.

30
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:31,760
Uncle!

31
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,010
Today,

32
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,050
I must offer you a toast.

33
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,200
My uncle is sure impressive.

34
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,360
"Liu Ancestral Hall,
Blessed with Fortune and Wisdom."

35
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,800
A treasured calligraphy work
from a Normal University professor.

36
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,377
Impressive.

37
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,610
You can't even get something
like this out there.

38
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,640
Without Uncle,

39
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:48,850
the Liu family

40
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,010
wouldn't be so cultured?

41
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,760
My in-law wrote it myself.

42
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,450
Really?

43
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:54,920
I brought it here.

44
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:55,570
Fill it up.

45
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,800
I'll offer you a toast, Uncle.

46
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,010
Not too much.

47
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:00,410
Uncle.

48
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,320
Everyone, have a drink.

49
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:02,444
I'll finish this in one go.

50
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,890
Take it or leave it!

51
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:05,850
Cheers.

52
00:03:06,177 --> 00:03:07,333
Don't drink too much.

53
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,170
It's just a bit.

54
00:03:11,422 --> 00:03:12,200
Come on, Aunt.

55
00:03:12,444 --> 00:03:13,533
Aunt, let me explain.

56
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,888
This is real pure grain liquor.

57
00:03:15,577 --> 00:03:16,390
This type of liquor

58
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,290
is good for Uncle's health.

59
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,200
I just finished mine.

60
00:03:20,355 --> 00:03:22,199
(Celebrate Every Moment with Liquor)
This is good.

61
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:23,730
It's okay.

62
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,240
Don't worry.

63
00:03:26,577 --> 00:03:27,480
Go back to your seat.

64
00:03:29,444 --> 00:03:30,800
Aunt is really concerned about you.

65
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,330
Come, let's drink.

66
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,760
Dad knows what he's doing.

67
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:36,360
Watch this.

68
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:39,377
Someone's building a cemetery
at the back of the mountain.

69
00:03:39,688 --> 00:03:40,240
A cemetery?

70
00:03:41,044 --> 00:03:42,066
Uncle, watch this video.

71
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,330
Tian...

72
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,640
Tiandi Cemetery.

73
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,050
Cemetery.

74
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,200
Rest in the heavens.

75
00:03:47,222 --> 00:03:50,170
(Spirit Rests in Heaven)
Memories remain on earth. Tiandi Cemetery.

76
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,050
Life's Final Home.

77
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:52,640
Look at this.

78
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,410
Not bad.

79
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:53,760
Yeah.

80
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,240
I was just saying.

81
00:03:55,622 --> 00:03:56,520
Come on, everyone.

82
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:57,850
Watch this video.

83
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,680
Come and watch it.

84
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,640
Tiandi Cemetery

85
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,450
is right behind the mountain.

86
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,410
Hey, Liu Dong.

87
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,760
You're too young for this.

88
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,333
Liu Dong, why are you showing us this?

89
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,290
Aunt,

90
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:08,960
look at this.

91
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,680
Lina, take a look.

92
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:11,755
Spirit Rests in Heaven.

93
00:04:11,844 --> 00:04:12,960
Memories Remain on Earth.

94
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:14,500
Tiandi Cemetery.

95
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,730
Life's Final Home.

96
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:16,530
You see.

97
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,850
The manager
is my elementary school classmate.

98
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,000
Now, his old man's days

99
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,850
are numbered.

100
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,530
I see.

101
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,650
I have a suggestion.

102
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,610
Everyone, listen!

103
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,610
I propose that the Liu family

104
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,970
buy these plots together.

105
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,050
Let's do a group purchase

106
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,090
to get a good spot at a good price.

107
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:33,880
Great idea!

108
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,120
In the future, when we gather

109
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,290
for Chinese New Year's
dinner and play mahjong,

110
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:39,770
how convenient would that be?

111
00:04:39,888 --> 00:04:40,560
That's right?

112
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,650
The Liu family
will all be buried together.

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,170
We will be together even in death.

114
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,730
Well said!

115
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:51,410
Uncle.

116
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,050
What do you think?

117
00:04:55,777 --> 00:04:56,822
How much is it?

118
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,480
Since it's our hometown,
it's definitely cheaper.

119
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,560
The double burial plot is 88,000 yuan.

120
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,688
How much is it again?

121
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:04,133
It's 88,000 yuan.

122
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,730
It's even more expensive
than the ones in Nanjing.

123
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,320
That's too expensive.

124
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,290
What? 88,000 yuan?

125
00:05:15,422 --> 00:05:17,022
It's more expensive than Nanjing's?

126
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,440
Aunt, I meant the burial plots
in the back mountain.

127
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,320
The cemetery

128
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,210
on Huangquan Road.

129
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,240
That plot costs 88,000 yuan.

130
00:05:28,311 --> 00:05:29,509
But there are cheaper ones too.

131
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,355
Some are as low as 20,000 yuan
or 30,000 yuan.

132
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:34,880
I'm just amazed

133
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,730
this place is flooded with projects.

134
00:05:38,377 --> 00:05:40,866
One minute, it's fixing the hall
and the hanging plaques.

135
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:42,800
The next minute is buying burial plots.

136
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:43,920
Oh,

137
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,610
what's the next project after this?

138
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,730
Let me guess.

139
00:05:47,911 --> 00:05:50,066
Does the road at the village entrance
need fixing too?

140
00:05:50,088 --> 00:05:51,044
Mom, that's enough.

141
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,320
Aunt.

142
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,850
Let me explain.

143
00:05:56,488 --> 00:05:57,400
We are doing this

144
00:05:57,533 --> 00:05:58,800
for the sake of the Liu family.

145
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,610
Once we restore the ancestral hall,

146
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,360
it will lead to good feng shui.

147
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,610
Yes.

148
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,555
When feng shui is good,

149
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:04,850
the descendants like our children

150
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:05,880
will enjoy the blessings.

151
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,977
First, make sure the descendants
are taken care of.

152
00:06:08,222 --> 00:06:08,800
Am I right?

153
00:06:09,155 --> 00:06:10,019
Don't you agree?

154
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,170
Duole is taking
the university entrance exam this year.

155
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,800
Why don't we ask
the Liu family ancestors

156
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,090
if they have any connections?

157
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,000
Stop it, Mom.

158
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,560
See? You upset them.

159
00:06:23,222 --> 00:06:24,050
I'm just being frank.

160
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,320
Why are you filming this?

161
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,530
Stop it, Mom.

162
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,410
- Liu Dong.
- Let's enjoy the drinks.

163
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,170
Listen here.

164
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,000
Liu Dong.

165
00:06:36,466 --> 00:06:37,410
Sorry for interrupting.

166
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:40,200
Just look at your family.

167
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,610
T-shirts from the bank

168
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,360
and the power bank.

169
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:45,610
I...

170
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,044
You're pretty well-connected, huh?

171
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,090
My dear nephew,

172
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,610
is the cemetery your new hustle?

173
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,970
Is she telling the truth?

174
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,210
Uncle.

175
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,730
Aunt.

176
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,970
Aunt, you can't put it like that.

177
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,000
Let's not talk about this here.

178
00:07:04,044 --> 00:07:05,177
Where should I do it then?

179
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,610
We can talk about this at home.

180
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,577
Why should I?

181
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,866
Can't you consider the occasion?

182
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,000
What occasion?

183
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:12,610
I have something to say,
and I'm going to say it here.

184
00:07:12,688 --> 00:07:13,859
If I don't make myself clear,

185
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,960
are you going to borrow money
from the in-laws again?

186
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:16,730
You...

187
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:18,880
Keep it down.

188
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,320
Mom, stop it.

189
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,290
Why should I?

190
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,210
This is a major life event.

191
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,530
What matters the most is living

192
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,170
and living well.

193
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,440
As for this burial plot,

194
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,000
I will not buy it.

195
00:07:31,288 --> 00:07:33,330
If you want to buy it,
you can bury yourself there.

196
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,955
I want to be buried somewhere else.

197
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:35,360
Aunt.

198
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,711
Where are you going, Mom?

199
00:07:37,711 --> 00:07:38,200
Grandma!

200
00:07:38,444 --> 00:07:39,360
Where are you going?

201
00:07:39,422 --> 00:07:40,666
I don't want to hang with them.

202
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,440
Mom, your phone!

203
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,360
That was a harsh thing to say.

204
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,850
That's right.
How could they not be buried together?

205
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:51,480
That was embarrassing.

206
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,530
- Mom, stop walking.
- It's so frustrating.

207
00:07:56,422 --> 00:07:57,320
There, calm down.

208
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,410
I'm so mad.

209
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:59,560
Oh, don't be.

210
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:00,730
You know?

211
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,511
Ever since I married into that family,
I've been unlucky all my life.

212
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,000
It's just too much.

213
00:08:05,844 --> 00:08:07,190
I'll put everything else aside.

214
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,530
When we were buying a house in Nanjing,

215
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:11,210
we were 30,000 yuan short.

216
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,680
I told your dad

217
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,050
to borrow some from his relatives.

218
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,530
Your dad was there for a week.

219
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:17,755
He did borrow the money.

220
00:08:18,577 --> 00:08:20,050
He only managed to borrow 8,000 yuan

221
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,240
with IOU and seal them
with fingerprints.

222
00:08:23,355 --> 00:08:24,911
As if we would run off with the money.

223
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,309
Isn't that what they thought?

224
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,311
Then guess what happened?

225
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,170
After a month,

226
00:08:29,444 --> 00:08:31,222
Liu Dong suffered
from brain inflammation

227
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,490
and came asking us for that 8,000 yuan.

228
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,890
I even chipped in another 2,000 yuan.

229
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,770
We gave back 10,000 yuan altogether.

230
00:08:37,822 --> 00:08:38,650
And now look at him.

231
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,920
Liu Dong's brain is all healed, right?

232
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:42,050
Next thing you know,

233
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:44,650
it's 20,000 yuan for a plaque
at the ancestral hall.

234
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,960
Then it's 88,000 yuan for a burial plot.

235
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,840
In just a month, they've quietly taken

236
00:08:50,911 --> 00:08:52,488
more than 100,000 yuan from us.

237
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,410
My goodness.

238
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,680
That's over 100,000 yuan!

239
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,250
Do you know how hard it is

240
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,530
for regular folks like us

241
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,000
to save that kind of money?

242
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,960
Calm down, Mom.

243
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,488
Are you a machine gun or something?

244
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:06,720
Stop spitting bullets already.

245
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,733
You should take a break.

246
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,840
Grandma, have some water.

247
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,770
See?

248
00:09:11,822 --> 00:09:12,960
Thanks, my sweet grandson.

249
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,290
Look at Duole. He's so well-behaved.

250
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:16,800
He knows how to take care of me.

251
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,170
He's smart and thoughtful.

252
00:09:18,422 --> 00:09:20,050
But they're trying to make him smoke?

253
00:09:20,355 --> 00:09:21,890
Isn't that ruining the young people?

254
00:09:21,955 --> 00:09:23,220
Well, he didn't smoke in the end.

255
00:09:23,222 --> 00:09:25,080
Of course, he wouldn't
dare to let that happen.

256
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,010
And they have the nerve

257
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,050
to call him Liu Duole?

258
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,410
Our surname is Shen!

259
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,890
It's Shen Duole, okay?

260
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,250
Well, the Liu family blood runs
in Duole's body.

261
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,177
Don't forget that.

262
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,410
Maybe their DNA is the reason

263
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,200
his grades aren't improving.

264
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:45,440
What?

265
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:45,960
Duole,

266
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,290
don't you agree?

267
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,370
Grandma, keeping peace matters most.

268
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:51,410
See?

269
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,480
Keeping peace.
So calm down already, okay?

270
00:09:53,488 --> 00:09:54,530
- Take a break.
- I was...

271
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,290
Aren't you tired?

272
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:56,490
You think I'm not tired?

273
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:57,777
They're driving me up the wall!

274
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,333
Okay, just drop it. Have some water.

275
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:02,960
Mom.

276
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,130
Lina.

277
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:06,733
(Dad)
Where are you guys?

278
00:10:06,755 --> 00:10:07,511
Come back here.

279
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,044
The plaque ceremony's starting.

280
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,050
You heard that, right?

281
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,200
Let's go.

282
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,920
Come on, give him some face.

283
00:10:14,977 --> 00:10:15,933
My last name isn't Liu.

284
00:10:16,044 --> 00:10:18,190
What does their plaque ceremony
have to do with me?

285
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,370
I'm not going.

286
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,600
Uncle.

287
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,770
Are Aunt and the rest coming?

288
00:10:42,155 --> 00:10:43,177
Let's not wait anymore.

289
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:44,333
They're leaving?

290
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,933
The auspicious time has arrived.

291
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,080
We now begin the unveiling.

292
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:52,840
Great!

293
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,050
A fresh beginning and blessings.

294
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,200
Unveiling the plaque
to welcome good fortune.

295
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,960
May heaven bestow great luck upon us.

296
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,320
So our legacy thrives
for generations to come!

297
00:11:10,511 --> 00:11:12,650
(Liu Ancestral Hall)
Descendants, pay your respects.

298
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,410
First bow!

299
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,370
Second bow!

300
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,440
Third bow!

301
00:11:21,288 --> 00:11:22,355
The ceremony is complete!

302
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:24,770
Let's go inside and pray!

303
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:34,490
(Liu Ancestral Hall)

304
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,440
Look up.

305
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:07,490
Look down.

306
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,170
That's nice.

307
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
Look around you.

308
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,370
Smile.

309
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,130
Show me two teeth.

310
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,200
Now four.

311
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,700
Give me eight for a wider smile.

312
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:26,560
Eight teeth?

313
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,290
That is way too good-looking.

314
00:12:28,755 --> 00:12:30,240
She's right about showing eight teeth.

315
00:12:30,244 --> 00:12:31,920
Hurry before I lose my teeth.

316
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,800
You know what?

317
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,440
You look dashing

318
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,288
when you turned around just now.

319
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:38,290
I thought you were Xu Wenqiang
from "The Bund."

320
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,530
It would be perfect with muscles.

321
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:03,720
Grandpa,

322
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:04,720
look.

323
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,666
My grandpa is killing it with style.

324
00:13:08,096 --> 00:13:13,460
(Men are like wine.
They get better with age.)

325
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,080
Doesn't he look just like Xu Wenqiang

326
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,290
from "The Bund"?

327
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,290
Dad,

328
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,290
dressing up as Xu Wenqiang is easy.

329
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,600
All you need is a hat and a scarf.

330
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,440
If you want,
I can help you dress up like him.

331
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,050
No, thanks.

332
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:32,369
A truly capable man

333
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,600
doesn't need to put up plaques,
restore ancestral halls,

334
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,720
or bow to his ancestors.

335
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,250
If you're capable, then you are.

336
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,680
If the Liu ancestors

337
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:42,770
really cared so much
about their descendants,

338
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,680
maybe they could help you get
your retirement pay increased?

339
00:13:54,866 --> 00:13:55,920
According to the contract,

340
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,555
the Series B+ round of financing

341
00:13:57,555 --> 00:13:59,590
was supposed to be credited
on the 1st of this month.

342
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:01,933
But where's the money?

343
00:14:05,755 --> 00:14:07,200
Qing, can you push them again?

344
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,490
Push them.

345
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,200
Just see where it's stuck
in the process.

346
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,720
I've already followed up several times.

347
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,800
They're saying

348
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,511
they just switched banks
and the money's in the pipeline.

349
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,720
I bet it's likely
because the clinical results for Phase 3

350
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:22,890
haven't come out yet.

351
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,290
So Shide Capital is not confident.

352
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,410
Come on,
medicine development isn't cooking.

353
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:31,190
We don't just throw things in a pot
and eat it however it turns out.

354
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,720
Clinical trials have to be rigorous

355
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,490
and objective.

356
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,777
This isn't something we can rush.

357
00:14:34,844 --> 00:14:37,410
The investors don't care about that.
He only cares about the result.

358
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,369
Then where's the money?

359
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,377
If you give me the money,
I'll give you the results.

360
00:14:40,377 --> 00:14:41,600
No money, no results.

361
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,440
Can you try talking to Ice Li again?

362
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:48,290
After all, she's the person in charge.

363
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,440
Ruifeng,

364
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,800
Ice has already done a lot for us.

365
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,577
We can't keep pressuring the people

366
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,320
who are actually helping us.

367
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,650
She's on leave

368
00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:01,840
and her father was just diagnosed

369
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,600
with late-stage lung cancer.

370
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,800
(It's been so many years
since I last held my father's hand.)

371
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,250
Excuse me.

372
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:00,530
Yes, sir?

373
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,130
I wanted to ask you

374
00:16:02,244 --> 00:16:03,555
about this whole fitness thing.

375
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,250
At what age is it too late to start?

376
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,490
There's no age limit.

377
00:16:07,555 --> 00:16:08,570
You can start at any age.

378
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,600
But I'm seventy.

379
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,400
That's totally fine.

380
00:16:10,755 --> 00:16:11,600
Really? No problem?

381
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:12,720
So,

382
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:14,720
what if I want

383
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,530
to build a little more...

384
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,050
Muscle?

385
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:19,440
Yes.

386
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:19,840
I get it.

387
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:20,560
You see,

388
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,250
we have yoga, strength training,
and many more.

389
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:24,510
Please, have a seat.

390
00:16:25,577 --> 00:16:27,010
I'll walk you through the details.

391
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:27,600
Okay.

392
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,170
(Foster unity and a sense of belonging)
Our design aims to be simple and elegant.

393
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,530
The color scheme draws
from classic school uniforms.

394
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,960
It would be dark green, white, and blue.

395
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,050
As a mother,

396
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,650
practicality is very important to me.

397
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,530
Kids wear these every day.

398
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,010
So comfort is key.

399
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,560
We've made the collar

400
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,600
a little higher.

401
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,290
So it can be pulled up if it's windy

402
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,490
or folded down

403
00:16:52,622 --> 00:16:53,560
as a stylish lapel.

404
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,680
All the pockets come with zippers.

405
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,555
So students no longer have to worry

406
00:16:57,577 --> 00:16:59,460
about dropping their student IDs
or meal cards.

407
00:16:59,466 --> 00:17:00,333
We've used darker,

408
00:17:00,377 --> 00:17:02,840
more durable fabric for the sleeves.

409
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:03,720
Also,

410
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:05,600
we added adjustable cuffs

411
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,970
at the pant legs.

412
00:17:08,155 --> 00:17:09,755
It's great for P.E. or rainy days.

413
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,360
It can be easily lifted up,

414
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,120
practical, and clean.

415
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,370
(Thank you for your time)

416
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,730
We focus on students' physical
and mental well-being,

417
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,840
capturing the unique energy of youth.

418
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,560
Calm when needed,

419
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,840
bold when needed.

420
00:17:27,244 --> 00:17:28,022
Thank you, everyone.

421
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,320
When I first went up there to present,

422
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,530
I was honestly really nervous.

423
00:17:38,911 --> 00:17:40,690
But then I started
to feel more comfortable.

424
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,320
I think I was born to do this.

425
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,770
Of course you were, Lina.

426
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,250
I knew you could do it.

427
00:17:47,688 --> 00:17:49,250
I was watching you from the audience,

428
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,010
you looked so cool up there.

429
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,690
I can't believe my first time

430
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,930
as a designer passed unanimously.

431
00:17:58,111 --> 00:17:59,577
When you have a perfect start,

432
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,250
things can only go up from here.

433
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,160
Lina,

434
00:18:11,555 --> 00:18:12,530
your hand is injured.

435
00:18:12,533 --> 00:18:13,920
There's a pharmacy right over there.

436
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,200
I'll buy some adhesive bandages.

437
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:16,250
I didn't even notice.

438
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,690
Maybe I unknowingly hit the board

439
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:19,822
during the presentation.

440
00:18:19,911 --> 00:18:20,970
Wait here. I'll be quick.

441
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:27,840
Hello.

442
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,640
I need an antiseptic solution

443
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,840
and an adhesive bandage.

444
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,880
Senior health investment
by Joy Academy?

445
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,050
Thanks.

446
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,290
I really don't need it.

447
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,800
It's only a small cut.

448
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,770
Even small wounds need attention.

449
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,730
You're really thoughtful.

450
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,930
You even bought cotton swabs.

451
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:14,880
Athletes like us

452
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,840
always getting bumps and scrapes.

453
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,560
I'm practically half a doctor.

454
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,490
Bai,

455
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,010
by the way, what is this Joy Academy?

456
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:33,800
Oh,

457
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,640
this is one of our company's

458
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,160
key investment projects.

459
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,560
It's a wellness
and leisure center designed for seniors.

460
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,730
That's pretty interesting.

461
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:45,800
Lina,

462
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,050
do you know

463
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,250
there are 220 million people

464
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:51,577
in China over the age of 65 now.

465
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,840
Providing services for them
is definitely a blue ocean market.

466
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,450
So, what's the return
on investment like?

467
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,490
About 10%.

468
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,970
What? 10%? That's high.

469
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,250
That's pretty good.

470
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,800
Too bad all of our family's money

471
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
has already been invested
in my husband's company.

472
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:09,640
No worries, Lina.

473
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,711
I'll let you know
when there's another good project.

474
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,450
Okay.

475
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,930
I'll take this back home then.

476
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:15,800
Sure, take it.

477
00:20:16,888 --> 00:20:17,800
Okay, let's set out.

478
00:20:43,315 --> 00:20:48,200
(ICE Li Voice Call)

479
00:20:48,201 --> 00:20:49,820
(ICE)

480
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,400
Hello,

481
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,080
Shen Qing.

482
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:00,210
Ice,

483
00:21:01,222 --> 00:21:02,290
is it a good time to talk?

484
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:03,690
Yeah.

485
00:21:04,066 --> 00:21:05,644
Yes, I'm in the hospital waiting
in line.

486
00:21:05,844 --> 00:21:06,690
I'm free right now.

487
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,690
How's your dad?

488
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,010
The bad news

489
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:13,600
is the cancer has spread.

490
00:21:13,977 --> 00:21:15,160
So surgery isn't an option.

491
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,010
The good news is

492
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,050
the genetic test results came out,

493
00:21:20,222 --> 00:21:22,133
and there's
a suitable targeted drug therapy.

494
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,770
My dad

495
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,640
is actually doing well mentally.

496
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:27,840
He says

497
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:31,290
that he'll be content
as long as he gets to see me married.

498
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:35,688
All the heartbreaking things
that parents do for us.

499
00:21:37,044 --> 00:21:39,290
You're calling
because of the Series B+ funding, right?

500
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,120
There are still some differences

501
00:21:42,222 --> 00:21:43,822
within the company about this loan.

502
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,320
I'm arranging a meeting

503
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,080
so you guys can have a face-to-face

504
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,730
with the head
of the investment department.

505
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,690
So don't worry.

506
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,160
I'm pushing for it.

507
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:57,770
Ice,

508
00:21:58,577 --> 00:22:00,080
I feel bad for asking at this time.

509
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,080
I'm really grateful.

510
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,770
It's okay.

511
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,320
You're doing something incredible.

512
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,360
Shen Qing,

513
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,022
thank goodness
for the targeted drug therapy.

514
00:22:16,088 --> 00:22:17,577
At least my dad has hope now.

515
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,640
Don't worry.

516
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,560
We'll do our best.

517
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:51,690
The school uniform design I created
passed the meeting today

518
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,360
with full support.

519
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,290
It'll go into production tomorrow.

520
00:22:58,730 --> 00:22:59,970
This feels like the first step

521
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,360
in my long journey.

522
00:23:02,155 --> 00:23:04,044
When I first said
I wanted to join your company,

523
00:23:04,066 --> 00:23:05,466
you didn't even take me seriously.

524
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:06,640
Listen.

525
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,770
If your company ever goes under,

526
00:23:08,866 --> 00:23:11,044
you might have to rely on me
to support you.

527
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,770
What are you saying?

528
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,022
Our company is going to fail?

529
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:15,177
I was just being honest.

530
00:23:15,866 --> 00:23:16,644
By the way,

531
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,250
a friend recommended
an investment project to me.

532
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,160
I think it's pretty solid. Take a look.

533
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,690
Which friend?

534
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,400
Is it that Mr. Bai again?

535
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,730
Why do you always act like that
when I mention Bai?

536
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,690
He's been good to me,

537
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,450
and you assume
he has some ulterior motives.

538
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,577
Am I only worthy
of being friends with fools?

539
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:36,290
I'm just trying to remind you

540
00:23:36,511 --> 00:23:37,970
that any investments require caution.

541
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,640
You need to think things through.

542
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,010
You're one to talk.

543
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,010
You took all the money from home

544
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,400
and invested it in the company.

545
00:23:45,733 --> 00:23:47,840
Let's see how much
you can get back from that.

546
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:49,880
I discussed it with you before,

547
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,770
and you agreed.

548
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,600
And now I'm discussing it with you,

549
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,977
so what's with your attitude?

550
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,640
Fine, let's discuss.

551
00:23:56,088 --> 00:23:57,866
But first,
put the investment project aside.

552
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,010
Does our family have any cash right now?

553
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,290
You took all the cash.

554
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,400
Everything at home
is prioritized for you.

555
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,590
Then what's the point of discussing
if there's no money?

556
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,770
Also, let's talk
about the school uniform.

557
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,120
I have to remind you.

558
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,290
It's too similar

559
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,690
to Duole's school uniform.

560
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:14,530
What if

561
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,880
the school notices?

562
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:19,690
I've noticed something.

563
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,450
You're a professional
at raining on my parade.

564
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,050
I'm just helping you avoid risks.

565
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,290
It does look similar.

566
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,450
But the details are really different.

567
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,644
How could you not see them?

568
00:24:30,711 --> 00:24:32,155
I put so much thought into it.

569
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,640
Just the pocket on the arm alone.

570
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:37,250
The zipper took me
so many tries to design.

571
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,400
I don't know much about fashion design.

572
00:24:40,466 --> 00:24:42,600
But we have IPR
in the pharmaceutical industry.

573
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,422
If something goes wrong there,
it's a big issue.

574
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,160
I...

575
00:24:54,977 --> 00:24:56,050
Hello, Headmaster Zhang.

576
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:57,840
Ms. Liu,

577
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,560
our school teachers noticed

578
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:01,600
that your design

579
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,560
is similar
to Ansheng High School's uniform.

580
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:07,840
Is that so?

581
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,560
It may look similar.

582
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,080
But

583
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,290
I actually changed a lot of the details.

584
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,770
So it's completely different.

585
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,010
If the two schools met,

586
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:19,120
we wouldn't be comparing details.

587
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,360
We would be judging
by first impressions.

588
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,640
So whether it's a coincidence
or inspiration,

589
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,250
this cannot happen.

590
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:28,250
Also, our school's secretary mentioned

591
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:31,050
that you haven't fully understood
our school's history yet.

592
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,600
So kindly revise

593
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:37,290
the design again to better reflect
our school's characteristics.

594
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:38,290
I understand.

595
00:25:38,355 --> 00:25:40,050
I'll start making
the changes right away.

596
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,120
Time's tight.

597
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,377
Can you still make it?

598
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:43,800
Yes, of course.

599
00:25:44,266 --> 00:25:45,377
I'll do everything I can.

600
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,880
That's settled then. See you soon.

601
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:47,733
All right.

602
00:25:52,244 --> 00:25:52,880
What's wrong?

603
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,400
Mr. Shen,

604
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:57,930
you were right.

605
00:25:58,711 --> 00:26:00,066
The risk you mentioned has come.

606
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:10,250
Still mad?

607
00:26:10,755 --> 00:26:12,844
How can you still be mad
after so many days?

608
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,244
What does a person really want

609
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,400
in life?

610
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,711
What's the final destination?

611
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,080
It's just

612
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,840
to return to their roots
and rest in peace.

613
00:26:25,488 --> 00:26:27,822
The whole family is buried together
after a hundred years.

614
00:26:27,955 --> 00:26:28,800
How great is that?

615
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,560
With your family?

616
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:31,770
I don't even want

617
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,730
to be with them while I'm alive.

618
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,120
Let alone after I'm dead.

619
00:26:36,044 --> 00:26:37,690
I remember when I gave birth to Lina.

620
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,250
Your mom and dad

621
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,290
pulled a long face

622
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,880
as soon as they saw it was a girl.

623
00:26:43,244 --> 00:26:44,360
When they brought me food,

624
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,160
it was just a bowl
of rice soaked in soup.

625
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,080
It was cold too.

626
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,777
You've been talking
about that rice your whole life.

627
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,690
I brought it to you.

628
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,320
It was bone broth,
simmered for over two hours.

629
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:56,730
It was warm.

630
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,050
Besides,

631
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,250
when the food was cooked,

632
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,320
no one even knew
if it was a boy or girl.

633
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,400
It was cold.

634
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,730
It was definitely cold.

635
00:27:06,177 --> 00:27:07,490
I remember it as clear as day.

636
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,022
It was colder than your mom's face.

637
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:10,490
I still can't believe it.

638
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,360
Don't even get me started

639
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:14,511
on that Chinese New Year at your home

640
00:27:14,711 --> 00:27:16,133
when Lina was four months old.

641
00:27:16,244 --> 00:27:18,600
Your mom didn't care
if I was taking care of a baby or not.

642
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,210
She made me cook for the whole family.

643
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,490
I remember I cooked over twenty dishes.

644
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,640
When I finally sat down to eat,

645
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,730
there wasn't a single meat dish left.

646
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,690
I was breastfeeding at that time.

647
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:34,770
Just don't even bring up your family.

648
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:35,490
I...

649
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,560
I don't care for

650
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,640
any of them.

651
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,050
Honestly, I wish I could stay

652
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,010
as far away from them.

653
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,770
Now, you want me buried next to them?

654
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:47,210
Husbands and wives can live apart.

655
00:27:47,244 --> 00:27:49,044
But they don't get buried
at opposite ends.

656
00:27:49,155 --> 00:27:50,730
That's basically a divorce after death.

657
00:27:52,555 --> 00:27:54,770
When people hung the family plaque
in the ancestral hall,

658
00:27:54,777 --> 00:27:56,688
everyone was supposed
to be there together.

659
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,560
But you turned around and left.

660
00:27:59,066 --> 00:28:00,490
You left me standing there alone.

661
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,600
The ancestors were watching.

662
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,050
It was humiliating.

663
00:28:04,622 --> 00:28:06,120
If you care that much about face,

664
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:08,022
you should've told the ancestors

665
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,730
where the money came from.

666
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,010
It was borrowed
from my daughter's in-law.

667
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:12,840
I even paid it back.

668
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,770
I paid for the restoration.

669
00:28:14,844 --> 00:28:17,111
And in the end,
I still had to stand there beside you?

670
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,770
No way.

671
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,640
I gave all my money to you!

672
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,220
We've been married for over forty years.

673
00:28:21,222 --> 00:28:23,010
I don't even know how much I have.

674
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,880
I've listened to you on everything.

675
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,690
Can't you just let me have a say
on my final wishes?

676
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,770
Weren't you the one

677
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,560
who told Peng Yulan

678
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,770
that you just want me to take care
of you when you're sick?

679
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,490
That was just a girl talk
with my best friend!

680
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,690
Liu Debao,

681
00:28:39,711 --> 00:28:41,050
what do you want me to say to her?

682
00:28:41,644 --> 00:28:43,355
That I married you for money and power?

683
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,010
Or because of your good looks?

684
00:28:45,044 --> 00:28:46,530
If you weren't in it for any of that,

685
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,560
then I can only say

686
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,329
I want you to take care of me
when I am sick.

687
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,080
You're not that capable.
What else could I say?

688
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,320
What is that supposed to mean?

689
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:53,709
You forked out 20,000 yuan

690
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,620
and you don't want
to be part of the Liu anymore?

691
00:28:55,622 --> 00:28:57,200
Is that your buyout price?

692
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,690
Yes, that 20,000 yuan is the buyout.

693
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,160
There's no way I'll pay 88,000 yuan.

694
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,177
Not in a million years.

695
00:29:02,511 --> 00:29:04,511
Once you're gone, it won't
be your call anymore.

696
00:29:04,844 --> 00:29:06,200
I am the head of the household.

697
00:29:07,444 --> 00:29:08,400
I have the final say.

698
00:29:09,555 --> 00:29:10,600
What did you just say?

699
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,360
Liu Debao,

700
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,400
did you just wish me dead?

701
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:17,880
I...

702
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,800
You're unbelievable!

703
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,930
We understand Shide has some concerns.

704
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,360
So in this update,

705
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,840
we've added simulated market feedback

706
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,250
and emergency response strategies.

707
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,770
Thank you for understanding
our position, Mr. Shen.

708
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:40,800
We all know

709
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,930
that clinical trials can't be forced.

710
00:29:43,577 --> 00:29:44,640
But our fund's investors

711
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,290
have high expectations.

712
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,770
That's why the disbursement process
has been a bit complex.

713
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,930
We've really done our best
to communicate that.

714
00:29:54,022 --> 00:29:55,400
Mr. Qiao, here's the situation.

715
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,970
We're truly in a rush.

716
00:30:00,688 --> 00:30:02,210
If the funding doesn't come through,

717
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,970
the clinical trial will get stuck.

718
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,050
And once it's stuck,

719
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:08,320
all the investment effort so far

720
00:30:08,911 --> 00:30:10,080
will have been for nothing.

721
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,450
I understand.

722
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,080
But extending Phase 3 to 24 weeks

723
00:30:16,577 --> 00:30:18,200
requires a massive investment.

724
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,250
We still haven't seen results,

725
00:30:20,466 --> 00:30:22,822
which leads to the medicine
being unable to go to market.

726
00:30:23,111 --> 00:30:24,160
That's a fact, isn't it?

727
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,530
Once the investment is in place,

728
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,290
we can proceed with the trials

729
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:31,360
and have the M701 marketed
as soon as possible.

730
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,050
What we want to know is,

731
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,160
if by the 24th week,

732
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,880
we still don't get the ideal data,

733
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:39,690
then what?

734
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,080
We're in venture capital.

735
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:49,800
So we have to face risk head-on.

736
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,560
We signed the agreement

737
00:30:51,644 --> 00:30:52,690
and did our due diligence

738
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,755
because we believe
in RF Pharmaceuticals.

739
00:30:56,111 --> 00:30:57,000
You're right.

740
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,930
I've been taking care
of my father lately.

741
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,490
I understand

742
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,690
how desperately

743
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:06,120
drug-resistant patients hope

744
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,050
for new treatments.

745
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,600
This isn't just a large market.

746
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,560
This is about saving lives.

747
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,770
M701 has come such a long way.

748
00:31:15,044 --> 00:31:16,360
It just needs one last push.

749
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,160
As an investor,

750
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,530
I believe

751
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,450
we should support RF Pharmaceuticals

752
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:23,377
and disburse the funds
as soon as we can.

753
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:24,880
Everyone takes their share of risk.

754
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,880
Let's give it everything we've got.

755
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,360
Hello, Director Yu.

756
00:31:49,644 --> 00:31:52,311
Liu, can we start production
on the school uniforms today?

757
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,450
All the fabrics

758
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,622
and accessories have arrived.

759
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,160
Director Yu,

760
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:59,320
there's a small issue
with the design draft.

761
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,400
I might need two more days.

762
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,010
Please try to hurry.

763
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,930
Or else I won't be able to deliver
by the 20th.

764
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,160
I understand.

765
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:08,640
Okay.

766
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,880
Mom, what are you doing?

767
00:32:21,511 --> 00:32:22,866
Are you trying to wreck the place?

768
00:32:22,955 --> 00:32:23,690
Why are you here?

769
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:25,800
Liu Debao,

770
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,360
did you tell her to come?

771
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,740
Why did you tell her to come?

772
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,080
Don't you know she's busy?

773
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:34,880
Dad, what's going on?

774
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,050
Your mom wants a divorce.

775
00:32:48,622 --> 00:32:50,560
(Divorce Agreement)
All jointly owned assets

776
00:32:50,666 --> 00:32:53,133
will be passed on to our daughter,
Liu Lina after we both pass.

777
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,290
All jointly owned savings

778
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,600
will be passed to Liu Lina.

779
00:32:57,666 --> 00:32:58,333
That's right.

780
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:01,930
Mom,

781
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,080
is this a divorce agreement

782
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,160
or a will?

783
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,320
It's to make sure that after I die,

784
00:33:07,466 --> 00:33:09,780
your dad doesn't drag me back
to be buried in his hometown.

785
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:10,800
This is ridiculous!

786
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,210
Ridiculous?

787
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:14,530
I'm just making arrangements

788
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,080
while I'm still alive.

789
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:19,690
I worked so hard
to get from Xuzhou to Nanjing,

790
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,466
and I finally made it
to live near Xinjiekou.

791
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,770
Even when I die,
I want to die here in Nanjing.

792
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:25,730
Why should I let him bury me

793
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,250
in some mountain village?

794
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:29,770
You're not a real Nanjing native.

795
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:30,600
Why are you acting

796
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:32,222
like you've got such deep roots here?

797
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:33,930
How am I not a Nanjing native?

798
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,970
Check the household registration.

799
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,840
It says Sun Baoqin.

800
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,010
Nanjing.

801
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,730
Qinhuai District.

802
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,600
Huiyuanli.

803
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,730
When we started dating,

804
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,490
you liked me
because I was a Nanjing resident.

805
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,450
You married me
for the Nanjing residency.

806
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,880
Now when I die,
you want to bury me in your hometown?

807
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,210
So I'm drawing the line now.

808
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,530
Sign this.

809
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,600
Sign it now.

810
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,880
I won't sign it.

811
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,377
You won't sign?

812
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,810
Fine. Then let me give you some advice.

813
00:34:09,888 --> 00:34:11,560
You are not buying a family burial plot

814
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,930
in your hometown.

815
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,280
One more thing,

816
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,720
cut ties with Liu Dong.

817
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,970
Block him and don't keep in touch
with him anymore.

818
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,240
Liu Lina,

819
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:24,850
go back home

820
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:26,720
and tell everyone from the Shen family

821
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,530
to keep their money close to them.

822
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,890
Stop lending money to your dad.

823
00:34:30,044 --> 00:34:31,050
If they lend him again,

824
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,080
I'm not covering his debts anymore.

825
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,760
Mom, take it easy.

826
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:36,890
Sun Baoqin,

827
00:34:37,111 --> 00:34:38,200
what is wrong with you?

828
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:39,760
Are you done or not making a scene?

829
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,970
Am I the one with the problem?

830
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:42,120
Or is it you?

831
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,050
Who was it?

832
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:46,050
Who borrowed 20,000 yuan
from Lina's sister-in-law?

833
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,370
Did you see that?

834
00:34:48,511 --> 00:34:49,380
Your dad has lost it.

835
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,420
Who is he putting on a show for
by slamming the door?

836
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,244
Is he rebelling?

837
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:52,930
Okay, enough.

838
00:34:53,711 --> 00:34:55,240
Liu Lina, you better listen to me.

839
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,010
Over my dead body

840
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,240
will I be buried
in your father's hometown.

841
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,810
I already looked into

842
00:35:01,844 --> 00:35:03,560
the cemetery
your late mother-in-law is in.

843
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,600
It's a wall niche burial.

844
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,200
When the time comes,
buy me one of those.

845
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,749
It's not expensive. Just 80,000 yuan.

846
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,010
It's similar to the price
of the one back home, right?

847
00:35:10,133 --> 00:35:12,022
I can be buried
next to your mother-in-law.

848
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,970
It'll be easier for you to visit too.

849
00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:17,133
Mom, no one chooses
a burial site based on convenience.

850
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,160
Besides, it's a small niche.

851
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,240
I know that.

852
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,840
It's like a little apartment building.

853
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,370
Me and a few old friends

854
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,155
were planning
to buy a few spots together.

855
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,240
Can you imagine how lively it'll be?

856
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:29,490
When you have time,

857
00:35:29,688 --> 00:35:31,600
come burn some paper
and offer some incense.

858
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,810
If you don't, it's okay.

859
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,240
I really like

860
00:35:35,488 --> 00:35:36,720
Peng Yulan's little grandson.

861
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,600
When he comes to pay his respect
to his grandma,

862
00:35:39,688 --> 00:35:41,422
I'll get to bask in that moment too.

863
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,330
At Qingming Festival,

864
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,810
there'll be a whole row
of fresh flowers laid out.

865
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:47,760
So much life.

866
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:49,760
Mom,

867
00:35:50,044 --> 00:35:51,680
but if you choose wall niche burial,

868
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,911
you're giving up on Dad?

869
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,850
That depends on

870
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,410
whether he can wrap his head around it.

871
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:00,810
If he comes around,

872
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,560
save him a spot next to me.

873
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:04,200
He can live in the "apartment" with me.

874
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,050
Dad.

875
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:10,850
Hold on.

876
00:36:11,644 --> 00:36:13,244
The room is filled with smoke.

877
00:36:13,355 --> 00:36:14,511
Let me open the window.

878
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:19,280
It's okay.

879
00:36:20,266 --> 00:36:20,970
Come sit down.

880
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,010
Dad, what are you thinking?

881
00:36:28,488 --> 00:36:30,844
Why do you have to go back
to your hometown after you pass?

882
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:34,010
Then we'll have to travel back there
every Qingming Festival.

883
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,450
Isn't Nanjing nice?

884
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,330
It's easier for us to visit you too.

885
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,200
What's there to visit?

886
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:44,810
Just burning some extra paper
is already fine with me.

887
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,850
I didn't do much for you
while I was alive.

888
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,810
I don't want to burden you
after I'm gone.

889
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,640
What are you talking about, Dad?

890
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:55,970
Lina,

891
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,850
I'm not a capable father.

892
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,930
Forty-five years in Nanjing,

893
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:06,450
I worked my way up

894
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,160
as a bench worker

895
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,930
and retired as a senior technician.

896
00:37:12,755 --> 00:37:13,644
I managed

897
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,680
to raise an outstanding daughter

898
00:37:18,266 --> 00:37:19,370
and a university graduate.

899
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:21,760
Now you're starting your own company.

900
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:23,850
You're doing great.

901
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:24,640
So I'm at ease.

902
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:26,640
But for me,

903
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:27,760
I want

904
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,410
to go back home.

905
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,410
After all, that's where my roots are.

906
00:37:32,844 --> 00:37:34,844
When I was young,
I didn't think about it.

907
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,530
But the older I get,
the more I want to return

908
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,560
to where I came from.

909
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,010
I would feel grounded that way.

910
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,720
Besides,

911
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:44,280
buying

912
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:47,240
the burial plots there is cheaper.

913
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:49,010
For 88,000 yuan,

914
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:51,200
it's enough for your mom and me.

915
00:37:51,888 --> 00:37:53,955
The land in Nanjing
is way too expensive.

916
00:37:54,533 --> 00:37:55,280
It's not worth it.

917
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:57,720
We'll leave the house

918
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:58,680
and the money to you.

919
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,560
Duole still has to study.

920
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,911
That's going to cost a lot.

921
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,890
But you're healthy now.

922
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,160
Why talk like this?

923
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,120
People live long lives these days.

924
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,466
You and Mom still have plenty
of years ahead.

925
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:13,010
Also,

926
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:15,050
when that day does come,

927
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:17,200
if you still want to return home,

928
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:18,530
write a will.

929
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,120
We'll honor your wishes.

930
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,930
Mom wouldn't oppose it either.

931
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,490
Liu Dong says

932
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,370
we can buy plots as a group
to get a discount.

933
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,560
Stop listening to him.

934
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:35,200
Do you remember Liu Dong tricked me
out of my money when I was a kid?

935
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,590
He said it was to buy me
those liquor-filled chocolates.

936
00:38:37,688 --> 00:38:38,400
And then what?

937
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,720
He disappeared with the money.

938
00:38:39,733 --> 00:38:41,333
And I never even saw the chocolates.

939
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:43,080
I cried so hard.

940
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,280
Aunt even took his side

941
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,050
and said he didn't mean it.

942
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,050
That's why

943
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:51,010
don't bother
with any group buying discounts.

944
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,560
When the time comes,
we'll just go back there

945
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,688
and buy the best plot.

946
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,120
That would work too.

947
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,600
Of course.

948
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,490
Give me your phone.

949
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:00,850
Why?

950
00:39:01,488 --> 00:39:03,244
I'm going to transfer you 10,000 yuan.

951
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:05,490
What for?

952
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,600
I don't need money.

953
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:08,244
(Transfer 10,000 yuan)
No, don't do it.

954
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,700
- All done.
- You already transferred?

955
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,560
If your mom finds out, she's going to...

956
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:13,930
I helped you hide it in this.

957
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,640
Look, this is the "Wealth Manager" app.

958
00:39:17,511 --> 00:39:19,177
Mom doesn't know about this thing.

959
00:39:19,755 --> 00:39:20,800
She doesn't know it.

960
00:39:20,822 --> 00:39:22,377
I don't know how to use it either.

961
00:39:22,466 --> 00:39:24,000
All you have to do is transfer it out

962
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,560
when you need it.

963
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,760
Wait, I thought

964
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:29,760
Shen Qing still needed some money too?

965
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:32,240
You two are quite tight in cash too.

966
00:39:32,466 --> 00:39:33,800
This amount doesn't affect much.

967
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,280
I made this money

968
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,240
and I want to spend it on you.

969
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:40,490
Silly child.

970
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:42,970
If I can earn,

971
00:39:43,222 --> 00:39:43,890
you can spend.

972
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:46,200
Don't worry about it.

973
00:39:46,266 --> 00:39:48,810
You can go out with your fishing buddies
and go out for a meal.

974
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,600
Stop thinking about death.

975
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,488
Being alive is such a blessing.

976
00:40:04,266 --> 00:40:06,222
I looked over
your presentation slides yesterday.

977
00:40:06,222 --> 00:40:08,311
There are still a few areas
that could be improved.

978
00:40:08,333 --> 00:40:10,330
I'll be direct. The template
should be changed.

979
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,530
And maybe the font too.

980
00:40:14,133 --> 00:40:14,930
Hey, Lina.

981
00:40:16,155 --> 00:40:17,090
You can work on it now.

982
00:40:22,222 --> 00:40:23,010
Have a seat, Lina.

983
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:26,530
What's the matter?

984
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,000
Why are you in such a rush
to see me?

985
00:40:28,066 --> 00:40:28,933
Don't even ask.

986
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,200
Headmaster Zhang called me last night.

987
00:40:31,244 --> 00:40:34,044
He said the design was too similar
to Ansheng High School's uniform

988
00:40:34,044 --> 00:40:35,488
and requested to change the design.

989
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,720
I'm at my wit's end.

990
00:40:36,822 --> 00:40:39,422
I have to hire a professional designer
to help him now.

991
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,600
They paid so little,

992
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,088
yet they're still being this picky?

993
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,680
I don't have time

994
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,890
to argue about this anymore.

995
00:40:46,955 --> 00:40:48,733
The factory is waiting
to start production.

996
00:40:48,755 --> 00:40:49,733
I'm going crazy here.

997
00:40:49,755 --> 00:40:51,266
I have to get this design draft done

998
00:40:51,288 --> 00:40:52,600
and delivered in two days.

999
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:54,680
Okay, what do you need me to do?

1000
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,120
Can you help me withdraw

1001
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,450
that 500,000 yuan business loan?

1002
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,240
Okay.

1003
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,080
No problem.

1004
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,120
That's great.

1005
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:06,890
Calm down, Lina.

1006
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:08,410
Here.

1007
00:41:09,311 --> 00:41:09,970
Have some water.

1008
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:10,680
Thanks.

1009
00:41:10,755 --> 00:41:11,490
You're welcome.

1010
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,280
Lina,

1011
00:41:18,533 --> 00:41:20,330
does hiring a designer really cost
that much?

1012
00:41:21,111 --> 00:41:22,111
That's not the reason.

1013
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,280
Well,

1014
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:27,240
I want to help my dad buy a burial plot.

1015
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,530
Lina, is your business range

1016
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,450
that broad now?

1017
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:33,720
Not at all.

1018
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,450
On my way here,

1019
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:39,640
I kept thinking that my dad

1020
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,890
has been working hard all his life.

1021
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:46,490
He only wants to return to his roots
after he passes.

1022
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,120
As his daughter,

1023
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,530
I should fulfill his wishes, right?

1024
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:52,970
Of course.

1025
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,080
Even if my mom refuses

1026
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,450
to be buried with him there,

1027
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,560
he won't be lonely

1028
00:41:58,688 --> 00:42:00,511
seeing we have many relatives there.

1029
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,050
I understand.

1030
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:05,490
You're a filial daughter.

1031
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:08,410
But

1032
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:12,450
a business loan is meant
for business use.

1033
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,222
So buying a cemetery plot with it

1034
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:14,930
might not...

1035
00:42:16,177 --> 00:42:17,333
It can't be done?

1036
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:20,370
Unless you're planning
to build a cemetery.

1037
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,280
Then you can.

1038
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,160
Build it?

1039
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,450
That's beyond my capability.

1040
00:42:33,422 --> 00:42:34,200
All right, Lina.

1041
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,160
Stop worrying about it.

1042
00:42:35,422 --> 00:42:36,600
I just got my commission.

1043
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:37,530
I can lend it to you.

1044
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:38,490
No, it's okay.

1045
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:39,659
Give me your account number.

1046
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,190
- What's the number?
- Oh, it's okay.

1047
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,120
Young people
like you have high commitments.

1048
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,200
It's okay.

1049
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,970
I'll think of another way.

1050
00:42:47,044 --> 00:42:48,888
Lina, don't be embarrassed about this.

1051
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,120
What if

1052
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,640
I use the business loan
to invest in Joy Academy,

1053
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:57,600
and then use the profits
to buy the plot?

1054
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,410
Would that work?

1055
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:00,240
Of course, you can.

1056
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:02,911
It's your profit.
You can spend it however you like.
