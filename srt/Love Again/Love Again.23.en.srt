3
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:39,890
Dad.

4
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,610
Why aren't you taking a nap?

5
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,080
You...

6
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,520
I just came back
from walking 10,000 steps.

7
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,800
Where's Ms. Lv?

8
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,850
Ms. Lv?

9
00:01:48,044 --> 00:01:48,730
She's right here.

10
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,360
Hello, Ms. Lv.

11
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,640
Hello, Shen Dai.

12
00:01:56,777 --> 00:01:58,050
Ms. Lv, thank you for everything.

13
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,080
My dad told me you've been
helping him exercise lately.

14
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,520
Even his appetite's come back.

15
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,190
He can finish
a whole bowl of noodles now!

16
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,730
No need to thank me. Don't worry.

17
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,640
I'll take good care of your father.

18
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,200
Come back and visit when you can.

19
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,240
He misses you.

20
00:02:11,688 --> 00:02:13,355
Take care of yourself over there.

21
00:02:13,377 --> 00:02:13,850
That's all.

22
00:02:14,444 --> 00:02:15,290
You take care too.

23
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:15,890
Will do.

24
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,290
Eat well.

25
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,920
Eat a balanced diet.

26
00:02:21,422 --> 00:02:22,010
All right.

27
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,170
Shen Dai.

28
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,610
Is this yours?

29
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:30,800
No.

30
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,760
All right then.

31
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,010
Take care.

32
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,080
Okay, I'm hanging up.

33
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,290

(Chinese Motherwort)

35
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,980
(Sunset Glory Square Dance Competition)

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,680
Great!

37
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,240
Ladies! Gather around!

38
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:35,730
Coming!

39
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,290
Come!

40
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,000
Quickly!

41
00:03:37,244 --> 00:03:38,020
Stand in position.

42
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:38,880
Listen to me.

43
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:39,730
Listen to me.

44
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,170
They were way too nervous

45
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,290
in that last performance.

46
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,000
Got it?

47
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,090
We have to avoid that.

48
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,290
We need to stay steady.

49
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,610
Just follow the beat. Clear and clean.

50
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,170
No rushing, understand? Just...

51
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,730
Just like that. Steady.

52
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,360
Take your places.

53
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,440
That's it. To your places.

54
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,155
Get into position.

55
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,290
Heads up, shoulders back.

56
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,770
Bring the energy!

57
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,320
If we make it to the finals,

58
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,090
we get to perform
at the Olympic Sports Center!

59
00:04:07,777 --> 00:04:09,800
- Let's do our best!
- That would be incredible!

60
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,480
So let's hang in there!

61
00:04:11,488 --> 00:04:12,920
- We got this!
- Let's go! Let's go!

62
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,210
We got this!

63
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,290
Ms. Lv.

64
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:16,920
Come with me.

65
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,666
I'll be right back.

66
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,320
Ms. Lv! Wait!

67
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,170
What's wrong?

68
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,480
Whose is this?

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,320
What?

70
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,210
I don't know.

71
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,240
Who's Lian Yilian?

72
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,680
Ms. Lv,

73
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,610
I need to get on stage.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,050
This competition means a lot to us.

75
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,850
You're not going anywhere
until you tell me.

76
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,170
You can't...

77
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,360
A folk song takes two to sing.

78
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,170
A basket of tea
spreads fragrance for miles.

79
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:42,610
Look! It's already their turn!

80
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,480
- Please let me go!
- Answer my question.

81
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:44,880
Ms. Lv!

82
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,360
Baoqin, hurry! We're on!

83
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,050
Hurry!

84
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,320
I'll be right there!

85
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,000
Let me dance first.

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,480
I'll tell you after I finish.

87
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:53,410
Please?

88
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,850
Tell me.

89
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:56,410
Okay.

90
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,530
That belonged to Shen's ex-girlfriend.

91
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,290
Can I go now?

92
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,610
I knew it.

93
00:05:04,377 --> 00:05:05,730
Did she live in that house?

94
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,050
She moved in herself, just like you did.

95
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:08,800
Oh, no.

96
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,800
She moved in herself. You didn't.

97
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,680
She stayed for a month.

98
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,560
Then they broke up and she moved out.

99
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,320
A month?

100
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:15,800
Yes.

101
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,650
Guest room or master bedroom?

102
00:05:18,822 --> 00:05:19,560
She stayed in...

103
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:20,880
Baoqin!

104
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:22,360
Come on!

105
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,777
- We're up!
- Where did she stay?

106
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,050
Tell me!

107
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:25,850
Let me think.

108
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,240
Hurry up! We're on!

109
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,000
Ms. Lv.

110
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,155
- Look. We really have to perform.
- Say no more.

111
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,850
I get it now.

112
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,290
I didn't expect Shen
to be that kind of person.

113
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,170
If you want to blame someone,
blame that...

114
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,730
Blame who?

115
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:41,730
Say it.

116
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,170
Blame that Gou!

117
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,880
It was him! He pushed for it!

118
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:46,850
He kept saying

119
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,530
if he didn't introduce someone,

120
00:05:48,577 --> 00:05:49,977
Shen would end up alone forever.

121
00:05:50,022 --> 00:05:51,533
Now you know. I've told you everything.

122
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,650
Next up, we have
the Life is Beautiful Dance Team!

123
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,320
I have to go.

124
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,320
Thank you. I'm off, then.

125
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,440
Presenting
Colorful Clouds Chasing the Moon!

126
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,120
Come on!

127
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:15,066
Mr. Shen, done with your workout?

128
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,090
9,990 steps.

129
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,650
I'll hit 10,000 right as I get home.

130
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,360
Impressive! Goodbye, Mr. Shen.

131
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,610
Bye.

132
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,970
I hit 10,000 steps!

133
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:41,920
What's going on here?

134
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,610
These slippers are Jingmin's.

135
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:47,800
I know.

136
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,320
You keep them

137
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,800
because they're a memory.

138
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,120
That I understand.

139
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:54,970
But these

140
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,680
size 38 shoes.

141
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,530
They're not Jingmin's.

142
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,410
They're not Lina's.

143
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,290
And they're definitely not Shen Dai's,

144
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,010
who's all the way overseas.

145
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,050
So,

146
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,800
whose are they?

147
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,200
These shoes...

148
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:18,800
They're...

149
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,155
They're hers, aren't they?

150
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:29,720
They're...

151
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,530
Who is she?

152
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,680
Her name is Lian Yilian,

153
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,000
right?

154
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,800
She was your ex-girlfriend, wasn't she?

155
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,250
You were even about to get married,
weren't you?

156
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,170
I used to think your heart
belonged to Jingmin alone.

157
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,530
I was wrong about you.

158
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:14,440
Ms. Lv Yuan.

159
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,440
You came prepared.

160
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,490
Well...

161
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,050
All right. Let's talk.

162
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:23,800
Calm down.

163
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,560
People say you should mourn
for three years...

164
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,130
You couldn't even make it one.

165
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,800
You have no sense of decency!

166
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,680
Some professor you are.

167
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,250
Jingmin.

168
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,050
He was already sleeping

169
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,800
with another woman
less than a year later!

170
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,530
- Do you even
- Jingmin...

171
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,422
hear yourself?

172
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,800
Mourning for three years

173
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,680
is for parents, not spouses!

174
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,840
Listen here, Ms. Lv Yuan.

175
00:08:58,770 --> 00:08:59,530
Lian Yilian

176
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,410
was the head nurse
back when I was hospitalized.

177
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,680
She's an excellent medical professional.

178
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,320
If it weren't for her care,

179
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,840
I wouldn't have

180
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,600
recovered so quickly.

181
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,840
It's true that we developed feelings.

182
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,410
And yes, we talked about marriage.

183
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,890
But things didn't work out

184
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,250
for other reasons.

185
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,250
Oh, so just because she's "excellent,"

186
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,250
she gets to seduce patients?

187
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,960
Nurses are supposed
to care for patients.

188
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,250
Anyone who takes care of you,

189
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,440
you just end up sleeping with?

190
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,560
Watch your mouth!

191
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,290
Jingmin is gone.

192
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,650
I've barely managed

193
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,080
to pull myself out of that grief.

194
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,960
I tried to find love again.

195
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,530
Is that wrong?

196
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,680
Yes!

197
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:55,770
This is exactly

198
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:57,720
what you call

199
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,200
heartless and ungrateful.

200
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,840
"Finding love" is just your cover

201
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,840
to forget where you came from!

202
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,440
Ms. Lv Yuan.

203
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,600
I'm not heartless.

204
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,530
And I'm not forgetting anything.

205
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,600
Heed my advice.

206
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,650
Stop living in the past.

207
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,200
Stop slapping labels on people.

208
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,440
I'll say this again.

209
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,320
I have the right to pursue my happiness!

210
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:37,960
Jingmin!

211
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,130
Look at him! Just look at him!

212
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,410
Ms. Lv.

213
00:11:00,888 --> 00:11:01,680
How can I help you?

214
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:02,650
Hello.

215
00:11:06,288 --> 00:11:07,050
I'll be right back.

216
00:11:09,755 --> 00:11:11,050
What can I do for you, Ms. Lv?

217
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,080
You know Lian Yilian?

218
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,130
I do. Why?

219
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,960
You introduced her to Shen, didn't you?

220
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:19,650
No.

221
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,130
I... I didn't.

222
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,650
Don't lie.

223
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,200
I wouldn't have come
if I didn't already have proof.

224
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,080
What do I have to lie about?

225
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,960
How exactly did you set them up?
Give me details.

226
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,200
You're talking nonsense...

227
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,960
Who gave him this duvet?

228
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,490
That day we had hotpot,

229
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,720
I already felt
you were impulsive and flaky.

230
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,770
In the choir,

231
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,170
you're the one
always fidgeting the most.

232
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,130
I even wondered,

233
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,010
how could someone like Mr. Shen

234
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,650
have a friend like you?

235
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,560
His wife had just
passed away a year ago.

236
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,680
And instead of being
a supportive friend,

237
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,560
you were busy

238
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,770
playing matchmaker.

239
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,777
What were you thinking?

240
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,170
What do you mean
by "what was I thinking"?

241
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,960
He's single, and she's single.

242
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,080
Why shouldn't I

243
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,720
match them up?

244
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,170
You live wildly,

245
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,010
married a woman 30 years younger,

246
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,440
and now you want to drag

247
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
every man down with you?

248
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,770
Why can't a widower find love again?

249
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,600
Is pursuing love and happiness

250
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,600
somehow "immoral"?

251
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,200
Ms. Lv!

252
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,800
You came to know Shen

253
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,770
after seeing

254
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,250
that choir video, didn't you?

255
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,170
So, who are you to judge us?

256
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,840
I'm not like the others.

257
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,800
I care for Mr. Shen.

258
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,320
Our connection is more noble,

259
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,010
more pure, and more exceptional.

260
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,650
Exceptional?

261
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,080
As far as I know,

262
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,050
there's nothing but friendship
between you and Shen.

263
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:06,960
What's going on?

264
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,370
You two sound like you're fighting.

265
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:10,130
Not at all.

266
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:14,440
We were just discussing the difference
between love and friendship.

267
00:13:15,422 --> 00:13:16,320
What do you think?

268
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:21,890
Gou.

269
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:24,130
What we have now

270
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,370
feels like friendship.

271
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,530
Gou.

272
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:36,840
This is love.

273
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,290
This is how I explain the difference.

274
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:40,890
How's that?

275
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,490
Disgusting.

276
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,320
Then how should we define it?

277
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:00,560
Dad.

278
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:01,840
Have you eaten?

279
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,010
Where's Ms. Lv?

280
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,010
No idea.

281
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,050
She left early this morning.

282
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,290
After

283
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,800
that woman found out

284
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,130
about Lian Yilian,

285
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,720
she said I'd betrayed your mother.

286
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,150
That I'd forgotten where I came from.

287
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,840
She forced me to apologize to your mom.

288
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,320
She had me

289
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,600
tossing and turning all night.
Didn't sleep a wink!

290
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,050
Nonsense. That's not true.

291
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,680
After Mom passed,

292
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,770
we all supported you in moving on.

293
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,600
Exactly!

294
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,050
Ms. Lv probably assumed

295
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,650
you were "hers."

296
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,890
She can't think that!

297
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:38,600
She and her daughter don't get along.

298
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,770
When she moved in, I made it very clear

299
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,577
this was just helping each other out.

300
00:14:42,577 --> 00:14:43,200
Like comrades.

301
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,050
Yes, you said that.

302
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,770
But she had her own ideas.

303
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,080
Ms. Lv has a good heart.

304
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,720
She's just a little intense sometimes.

305
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,170
Sometimes, she makes me nervous.

306
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,490
Is that her?

307
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:02,720
She's back.

308
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,890
Dad, don't stress.

309
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,170
I'm not stressed. Not at all.

310
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:10,920
We're all good.

311
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,770
Ms. Lian.

312
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,250
- Come in.
- Lina.

313
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,080
What brings you here?

314
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:23,530
Right.

315
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,130
Everything good?

316
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:25,890
All good.

317
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,622
- I...
- No need to change your shoes.

318
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:28,680
It's fine.

319
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,320
Dad! It's not Ms. Lv.

320
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,650
It's Ms. Lian!

321
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:39,930
Lian, you came.

322
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,690
You're here, Lian.

323
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,010
It's been a while.

324
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:45,490
Hope everything's going well?

325
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:46,450
Yes.

326
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:47,600
I've been well.

327
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,569
Come on in.

328
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,550
- Come in.
- Have a seat.

329
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:52,977
All right.

330
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,355
Come.

331
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,490
Sit down.

332
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,080
Please sit.

333
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,450
I'll make you some tea.

334
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,290
Thank you.

335
00:15:59,288 --> 00:16:01,066
I actually came
to drop off wedding sweets.

336
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,050
I got married.

337
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,050
Then...

338
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,250
Congratulations are in order.

339
00:16:15,644 --> 00:16:16,360
Congratulations.

340
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,560
Who's the lucky groom?

341
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,840
A retired TCM doctor
from our city hospital.

342
00:16:24,177 --> 00:16:25,250
Very gentle, and very kind.

343
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,210
His place has two bedrooms
and a living room.

344
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,250
He promised to transfer it to us.

345
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,690
Traditional Chinese Medicine. Good.

346
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,970
The older they are, the better.

347
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,010
How old is he?

348
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,080
A bit older than Professor Shen.

349
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:45,690
Older than my dad?

350
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,600
But he's a good man.

351
00:16:51,622 --> 00:16:52,933
He treats me and my son very well.

352
00:16:54,844 --> 00:16:55,880
Well, that's what matters.

353
00:16:56,577 --> 00:16:58,390
No wonder you look like
you've gained a little.

354
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,311
I'm happy for you.

355
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,120
Right.

356
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,930
We should be happy for you.

357
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,360
Yilian.

358
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,450
Now that the housing issue is settled,

359
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,050
Lian Jin finally has some stability.

360
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,210
As his mother,

361
00:17:21,577 --> 00:17:22,730
that must put you at ease.

362
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,840
I really should sincerely

363
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:31,930
wish you the best.

364
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,400
We have a guest.

365
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,360
Who is this?

366
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,360
Ms. Lv, let me introduce you.

367
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,730
This is Ms. Lian.

368
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,090
She's an old friend of my dad's.

369
00:17:56,444 --> 00:17:57,160
Nice to meet you.

370
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,466
Nice to meet you.

371
00:17:58,466 --> 00:17:58,930
I'm Lv Yuan.

372
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,560
Lv as in Lv Bu.

373
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,050
Yuan as in "a single spark
can start a prairie fire."

374
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,930
I moved in at the start of the month.

375
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,970
No. Not the same situation.

376
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,490
Different from when you moved in.

377
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,800
Ms. Lv is here because...

378
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,880
Lina,
why didn't you make tea for our guest?

379
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,730
Where are your manners?

380
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:18,977
Right, I'll go make tea.

381
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,640
I'll do that.

382
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,840
Go on.

383
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,840
You're Lian Yilian, aren't you?

384
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,690
Mr. Shen Zhuoran

385
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,050
mentioned you.

386
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:39,977
Have a seat.

387
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,450
I should go.

388
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,770
Please don't.

389
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,010
Running away won't solve anything.

390
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,400
Let's just sit down and talk openly.

391
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:53,290
Sit.

392
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,210
Sit down.

393
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,320
You too.

394
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,450
Didn't you two already break up?

395
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Why are you back again?

396
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,930
Lian is here to drop off wedding sweets.

397
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:15,970
She got married.

398
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:18,640
You got married?

399
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,970
Yes. I'm just here to share the joy.

400
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:24,770
See?

401
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:25,930
See.

402
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,400
I brought some
for Shen Qing and the others too.

403
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,840
Please help me pass them

404
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,770
to Gou and Ding.

405
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:34,533
Of course. I'll make sure they get them.

406
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,560
How are they doing?

407
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,880
They're all doing well.

408
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:38,250
Gou's doing fine.

409
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:39,320
Ding

410
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,120
has Alzheimer's.

411
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,640
But he was doing just fine, wasn't he?

412
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,290
Yes.

413
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,770
You know Ding too?

414
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,050
Yes.

415
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,530
Ding, Gou, and Professor Shen.

416
00:19:51,622 --> 00:19:53,030
They were like the Three Musketeers.

417
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:53,800
Yes.

418
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,360
So, how's Ding now?

419
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,970
He's on medication.

420
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,010
They say it's under control.

421
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,880
Yilian, how have you been?

422
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:03,970
Your health okay?

423
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:04,800
Dad.

424
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,600
She's the wife of a TCM doctor now.

425
00:20:08,644 --> 00:20:10,177
Of course she's well taken care of.

426
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,533
Right? Have some tea, Ms. Lian.

427
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,120
Right.

428
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,560
Ms. Lv.

429
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,080
My husband is a bit older than me,

430
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:18,560
but he's very kind to me and Lian Jin.

431
00:20:19,755 --> 00:20:21,600
I've already arranged
for early retirement,

432
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,690
so I can spend more time with him.

433
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,800
Meeting someone at this age...

434
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,080
That's fate too, right?

435
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,730
Yes. Fate...

436
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:30,970
Fate.

437
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,160
And how's Lian Jin doing these days?

438
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,840
He's doing great.

439
00:20:43,222 --> 00:20:46,210
Still loves reading. Lately he's gotten
into traditional Chinese medicine.

440
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,450
He's passionate about it.

441
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,210
Passion is the best motivation.

442
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:52,050
Yes. He even has his own study now.

443
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,490
Spends all day in there
writing and drawing.

444
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,266
That's wonderful.

445
00:20:55,311 --> 00:20:57,480
Of course, a big part of that
is thanks to your influence.

446
00:20:57,488 --> 00:20:58,250
Not at all.

447
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,080
I

448
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,880
wasn't in a position

449
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,050
to be picky anymore.

450
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,250
I only want the best

451
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,640
for my child.

452
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,010
I understand.

453
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,050
I won't bother you any longer.

454
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,530
Okay.

455
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,450
I'll walk you out.

456
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,530
I'll walk you.

457
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:17,690
Thanks.

458
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,160
Professor Shen.

459
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,400
I'm very grateful

460
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,640
to you.

461
00:21:26,444 --> 00:21:27,266
I understand.

462
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,690
I understand.

463
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,240
(Shen Zhuoran and Lian Yilian)
Take your things with you.

464
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,530
You can keep using that "wedding duvet."

465
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,080
Ms. Lv!

466
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,080
You...

467
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,970
Don't leave loose ends.

468
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,490
That'll only ruin your own happiness.

469
00:21:48,888 --> 00:21:50,488
(Shen Zhuoran and Lian Yilian)

470
00:21:56,296 --> 00:22:06,000
(Shen Zhuoran and Lian Yilian)

471
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,560
Dad!

472
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:42,970
You've circled the park several times.

473
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,080
Don't be upset anymore. Let's go back.

474
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,320
It's not like I want to be angry,

475
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:50,080
but what she did was infuriating!

476
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:50,970
Yes.

477
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,770
Yilian got married

478
00:22:53,266 --> 00:22:54,970
and came over to deliver wedding sweets.

479
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,530
Shouldn't we be wishing her well?

480
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,880
Of course.

481
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,400
And what did Ms. Lv Yuan do?

482
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,450
She grabbed that duvet,

483
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,690
that special duvet,

484
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,120
and threw it at her!

485
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,530
That's an insult, you know?

486
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,444
Made me feel so...

487
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,080
Ugh, I was so embarrassed...

488
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,160
Dad, maybe we should call Xinghuo?

489
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,711
Ask her to come pick her mom up sooner?

490
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,290
Yes, call her. Call her now.

491
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:16,290
Okay.

492
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:20,730
Dad, have a seat.

493
00:23:23,955 --> 00:23:24,740
Did it go through?

494
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,838
Xinghuo.

495
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,050
Just a moment.

496
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,210
Xinghuo.

497
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,250
Are you back yet?

498
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:36,730
Listen.

499
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,490
Today, your mother...

500
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:40,880
No needles!

501
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:42,770
Taotao?

502
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,050
Is that you, Taotao? Why are you crying?

503
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,250
Mr. Shen,

504
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,250
I was just about to let you know.

505
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,640
We're still in Shanghai.

506
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,770
Taotao might've eaten something bad.

507
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:53,440
She's been throwing up
and having diarrhea.

508
00:23:53,444 --> 00:23:54,650
They're doing blood tests now.

509
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,570
The doctor says
she might need to be hospitalized.

510
00:23:56,577 --> 00:23:59,530
I don't want to be hospitalized!
I want to go home!

511
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,360
Can you manage her on your own?

512
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,250
I'll manage.

513
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,222
I've got a friend helping me
take care of her.

514
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:06,560
I'm so sorry,

515
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,050
Mr. Shen.

516
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,560
My mom might need

517
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,290
to stay with you for a few more days.

518
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,600
Forget your mom for now.

519
00:24:14,044 --> 00:24:15,400
Just take care of your daughter.

520
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:17,560
Taotao.

521
00:24:17,822 --> 00:24:18,560
It's Grandpa Shen.

522
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,690
Taotao, listen to me.

523
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,840
I want to go home!

524
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,050
Be good.

525
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,990
You're sick.
You have to take your medicine.

526
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,311
Get your shots,
and if you need, stay in the hospital.

527
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:28,050
There, there.

528
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,490
Taotao is a brave little girl.

529
00:24:29,866 --> 00:24:32,210
Get well soon. I'll take you out
to play when you're back.

530
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,050
No more tears.

531
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,730
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

532
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:37,840
Let's go.

533
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,290
Let's go home.

534
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,560
The timing of it all.

535
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,290
Yes...

536
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,050
Maybe you can stay with us
for a few days, Dad?

537
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,290
Squeeze in with Duole.

538
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,288
That's an idea.

539
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,120
But why should I?

540
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,210
It's my home!

541
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,210
Why should I give her space?

542
00:25:00,377 --> 00:25:01,244
I won't do it.

543
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,640
I need to have a real talk with her.

544
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,666
I need to make her understand

545
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:07,311
the truth of this situation.

546
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,560
Ms. Lv?

547
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,080
Out exercising?

548
00:25:35,222 --> 00:25:35,880
That's right.

549
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,930
Start the day right and all that.

550
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,010
I heard you threw the duvet

551
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,050
at Lian Yilian yesterday?

552
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:44,360
I did.

553
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,770
I don't tolerate nonsense.

554
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:50,530
Even if it were the emperor himself,
I'd still kick her out.

555
00:25:51,422 --> 00:25:52,400
Got a bit impulsive?

556
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,640
No, no.

557
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,800
You're a model citizen.

558
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,640
But perhaps

559
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,730
just a little too impulsive?

560
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,770
Think about it.

561
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,600
Lian Yilian

562
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:08,600
is married now.

563
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,360
To an old man.

564
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,050
What's she after, huh?

565
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,050
The house, obviously!

566
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,120
Sure, Gou tried to set her up,

567
00:26:18,222 --> 00:26:19,210
but it didn't work out.

568
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,600
We saw through it. She ran off.

569
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,880
You're above all that.

570
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,560
Why even get involved?

571
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,320
No, no! Lian Yilian is really something!

572
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,450
Already married,

573
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,160
and she still came over
and sat there in Shen's house.

574
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:39,640
Those watery eyes,

575
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,640
acting all delicate.

576
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,690
Is that appropriate?

577
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:45,311
Inappropriate.

578
00:26:45,311 --> 00:26:45,490
Yes!

579
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,160
Inappropriate!

580
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,490
Right.

581
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,540
That's very inappropriate.

582
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,560
Would you go
to your ex-boyfriend's place,

583
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,840
gaze at him with watery eyes,

584
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,320
and act all fragile?

585
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,640
Of course not.

586
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,733
- Absolutely not.
- Right!

587
00:26:56,755 --> 00:26:58,010
I would never.

588
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:58,730
Right.

589
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:00,690
But...

590
00:27:00,977 --> 00:27:02,290
That's what I'm saying, though.

591
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,160
I understand it's about the principle.

592
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:06,490
But...

593
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,290
Here's what I think.

594
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,600
Shen.

595
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,560
My in-law.

596
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,120
After all these years
of being in-laws with him,

597
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,210
I can assure you

598
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,360
I know him very well.

599
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,250
He's someone very loyal in love.

600
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:21,800
When Jingmin passed away,

601
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,120
Shen just broke down, and collapsed.

602
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,450
Almost didn't make it.

603
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,080
That burial plot he bought?

604
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,450
It was a double plot.

605
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,640
He planned for the end already.

606
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,490
Really?

607
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,690
Yes.

608
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,320
So,

609
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,560
what do we need to do now?

610
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,080
We need to stay united.

611
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,360
Unity is strength.

612
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,690
Unity is strength.

613
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,450
Right?

614
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,530
When you threw that duvet,

615
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,250
you were pushing Shen away.

616
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:55,690
Now

617
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,490
you need to stand with him.

618
00:27:59,250 --> 00:27:59,690
Also,

619
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,840
and I'm not sure
if I'm right to say this,

620
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,970
but I really think

621
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,840
you should wish Lian Yilian well.

622
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,930
Wish her a happy marriage.

623
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,400
Wish her the best.

624
00:28:11,266 --> 00:28:12,640
Not sure if I'm right to say it...

625
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,800
You're right. You're completely right.

626
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,640
I know someone who used to work
at the same steel factory

627
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,010
as Ms. Lv Yuan.

628
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,490
He told me she was laid off.

629
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,400
He also said

630
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:31,600
her ex-husband had an affair

631
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,120
back in the day.

632
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,160
Lv Yuan went all out

633
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,360
to get that divorce.

634
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,450
She chased her husband

635
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:41,955
around the whole factory
wielding a seamless steel pipe!

636
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:43,360
Cornered him in a meeting room

637
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,640
and smashed all the glass!

638
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,560
When she finally got in,
she nearly broke his leg.

639
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:52,800
Shen, I came today
just to tell you this.

640
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,320
You need to be very careful

641
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,930
when dealing with Lv Yuan.

642
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,730
Mind the boundaries.

643
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,120
What do you mean by that?

644
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,080
There's nothing going on between us.

645
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,400
What boundaries am I supposed to mind?

646
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,400
An affair? A broken leg?

647
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,400
What is this mess?

648
00:29:13,511 --> 00:29:14,688
See what I'm dealing with?

649
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,250
Dad.

650
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:18,120
Ms. Lv definitely went too far
with this one.

651
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,970
But that's just her hot temper.

652
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,880
Let it go. She's not a bad person.

653
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,160
Just bear with it.

654
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,690
Right. Just let it go.

655
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,911
How am I supposed to let it go?

656
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,770
Yes, she has done

657
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,690
a lot for our family.

658
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:31,600
She has been a great help.

659
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,120
We should be grateful.

660
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,360
But look

661
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,210
at what happened today!

662
00:29:37,155 --> 00:29:38,250
How do I just let that go?

663
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,450
I can't let it go.

664
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,530
And let me tell you.

665
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,530
A few days ago,
she came looking for me in the park.

666
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:44,577
I told her straight up.

667
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:45,800
I said, based on my gut,

668
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,290
Shen doesn't feel that way about you.

669
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,770
There's a difference between
friendship and romance.

670
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:51,010
Gou!

671
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:56,244
You really are my old friend!
You know me well!

672
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:58,690
Mr. Gou.

673
00:29:59,133 --> 00:30:00,210
What's the difference then?

674
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,560
Lina,

675
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,930
with friendship

676
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,450
you can eat together, and talk together.

677
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,490
But love?

678
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,050
You have to sleep together.

679
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,600
Good one.

680
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,160
Well, not entirely.

681
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,560
Not entirely, no.

682
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,160
True.

683
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:26,800
An even better one.

684
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,400
Ms. Lv Yuan.

685
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,320
We need to have a proper talk.

686
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:35,600
All right.

687
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:37,970
But before that,

688
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,360
let me first start
with my self-reflection.

689
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,770
Lian Yilian came

690
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:44,250
as a guest yesterday,

691
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:45,730
and I acted out of line.

692
00:30:47,288 --> 00:30:49,320
I'm sorry.
I sincerely apologize to you with a bow.

693
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,210
No, no... No need to bow.

694
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,160
Please sit.

695
00:30:52,177 --> 00:30:52,933
Sit down and talk.

696
00:30:52,955 --> 00:30:54,400
I understand everything

697
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,120
that happened now.

698
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,930
It's not your fault.

699
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,970
You're a victim too.

700
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,400
You lost your wife
and you were in a fragile state.

701
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,010
Then, some "bad friends"
tried to play matchmaker.

702
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,840
Yilian had her own reasons.

703
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,970
Pulling you

704
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,320
into

705
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,730
this emotional whirlpool.

706
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,250
It's understandable

707
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,770
and worthy of sympathy.

708
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,880
No. That's not how it is.

709
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,210
To be honest, I'm at fault here too.

710
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,450
We all have our own

711
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,730
perspectives

712
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,080
and concerns,

713
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:29,800
right?

714
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:34,160
I didn't try to understand

715
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,010
the deeper reasons
behind Yilian's choices.

716
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:37,490
See?

717
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,050
I was the one who pushed her to leave.

718
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:42,111
She came back just
to give us some wedding sweets.

719
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:42,730
And yet you...

720
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:43,730
It just wasn't right...

721
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:46,360
See? Even in a situation like this,

722
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,800
you still have the courage
to reflect on yourself.

723
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,250
I'm truly impressed.

724
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,800
I understand Yilian's hardship now.

725
00:31:53,844 --> 00:31:55,050
Marrying that rich old man

726
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,450
just for her son's sake,

727
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:58,930
succumbing to money.

728
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,360
Trading her future

729
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:05,160
for a house for her son.

730
00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:08,450
It wasn't easy.

731
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,930
She deserves sympathy too.

732
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,640
What are you even talking about?

733
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,640
Where is this all going?

734
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,400
On your behalf,

735
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,690
I had someone deliver her
a big red envelope

736
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:19,955
to wish her a blessed marriage.

737
00:32:19,977 --> 00:32:23,400
A halfway-marriage,
each gets what they need.

738
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,800
Everyone's happy in the end, right?

739
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,640
No! No, no, no... wait!

740
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,044
How much money was in that envelope?

741
00:32:30,044 --> 00:32:30,819
I'll pay you back.

742
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,311
Please don't.

743
00:32:31,377 --> 00:32:32,120
You can't

744
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,840
give me any money.

745
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,530
That was just

746
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,330
a small gesture,

747
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,560
a little apology from me.

748
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:43,370
I was

749
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,560
totally in the wrong.

750
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,850
I jumped to conclusions.

751
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,720
But even in that state,

752
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:51,930
you still managed
to finish your 10,000 steps!

753
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,080
Really.

754
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,080
I've got a lot to learn from you.

755
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,370
Let's have Shen Qing

756
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,680
and the whole family over
for dinner tonight.

757
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,890
I want to apologize to everyone.

758
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,050
No, no.

759
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,866
That's not necessary.

760
00:33:04,755 --> 00:33:05,688
That won't be necessary.

761
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,530
I'll explain things

762
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,450
to the young ones myself.

763
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,160
All right.

764
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,200
Let the past be the past.

765
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,410
As the old song goes,

766
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,930
"onward, onward, onward!"

767
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,370
From now on,

768
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:22,160
let's supervise each other

769
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,450
and grow together.

770
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,530
Here, Mr. Shen. Let's shake on it.

771
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:33,370
Are you okay?

772
00:33:36,822 --> 00:33:37,530
Are you all right?

773
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:42,490
Take it easy!

774
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,370
As you all know,

775
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,370
if we can't get

776
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,890
the Phase III clinical data out soon,

777
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,680
we won't get
the B+ rounds of investment.

778
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,010
Everything we've worked for

779
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:57,600
will be in vain.

780
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,240
Right now, the only option is

781
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,560
to extend the trial to 24 weeks.

782
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,050
But if we do that,

783
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,720
the R&D budget won't be enough.

784
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,760
So

785
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,120
Mr. Du from Furong called earlier.

786
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:21,280
He's willing to add
another five million.

787
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,600
But even that might not be enough.

788
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:26,530
So

789
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,600
I wanted to loop everyone in.

790
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,970
If we run into another funding gap,

791
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,970
can we, as insiders,

792
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:36,280
consider pooling funds

793
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,240
and investing ourselves

794
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,530
to get through it?

795
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,640
Of course, this is a big decision.

796
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:48,560
No rush.

797
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:49,720
Take your time.

798
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,450
Talk it over with your families first.

799
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:56,333
Have some tea.

800
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,200
Qing!

801
00:35:21,222 --> 00:35:22,410
Look! What do you think?

802
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,560
Looks good.

803
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,850
I just landed a big order.

804
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,640
120 sets of performance costumes,

805
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:28,760
8 series,

806
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:30,330
and 24 combinations.

807
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,680
And the company is very rich.

808
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,760
They need it urgently.

809
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,970
So I raised the price just a little.

810
00:35:36,111 --> 00:35:37,850
This order will net me at least 10,000.

811
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,444
What do you think about the hat?

812
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,280
Is it a bit too big?

813
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,490
Come with me, Lina.

814
00:35:46,755 --> 00:35:47,422
What's wrong?

815
00:35:50,288 --> 00:35:50,760
Sit down.

816
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:52,760
What's the matter?

817
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,050
What's going on?

818
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,160
How much money do we have?

819
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,240
We've got 800,000
in managed investments.

820
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,200
Why?

821
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,240
The company

822
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,050
might need

823
00:36:13,822 --> 00:36:14,911
internal fundraising.

824
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:18,010
Fundraising?

825
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,080
Is this because An Ruifeng's leading

826
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,640
everyone to fortune and glory,

827
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,530
or because the company's broke

828
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,450
and needs you to ride out the storm?

829
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,600
The company has hit
a rough patch lately.

830
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,810
But I know better than anyone

831
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,850
how promising these two drugs are.

832
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,810
Once Phase III clinical trials succeed,

833
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,266
they'll definitely be profitable.

834
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,370
Most importantly,

835
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,490
it's about showing

836
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:48,490
we're in this together with the company.

837
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,280
So

838
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,010
maybe we could

839
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,410
use that money...

840
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,050
That depends on your performance.

841
00:36:59,422 --> 00:37:00,688
Let's see how you do tonight.

842
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,930
I'm being serious.

843
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,720
So am I.

844
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,450
Fundraising?

845
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,160
Oh my goodness!

846
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,050
Has Shen Qing lost his mind?

847
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,120
Working overtime every day isn't enough,

848
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,410
now he wants to throw in

849
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,970
all your savings too?

850
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,120
Mom, calm down.

851
00:37:30,155 --> 00:37:31,330
I haven't agreed to anything.

852
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:32,600
The money's still with me.

853
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,370
Don't do it.

854
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:36,050
Don't even think about it.

855
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,280
You've got to hold on tight
to your money,

856
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:39,760
understand?

857
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,450
Got it.

858
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,640
I'm hanging up.

859
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,640
Sun!

860
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,410
Ms. Lv!

861
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:55,850
You're protecting the community.
Show some spirit!

862
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:57,640
Back straight!

863
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,280
Chests out!

864
00:37:59,370 --> 00:37:59,930
Yes, ma'am.

865
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,280
How's this?

866
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:01,640
Good.

867
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:02,930
Goodbye, Ms. Lv.

868
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:03,490
Goodbye.

869
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:18,680
Lina.

870
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,010
Work hard.

871
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,560
This batch has to ship out today.

872
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,920
We're running full throttle already.
Haven't even had time to eat.

873
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,720
I'm counting on you.

874
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,410
Bonuses for everyone!

875
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,530
Four, five, six...

876
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,450
Three, four...

877
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,911
Where's the shipment?

878
00:38:43,911 --> 00:38:45,080
Everything's packed. This box.

879
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,560
This one's urgent.

880
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,120
Don't worry. I got it.

881
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:12,160
Ms. Lv, what are you doing?

882
00:39:12,177 --> 00:39:13,640
There were cockroaches in the house.

883
00:39:13,644 --> 00:39:15,450
I'm disinfecting the entryway.

884
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,330
Might've come in

885
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:19,410
with the delivery boxes.

886
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,450
Business has been good. I'm swamped.

887
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,640
Just sent out a big order today.

888
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,680
That's great!

889
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,370
I'll buy cockroach spray.

890
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,380
You can get that online.

891
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,280
No need.

892
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:32,288
You don't need to worry
about anything at home.

893
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:33,590
Focus on your own stuff. Go on!

894
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,450
I'm happy for you!

895
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:43,890
Back so early today?

896
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,866
Just came to grab
some materials for a meeting

897
00:39:45,888 --> 00:39:47,330
with our overseas partners tonight.

898
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,450
You should've told me.

899
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,160
I could've dropped it off for you.

900
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,120
You've been busy starting your business.

901
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,970
I didn't want to trouble you.
It's not a big deal.

902
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,800
You're being thoughtful for once,
Mr. Shen.

903
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:00,450
By the way,

904
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,410
I completed a big order today!

905
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,200
Ms. Liu, you're a powerhouse.

906
00:40:04,244 --> 00:40:06,080
Don't wait for me tonight.
I'll be working late.

907
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,050
Oh, don't bother. I'll support you!

908
00:40:09,644 --> 00:40:10,822
Sure, whatever you say.

909
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:18,370
Overtime every day.

910
00:40:18,755 --> 00:40:19,560
Doing unpaid labor.

911
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:28,330
Even though your new drug
has reached Phase III trials,

912
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:29,450
that just means

913
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,080
it reached it.

914
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,810
Not that it's passed.

915
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:36,410
Sorry.

916
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,720
We can't invest in this project.

917
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:40,010
Mr. Lin,

918
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,560
our M701 has

919
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,330
huge market potential.

920
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:45,240
We're just one step away now.

921
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:49,370
Sorry.

922
00:40:52,866 --> 00:40:54,720
You're welcome
to stay as long as you like.

923
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:09,890
Leave?

924
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:14,010
It's okay.

925
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,930
Shi's got another company
lined up tonight.

926
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,777
We still have a shot.

927
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:32,600
Mom.

928
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,720
Is Dad still sleeping?

929
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,930
He didn't even come home last night.

930
00:41:37,422 --> 00:41:39,466
He was in meetings all night
at the company.

931
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:41,280
That man...

932
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:43,160
Why does he push himself so hard?

933
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,010
He's doing it for you.

934
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,330
Don't do it for me.

935
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,200
I can survive on two pork buns.

936
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,120
Mom, I'm off to school.

937
00:41:51,244 --> 00:41:52,530
Give me a second. I'll drive you.

938
00:41:52,666 --> 00:41:54,280
It's fine. I'm catching a ride with Lu.

939
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:55,760
Who's that?

940
