00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,040
=Love Again=

2
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,140
=Episode 36=

3
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,300
(Bliss)

4
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,100
Duole,

5
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,940
you brought
a charging cable with you, right?

6
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,780
I brought three of them.

7
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,740
- Great job.
- Put them in the luggage.

8
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,900
It's already full.

9
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:29,620
Do you need to pack bed sheets
with him when he's going overseas?

10
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,740
Yeah. Shen Dai said

11
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,900
that the bed sheets overseas
are not as comfortable.

12
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,820
That's twisted.

13
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,020
I did say that.

14
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,140
How could you trust Shen Dai completely?

15
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,900
Shen Dai was the one
who found Duole's school for him.

16
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,500
Shen Dai is very outstanding.

17
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,420
That's right.

18
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,780
Lina,

19
00:02:46,644 --> 00:02:47,866
you're outstanding as well.

20
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,780
Shen Qing.

21
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,740
Take the dictionary for Duole.

22
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,940
Duole, do you take
the dictionary with you?

23
00:02:56,022 --> 00:02:57,422
Back then, your grandfather came up

24
00:02:57,422 --> 00:02:59,355
with your name through
searching the dictionary.

25
00:02:59,911 --> 00:03:02,180
He actually used the dictionary
to come up with my name?

26
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,700
What do you know?

27
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,860
It's very meaningful.

28
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,980
Wait here. I'll take it for you.

29
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,860
I'm just going to study abroad.

30
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:13,340
Why is the entire family
getting excited?

31
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,500
Of course.

32
00:03:14,622 --> 00:03:16,540
You're the most
treasured member of the family.

33
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,140
Dad.

34
00:03:19,644 --> 00:03:20,888
Mom has truly improved.

35
00:03:20,888 --> 00:03:22,333
Today, she didn't say something like,

36
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,200
"You'll let us down
if you don't study hard."

37
00:03:24,222 --> 00:03:25,444
I haven't finished my words.

38
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,540
Study well.

39
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,700
And, live well.

40
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,300
Experience the world

41
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,660
and enjoy your youth.

42
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,020
Mom, I will.

43
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,860
Send more pictures
to the family group chat.

44
00:03:46,155 --> 00:03:47,777
If you encounter any difficulties,

45
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:50,140
remember, you can
always tell us about it.

46
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,380
Dad, Mom,

47
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,220
I'll look after myself.

48
00:03:55,377 --> 00:03:56,500
You guys should do the same.

49
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,980
Don't worry about us.

50
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,900
- Remember to rest on the plane.
- Got it.

51
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,844
Don't play with your phone
the entire flight.

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,859
Duole.

53
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,180
- Give me your backpack.
- Hello?

54
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,100
I'll carry it for you.

55
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,020
Thank you, Grandpa.

56
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,220
Hello, Grandpa?

57
00:04:23,622 --> 00:04:25,340
- Hurry.
- We've arrived at the airport.

58
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,439
I'm checking in my luggage.

59
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,755
I'll call you right after landing.

60
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,660
There's one more here.

61
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,060
(Duole)
Duoduolele.

62
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,100
Shen gave this to him.

63
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,140
It's not as thick as ours.

64
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,990
Stop chatting.

65
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,222
- Let me put it inside.
- Got it.

66
00:04:37,222 --> 00:04:37,980
Hurry up.

67
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,380
Carry your backpack.

68
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,700
Here you go.

69
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,260
Carry it properly.

70
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,180
Remember,

71
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,420
don't be forgetful, okay?

72
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,090
Did you stuff money
in my backpack again?

73
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,220
Don't tell them about it.

74
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,500
Be well, okay?

75
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,470
Okay.

76
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,620
- Duole.
- Look after yourself.

77
00:04:51,622 --> 00:04:52,940
- Shen Duole!
- Duole!

78
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,860
Duole!

79
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,460
Mom, look at that school uniform.

80
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,820
- Duole!
- Mom.

81
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,470
Look. You designed
their school uniforms.

82
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,460
You're right.

83
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,820
Hello, Mrs. Shen.

84
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,740
Hello.

85
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:05,700
Nice to meet you all.

86
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,620
Mrs. Shen, look.

87
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,780
We can put earphones

88
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,020
in this tiny pocket.

89
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,140
After we zip it,

90
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,420
it won't fall out.

91
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,140
That was my intention all along.

92
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,300
It's much more logical
than the original design.

93
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,660
Girl, do you know something?

94
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,820
You provided me with plenty of courage.

95
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,740
Our vice principal had
high praises for your design.

96
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,822
- Really?
- He might negotiate a deal with you.

97
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,460
Mom, by then, you must set a high price.

98
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,710
You must earn back
your principal together with interest.

99
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:34,220
That's quite embarrassing.

100
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:36,020
But I'll heed your will.

101
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,900
Son,

102
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,780
once you've settled down,

103
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,940
text me on WeChat.

104
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,220
Safe travels.

105
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,500
Mom.

106
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,020
Remember to text me after landing, okay?

107
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,940
Mom,

108
00:06:06,377 --> 00:06:07,660
you need to remember this.

109
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,780
You're more than just my mother.

110
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,740
First of all, you're Liu Lina.

111
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,420
Alright.

112
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:18,511
You'll see an entirely new version of me

113
00:06:18,555 --> 00:06:20,222
when you come back for summer break.

114
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,700
You got this.

115
00:06:37,377 --> 00:06:38,420
Let's work hard together.

116
00:06:40,444 --> 00:06:41,660
Mom, I'll make a move first.

117
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,940
Go now.

118
00:06:42,977 --> 00:06:44,620
- Safe travels.
- I'll make a move first.

119
00:06:46,377 --> 00:06:47,900
- Safe travels.
- Look after yourself.

120
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,820
Duole.

121
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,740
Remember.

122
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,020
We'll always be Chinese.

123
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:55,977
I'm an all-Chinese product!

124
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,780
I'll be leaving now.

125
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,500
Drive safely.

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,030
(Mom,)

127
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:02,140
(you need to remember this.)

128
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,260
(You're more than just my mother.)

129
00:08:04,355 --> 00:08:05,780
(First of all, you're Liu Lina.)

130
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,100
Hello?

131
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,860
Come downstairs.

132
00:08:23,022 --> 00:08:25,533
I'll take you to Yangzhou
for crab roe soup dumplings.

133
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,060
Okay.

134
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,140
Coming.

135
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,220
Jim,

136
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,140
don't you think

137
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,620
we should place this painting

138
00:08:57,644 --> 00:08:58,980
at the center of the exhibition?

139
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,260
About this painting,

140
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,340
I suppose the artist

141
00:09:03,422 --> 00:09:05,111
hasn't reached that level of fame yet.

142
00:09:05,733 --> 00:09:07,688
We should put this
at the center instead.

143
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,100
Its artist is more popular.

144
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,940
As curators,

145
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,780
we have to provide participants

146
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,340
with a vibrant and uplifting force.

147
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,220
What's with all the talk about fame?

148
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,100
Just focus on the painting alone.

149
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,780
The composition,

150
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,422
brushwork, and colors of this painting

151
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,540
are all superior.

152
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,460
And, in my opinion,

153
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,740
paintings that can
impact the world the most

154
00:09:29,822 --> 00:09:31,266
should be placed at the center.

155
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,260
Fine, then.

156
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,660
You convinced me.

157
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,740
Trust me. I'm always right.

158
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,060
Here.

159
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,600
Be gentle.

160
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,950
Is it straight?

161
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:44,970
Yeah.

162
00:09:46,577 --> 00:09:48,088
Let's hang that painting now.

163
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,500
Dad, look.

164
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,420
We're here.

165
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,620
When we were young, you and Mom

166
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,860
always took us here for a hike.

167
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,860
I could never move

168
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,929
after reaching this spot.

169
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,711
Mom and I would wait here
for you and Dai.

170
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,900
I know.

171
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,380
It's not

172
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,660
that you couldn't move.

173
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,466
You just wanted
to keep your mother company.

174
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:29,900
And, every time,
whenever Dai and I returned here,

175
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,422
you would sit by your mother's side

176
00:10:31,444 --> 00:10:32,266
and sing that song.

177
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,740
It's the same old song.

178
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,550
♪Eyes wide open like copper bells♪

179
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:38,420
That's the one.

180
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,740
♪Radiating sharpness like lightning♪

181
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,340
♪Ears upright like antennas♪

182
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,820
You kept repeating it, right?

183
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,540
I think I'm forgetting the lyrics.

184
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,460
Back then,

185
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,660
you led a happy life.

186
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,220
But now,

187
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,900
you're in the prime of your life.

188
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,900
Why are you getting
less and less motivated?

189
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,340
Now that I'm a middle-aged man,

190
00:11:03,688 --> 00:11:05,555
I have to look after
my parents and my child.

191
00:11:05,977 --> 00:11:07,933
Everyone looks for me
when they're in trouble.

192
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,500
Who can I find when I'm in trouble?

193
00:11:09,866 --> 00:11:11,111
I wanted to please my wife

194
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:12,420
when I returned home too.

195
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,620
But eventually,

196
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,820
I lost the energy to do so.

197
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,060
Think about it.

198
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,820
When I was in my forties,

199
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,180
I pulled a long face every day as well.

200
00:11:25,266 --> 00:11:26,977
I didn't talk to anyone when I got home.

201
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,660
When I was free, I took a stroll

202
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,940
downstairs.

203
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,140
Do you remember?

204
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,300
Of course.

205
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,220
Dai and I

206
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,860
observed you upstairs.

207
00:11:36,888 --> 00:11:38,180
You walked round after round.

208
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,140
We were counting it.

209
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,850
You always walked
five and a half rounds.

210
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,180
When I was young,

211
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,540
my father always said this,

212
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,580
"Compromise will make a conflict

213
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,980
much easier

214
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,740
to resolve."

215
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,180
I lived according to that creed.

216
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,100
When I played soccer
with Mr. Gou's son as a kid,

217
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,500
we got into a fight.

218
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,460
You put me under house arrest.

219
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,460
You even made me recite

220
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,940
"Hunting in Mi Zhou".

221
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,060
That verse

222
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:06,311
was so bold and extravagant!

223
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,180
When I couldn't recite it,

224
00:12:08,422 --> 00:12:09,900
you didn't allow me to go outside.

225
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,770
When I cried, you said
men weren't supposed to cry.

226
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:13,266
You said that men would never cry.

227
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,900
Do you remember that?

228
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:17,820
Now that I think about it,

229
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,740
I might be wrong.

230
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,060
In life, we should be able
to express our feelings.

231
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,300
Am I right?

232
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,220
We should cry or laugh

233
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,060
when we want to.

234
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,700
I should've joined you

235
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,780
and played soccer with you.

236
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,711
I shouldn't have made you
recite those verses.

237
00:12:39,422 --> 00:12:40,740
But I was still young back then.

238
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,340
I still remember the verses I recited.

239
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,740
Really?

240
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,940
"This old boy is truly young
at heart and mind.

241
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,580
A retriever by left hand,
a falcon on the right.

242
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,460
In coats of fur and
hats of brocade we ride,

243
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,740
Thousands of hoofbeats
swept the hills in sight.

244
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,300
I'd shoot a tiger like
Sun Quan the heroic archer.

245
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,900
My old heart is fearless again,
fired with wine.

246
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,220
What does it matter so frost
covers my temples high!

247
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,777
When would Feng Tang
be sent with the tally,

248
00:13:10,777 --> 00:13:12,700
to help this governor
who's ready to fight?

249
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,540
Like the full moon,
I'd pull the bow tight and round.

250
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,940
To northwest,
I'd shoot the star of Sirius down!"

251
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,380
How do you feel?

252
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,460
I feel

253
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,980
free.

254
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,180
Shen Qing took care of external affairs
while you took care of internal affairs.

255
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,340
I'm sure it was tough.

256
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,820
Yeah.

257
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,220
Now that you both loosened up,
it's quite nice.

258
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,700
Since young,

259
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,820
my mother praised me,

260
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,540
my teachers praised me,

261
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,577
and Shen Qing praised me.

262
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,700
But now, I realize

263
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,900
that I can praise myself as well.

264
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,820
That's right.

265
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,580
I'm quite pretty, aren't I?

266
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,860
Yeah.

267
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,740
You're very pretty.

268
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,420
You have a great figure too.

269
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,780
But your hairstyle is lacking.

270
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,020
What about this?

271
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,260
- Beautiful!
- Beautiful!

272
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,420
Liu Lina, you're great!

273
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,740
You're super great!

274
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,100
You're outstanding!

275
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,250
Qing, get the door.

276
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,340
Lina?

277
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,260
Come inside.

278
00:15:09,777 --> 00:15:11,710
- Let me change into the slippers.
- It's fine.

279
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:12,900
Come here.

280
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,190
- You look so cool today.
- Dad.

281
00:15:14,244 --> 00:15:15,020
Of course.

282
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,940
Lina.

283
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,420
Dad, you made so many dishes.

284
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,140
That's right. Have a seat.

285
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,380
Listen, Dad is showing
everything he has today.

286
00:15:23,488 --> 00:15:24,700
Do you need me to do anything?

287
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,460
- No.
- Everything is ready.

288
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,466
It's ready. Have a seat.

289
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,300
- Have a seat.
- Sit down.

290
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,820
Come.

291
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,740
Dad.

292
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,060
All of us are seated.

293
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:38,911
Let me introduce someone to you.

294
00:15:39,244 --> 00:15:41,088
This is one of the top singers
of our school,

295
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,180
Shen Qing.

296
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,420
That title is outdated.

297
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,533
Let me reintroduce myself again.

298
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,700
I'm the rising star
of the fashion industry,

299
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:49,940
Liu Lina.

300
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,700
Insert applause here!

301
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,660
Dad, what day is it today?

302
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,020
Dad,

303
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,980
did you graduate

304
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,100
from a famous culinary academy today?

305
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,700
Seems like I have

306
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,380
to change my image

307
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,420
of being bad at doing chores.

308
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:08,700
Let me introduce these dishes.

309
00:16:10,022 --> 00:16:11,620
This is called Snow Cabbage and Edamame.

310
00:16:11,777 --> 00:16:13,620
Ms. Lian Yilian taught me
how to make this.

311
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,940
As for these dumplings,

312
00:16:16,177 --> 00:16:17,777
Ms. Lv Yuan taught me how to make them.

313
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,980
Ms. Nie taught me
how to use osmanthus flowers

314
00:16:22,088 --> 00:16:23,955
and a touch of red
as decoration for pastries.

315
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,980
As for the Snow Fungus
and Red Date Soup, it's...

316
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,220
Ms. Le taught you that.

317
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,300
That's right.

318
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,570
Dad, were you getting
into relationships?

319
00:16:32,577 --> 00:16:34,500
Or were you just learning
how to cook from them?

320
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,220
I did both.

321
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,180
In the past,

322
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,620
I was afraid of aging.

323
00:16:41,555 --> 00:16:42,700
I was afraid of loneliness.

324
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,690
I was afraid that no one
might be there for me.

325
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,260
I've always been searching for support.

326
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,380
I failed at every attempt.

327
00:16:53,355 --> 00:16:55,140
However,
I picked up a lot of new skills.

328
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,820
I've learned many lessons as well.

329
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,260
In my opinion,

330
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,860
if you have

331
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,460
a good mindset,

332
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,980
nothing troubles you.

333
00:17:05,488 --> 00:17:06,990
If you think everything irritates you,

334
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,420
everything will irritate you.

335
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,900
Therefore,

336
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,020
one must be strong
to shape their own destiny.

337
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,060
That's right.

338
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,980
Lina.

339
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,100
Lina,

340
00:17:17,977 --> 00:17:19,180
our family has to thank you

341
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,860
for all these years of contribution.

342
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,260
Today, I'll represent my family,

343
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,020
including those

344
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,140
who aren't around,

345
00:17:26,933 --> 00:17:28,060
and I want to thank you.

346
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,980
It's my duty.

347
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,980
That's not it.

348
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,260
That's not your duty.

349
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,980
You were willing to look after us
of your own accord.

350
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,060
Shen Qing is able to be a workaholic

351
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,740
all because of you.

352
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,140
Lina,

353
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,420
Dad is right.

354
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,700
It's been tough on you all these years.

355
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:00,460
You're the strongest supporter

356
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,860
of the family.

357
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,420
You should stop that.

358
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,940
I'm tearing up.

359
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,220
It's difficult for Qing
to say something mushy.

360
00:18:09,444 --> 00:18:11,460
He's saying that right before
you guys part ways.

361
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,540
What are you saying?

362
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,660
Dad, you're wrong.

363
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,820
Lina.

364
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,140
Don't be afraid

365
00:18:20,377 --> 00:18:21,960
that no one might recognize your talent.

366
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,620
Don't be afraid of loneliness.

367
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,420
Don't be afraid of what he said.

368
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,460
Look at

369
00:18:29,866 --> 00:18:31,460
all the ladies who became my partners.

370
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,740
Each of them is courageous
in their own ways.

371
00:18:40,288 --> 00:18:42,780
No matter what will happen to you
and Shen Qing in the future,

372
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,500
you'll always be a daughter
of the Shen family.

373
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,900
As for your current career,

374
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:54,420
no matter what difficulties
you'll face in the future,

375
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,820
you can just charge ahead.

376
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,820
We'll be your strongest backers.

377
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,780
Dad.

378
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,340
I support you.

379
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,740
Dad.

380
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,460
Let's have a toast.

381
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,140
Dad.

382
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,820
Lina.

383
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,933
Let me offer you a toast.

384
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,340
It's been tough on you.

385
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,260
Son,

386
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,620
remember to train your body.

387
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,980
Make sure you can breathe smoothly.

388
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,100
Don't fall sick.

389
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,190
Alright. I won't fall sick.

390
00:19:34,222 --> 00:19:34,820
I won't.

391
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,740
Dad, wait.

392
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,460
Your expectations for Qing

393
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,460
are this low now, huh?

394
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,800
You just want him to stay healthy?

395
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,340
What about me?

396
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,380
Can I not get married
or have a child in the future?

397
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,700
Of course.

398
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:46,220
It's fine no matter if you get married

399
00:19:46,222 --> 00:19:47,650
or have a child or not in the future.

400
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,260
It's fine as long as you're happy.

401
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,740
That'll be fine.

402
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,300
Am I right?

403
00:19:53,444 --> 00:19:54,911
When you stop insisting on things,

404
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,620
everything will work out.

405
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,060
When you guys were young,

406
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,100
your mother and I hoped

407
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,133
that you two would be
outstanding individuals.

408
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,740
But now that I'm old,

409
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,340
I only wish you guys happiness.

410
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,740
I'm serious.

411
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,700
Just stay happy.

412
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,260
Lina.

413
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,340
You have to smile.

414
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,500
Dad,

415
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,900
you prepared a feast,

416
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,844
and you concluded
the life events of our family.

417
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:31,580
Don't tell me
there's something wrong with you.

418
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,140
Are you unwell?

419
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,380
That's not it.

420
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,660
I'm perfectly healthy.

421
00:20:37,866 --> 00:20:39,460
But I do have an important announcement

422
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,620
to make.

423
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,260
I'm going

424
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,300
to move to a nursing home.

425
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,140
So, in the end,

426
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,100
this is a parting feast, huh?

427
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,220
Dad, isn't it comfortable
living at home?

428
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,100
- Why are you moving to a nursing home?
- Yeah.

429
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,780
It's lively over there.

430
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,620
Besides,

431
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,420
Mr. Ding is there as well.

432
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,420
I can look after him

433
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,929
and keep contributing to society.

434
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,140
Dad, even if you want to do so,

435
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,400
there are plenty of ways.

436
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,980
You don't need
to move to a nursing home.

437
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,140
- Yeah.
- Precisely.

438
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,140
Last time,

439
00:21:15,466 --> 00:21:16,980
I wanted to move to the nursing home

440
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,980
to keep Ms. Nie company.

441
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,420
It didn't work out.

442
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,620
I've always regretted that.

443
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,740
- But...
- No more buts.

444
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,940
I'm already an organ donor.

445
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,900
I'm sure I can make my own decisions.

446
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,220
You see, we Chinese people

447
00:21:34,244 --> 00:21:35,755
are not good at expressing ourselves.

448
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,860
We're bad

449
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,860
at saying something mushy.

450
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:47,740
Today, I'm going to muster my courage

451
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,660
and say this to you all.

452
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,820
My children,

453
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,500
all of you are my excellent children.

454
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:04,980
I

455
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,780
love you all.

456
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:10,900
I love you all.

457
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,260
I...

458
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,540
We love you too.

459
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,500
Dad,

460
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,100
we love you too.

461
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,340
Dad.

462
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,580
Let's just stay happy.

463
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,980
Alright, my girl.

464
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,860
Now,

465
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,620
we can dig in.

It was developed

00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,460
Firstly, we need to understand
the design,

499
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,140
fabric, and color of the outfits.

500
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,620
Through its design,

501
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,380
we can determine what kind of style

502
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,460
this outfit is going for

503
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,700
and what kind of figures
are good fit for said design.

504
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,780
No wonder the fit is so good.

505
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,140
It's tailored with 3D cutting.

506
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,180
That was brilliant.

507
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,620

525
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,700
has been successfully launched today.

526
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,460
It has given our team

527
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,420
a tremendous sense of achievement.

528
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,940
M703 and M706

529
00:25:30,022 --> 00:25:31,140
are still under development.

530
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,220
We believe

531
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,300
that we can conquer
the fortress of technology.

532
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,980
We shall provide humans
with more potent weapons

533
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,220
in the upcoming battles
against diseases.

534
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,220
Now,

535
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,140
we would like

536
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,500
to thank our investors, Shide Capital,

537
00:25:49,511 --> 00:25:51,355
for providing us
with the necessary capital.

538
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,500
We would also like to thank

539
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,780

540
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,220

542
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,700
and Jin.

543
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,740
Without you guys,

544
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,660
RF Pharmaceuticals would cease to exist.

545
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,980
- Mr. Shen.
- Mr. Shen.

546
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,980
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

547
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,666
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

548
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,580
I know many investors have approached
your company.

549
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:26,980
We from Shide Capital

550
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,750
wish to continue our investment
in your company.

551
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:30,577
I wonder if we'll have
the honor to do so.

552
00:26:31,888 --> 00:26:33,940
I'm sure your company has hesitated
to invest in M701

553
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,180
before it was launched, right?

554
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,460
Actually, all of us should thank Ice

555
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,700
the most.

556
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,700

An Ruifeng before.

00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,740
your investment

559
00:26:52,488 --> 00:26:54,340
is that you guys
have to apologize to Ice.

560
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:02,780
That's what we should do.

561
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,820
We're supposed to do that.

562
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,660
I'll contact Ice right now.

563
00:27:13,977 --> 00:27:15,320
You feel much better today, right?

564
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:16,740
You look much better as well.

565
00:27:18,155 --> 00:27:19,977
The living environment
of the hospital is great.

566
00:27:20,488 --> 00:27:22,000
That's why I recover faster.

567
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,020
Dad, sit here.

568
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,400
- I'll answer a call.
- Go ahead.

569
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,511
You can have a seat first.

570
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,420
Hello.

571
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,460
Mr. Qiao. Mr. Lu.

572
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:36,980
Hello, Ice.

573
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,300
Today, M701 has
officially been launched.

574
00:27:40,444 --> 00:27:42,180
It'll help out
many patients in the future.

575
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,900
Mr. Shen said

576
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,900
we owe you an apology.

577
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,740
Therefore,

578
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,980
right now, on behalf of Shide Capital,

579
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,220
I would

580
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,220
like to

581
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,460
apologize to you.

582
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,620
It's fine.

583
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,940
M701 will help my father too.

584
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,500
By helping RF Pharmaceuticals,

585
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,155
I'm helping myself out as well.

586
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,260
How have you been lately, Ice?

587
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,500
I'm doing great.

588
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,420
Shen Qing,

589
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,260
congratulations.

590
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,780
Thank you.

591
00:28:20,555 --> 00:28:22,622
Alright.
We'll stop bothering you. Goodbye.

592
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,540
That was so cool.

593
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,569
Our girls' volleyball team

594
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,622
has advanced to
the National High School Championship.

595
00:28:51,622 --> 00:28:53,100
Please design their uniforms for them.

596
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,060
No problem.

597
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,790
Do you guys have any requests?

598
00:28:56,022 --> 00:28:57,140
Let me ask them about it.

599
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,100
Guys, stop for a second.

600
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,555
Ladies, do you have any specific
requirements for your team uniforms?

601
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:05,500
We want them pretty!

602
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,700
Got it!

603
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,940
Alright, ladies.

604
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,860
Let's begin!

605
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,740
(You've successfully hiked 12 km.)

606
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,380
(Great job. Keep up the good work.)

607
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,940
Hello, Bai?

608
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,300
Lina,

609
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,380
it's me.

610
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,900
Sorry.

611
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,800
I didn't dare to switch on
my phone before this.

612
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,888
We got back some money from Joy Academy.

613
00:30:34,044 --> 00:30:35,866
You should be able
to get 100,000 yuan back.

614
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,220
Once the procedures are done,

615
00:30:37,222 --> 00:30:39,000
I'll transfer the money
to you immediately.

616
00:30:39,222 --> 00:30:40,340
As for the rest of the sum,

617
00:30:40,511 --> 00:30:41,620
I'll think of something.

618
00:30:41,844 --> 00:30:42,980
Please give me some time.

619
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,180
Bai,

620
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,860
since you've called me,

621
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,555
that means you don't let down my trust.

622
00:30:49,888 --> 00:30:51,420
Actually, I wanted to thank you for it.

623
00:30:51,444 --> 00:30:52,940
The design class you registered for me

624
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,860
was very effective.

625
00:30:53,933 --> 00:30:55,644
I'm already starting to take job orders.

626
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,740
Really?

627
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,900
Yeah.

628
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,420
Your coach was right.

629
00:30:59,511 --> 00:31:01,155
It's not scary to bump into walls.

630
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,220
Just turn around.

631
00:31:03,288 --> 00:31:04,700
It's not scary to bump into walls.

632
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:07,780
Just turn around, huh?

633
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:09,900
Got it, Lina.

634
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,220
These are giant Mandarin oranges.

635
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,700
Lina, why did you buy
so much stuff for us?

636
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,900
Just eat them.

637
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,180
Here.

638
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,470
Have some salted preserved plums.

639
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,780
Open your mouth.

640
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,260
Okay.

641
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,260
- What's wrong?
- It's so salty!

642
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,580
Spit it out.

643
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,700
It's quite good.

644
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,860
You lass!

645
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,340
Stay out of this. I'll handle them.

646
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,020
- Go and have some fun.
- Okay.

647
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,420
Go and have some fun. Take a break.

648
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,140
Alright. I'll take these with me.

649
00:31:48,155 --> 00:31:49,660
Give them to me. I'll keep them away.

650
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,660
Go ahead.

651
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,380
I'll keep them in the kitchen.

652
00:31:53,022 --> 00:31:55,140
Let's see what we can make
for our daughter tonight.

653
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,060
Yeah.

654
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,060
Lina, is this okay?

655
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,380
Sure. No problem.

656
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,340
I think we lack some chairs.

657
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,500
I'll go and get them.

658
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,300
Lina, what kinds of mooncakes
do we have here?

659
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,500
Five-nut and salted egg mooncakes.

660
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,420
Alright.

661
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,540
How is it?

662
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,580
Isn't it nice?

663
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:09,660
Gou.

664
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,420
Gou?

665
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,740
Gou.

666
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,140
Do you miss Gou?

667
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,620
Alright.

668
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,020
You miss Gou, huh?

669
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,500
Let's draw him.

670
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,140
We have to add
a few more strokes for him.

671
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,300
Let me add some.

672
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,940
Here. Push the cart over there.

673
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,020
- Over here.
- Come.

674
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,940
We need one more.

675
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,380
- Alright.
- Take care.

676
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,020
What does it look like?

677
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,060
He has a cap!

678
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,660
Gou is playing saxophone with a cap!

679
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,060
Listen.

680
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,180
What did Gou

681
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,100
say again?

682
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,380
He said we might die sooner
without women, right?

683
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,220
He's wrong.

684
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,900
All of us are living well.

685
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,020
That's right. We're living well.

686
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,460
That's pretty nice.

687
00:34:59,311 --> 00:35:01,140
- He likes to be clean.
- I'm not late, right?

688
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,380
You're not late.

689
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,580
Why are you only here now?

690
00:35:03,911 --> 00:35:05,140
- What should I do?
- Hurry.

691
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,060
Hang this for me.

692
00:35:06,444 --> 00:35:08,020
- Where?
- Look at all those lanterns.

693
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,740
Is that a saxophone?

694
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,140
I thought it was a tobacco pipe.

695
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,419
(A bright moon rises above the sea.)

696
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,200
(From far away,
we share this moment together.)

697
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,955
(Lovers resent the long, distant night.
All night long, thoughts of longing arise.)

698
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,380
- Come.
- Ms. Lian.

699
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,460
Here you go.

700
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,540
Ms. Lv.

701
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:24,940
Alright.

702
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,400
This helps soften the blood vessels.

703
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,780
Isn't it hot?

704
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,300
Time to sing!

705
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,220
Ding is so excited.

706
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,620
He wants to sing now.

707
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,540
Mr. Jiang,

708
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,740
please play some music.

709
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,940
Excellent!

710
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,340
Mr. Jiang, please.

711
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,340
This is great.

00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,700
Have you walked
ten thousand steps today?

719
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,060
Who are you guys trying to insult here?

720
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,980
Ms. Lv,

721
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,220
they were referring to me.

722
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,980
Shen.

723
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,020
Ms. Le!

724
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,860
Heibao.

725
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,100
- Dai.
- I have an announcement to make.

726
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,540
We're married.

727
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,140
She said

728
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,980
she wanted to deliver wedding candies
to you guys from the choir.

729
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,460
You guys are her family.

730
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:54,950
If so,

731
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:57,030
let's congratulate them.

732
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,880
Okay.

733
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:59,380
Congratulations!

734
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:02,940
Over here.

735
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,280
I'll distribute them to you guys.

736
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:05,100
Come.

737
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,100
Mr. Heibao, I'll do it.

738
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,740
- Hello.
- Shuishan.

739
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,100
I wish you happiness.

740
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,700
Your dream has been fulfilled.

741
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,140
Here comes the mooncakes!

742
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:17,820
Here comes the mooncakes!

743
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,400
Mom, Dad, why are you two only here now?

744
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,900
Lian Yilian!

745
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,444
In-law, I made these mooncakes myself.

This moment

752

753
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,780
"Life's triumphs must serve indulgence,

754
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:42,260
and let not an empty golden grail
face the moon."

755
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,660
Everyone, please raise your glass.

756
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,300
