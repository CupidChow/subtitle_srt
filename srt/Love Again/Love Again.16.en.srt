3
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,480
Liu.

4
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:45,990
Thanks for helping out.

5
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,320
Thank you so much.

6
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,350
Don't worry about it.

7
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:49,560
Hello?

8
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:50,680
Hello?

9
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,680
Chu!

10
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,290
We had an agreement.

11
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,680
We booked the auditorium for the day!

12
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,960
Tell the business school

13
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,250
to figure something out.

14
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,480
I need to go. We're rehearsing.

15
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,530
I'm hanging up.

16
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,800
- Here.
- This handwriting is beautiful.

17
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,360
I copied the lyrics last night myself.

18
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,190
What time will Ms. Nie be here?

19
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,810
We agreed on 2 PM.

20
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,760
I'll go meet her at the front gate.

21
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,730
All right.

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,880
Attention, everyone. Quiet, please.

23
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,720
Our literary consultant,
Ms. Nie, will be here

24
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,280
this afternoon.

25
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,610
Let's put on our best performance.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,210
Sing with skill,

27
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,120
sing with spirit!

28
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,160
All right!

29
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,560
Shen, you wrote the lyrics yourself?

30
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,160
I hand-copied them myself.

31
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,250
That makes them even more precious.

32
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,330
Enough.

33
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,610
Ms. Peng, you're joining us today

34
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,560
too?

35
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:48,960
Yes.

36
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:49,880
Let me tell you,

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,060
if it weren't for Ms. Peng,

38
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,400
there's no way

39
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,810
I could've handled cooking
for over 30 people on my own.

40
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,490
And she enjoys singing too.

41
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,370
So she's joining us.

42
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,490
I didn't do much.

43
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,120
Ms. Peng, you look beautiful today.

44
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,560
You're too kind.

45
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,560
You do look beautiful.

46
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,119
- The fabric looks lovely.
- The color's nice too.

47
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,650
Of course. It cost 580.

48
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,810
580? Peng Yulan!

49
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,490
You...

50
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,880
You certainly didn't hold back.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,220
Your lipstick's a little faded.

52
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,050
Is it?

53
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,490
Yes. Check in the mirror.

54
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,120
Did you bring your lipstick?

55
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,000
No.

56
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,120
I figured as much.

57
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,439
Look what I have.

58
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:37,720
Here.

59
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,750
Open wide.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,530
Fine.

61
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,610
Don't move those lips.

62
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,000
I want to see.

63
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,279
Take a look. See if that's good.

64
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,370
I don't want them too red.

65
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,490
Oh, that's not a problem.

66
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,840
Red lips make a fair lady.

67
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,210
If you say so.

68
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:05,910
Oh, right.

69
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,960
When we get there,

70
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,050
we'll bring the stuff in first.

71
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,630
You hold off making your entrance.

72
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,720
Don't come in until I call you.

73
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,740
We'll bring the things in.

74
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,220
You just bring your beautiful looks.

75
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,170
Oh, you!

76
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,560
Hey! Why are you grinning too?

77
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:25,810
I...

78
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,520
Don't laugh.

79
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:35,930
♪I long to pluck one and wear it,♪

80
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:48,930
♪but I fear it won't bloom next year.♪

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,610
Excellent.

82
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,400
We're getting into the zone.

83
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,640
This afternoon,
our literary consultant, Ms. Nie,

84
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,290
will be here in person.

85
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,170
Let's

86
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,860
keep up our performance.

87
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:02,760
All right?

88
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,810
Yes.

89
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,610
Also,

90
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,290
we've prepared lunch

91
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,930
for our choir

92
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,320
today.

93
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,170
Great!

94
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,910
I hope you brought your appetite.

95
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,810
Yes.

96
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,170
We're here, everyone!

97
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,810
We brought lunch!

98
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,440
We brought the clothes!

99
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,320
We brought steamed buns!

100
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,730
Freshly steamed meat buns!
Lunch is served!

101
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,760
Come and get them! Plenty for everyone!

102
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:28,640
Let's eat.

103
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:29,850
Have another.

104
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:31,880
All right.

105
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,680
Eat up.

106
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,760
I love steamed buns.

107
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,490
Have a bun.

108
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:35,510
Just half please.

109
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,850
The bun's good.

110
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,640
Tasty. The filling's great.

111
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,680
Eat up!

112
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,760
Eat up! There's enough to go around!

113
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:42,810
Baoqin!

114
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,410
Thank you and Liu so much

115
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,729
for preparing all of this.

116
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,410
You've prepared a feast for us.

117
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,120
Oh, don't be so courteous!
We're a family!

118
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,199
It's delicious.

119
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,620
Liu and I can't take all the credit.

120
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,200
My good friend, Peng Yulan,

121
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,760
helped us make the steamed buns!

122
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,370
- Who's Peng Yulan?
- Peng Yulan.

123
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,560
She's my best friend.

124
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,440
Peng Yulan!

125
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,640
There's definitely more to Peng Yulan.

126
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,560
She's our belle of the factory!

127
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,930
She prepared

128
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,000
the filling

129
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,640
in the buns herself.

130
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,930
We have to thank her, then.

131
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,850
Peng Yulan!

132
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,440
Where are you?

133
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,610
Everyone wants to meet you.

134
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,080
We're all waiting for you.

135
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,250
Peng Yulan is here!

136
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,490
Look, everybody!

137
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,290
There she comes!

138
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,760
Where were you?

139
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,760
I was just outside.

140
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,490
Professor Shen wanted
to thank you in person.

141
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,440
Yes.

142
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,290
You're welcome.

143
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,680
Thank you, Peng.

144
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,470
Have you eaten? You should join us.

145
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:47,680
I already ate.

146
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,290
All right.

147
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,810
Thank you so much, Peng,

148
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,880
for preparing lunch for all of us.

149
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,640
It wasn't much.

150
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,250
Sit down.

151
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,050
Sit.

152
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:55,760
Sit.

153
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,850
Attention, everyone!

154
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,970
Attention, please!

155
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,760
The belle of the factory cooked for us!

156
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,520
What about it?

157
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,680
We're honored!

158
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,880
Do you mean
the blower factory on Liuye Street?

159
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,830
Yes, that's our factory!

160
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,910
There's someone
named Hu Di there, right?

161
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,050
Hu Di is our factory director.

162
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:23,560
Yes.

163
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,760
He's my cousin!

164
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,080
How many cousins do you have?

165
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,000
There they go again.

166
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,170
Your jealousy is showing.

167
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,080
Are you full?

168
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,290
Have some chicken soup, Professor Shen.

169
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,370
I already have some.

170
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,930
I added goji berries
to the ginseng chicken soup.

171
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,230
Good for boosting energy.

172
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,680
Everyone!

173
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,850
Professor Shen is having chicken soup!

174
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:54,730
So what?

175
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,370
The soup you're drinking is made
from the same chicken broth!

176
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,490
It's fresh! Just as good!

177
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,120
We're having the broth
from the chicken soup!

178
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,479
- You guys can have some too.
- Greedy bugger.

179
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,370
Professor Shen can't finish all of this.

180
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:06,880
No, no...

181
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,080
Have some!

182
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,640
Give Gou some too.

183
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,120
Come.

184
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:11,680
Let's share.

185
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,120
Right.

186
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,970
You have some too.

187
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:13,490
Here.

188
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,680
She's got her eyes on Mr. Shen.

189
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,930
Didn't expect

190
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,880
Mr. Shen is still a heartthrob.

191
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,320
Enjoy the food, everyone.

192
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,170
I have good news to share.

193
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,520
Tian and I

194
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,680
are getting married

195
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,380
on the 17th of this month!

196
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,850
Everyone is invited!

197
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,879
Make sure you come!

198
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,080
I need to use the toilet.

199
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,000
Go on.

200
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,720
You guys carry on.

201
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,710
Come back soon.

202
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,200
We didn't hear anything about this!

203
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,760
Prepare our wedding gifts!

204
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,609
Don't listen to him!

205
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,850
We don't need the gifts.

206
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,400
We'd just love your attendance.

207
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,970
It's not our first wedding anyway.

208
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,210
It's her third and my second.

209
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,610
No, no. My eighth and his tenth.

210
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,370
You just love messing with them.

211
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,500
My in-law's having an event
at his university.

212
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,000
The whole family's over.

213
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,310
It's a lively event.

214
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,210
His daughter's abroad, though.

215
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,920
She's only joining through video call.

216
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:10,400
Yes.

217
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,370
Yes.

218
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,140
Oh, don't worry about it.

219
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,760
It's nothing.

220
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,690
You don't have to be so formal with me.

221
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,280
Yes, we...

222
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,800
I have to go.

223
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,640
Bye.

224
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:36,570
You...

225
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,830
I'll throw these away. You take a break.

226
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,370
"It's nothing."

227
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,820
"You don't have to be
so formal with me."

228
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,210
It was too loud in there.

229
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,040
I came out for some peace and quiet.

230
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:50,760
Peace and quiet.

231
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,050
You just came out to get away from me.

232
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,090
To call

233
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,040
your "sweetheart" behind my back.

234
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,450
You're being unreasonable.
You should be nicer to me.

235
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,520
Why should I?

236
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,990
You think you're some hot commodity?

237
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,880
Why should I pander to you?

238
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,530
Let me make this clear.

239
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,369
There are a bunch
of well-educated gentlemen

240
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,570
inside that auditorium.

241
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,970
I can talk to them instead.

242
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,490
Go on. Carry on with your call.

243
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,920
- Go on.
- Fine. Forget about it.

244
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,520
No... you...

245
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:20,800
You're done?

246
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,520
Listen.

247
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,520
That fairy will be here soon.

248
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,730
It's time.

249
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,090
Wait for her by the entrance.

250
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:30,330
I...

251
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,640
Go get her and bring her here.
Let me know when she's here.

252
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,860
But I don't know who she is!

253
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,450
She's a 60-year-old lady!

254
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,760
Skinny.

255
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,930
Wobbles a little when she walks.

256
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,090
If you really can't be sure,

257
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,040
send me a photo of her.

258
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,090
I know her.

259
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,090
How do you know her?

260
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,210
I'm her fairy.

261
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,640
Stop asking questions!

262
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,800
Just go!

263
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:55,610
All right.

264
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,610
Let's make sure we get the rhythm down.

265
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,190
All right

266
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,090
Rhythm.

267
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:40,920
Oh.

268
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:42,690
It's about time.

269
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,970
I should go get Ms. Nie.

270
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,879
What's the rush?
There's still half an hour to go.

271
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,120
She might be here early.

272
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,880
Fine. Go.

273
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,120

No idea. He went backstage.

278

Let's make sure you're at your best.

Is that Mr. Shen over there?

284
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,000
Yes.

285
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:39,690
Come on.

286
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,970
Mr. Shen.

- Goodbye.

291
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:51,520
Everyone.

292
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,280

Welcome!

00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,520
Welcome...

300
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,730
Find her!

301
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,400
What happened?

302
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,250
What's going on?

303
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,100
What's the matter?

304
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,570
Oh, I've got it.

305
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:48,790
She's trying to be

306
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,040
fashionably late.

307
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,370
Really, to be doing that at her age...

308
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,160
Mom, say less.

309
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,450
I...

310
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,520
Stop it.

311
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,830
Fine. Let's listen to the choir.

312
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,160
I'm just saying.

313
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,570
Fairies aren't meant to be with mortals.

314
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,850
Fairies are to be worshipped.

315
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,280
That's enough.

316
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:06,880
Sit down.

317
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,000
All right.

318
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,370
They're singing.

319
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,640
Fine. Let them sing.

323
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,120
Did anyone ask

324
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,520
about

325
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,090
where the auditorium is?

326
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,490
No, not this gate.

327
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,370
Not this gate.

328
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,250
Thank you.

329
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,000
Don't mention it.

330
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,730
Professor Shen.

331
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,450
Hello.

332
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:58,800
Sorry.

333
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,040
The number you have dialed
is currently not available.

334
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,570
Please try again later.

335
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,190
All right.

336
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,120
All right.

337
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:31,450
Everyone.

338
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,920
If any of the outfits don't fit,
bring them to me to exchange.

339
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,450
All right. Thank you.
We're off, then.

340
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,800
See you, Lina.

341
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,450
Goodbye.

342
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,250
Shen.

343
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,880
Be patient.

344
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,690
She said she'd come.

345
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,120
She said she'd be here at 2 PM.

346
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,250
But she didn't show up.

347
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,690
Didn't answer her phone.

348
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,640
Maybe something came up.

349
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,610
Right.

350
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,250
She should have

351
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,850
sent Shen a text at least.

352
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,120
Ms. Nie is a scientist.

353
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,570
Scientists are meticulous.

354
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,640
You're right.

355
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,760
Ms. Nie has always been punctual.

356
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,000
I know.

357
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,969
The fairy doesn't want
to come down to earth.

358
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,400
You know...

359
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:11,760
Mom!

360
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,640
You don't think
something happened to her, do you?

361
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,490
Perhaps

362
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,520
we should pay her a visit?

363
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,400
I... I don't have her home address.

364
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,920
I only have her mailing address.

365
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:28,760
Right.

366
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:29,760
Um...

367
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,250
Gou.

368
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,690
You introduced them.

369
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,690
You must know her address.

370
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,120
I don't have her address either.

371
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,970
I've been trying to reach her landline.

372
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,250
It's off.

373
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,799
- My goodness...
- Leave her a message.

374
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,040
- She'll see it when she turns it on.
- I'll do that.

375
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,090
Right. You do that.

376
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,210
I'm on it.

377
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,250
Calm down, Shen.

378
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:47,450
If we must,

379
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,130
we'll contact her department tomorrow.

380
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:50,730
Dad.

381
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,610
Let's go home first.

382
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,550
They'll let us know if we hear from her.

383
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:54,970
Right.

384
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,810
You guys head back without me.

385
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,100
I want to wait a little longer.

386
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,370
We can't leave you here by yourself.

387
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:00,800
Yes.

388
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,610
She's right, Zhuoran.

389
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,000
They have to lock the auditorium

390
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,120
and the gates...

391
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,450
Let's go home, Grandpa.

392
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,040
Professor Shen, you should go home.

393
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,650
If anything comes up,

394
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,970
Gou will let you know
in the first instance.

395
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,729
Come on, Dad.

396
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,970
They're waiting.

397
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,319
Duole, help your grandpa up.

398
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,090
- Duole.
- Come on.

399
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:20,950
Help your Grandpa.

400
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:21,760
Grandpa.

401
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,210
Slowly.

402
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:24,700
Easy there.

403
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,489
- Don't worry.
- I'm sure everything's fine.

404
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,320
We're leaving, Mom.

405
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,890
All right. I'm leaving too.

406
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:29,330
All right.

407
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,420
Good work, everyone.

408
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,130
Let's get changed.

409
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,890
We're going to change.

410
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,280
All right.

411
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,890
Poor Professor Shen.

412
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,690
Let's stop by her place.

413
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,559
Are you sure?

414
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:45,940
Come on.

415
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:46,970
Okay.

416
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,890
The moth orchid fell over!

417
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:38,410
Look!

418
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,519
Something did happen to her!

419
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,360
Ms. Nie!

420
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,730
Ms. Nie! Ms. Nie!

421
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,930
Ms. Nie!

422
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:45,730
Ms. Nie!

423
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,000
Get your phone!

424
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,250
Quick! Call an ambulance! 120!

425
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:49,890
Hurry!

426
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:50,600
Quick!

427
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,800
Ms. Nie!

428
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,520
Hello?

429
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,170
Emergency services?

430
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,040
Come quickly! Someone fainted!

431
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,080
Hurry!

432
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:00,600
The address?

433
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,800
The address!

434
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,760
168, Yihe Road!

435
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,840
Come quickly!

436
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,360
Look for the key!

437
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,079
The key!

438
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,830
The door's locked!

439
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,450
Is the key under the carpet?

440
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,450
I don't know.

441
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,210
Look around.

442
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:14,760
Not here.

443
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,270
That's not it.

444
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,250
Check the shoeboxes.

445
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:22,730
It's here!

446
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,760
Found it!

447
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:24,840
Hurry!

448
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,040
Ms. Nie!

449
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,760
- Ms. Nie!
- Ms. Nie!

450
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,360
Hurry!

451
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:52,930
Ms. Nie...

452
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,210
Her legs are cold!

453
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,410
She...

454
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,800
Is she going to be all right?

455
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,000
Ms. Nie...

456
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,130
Is Ms. Nie going to be all right?

457
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,130
Ms. Nie...

458
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,000
Ms. Nie...

459
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,840
This is an important business dinner.

460
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,730
It'll determine whether
the next round of funding

461
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,690
comes through on time.

462
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,340
Ice will be there too.

463
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,320
So we've got to tell the story well.

464
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,210
What do you mean, tell a story?

465
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,000
Dr. Qin is attending.

466
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,200
That means it has to be
a serious, scientific explanation.

467
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,130
Got it.

468
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,930
I'll prepare along those lines.

469
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,080
No, no.

470
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,730
Don't prepare it like that.

471
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:47,930
People won't understand.

472
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,490
If you go on about the T cells...

473
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,600
Yes, Lina?

474
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,130
Shen Qing! Ms. Nie fainted!

475
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,250
She fainted?

476
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:56,970
Does Dad know?

477
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:57,760
How is he?

478
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,490
He's worried sick!

479
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,650
I'm taking Dad

480
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,000
to Zijin First Hospital right now.

481
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,490
Shen Qing, can you come to the hospital?

482
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,790
I'll be right there.

483
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,000
All right.

484
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,330
See you at the hospital.

485
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,410
Please pull over.

486
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,209
I have a family emergency.
I need to get to the hospital.

487
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:16,730
I heard.

488
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,360
Have the driver take you there.

489
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,520
I don't want you guys to be late.
I can call a taxi.

490
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,250
I'll meet you guys as soon as I can.

491
00:21:22,251 --> 00:21:25,940
(Inpatient, Emergency)

492
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,280
Come on.

493
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,210
How's Ms. Nie?

494
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:31,490
Ms. Nie.

495
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,560
Ms. Nie.

496
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:33,890
Ms. Nie.

497
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,000
We're at the hospital.

498
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,930
Don't worry. You're in good hands.

499
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,890
Right. Ms. Nie.

500
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:40,760
What's your son's number?

501
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,040
Let me know.

502
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,360
I'll call him.

503
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,489
- Ms. Nie...
- The patient is still unconscious.

504
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,520
She's still unresponsive.

505
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,170
Still unconscious?

506
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,310
I thought I saw her open her eyes.

507
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,080
When will she wake up?

508
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,890
Goodness.

509
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:57,760
Nurse.

510
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,360
Can we move her to a different ward?

511
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,970
- It's too noisy here.
- Right.

512
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,730
That's hard to do.

513
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,930
Too many patients and not enough beds.

514
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,520
All right.

515
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,320
We'll make do.

516
00:22:10,634 --> 00:22:14,140
(Emergency Room)

517
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,530
The doctor's coming out.

518
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,320
Dr. Wang.

519
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:20,890
Shen Qing.

520
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:21,450
Dr. Wang.

521
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,250
- Are you
- Dr. Wang.

522
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,760
Ms. Nie's attending physician?

523
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,030
What brings you here again?

524
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:26,850
What's wrong?

525
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,410
Ms. Nie is a friend of my dad.

526
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,080
Yes.

527
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,130
How is she?

528
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:31,600
Tell us.

529
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,900
Here's the situation.

530
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,320
The patient has had
a mastectomy for breast cancer.

531
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,600
Surgery? A mastectomy?

532
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,620
I know what that is.

533
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,080
Please go on.

534
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:42,830
All right.

535
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,560
According to the cranial CT

536
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,410
and enhanced brain MRI,

537
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,409
we found enhancing lesions
inside the skull.

538
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,820
The clinical diagnosis
is brain metastasis from breast cancer.

539
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,470
That's what caused her
to collapse suddenly.

540
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,560
Brain metastasis?

541
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,800
Jingmin also had metastasis.

542
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,600
- After she... she...
- Stop talking.

543
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,360
She...

544
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:05,760
Dr. Wang.

545
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,520
So what's the treatment plan now?

546
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,250
For a breast cancer patient
with brain metastasis,

547
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,210
surgery is not clinically recommended

548
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,130
because it can't achieve
a complete removal.

549
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,830
Treatment primarily relies

550
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,279
on chemotherapy, targeted therapy,
and brain radiotherapy.

551
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,720
The best we can do is relieve her pain
and extend her life.

552
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:24,850
Are you all right?

553
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,080
It's that bad?

554
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,250
Sit down.

555
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:28,690
Um...

556
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,650
We still haven't been able
to reach the patient's family.

557
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,410
We...

558
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,270
We'll have to discuss it
with her family first.

559
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,889
Well. You discuss it.
I'll return to work.

560
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,399
- Call me if anything comes up.
- All right. Thank you, Dr. Wang.

561
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:39,830
Thank you.

562
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,410
Thank you.

563
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,280
Dr. Wei.

564
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,360
Have you reached any of her family yet?

565
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,410
Ms. Nie only has one son.

566
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,549
I called, but it's the middle
of the night where he is.

567
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,690
I can't get through.

568
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:49,270
What do we do?

569
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,760
It's been ten years...

570
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,600
How could it still metastasize?

571
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,450
Shen...

572
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:55,800
Dad.

573
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,450
Calm down.

574
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:00,170
Our company develops targeted therapies.

575
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,200
- Qing, sit down and tell him.
- Yes. Sit.

576
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,650
Anti-cancer drugs

577
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,080
is evolving fast.

578
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,560
There might be options.

579
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,210
He's right.

580
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:09,930
Medical technology

581
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,280
has come a long way.

582
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,690
I have a neighbor

583
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,130
who relapsed four times

584
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,760
and is still thriving!

585
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,520
Gou.

586
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:21,800
What are you saying?

587
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,279
- Relapsed four times......
- Four times!

588
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,410
and still thriving?

589
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,040
They're fine.

590
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,800
Do you know
what the ER doctor said just now?

591
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,520
If we had been half an hour later,

592
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,760
she would've died!

593
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:32,520
Yes.

594
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,000
The doctor said it was critical.

595
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:34,930
Did you hear that?

596
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:35,650
Ms. Peng.

597
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,520
How did you learn
that Ms. Nie had fainted?

598
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,970
We...

599
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,000
We were looking for dance partners

600
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,520
on Beijing East Road.

601
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,170
Yes.

602
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:46,650
We...

603
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,650
Is this the time

604
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,250
to ask about such trivial things?

605
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,170
Why don't you ask
how Ms. Nie's doing now?

606
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,200
How's her recovery?
Has she regained consciousness?

607
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,930
The stuff you're asking is just...

608
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:58,760
Good grief.

609
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:01,970
Come in.

610
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,320
Dr. Wang.

611
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:03,889
Shen Qing.

612
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,060
Thank you for your help today.

613
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,820
Just doing my job.

614
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,690
Can I take a photo

615
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,560
of Ms. Nie's CT scan?

616
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,230
I'll check if there's any new drug
that could help.

617
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:14,690
Right.

618
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,450
You're in pharmaceutical R&D.

619
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,160
You're ahead of us in this field.

620
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,340
- All right. I'll pull it up for you.
- Great. Thanks.

621
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:29,690
This...

622
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,360
This seems

623
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,520
a lot like what happened to my mother.

624
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,190
It's more severe
than your mother's case.

625
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:42,410
How much time

626
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,560
do you think she has left?

627
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:48,409
Patients with brain metastases
from breast cancer

628
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,030
generally don't respond well
to treatment..

629
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,730
Their life expectancy

630
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,040
is usually measured in months.

631
00:25:59,560 --> 00:25:59,970
All right.

632
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,000
Keep in touch.

633
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,480
Dad, I have a Quick-Acting Heart-Saving Pill.
Do you need it?

634
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,130
I'm fine.

635
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,690
I got in touch with Ms. Nie's son.

636
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:08,840
You did?

637
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,410
His wife is about to give birth.

638
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,690
So he said

639
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,249
once he gets things settled at home,

640
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,620
he'll rush over as fast as he can.

641
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,970
Good. As long as we found him.

642
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,970
Ms. Nie's going to be a grandmother.

643
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,000
Thanks, everyone.

644
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,410
It's late.

645
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,560
You should

646
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:24,840
head back.

647
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,830
Don't stay up here all night.
Go back and rest.

648
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,320
Come on, Shen.

649
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,449
- Let's go.
- We're leaving?

650
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:32,000
Let's go.

651
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,650
Let's go, Dad.

652
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,039
Go home and get some rest.

653
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,420
Come on.

654
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:36,140
Here we go.

655
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,649
Let's go.

656
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:37,180
Take it easy.

657
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:37,860
All right.

658
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:38,690
Thank you.

659
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,450
- All right.
- Dr. Wei.

660
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,490
Let's go.

661
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,690
- I've toasted everyone already.
- Let me give you a toast.

662
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,650
Let me toast you.

663
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,490
Stop focusing only over there.
Let's all drink.

664
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,210
Come on.

665
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:04,930
Let's drink.

666
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,320
Mr. Wang.

667
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,250
I'm happy.

668
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,520
I'm enjoying myself.

669
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:10,560
To Mr. An.

670
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,130
- I've done some research too.
- Have you?

671
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,320
Drink! Enjoy yourselves!

672
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,080
Ice.

673
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,730
I know a bit about palm reading.

674
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,449
Enjoy yourselves!

675
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,079
Let me read yours.

676
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,340
- Give me your right hand.
- Ice.

677
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:25,800
A toast to you.

678
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:27,000
Sure.

679
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:29,890
I already drank with all the other

680
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:30,650
Shide associates.

681
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,320
I'm having a great time.

682
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:34,450
Take it easy.

683
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,240
Bottoms up.

684
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,080
Thank you.

685
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:40,690
Dr. Qin.

686
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,200
Let's have another drink.

687
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,410
I...

688
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:45,840
Jin.

689
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,320
Fill this for me.

690
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:47,690
Coming.

691
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,040
I'll do it.

692
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:50,320
Okay.

693
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:51,280
Dr. Qin...

694
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,250
I'll max out the R&D budget for you.

695
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,960
I'll get you all the crab-eating macaque

696
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:58,840
you need!

697
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,410
All I ask is that

698
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,040
you speed up the development.

699
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,280
The sooner our drug goes to market,

700
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:09,690
the sooner

701
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,600
we can help patients relieve their pain,

702
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,560
and extend their lives.

703
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:14,890
Got it.

704
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:15,660
Please.

705
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,000
I'll do my best. That's all I ask.

706
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,940
Please take it easy.

707
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,969
- I 'm not drunk!
- Please go easy on the alcohol.

708
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,040
I barely drank!

709
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:21,840
You drank too much!

710
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,800
Pour him less.

711
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:23,890
Don't give him too much.

712
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:24,490
Here.

713
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,000
Mr. Shen.

714
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:27,040
Let's all give a toast to Dr. Qin.

715
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,890
All right! Together, everyone!

716
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,320
To our brilliant scientist!

717
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:30,689
Come on!

718
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:32,050
- Let's drink to that!
- Thank you.

719
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,560
- To our scientist!
- To Dr. Qin!

720
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,250
To the scientist!

721
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,890
An Ruifeng, did you drink?

722
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,800
I did. I poured it into my mouth.

723
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:46,160
(Emergency)

724
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:46,890
Thank you.

725
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,880
- Sorry for the trouble.
- Don't worry about it.

726
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,600
Ms. Nie.

727
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,520
You're finally awake.

728
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
What happened to me?

729
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:10,860
You fainted

730
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,600
at home.

731
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,080
The ambulance brought you here.

732
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,280
Did I...

733
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,970
metastasize?

734
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,520
How much time

735
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,600
do I have?

736
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,040
Well...

737
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,250
It's hard to say.

738
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,200
You need to stay positive.

739
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,520
Once your son gets here,

740
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,170
we'll discuss

741
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,790
your treatment options together.

742
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,410
What you need to do now is

743
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,170
to get enough rest.

744
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,965
(Weekly Meal Plan, White Blood)
Look at

745
00:31:18,966 --> 00:31:21,450
(Cell-Boosting Meals for Cancer Patients)
this situation.

746
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,970
We've ended up doing logistics.

747
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,320
Technically,

748
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,800
you and Ms. Nie are love rivals.

749
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,130
What "rivals"?

750
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,170
Standing up, sure, rivals.

751
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:35,000
But now she's down.

752
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,650
Look.

753
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:41,410
We're humans. We must have compassion.

754
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:46,410
Peng Yulan.

755
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,490
I can see

756
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,280
your whole outlook has elevated.

757
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,450
I'll be honest with you.

758
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,650
I live alone too.

759
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,490
I'm always afraid
that something might happen at night,

760
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,760
and if I die,

761
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,270
nobody would even know.

762
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,210
Isn't that exactly
what happened to Ms. Nie?

763
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,520
Thank goodness we went over
and checked in on her.

764
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,210
Otherwise...

765
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,760
Yes.

766
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:10,760
You're right.

767
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:13,930
Everyone

768
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,690
has tough times.

769
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,130
If we can help, we help.

770
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,650
Yes. We do what we can when we can.

771
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,490
Sometimes I wonder.

772
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,130
What's the point of men?

773
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,730
Zhuoran

774
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,320
wrote all those letters
and made all those calls.

775
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:33,760
But in the end,

776
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:34,990
he didn't even know

777
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,840
where Ms. Nie lived.

778
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,550
When it comes down to it,

779
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,760
it's us old ladies
helping each other out.

780
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:41,760
Right?

781
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:46,930
Peng Yulan.

782
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,320
What will you do if Ms. Nie gets better?

783
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:52,410
I...

784
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,280
I'll give them my blessing.

785
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:01,080
Seeing Professor Shen so heartbroken,

786
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,450
I realize that those two are soulmates.

787
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:06,730
Careful.

788
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,520
Watch your mouth.

789
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,490
Don't let
my late in-law, Jingmin, hear you.

790
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:15,800
I meant after 70.

791
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,130
After 70,

792
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,650
you're only as good a match

793
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,970
as how long you can live.

794
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,250
Of course,

795
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,000
that's a terrible thing to say.

796
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,760
But that's the truth.

797
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:32,730
I mean...

798
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,560
Look. His first wife

799
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,000
got sick.

800
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,970
That's no one's fault.

801
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,130
But who would choose

802
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,000
a second wife with a terminal illness?

803
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:49,890
Granny.

804
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:51,730
Granny.

805
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:52,800
Duole, you're back.

806
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:53,250
I'm home.

807
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:53,730
Ms. Peng.

808
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:54,940
Where's your mother?

809
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,250
My mom is waiting downstairs.

810
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:58,279
Aren't you going
to the hospital to see Ms. Nie?

811
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:58,840
That's right.

812
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,650
Le, go see if your grandpa

813
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:01,450
is ready.

814
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,000
Grandpa is already in the car.

815
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,490
Well, isn't he impatient?

816
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:06,730
Yulan.

817
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,650
Hurry up!

818
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,840
Get the soup!

819
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,490
- Don't forget the spring onions!
- On it!

820
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:13,650
I'll do it.

821
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,440
Granny.

822
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:18,650
You ladies really are

823
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,170
"girls help girls."

824
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:23,480
Girls what girls?

825
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,170
He means old ladies helping old ladies.

826
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,760
This way, right?

827
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,440
Which room?

828
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:54,440
Don't know.

829
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:00,010
Zhuoran!

830
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:01,730
- Slow down!
- Sorry! I didn't see you.

831
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:03,760
What's wrong?

832
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:06,250
What's wrong?

833
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,650
Ms. Nie.

834
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,210
Ms. Nie! How are you feeling?

835
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:18,920
She's much better.

836
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,960
She had half a bowl of porridge
this morning.

837
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,400
That's good to hear.

838
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,920
How can we address you?

839
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:24,930
Just call me Wang.

840
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,950
Three horizontals, one vertical.

841
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,130
Ms. Nie,
your friends are here to see you.

842
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,280
I'll go rinse out these towels.

843
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:34,090
You all sit.

844
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,250
You do your thing.

845
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,050
All right.

846
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,090
Ms. Nie!

847
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,480
You picked a good caregiver!

848
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:47,320
She's diligent.

849
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,400
- Isn't she?
- Yes.

850
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,050
Right?

851
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,050
Ms. Nie, allow me to introduce you.

852
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,170
Peng Yulan.

853
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,730
It was the two of us who brought you

854
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,090
to the hospital that day.

855
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,690
Yes.

856
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:02,920
We happened to be passing by
to visit a friend

857
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,130
and saw you through the window.

858
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,480
Thank you both so much.

859
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,960
Oh,

860
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,280
don't mention it.

861
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,730
Why are you always being so polite?

862
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,800
No need to be so formal.
Look what we brought you.

863
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,440
Here's some mouthwash.

864
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:16,730
There's plenty.

865
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:20,050
When it's hard for you to brush your teeth,
just rinse with this. Works great.

866
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:20,710
And here.

867
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,960
These are disposable towels.

868
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,440
Very useful in the hospital.

869
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,440
Back when Jingmin

870
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,960
was hospitalized...

871
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,210
Jingmin is my late in-law.

872
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,840
She was a frequent patient.

873
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:36,090
We got plenty of experience
taking care of her.

874
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,050
You must be hungry, Ms. Nie.

875
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,600
Would you like some soup?

876
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,569
Right. Soup.
Shen's been holding it all this while.

877
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,610
It's heavy. Here.

878
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,440
Yulan

879
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:48,360
made

880
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,320
this soup.

881
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,570
All the meat's been stewed
into the broth!

882
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,380
You're a patient

883
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,210
right now.

884
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,780
You need all the nutrients you can get.
Drink lots of soup.

885
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,729
Thank you. I can't thank you all enough.

886
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:03,360
- Ms. Nie...
- What are you thanking him for?

887
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:03,840
Right?

888
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,760
Everyone has tough times.

889
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:06,650
Right?

890
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:08,210
Ms. Nie.

891
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,359
Let me know
if there's anything you want to eat.

892
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,720
Yulan and I will make it for you.

893
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:13,610
Yes.

894
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,170
I'm a good cook.

895
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:15,650
Yes.

896
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:16,880
Ms. Nie.

897
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:20,010
Ms. Nie,
I don't think that tape recorder

898
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:21,690
can play opera for you.

899
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:24,050
I'll bring you a radio
from home tomorrow.

900
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,570
No need to trouble yourself.

901
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,840
It's no trouble.
I already have one at home.

902
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,250
Baoqin.

903
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,570
I forgot to bring tissues.

904
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,280
You didn't bring any?

905
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,480
We brought all this stuff
but no tissues?

906
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,609
I think there's a retail store
downstairs in the hospital.

907
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,860
They sell them. I'll take you.

908
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:53,960
Okay?

909
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,530
Shen,

910
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,800
stay and talk with Ms. Nie.

911
00:37:59,010 --> 00:37:59,790
We'll be right back.

912
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:00,760
Thank you.

913
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,090
Oh, and I'll just leave these here.

914
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:03,840
Yes.

915
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,520
Have a good chat.

916
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:06,320
You two talk.

917
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,280
Why is Ms. Nie

918
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,690
being so cold to Professor Shen?

919
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,320
Peng Yulan, I think you...

920
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:23,690
Who could be happy

921
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,760
after being diagnosed with cancer?

922
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,250
Jingmin,

923
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:28,360
my late in-law,

924
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,760
didn't speak a word for days

925
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:33,840
after learning about her metastasis.

926
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,800
And then?

927
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,130
Then,

928
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,800
she couldn't stop talking.

929
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,280
Like

930
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,920
she had to get

931
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,760
a whole lifetime's worth of words
out at once.

932
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:49,210
Wang.

933
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,089
You washed the towels already?

934
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:51,760
I'm fast.

935
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,760
No hurry.

936
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,090
Ms. Nie's not in the best mood.

937
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,750
Let her friend try and talk to her.

938
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,530
She needs it.

939
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,730
Ms. Nie is quiet and reserved.

940
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:02,570
True.

941
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:03,610
Oh,

942
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,360
and when you bring food next time,
don't bring so much.

943
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,170
Ms. Nie's appetite is small.

944
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:09,360
It's only this big.

945
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:11,920
Wang,

946
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,360
you can share

947
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,250
Ms. Nie's food.

948
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,760
The soup won't be fresh the next day.

949
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,480
I'm not really into those light broths.

950
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,130
I like spicy pepper soup.

951
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,670
That stuff's got punch.

952
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,920
Wang, you sure speak your mind.

953
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,480
Yes.

954
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,480
You have to.

955
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,880
In our line of work,
we see people pass away every year.

956
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,880
You have to learn to accept it.

957
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,320
You've got it tough.

958
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,790
Things will ease up for you
once her son gets here.

959
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,800
Kids or no kids,

960
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:48,220
in the end,
it's still us caregivers doing the work.

961
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,960
The kids need to work, right?

962
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,910
They have kids of their own too, right?

963
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,920
You shouldn't say that.

964
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,090
They're usually more attentive.

965
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:57,570
Yes.

966
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,980
Only when it's a treatable illness.

967
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:00,880
If it's terminal,

968
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,170
in the beginning...

969
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,650
There are patients here.

970
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,440
At first,

971
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,530
they'll sell everything to treat it.

972
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:12,920
But later?

973
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:13,800
Bit by bit,

974
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:18,400
both the patient and the family suffer.

975
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,530
In the end, you can't escape it.

976
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,530
A good cry,

977
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,810
and it's over. Maybe for the best too.

978
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,010
We've seen it all before.

979
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:33,650
Ms. Nie.

980
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,220
Your hand is bruised
from all the needles.

981
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,530
Ms. Nie.

982
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,570
You missed rehearsal yesterday.

983
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,610
The choir has improved a lot.

984
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,050
My grandson recorded a video of us.

985
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,610
I'll play it for you.

986
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,090
You should go.

987
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,090
Don't come anymore.

988
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,280
I can't do that.

989
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,690
I have to be here.

990
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:40,440
Please.

991
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,610
Let me keep the last of my dignity.

992
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:42,920
Right. Let me add you on WeChat too.

993
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,759
Let's add each other.

994
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,350
In case we need
to reach you for anything.

995
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,059
Here, scan mine.

996
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:46,760
You scan mine.

997
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,020
Okay, I'll scan you.

998
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:52,250
He's out.

999
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:54,510
Why did Professor Shen

1000
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:55,400
come out?

1001
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,090
No idea.

1002
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:57,960
Zhuoran.

1003
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,480
Shen!

1004
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,840
Professor Shen!

1005
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:04,630
