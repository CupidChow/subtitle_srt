3
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,480
(Chuanlu Biotechnology Park)

4
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,070
Our company

5
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,240
was founded six years ago.

6
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,630
We have molecular biology labs,

7
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,710
cell labs,

8
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,120
animal labs etc,

9
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,120
and we provide testing services

10
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,480
for biopharmaceutical companies.

11
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,350
At this juncture,

12
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,600
we have assisted hundreds of companies

13
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,630
and helped them obtain
clinical trial results.

14
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,760
Our cell invasion trials

15
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,480
are renowned in the industry.

16
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,120
Had the other founder not fallen ill,

17
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,680
we wouldn't have sold this lab...

18
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,830
Pardon me.

19
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:17,950
Come.

20
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,630
It's so cute.

21
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,440
Aiden,

22
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,390
your guinea pigs will be in danger.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,630
Worry not.

24
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,830
I will protect the cats
and the guinea pigs.

25
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,280
This is our role model.

26
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,160
It doesn't eat a lot,

27
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,070
but it's chubby.

28
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,040
How old is this cat?

29
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,000
Almost ten now.

30
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,560
It's the litter of my friend's cat.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,600
It was born sick.

32
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:38,022
But since I study medicine,

33
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,160
I made medicine for it

34
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,070
and cured it.

35
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:43,230
You put your skills to good use.

36
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,160
You're full of love.

37
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,440
I take that compliment.

38
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,280
Thank you.

39
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,950
You raise pets.

40
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,230
But you're experimenting on macaques
and guinea pigs.

41
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,950
Do you ever feel guilty?

42
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,110
Truth be told,

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,670
yes, at the beginning.

44
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,670
I still

45
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,350
feel the same now.

46
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,560
Let's not talk about

47
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,230
that depressing topic.

48
00:03:10,688 --> 00:03:11,910
Should we eat something nice?

49
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:12,880
Sure.

50
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:13,910
Yangzhou fried rice.

51
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,200
I was about to say that.

52
00:03:15,422 --> 00:03:16,688
We already arranged for that.

53
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,600
It's done.

54
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,670
Dong,

55
00:04:15,977 --> 00:04:17,110
do you have a slot for today?

56
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,440
I want to straighten my hair.

57
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,390
Permed hair makes me look old.

58
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,800
Sure. I'll come right now.

59
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,177
All right.

60
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,240
Take care.

61
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,920
I look forward to your good news.

62
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:32,800
Sure.

63
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,630
We'll come out with a proposal.

64
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,070
Bye.

65
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:36,880
Bye.

66
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,830
Sure. Thanks.

67
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,590
Thanks.

68
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,711
- See you.
- Sure.

69
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,440
See you.

70
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,200
Thank you.

71
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:47,800
Bye.

72
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,150
What do you think of that lab?

73
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,150
Is it good?

74
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,270
The cat is good.

75
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,630
I think it's not bad.

76
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,560
The fiscal report looks good.

77
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,710
The founder is honest.

78
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,240
We spend a lot on lab tests every year.

79
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,830
If you acquire Maoli,

80
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:14,830
Maoli and I

81
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,360
will be under you.

82
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,240
It's a huge advantage for our future

83
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,240
IPO.

84
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,830
This sounds good on paper.

85
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,630
I'll relay it to Mr. Lu.

86
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,760
And I will cross-check

87
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,950
the data and reports.

88
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,800
Can we acquire the cat too?

89
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,320
You look

90
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,760
just like that cat.

91
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,470
No, I'm cuter.

92
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,390
Liu Lina, why are you all dolled up?

93
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,950
Mrs. Wang.

94
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,590
Lina, you look good today.

95
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,560
Dear.

96
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,000
Hurry up.

97
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,760
Where are you?

98
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,950
I'll wait for you at the gate?

99
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:19,430
(Dear)
No need to wait for me.

100
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm stuck in traffic. Go home first.

101
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,800
Why isn't Dad home?

102
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,440
He's stuck in traffic.

103
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,440
It'll take some time.

104
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:46,710
Eat now.

105
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,933
Then, do your homework.

106
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,560
Mom,

107
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,680
you look good today.

108
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:58,311
You think so?

109
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:00,030
I spent more than 500 yuan

110
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,200
to straighten my hair.

111
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,555
It's worth it.

112
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:03,844
- Really?
- I'm full.

113
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,630
Go.

114
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,760
You're back.

115
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,470
Why are you all dolled up at night?

116
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,470
To pick you up.

117
00:07:30,488 --> 00:07:31,911
You said you were stuck in traffic.

118
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:33,333
How come you came back this soon?

119
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,880
I was stuck at the intersection.

120
00:07:35,911 --> 00:07:37,088
A traffic police was there

121
00:07:37,088 --> 00:07:38,800
to direct the traffic. So it's resolved.

122
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,560
You just didn't want me to pick you up

123
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,760
in case I saw your female colleagues.

124
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,920
It's the same people you saw
this morning.

125
00:07:52,577 --> 00:07:53,800
I'm just worried about you.

126
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,560
I worry that...

127
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,150
I'm worried about your back!

128
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,760
I stood down there

129
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,470
for half an hour

130
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,800
till my back was hurting.

131
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,200
And you sent me home with one call.

132
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,390
Then suddenly, you appeared.

133
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,710
Am I that hideous?

134
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:06,800
No.

135
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,200
I don't mean that.

136
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,590
Then don't eat my food.

137
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,360
Eat. Don't just sit there.

138
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,360
You told me not to eat.

139
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,950
Now you listen to me.

140
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,630
How obedient.

141
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,270
Should I eat or not?

142
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,920
Eat. I made them for you.

143
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,440
You're the death of me.

144
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:43,920
Dear.

145
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,320
Can you

146
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,200
please reheat it?

147
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,830
Right, Mr. Shen.

148
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,920
Wait.

149
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,870
Did you wear the long johns?

150
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:16,800
I knew it.

151
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,320
The temperature is dropping today.

152
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,155
Keep your calves warm and you keep
your back warm.

153
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:28,560
Lina.

154
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,230
Mom.

155
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:29,990
I'm here.

156
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,200
Just stay there.

157
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,440
Do your work.

158
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,640
Your dad caught many fish today.

159
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,990
Many carps.

160
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,990
Shen Qing has a bad back.

161
00:09:41,022 --> 00:09:42,288
So let's make a nutritious soup

162
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,400
for him.

163
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:43,830
Sure.

164
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,990
Shen Qing?

165
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:45,950
Shen Qing!

166
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,280
He went on a stroll.

167
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,350
He...

168
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,320
Where to?

169
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,710
Either Qinhuai River

170
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:53,990
or Nanhu Park.

171
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,560
You're so...

172
00:09:59,111 --> 00:09:59,560
So what?

173
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,160
Why are you

174
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,680
so relaxed?

175
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,520
What?

176
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,710
Listen.

177
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,680
Men

178
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,830
are always

179
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,160
cunning.

180
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,230
You need to keep your eyes peeled

181
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,040
for Shen Qing.

182
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,110
He's a busy man.

183
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,350
I can't follow him around.

184
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,110
Also, he's surrounded by capable women.

185
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,160
I pale in comparison.

186
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,400
Who cares about those women?

187
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,710
They envy you.

188
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,110
They might look

189
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,400
all glamorous.

190
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,200
Yeah?

191
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,520
But deep down,

192
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,110
they suffer.

193
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,350
They do.

194
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,830
Look at you now.

195
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,710
You manage the money.

196
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,560
You manage almost all things
in this house.

197
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,400
That's wonderful.

198
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,640
Just make sure

199
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:46,022
you keep your eyes trained on Shen Qing.

200
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,040
Do you know his phone password?

201
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,950
Yes, it's Duole's birthday.

202
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,350
You must know

203
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,470
his phone password.

204
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,640
Make sure of it.

205
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,590
I'll prepare the fish now.

206
00:10:59,502 --> 00:11:01,440
(Set New Password)

207
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,280
Yes, Jin?

208
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:08,333
Sorry to have disturbed you

209
00:11:08,355 --> 00:11:09,466
this weekend, Mr. Shen.

210
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:10,590
There's an emergency meeting.

211
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,320
Mr. An wants you to be there.

212
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:14,950
Now?

213
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,400
Okay.

214
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,680
I'll be there.

215
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,520
Shide Capital

216
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,110
is now

217
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,800
acquiring Maoli.

218
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,870
That is

219
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,800
good news for us.

220
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,830
That's why I gather everyone here.

221
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,470
Ice Li and Aiden

222
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,320
will be here.

223
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,870
We will iron out the kinks.

224
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,440
Didn't you...

225
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,040
Mr. An, Ice and Aiden are here.

226
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,560
Come.

227
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:15,950
Hello.

228
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,110
Take a seat.

229
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:17,640
Allow me.

230
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,950
Take a seat.

231
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,560
Thank you.

232
00:12:21,688 --> 00:12:22,777
Do you want some water?

233
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,800
It's warm.

234
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:24,830
Thanks.

235
00:12:26,688 --> 00:12:27,866
Sorry to make you work

236
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:29,040
on weekends.

237
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,800
It's fine.

238
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,750
It's fine.

239
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,750
Your company

240
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,040
and our company

241
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,520
will be sister companies now.

242
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:36,440
Yes.

243
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,830
All thanks to Ice.

244
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:39,400
No, it's all thanks to your market value

245
00:12:39,422 --> 00:12:40,200
and your cute cat.

246
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,830
Let's begin.

247
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,070
Well...

248
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,070
Ice, can you

249
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,320
walk us through the operation?

250
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:50,400
Sure.

251
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,710
First of all,

252
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,320
Shide will set up a team

253
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,888
to perform due diligence on Maoli.

254
00:12:54,888 --> 00:12:55,511
Wonderful.

255
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:56,710
Yangzhou has many good food.

256
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,110
Aiden, you can't wait already.

257
00:13:02,288 --> 00:13:03,000
Say something.

258
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:04,750
Ice,

259
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,230
after the acquisition,

260
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,750
how do we work with Maoli?

261
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:09,355
After the acquisition concluded,

262
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:10,710
RF Pharmaceuticals will let Maoli

263
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,990
perform all tests.

264
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:12,590
Sure.

265
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,422
What about the rates?

266
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,444
Per the market price.

267
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,280
But

268
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,990
we will also invest in RF.

269
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
Great!

270
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,040
Moreover,

271
00:13:23,422 --> 00:13:24,822
I'm aware that you are applying

272
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,950
for the development of M701 and M703.

273
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,280
We can give you six months.

274
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,950
Do note that should you

275
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,040
miss the deadline,

276
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,950
the damages will be high too.

277
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,350
We have assessed

278
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,830
RF's current progress

279
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,400
and Maoli's capacity.

280
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:39,750
I'm confident

281
00:13:39,822 --> 00:13:41,377
- that you can make it.
- Your pants.

282
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,160
When will the extra capital from Shide

283
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,230
come in?

284
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,280
I'll ask your wife to deliver new pants.

285
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,520
We will evaluate the key stages

286
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,320
in the project.

287
00:13:50,644 --> 00:13:51,950
If the progress is satisfactory,

288
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,560
the capital will be pumped in.

289
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:55,950
Focus on the research.

290
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,560
Ms. Lina,

291
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,070
there's a hole in Mr. Shen's pants.

292
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,133
I'll send a deliverer to you?

293
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:04,688
Focus on your work.

294
00:14:04,755 --> 00:14:05,911
I'll arrange for the delivery.

295
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,070
All right.

296
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,400
He needs a pair of dark blue slacks.

297
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:10,800
Okay.

298
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:11,320
Sure.

299
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,200
Collection after 30 minutes?

300
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:07,800
Ms. Lina.

301
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,160
Jin.

302
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,230
You look gorgeous today.

303
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,590
Why didn't you use a courier?

304
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,040
It'll take half an hour.

305
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,520
So I came here myself.

306
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:17,822
It's fine.

307
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,950
I can wait.

308
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,560
When will the meeting end?

309
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,440
I want to talk to Shen Qing.

310
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,830
It'll end soon.

311
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,040
Maybe you can wait in Mr. Shen's office?

312
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:26,710
Sure.

313
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,555
Go back to your work.

314
00:15:27,555 --> 00:15:27,933
Okay.

315
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,400
Bye.

316
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,520
That's all for today.

317
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,440
Sure.

318
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,320
What a productive day.

319
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,870
We'll have dinner together later.

320
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,800
Aiden, you'll drink with me.

321
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,870
Great.

322
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,070
Let's go.

323
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:54,920
Ice.

324
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,230
We met before.

325
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,520
Mrs. Shen?

326
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,230
Hi.

327
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,040
- Hi.
- Lina?

328
00:15:59,933 --> 00:16:00,870
What brought you here?

329
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,830
Mr. An.

330
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:03,022
Allow me to introduce.

331
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,230
Ice.

332
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,200
Aiden.

333
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,640
Hello.

334
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,470
This is Lina.

335
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,520
My wife.

336
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,400
You look beautiful today.

337
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,440
And you look dashing, Mr. An.

338
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,200
I've always looked dashing.

339
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,040
Do you need people here?

340
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,320
I can work for you.

341
00:16:17,422 --> 00:16:18,460
I'm too scared to hire you.

342
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,555
If you want to work here,

343
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:20,911
I'll have to give you my position.

344
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:22,920
Go and have your dinner. Go.

345
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,600
Right. Go.

346
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,109
- Let's go.
- I need to settle something.

347
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,879
I'll be there later.

348
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,990
Lina, let's hang out someday.

349
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:27,640
Sure.

350
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:28,230
Hurry up.

351
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:28,750
I will.

352
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,640
Bye, Mr. An.

353
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,520
Just use the delivery service.

354
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,710
Why did you come here?

355
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,280
It's faster this way.

356
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,750
What happened?

357
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,320
Why is there a hole in your pants?

358
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,560
What did you do?

359
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,640
What did I do?

360
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,520
Look.

361
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,750
I put it in the car.

362
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,830
You must have torn it

363
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:52,750
when you washed it.

364
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,680
I...

365
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,440
Fine.

366
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,280
What are you doing?

367
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,520
Changing your pants.

368
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,040
I can do that myself.

369
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,710
Fine. Do it yourself.

370
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,466
I'll do it myself.

371
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,470
So you took

372
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,280
a stroll

373
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,590
all the way to your company.

374
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,950
Why didn't you tell me?

375
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,790
My mom brewed fish soup

376
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,310
and is waiting for you to drink it.

377
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,200
I don't want to drink it.

378
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:16,400
Show some appreciation.

379
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,790
My mom traveled all the way
to brew fish soup for you.

380
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,080
As the saying goes,

381
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,200
as you age, look after your health.

382
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,990
Before you get a new wife,

383
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,333
you need a working back.

384
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,600
What new wife?

385
00:17:31,111 --> 00:17:32,466
Why did you change your password?

386
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,120
What is this?

387
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,640
What?

388
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,750
Why does it matter?

389
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,120
Something's off about you lately.

390
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,510
You hurt your back
but you went to Yangzhou anyway.

391
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,840
You have a meeting on the weekend.

392
00:17:47,244 --> 00:17:48,880
And now, you changed your password.

393
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,030
Just tell me.

394
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,790
When are you replacing me?

395
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,440
Enough.

396
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,080
I changed my password. That's all.

397
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,200
And that's bad.

398
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,840
Why change your password suddenly?

399
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,120
Unless you hide secrets in your phone.

400
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,666
Stop this nonsense now.

401
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,955
Change your password back

402
00:18:04,977 --> 00:18:06,200
and I'll stop my nonsense.

403
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,680
I won't.

404
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,022
So you're hiding something.

405
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,600
I won't go anywhere.

406
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,080
I'll sit here and pick up your calls.

407
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,600
All your calls.

408
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:18,270
The mistress will appear eventually.

409
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,790
I'm not changing! Someone's calling me.

410
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,990
Stop it.

411
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,160
They are waiting for me.

412
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,030
Hand it back.

413
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,120
Like I said, no.

414
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,377
Change your password.

415
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,120
No.

416
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,266
Then no phone for you.

417
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,600
I'll change it. I'll change it.

418
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,510
Give it to me.

419
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,622
I need to pick up the call.

420
00:18:36,688 --> 00:18:37,488
Jin.

421
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,230
Yes, Jin?

422
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,710
Mr. Shen, are you here?

423
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,111
We're waiting for you.

424
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,360
I'm coming over.

425
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,790
I have to go now.

426
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,680
Change your password back.

427
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,120
I...

428
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,790
Okay. Okay.

429
00:18:54,817 --> 00:18:57,500
(Set New Password)

430
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,266
Duole's birthday.

431
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:00,550
Okay.

432
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,230
Go.

433
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,640
Sorry, I'm late.

434
00:19:15,377 --> 00:19:15,955
You're here.

435
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,310
I...

436
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:17,030
Where do I sit?

437
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,550
Here.

438
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,200
Here, Mr. Shen.

439
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,120
Sit here.

440
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:20,880
No, take that seat.

441
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,710
No, I can't.

442
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,688
You're the guest.

443
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,750
I can sit here.

444
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:24,880
Come.

445
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,270
You're so thoughtful.

446
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,710
Not me. Aiden.

447
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,440
I heard you have a bad back

448
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,644
so I gave you a cushion.

449
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,640
Thank you.

450
00:19:32,688 --> 00:19:33,400
Don't mention it.

451
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,750
Excuse me.

452
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,750
(Susan invites you to a video call)

453
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,790
Shen Duole, why are you still awake?

454
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,600
Well,

455
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,680
my parents have been fighting lately
so they don't have time to nag me.

456
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:06,866
I'm playing games right now.

457
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,680
How is life in the UK?

458
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:09,680
It's great.

459
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,360
I do miss home.

460
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,470
And...

461
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,880
Let's play some games together.

462
00:20:14,955 --> 00:20:16,780
You'll forget everything
when you play games.

463
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,044
See you in the games.

464
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:25,710
Shen Qing,

465
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,270
An Ruifeng said

466
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,750
that if I worked in your company,

467
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,230
he would give me his position.

468
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,470
You're the boss in this house.

469
00:20:38,022 --> 00:20:39,790
Now you want to be my boss at work too?

470
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,550
He was just joking.

471
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,510
Don't take it seriously.

472
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,400
I know that.

473
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,360
But he isn't against the idea
of my working there.

474
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,790
Why are you like this?

475
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,710
I studied accounting.

476
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,120
I'm more than capable

477
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,680
of being an accountant in your company.

478
00:20:52,688 --> 00:20:53,950
We can go to work together.

479
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,880
My company isn't a charity.

480
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:58,600
It's not right for a married couple
to work in the same place.

481
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,470
Excuses.

482
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,120
Your boss didn't oppose it.

483
00:21:03,155 --> 00:21:04,790
And you're here
trying to dampen my mood.

484
00:21:04,822 --> 00:21:06,190
You just don't want me to be there.

485
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,840
I'll talk to An Ruifeng.

486
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,400
Enough of your tantrum.

487
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,080
What tantrum?

488
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,933
Give me your phone.

489
00:21:16,977 --> 00:21:19,155
Let me check if you changed
your password again.

490
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,270
Liu Lina, this is too much.

491
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,470
Shen Qing.

492
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,950
Don't demonize me.

493
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,840
If you have nothing to hide,

494
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,440
you will let me check your phone.

495
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,680
I'm telling you right now.

496
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,400
The phone password is a deal breaker.

497
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,470
If you change it,

498
00:21:32,711 --> 00:21:33,911
I'll blow up in your face.

499
00:21:33,955 --> 00:21:34,644
Try me.

500
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,400
Sure.

501
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,080
I'll change it

502
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,920
in front of you.

503
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,160
Stop.

504
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,790
I'll change it.

505
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,640
We're over then.

506
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,230
I'll change the password.

507
00:21:42,644 --> 00:21:44,120
- It's over between us.
- You...

508
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,510
How dare you fight back.

509
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:47,880
You...

510
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,470
You...

511
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:50,400
Shen Qing!

512
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,310
Shen Qing!

513
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,030
What's the matter, Dad?

514
00:21:58,088 --> 00:21:59,311
Something bad happened.

515
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,920
What?

516
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,790
This is bad.

517
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,510
Mr. Shen,

518
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:05,710
have you thought it through?

519
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,990
Do you want to spend your life with me?

520
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,230
Who is this?

521
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,550
Yeah, who is this?

522
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,400
Lv Yuan?

523
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,230
Who's Lv Yuan?

524
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:18,680
What...

525
00:22:19,288 --> 00:22:20,644
What do you call that again?

526
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:22,880
Fans.

527
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:25,880
Fans.

528
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,120
Fans of the choir.

529
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,230
How did you meet her?

530
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,120
It's a long story.

531
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,990
Make sure you get the full story.

532
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:44,080
Perhaps there's another reason.

533
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,230
What could it be?

534
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,790
Did your father

535
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,750
do something to her?

536
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,360
Dad.

537
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,120
You only met Ms. Lv

538
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,750
once?

539
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:05,990
Twice.

540
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:08,640
You...

541
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,750
Did you do something to her?

542
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:12,709
What...

543
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,200
What thing?

544
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,710
I mean...

545
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,990
What were you thinking?

546
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,030
But this is...

547
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:22,400
I...

548
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,440
I had a meal with her.

549
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:26,710
You...

550
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,600
Calm down, Dad.

551
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,333
Have some tea.

552
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:32,120
Is she

553
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,030
sick in the head?

554
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,160
I'm not sure.

555
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:43,990
I don't know her.

556
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,710
I'm not close to her.

557
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,880
Reply to her.

558
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,600
Reject her.

559
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,710
Yes, reject her.

560
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,600
This is wrong.

561
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,080
Right.

562
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:50,790
Yeah.

563
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:51,920
Reject her.

564
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:52,990
Reject her.

565
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,600
Spend my life with her?

566
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,490
What's wrong with her?

567
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,230
She messaged me.

568
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,360
Mr. Shen.

569
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,990
I'm near your house.

570
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:00,710
Almost there.

571
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,550
Mr. Shen.

572
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:08,680
Go.

573
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,680
Professor Shen?

574
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,030
Mr. Shen?

575
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:16,790
Hi.

576
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,750
Is Mr. Shen...

577
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,640
Does Professor Shen Zhuoran live here?

578
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,750
Who are you?

579
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,310
I'm a friend of his.

580
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,640
He's not home.

581
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,200
It's okay. I can wait here.

582
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,030
He won't be back this soon.

583
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,080
It's fine. I can wait here.

584
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,120
Shen!

585
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,470
How do you know I live here?

586
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,422
What a great place you have here.

587
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,044
The circulation is wonderful.

588
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,160
The windows are large.

589
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,270
The lighting is great.

590
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,640
I love this place.

591
00:24:58,990 --> 00:24:59,640
It's bright.

592
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,080
But this...

593
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,440
Lampshade.

594
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,400
It's so dusty. It needs to be cleaned.

595
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,470
When was it last cleaned?

596
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,400
I asked around

597
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
by the gate.

598
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,750
I asked where Mr. Shen Zhuoran lived.

599
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,750
And so many people helped me.

600
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,710
The security guard

601
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,470
even led me to the elevator.

602
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
Everyone likes you.

603
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,790
Ms...

604
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,270
I'm Lv Yuan.

605
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:31,400
Ms. Lv,

606
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,400
my father-in-law says
that he's not close to you.

607
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,790
To drop by his house unannounced

608
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:38,990
is quite inappropriate.

609
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,470
That's what you told your kids?

610
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:46,440
Yes.

611
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,880
It's the truth.

612
00:25:49,911 --> 00:25:51,750
It's because he and I
don't hang out often.

613
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,533
Once we hang out often,
we'll be very close.

614
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,880
I'm a headstrong woman.

615
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,866
Once I find the right guy,
I'll chase after him.

616
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,120
Don't mind me, Mr. Shen.

617
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,360
You said last time

618
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,710
that you wanted to hire a helper

619
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,440
to reduce your daughter-in-law's burden.

620
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,440
Yes, I did say that.

621
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,080
But...

622
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,640
From now on, just pretend

623
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,120
that I am the helper.

624
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,840
A helper
that comes with her retirement fund.

625
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,600
A helper who knows how to make dumplings

626
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,440
and dim sum.

627
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,840
If you ever

628
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:28,600
need someone to perform heavy labor,

629
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,200
to climb up or down,

630
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,600
or to buy groceries,

631
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,750
I can do them all.

632
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,310
Ms. Lv,

633
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,400
we appreciate your offer.

634
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:43,120
But this isn't how you do things.

635
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,230
You dropped by so suddenly.

636
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,160
My father-in-law feels...

637
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,230
Ms. Lv,

638
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:50,550
are you in difficulties now?

639
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,710
Difficulties are like lemons.

640
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:54,333
When life gives you lemons,
make lemonade.

641
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:55,666
I'm not in difficulties.

642
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:57,790
I just

643
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,360
think Mr. Shen is the right man.

644
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,680
I want to help him

645
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,800
and share a happy life with him.

646
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,880
Ms. Lv Yuan,

647
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,360
I...

648
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:13,933
Sorry, let me pick up a call.

649
00:27:13,955 --> 00:27:14,977
Sure. Go ahead.

650
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:18,400
Hello.

651
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,977
Is this Professor Shen?

652
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,230
Hi.

653
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,640
I'm the daughter of Lv Yuan.

654
00:27:23,288 --> 00:27:25,111
May I know
if my mother is at your place?

655
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,510
Don't answer.

656
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,510
Just listen to me.

657
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,200
Okay.

658
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,120
Go ahead.

659
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,200
I'm away from your mother now.

660
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,470
My mom and I got into a fight just now.

661
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
And she stormed off.

662
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,600
She has been

663
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,933
asking my classmates
in Normal University about you.

664
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,755
She talks about you all the time.

665
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,440
I wonder if she came to you

666
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,270
so I called you.

667
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,120
Mom, I'm scared.

668
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,030
Don't worry. We found Grandma.

669
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,360
My mom

670
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,030
is a prideful

671
00:28:00,177 --> 00:28:01,311
and stubborn person.

672
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,550
She's still angry now,

673
00:28:03,044 --> 00:28:05,777
so she would rather sleep on the street
than come back home.

674
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,950
Okay. Don't cry now.

675
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,640
Let's wait till she calms down.

676
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,133
Then, I'll pass the phone to her.

677
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,310
You two can have a conversation, okay?

678
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,400
No, don't do that.

679
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,840
If she knows I called you,

680
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,950
she'll be even more upset.

681
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,600
Professor Shen,

682
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:25,640
I know it's inappropriate
to ask for this favor,

683
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,750
but I'm at my wit's end.

684
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,080
Can you take my mom in for a few days?

685
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,990
I'll pick her up

686
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:33,920
once she calms down.

687
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,577
You seem to be stuck

688
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,600
between a rock and a hard place.

689
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,360
Well,

690
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,750
I'm not sure if I can be of help.

691
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,360
But I can

692
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,640
let your mom stay here for a while.

693
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:48,680
Okay?

694
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,710
Add me on WeChat.

695
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:51,640
Sure.

696
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,120
This number, yeah?

697
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,030
We'll keep in touch.

698
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,080
Sure. Thank you.

699
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,200
Thank you, Professor Shen.

700
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:07,680
Everyone hits rock bottom
in their lives.

701
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,470
That's why we help each other.

702
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:12,950
Shen Qing.

703
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:14,880
I...

704
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,400
I need to tell you something.

705
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,440
Carry on.

706
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,840
Once I'm here, you'll be free.

707
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,920
You can work peacefully.

708
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,750
Let me handle this house.

709
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,400
Ms. Lv,

710
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,440
I don't work.

711
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,955
You're at your prime. You don't work?

712
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,440
You must! Find a job then.

713
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,840
I

714
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,950
was...

715
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,310
Ms. Lv Yuan,

716
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,990
I just talked to my son.

717
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,310
Right next

718
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,200
to this neighborhood,

719
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,080
not far from here,

720
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,710
there is a hostel
for the college training center.

721
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,400
You can stay there.

722
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,440
It's not far from this place.

723
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,190
It's convenient too.
Will that work for you?

724
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,310
Of course.
I came from a modest background.

725
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,100
Give me a blanket
and I can sleep anywhere.

726
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,360
Great.

727
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:03,880
Then

728
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,360
we...

729
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,400
Since it's near the gate,

730
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,230
then dropping by will be easier.

731
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:10,950
Mr. Shen,

732
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,790
let's hang out more.

733
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,080
Once you know me more,

734
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,120
you'll know that I'm an open book.

735
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,680
I'm a simple woman.

736
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,990
Giving me a chance

737
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,640
is giving yourself a chance.

738
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,030
Right.

739
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,990
Let's get yourself checked in.

740
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,120
Sure.

741
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,790
Let's go.

742
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:35,030
Dad, let me do it.

743
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,230
Dad! Dad!

744
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,444
Dad!

745
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,270
I'm fine.

746
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,400
Are you okay?

747
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,200
- I'm fine.
- Shen Qing.

748
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:43,920
I...

749
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,080
You...

750
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
I can't move. Don't!

751
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,510
Don't touch me. Ouch.

752
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,160
I...

753
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:50,039
Are you all right?

754
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,600
- Your back is hurt?
- Then pick him up.

755
00:30:51,644 --> 00:30:53,550
I can't move now. I can't.

756
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,549
- Then you have to go to the hospital.
- Careful.

757
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,920
We need to go to the hospital. Slowly.

758
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,650
Go to the hospital.

759
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,510
- Careful.
- I can't.

760
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,120
Come.

761
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,160
Push.

762
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,640
Push against me.

763
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,470
- Yes.
- Come.

764
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,470
No. I can't move.

765
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,920
Not at all?

766
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,270
- Go to the hospital.
- Careful.

767
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:09,990
- No.
- Slowly.

768
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,550
His leg is trapped.

769
00:31:14,022 --> 00:31:14,555
Come.

770
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:15,880
No.

771
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:17,550
This is bad.

772
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:19,459
We'll take you to the hospital.

773
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,133
- Let's go.
- Go.

774
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:21,030
We'll take the car.

775
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,920
Dad, we move slowly.

776
00:31:22,955 --> 00:31:24,666
Drag him forward.

777
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,030
I...

778
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,880
Get the car keys.

779
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,680
This won't work.

780
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,600
Come.

781
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,790
Let me do it.

782
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,680
Come.

783
00:31:31,688 --> 00:31:32,840
But this doesn't seem right.

784
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,440
Come.

785
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,080
It won't work.

786
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,790
Go. Just go.

787
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,310
Let's do it together.

788
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,310
One, two...

789
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:38,920
Go.

790
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:39,550
Lift!

791
00:31:40,844 --> 00:31:41,710
Careful. Slow down.

792
00:31:45,222 --> 00:31:46,400
Are you okay, Shen Qing?

793
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,955
Let me open the elevator.

794
00:31:48,955 --> 00:31:49,270
I'll go.

795
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,920
Wait for me. I'll get the car keys.

796
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:53,230
Careful, Ms. Lv Yuan.

797
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,120
Careful.

798
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,950
Dad, don't go.

799
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,640
Our doors are wide open.

800
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,550
Just stay home.

801
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,640
Call me

802
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,310
if anything.

803
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:01,950
Sure.

804
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,340
(Acupuncture
and Rehabilitation Department)

805
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:05,790
Lina.

806
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,790
Pay the bill and I'll queue up
at the pharmacy.

807
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,977
By the time you're done,

808
00:32:10,977 --> 00:32:12,466
it'll be my turn to get the medicine.

809
00:32:12,533 --> 00:32:12,822
Sure?

810
00:32:12,822 --> 00:32:14,422
Thank you so much for today, Ms. Lv.

811
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,400
You're welcome.

812
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,790
And no need to thank me at all.

813
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,550
Let's split up.

814
00:32:18,711 --> 00:32:19,866
It's more efficient that way.

815
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,360
Okay.

816
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,750
What did I tell you?

817
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:27,840
Be careful.

818
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,880
We need to take things slow.

819
00:32:30,155 --> 00:32:30,911
All right?

820
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,030
Oh, did you practice
the Baduanjin skills?

821
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,710
I did.

822
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,920
When you're middle-aged,

823
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,933
your joints are extra vulnerable.

824
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:40,990
If you can walk,

825
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,080
don't run.

826
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,750
Also,

827
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:45,400
like they say, for your problem,

828
00:32:45,733 --> 00:32:48,222
rehabilitation plays a more important
part than treatment.

829
00:32:49,911 --> 00:32:51,860
(ICE: Yangzhou is the best)
If you have a bad back,

830
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,200
you can't do many things.

831
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,750
I know you have a family to feed.

832
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,640
You work hard every day

833
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,950
(Like)
so I understand if you're stressed.

834
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,950
But even so,

835
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,680
health should be your priority.

836
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,680
Many office workers like you

837
00:33:08,755 --> 00:33:10,066
don't take care of themselves.

838
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,200
When you're at a certain age,

839
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,577
(Aiden: Yangzhou is the best)
you must be mindful of your health.

840
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,120
It'll be too late if you overwork

841
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,911
your body into a sickly mess.

842
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:21,790
We have

843
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,400
to admit we're old eventually.

844
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,640
How am I old?

845
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,310
Wait. Ow.

846
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,400
What did I tell you?

847
00:33:31,155 --> 00:33:33,000
Admit you're old,
whether you like it or not.

848
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,080
Understood?

849
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,270
Dad, Shen Qing pulled

850
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,377
his back accidentally.

851
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,360
In the hospital,

852
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,333
the doctor massaged him

853
00:33:46,355 --> 00:33:47,466
and he felt much better.

854
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:47,790
Oh?

855
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:48,360
Yes.

856
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,000
He can move now?

857
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:49,990
Yes.

858
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,200
All thanks to you, Ms. Lv.

859
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,733
- I wouldn't have been able
- Right.

860
00:33:53,755 --> 00:33:54,990
to handle him alone.

861
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,120
Don't mention it.

862
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,440
I used to carry gunny sacks
back in the metal factory.

863
00:33:58,555 --> 00:33:59,880
They were heavier than Shen Qing.

864
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,550
Drink some water.

865
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,510
Thank you for your help.

866
00:34:04,288 --> 00:34:05,200
Where is the hostel?

867
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,270
I'll go there myself.

868
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,733
Rest a bit first. Have some water.

869
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,950
Yes, have some water.

870
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:09,510
Look.

871
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:10,990
I called

872
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,510
the hostel just now.

873
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,120
They were having a meeting

874
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,560
so there's no room.

875
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,640
You know what?

876
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,520
Why don't you

877
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,870
stay at our place tonight?

878
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,680
No, that's not good.

879
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,710
An old woman like me

880
00:34:24,711 --> 00:34:26,310
cannot stay
in a married couple's house.

881
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,022
It's inappropriate.

882
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:27,800
It's fine. Really.

883
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,560
No. I'll find a way.

884
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,533
- You can stay in our study.
- I'll find a way.

885
00:34:30,555 --> 00:34:30,977
You...

886
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,200
It's quite late now.

887
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,200
Yes, indeed, Dad.

888
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,790
I'm fine.

889
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:36,000
Ms. Lv Yuan.

890
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,555
You know what? Look.

891
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,520
There's a small bed

892
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,830
in my study.

893
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,640
I haven't tidied it but...

894
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,480
It's perfect.

895
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,430
I was eyeing the bed just now.

896
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,350
Okay. I'll make the bed now.

897
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:47,830
It's fine.

898
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,111
You can stay here for a night.

899
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,288
I can do it myself.

900
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:50,750
Okay.

901
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:52,430
Wonderful.

902
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,333
Keep your voice low.

903
00:34:57,355 --> 00:34:57,755
The sheet

904
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,200
I...

905
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,350
And the pillowcases are clean.

906
00:34:59,350 --> 00:34:59,710
Right.

907
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,430
Xinghuo,

908
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,160
it's a bad day today.

909
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,080
I wanted to send your mother
to the hostel.

910
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:08,830
But as I bent down to grab something,

911
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:09,666
I almost fell down.

912
00:35:09,711 --> 00:35:10,640
My son pulled his back

913
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,480
to steady me.

914
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,600
Fortunately, your mother was here

915
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,230
to help us send him to the hospital.

916
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,230
We only came back now.

917
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,870
My mom is a kind person.

918
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,430
Professor Shen,

919
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:28,520
I know my mother is interested in you.

920
00:35:28,977 --> 00:35:30,270
And she's an impatient person.

921
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,120
Allow me to apologize in advance

922
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,680
if she ever offends you.

923
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,040
I see.

924
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,600
Anyway, don't worry.

925
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,600
I let your mom

926
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,520
use the small bed

927
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,040
in my study.

928
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,480
She'll have to make do here.

929
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,430
Okay?

930
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,080
That's wonderful.

931
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,310
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

932
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:49,755
You're welcome.

933
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:52,640
Dad.

934
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,560
Do we have a new duvet?

935
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,430
There should be. Let me find one.

936
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,970
Are you okay with the pillow thickness?

937
00:35:58,977 --> 00:35:59,960
It's good.

938
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:00,750
Okay.

939
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,350
It's very good.

940
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:01,790
Lina.

941
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:03,040
Come.

942
00:36:03,466 --> 00:36:04,200
Give it to me.

943
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,520
Mr. and Mrs. Ding gave this to us.

944
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,400
We've never used it.

945
00:36:06,422 --> 00:36:07,066
Okay. Dad.

946
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,160
You should rest now.

947
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,560
Ms. Lv Yuan,

948
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:11,790
I'll go to my room now.

949
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:12,790
Sure. Go ahead.

950
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,790
Rest early.

951
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:14,790
Sure.

952
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,790
This duvet...

953
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:17,710
Sorry for the trouble.

954
00:36:17,711 --> 00:36:18,777
Soft and fluffy.

955
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,120
You see, Lina,

956
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,390
my ex-husband

957
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:28,000
met his mistress when his factory

958
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,200
was purchasing duvets like this.

959
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:32,430
Therefore, I swear to never use

960
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,870
soft duvets like this ever again.

961
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:34,910
Take it away.

962
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,080
- I don't want it.
- Sure.

963
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,640
Sure.

964
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,640
I understand.

965
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:38,790
Let's not use it.

966
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:39,560
Yes.

967
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,640
There's a blanket there.

968
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,520
It's a great blanket.

969
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,680
I'll be fine.

970
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,200
Okay.

971
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,270
Ms. Lv,

972
00:36:52,622 --> 00:36:53,466
what's the matter?

973
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,000
It's a new mattress.

974
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,270
It's too soft.

975
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,080
I love this one here.

976
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,160
Sturdy.

977
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,710
I love a hard bed.

978
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,000
Go to sleep now.

979
00:37:08,044 --> 00:37:09,888
Don't worry about me. I'll handle it.

980
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,430
Thank goodness for Ms. Lv today.

981
00:37:20,755 --> 00:37:22,688
I wouldn't have been able to carry you.

982
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,680
Be gentle.

983
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,870
Can you check who messaged me?

984
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,790
I don't know your password anyway.

985
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:37,910
I changed it back.

986
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,560
It's Duole's birthday.

987
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,350
An Ruifeng

988
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,000
sent you a news link.

989
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:46,430
Ignore it.

990
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:47,640
Okay.

991
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,480
Mr. Shen, you're awake.

992
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,080
Morning, Ms. Lv Yuan.

993
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,000
Morning.

994
00:37:59,230 --> 00:37:59,790
Morning.

995
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,390
Come.

996
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,870
Have your breakfast.

997
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,520
What a lavish breakfast.

998
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,600
This is a lavish breakfast?

999
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,680
I'll show you more

1000
00:38:07,155 --> 00:38:07,830
in the future.

1001
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,680
So many dishes.

1002
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,480
Not at all.

1003
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,480
Breakfast is the most important meal.

1004
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,977
We must have a nutritious breakfast.

1005
00:38:15,022 --> 00:38:15,960
That's right.

1006
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,120
Thank you.

1007
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,870
I'll dig in then.

1008
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,040
Go ahead.

1009
00:38:21,022 --> 00:38:22,377
Let me know what you think of it.

1010
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,120
Enjoy your food.

1011
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:26,160
After this,

1012
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,222
I'll remove the curtains

1013
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,390
and wash them.

1014
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,230
It's a sunny day.

1015
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,200
No.

1016
00:38:34,955 --> 00:38:36,270
Don't worry about the curtains.

1017
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,830
When it's time to change them,

1018
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,160
Lina will come,

1019
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,160
change, and wash them.

1020
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,200
No need for her. I'm here now.

1021
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,755
From now on,

1022
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,310
all your needs

1023
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,480
will be taken care of.

1024
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,430
You'll be happy

1025
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,310
and content.

1026
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:52,910
Okay.

1027
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,350
Thank you.

1028
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,533
Enjoy your food.

1029
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:57,488
Eat some more.

1030
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,160
You...

1031
00:39:00,888 --> 00:39:02,155
I'm removing the curtains.

1032
00:39:02,222 --> 00:39:03,177
You're full already?

1033
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:08,350
This is...

1034
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,480
Stop!

1035
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,310
Ms. Lv Yuan.

1036
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,750
Let me help you.

1037
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,955
Be careful where you stand.

1038
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,390
I'll be fine.

1039
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,270
Goodness.

1040
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,080
You,

1041
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:17,910
take this.

1042
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,680
Shen Qing, come here.

1043
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,960
I just sat down.

1044
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,910
What's the matter?

1045
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,244
Duole, bring your dad here.

1046
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:36,830
Quick.

1047
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:40,390
Look.

1048
00:39:42,355 --> 00:39:43,520
Not bad. You hit it twice.

1049
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,390
Twice.

1050
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,230
Not bad.

1051
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,710
Is Grandpa in love?

1052
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,160
Shush.

1053
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,430
I quite like Ms. Lv now.

1054
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,640
Your dad hasn't done sports in ages.

1055
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,044
Now that she's here,

1056
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,870
he's exercising again.

1057
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,870
It's a sunny day today.

1058
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,830
Hurry up.

1059
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,680
Go down and take a stroll.

1060
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,350
Walk 10,000 steps.

1061
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,960
You haven't changed your clothes?

1062
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,160
I'll go now.

1063
00:40:17,444 --> 00:40:18,022
All the best.

1064
00:40:19,177 --> 00:40:19,800
All the best.

1065
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,080
No need to glare at me.

1066
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,790
I will take good care of Mr. Shen.

1067
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,680
You were a committee member.

1068
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,270
So am I.

1069
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,230
I've been a committee member
for more than 40 years.

1070
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:43,430
Worry not.

1071
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,000
You

1072
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,160
watch over me,

1073
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,750
and I'll

1074
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,160
watch over Mr. Shen for you.

1075
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,000
Mr. Shen.

1076
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,350
Walk with a wide stride.

1077
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,390
(ICE: Things are getting better now.)

1078
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,120
Ms. Lv is amazing.

1079
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,120
She dragged your father out

1080
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:56,870
of his boring rut.

1081
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,019
Look at your dad.

1082
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,690
He's already all tanned
within three days.

1083
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,600
Yes, Ms. Lv

1084
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,080
is so full of life.

1085
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,520
Fortunately, she's here.

1086
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,000
Since she's so nice to Dad,

1087
00:42:09,044 --> 00:42:10,200
we should be nice to her too.

1088
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,230
We should care about her.

1089
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:12,680
Yes.

1090
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,640
Give me the watermelon.

1091
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:18,830
Go back first.

1092
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:22,080
Ms. Lv?

1093
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:24,520
Ms. Lv?

1094
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:26,430
Where is she?

1095
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,520
Ms. Lv,

1096
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:35,790
what are you doing?

1097
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,270
The staircase is so dirty.

1098
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:39,270
I mopped it just now.

1099
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,640
No need to clean it.

1100
00:42:40,888 --> 00:42:42,350
We have janitors come here every day.

1101
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:43,750
They clean once every day.

1102
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:45,270
Just once? That is not enough.

1103
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,790
Look how dusty the railings are.

1104
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,200
And the corners.

1105
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:50,230
Stop cleaning now.

1106
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,380
You must clean it with a rug.

1107
00:42:51,422 --> 00:42:51,977
Let me do it.

1108
00:42:52,022 --> 00:42:53,120
I'm fine.

1109
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,080
I want to contribute.

1110
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:55,560
