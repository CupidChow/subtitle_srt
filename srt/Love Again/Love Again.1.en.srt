00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,110
=Episode 1=

3
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:43,970
Thank you for coming.

4
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,780
My condolences.

5
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,250
Thank you.

6
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,660
Sorry for the trouble.

7
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,730
What are you saying?

8
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,300
I'm so tired for the past few days.

9
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,500
I didn't even have time to cry.

10
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,420
Look after yourself.

11
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:55,940
Don't faint of exhaustion.

12
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,700
Lina!

13
00:01:57,266 --> 00:01:58,130
Someone's calling you.

14
00:01:58,133 --> 00:01:58,666
Lina!

15
00:01:59,250 --> 00:01:59,730
Coming.

16
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,420
Thank you.

17
00:02:04,444 --> 00:02:05,088
My condolences.

18
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,800
Thank you for coming.

19
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,444
My condolences.

20
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,730
Lina!

21
00:02:15,022 --> 00:02:16,288
This is a new elegiac couplet.

22
00:02:16,288 --> 00:02:17,259
Where should I hang them?

23
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,730
Well, hang them in the farewell hall.

24
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,511
I'll take you there.

25
00:02:21,022 --> 00:02:21,555
Zhou Jing.

26
00:02:21,622 --> 00:02:22,780
Take her to the farewell hall.

27
00:02:22,822 --> 00:02:23,540
The farewell hall?

28
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:24,890
Family member,

29
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,980
have you prepared the eulogy
as per the MC's request?

30
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,620
Yes. It's with my husband.
I'll retrieve it.

31
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,511
Okay. Hand it to him.

32
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,300
Shen Qing.

33
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,210
The eulogy.

34
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:43,580
Dai.

35
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,930
Dai!

36
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,020
- Dai!
- Madam Sun.

37
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,490
Madam Sun.

38
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,450
Didn't they say your mother
had conquered the cancer?

39
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,260
How could she leave us just like that?

40
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,580
In-law!

41
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,380
Wake up and see your daughter!

42
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,450
In-law!

43
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,450
Mom!

44
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,380
Madam Sun.

45
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,210
Don't cry...

46
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,650
You can cry later.

47
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,730
It's not time yet.

48
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,860
Shen Qing,
you're hanging in there, right?

49
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:23,860
I'm fine.

50
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,020
Mom, you...

51
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,170
You and Dad should have a seat inside.

52
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:29,700
Come.

53
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,170
In-law...

54
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,300
These flowers have all wilted.

55
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:43,020
This one-stop funeral service
is not professional at all.

56
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,330
No, I have to find them.

57
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,420
This is a huge deal, you know?

58
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,450
He can't be perfunctory.

59
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,100
Don't do this.

60
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:50,430
Don't cause other people trouble.

61
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,100
Come.

62
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:52,730
Let's go.

63
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,170
Let's go.

64
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,320
That's the place.

65
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,090
The Western hall.

66
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,300
Tian, let's go.

67
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,420
Don't hold my hand.

68
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,540
Fine. I won't.

69
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,300
Gou.

70
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:04,770
I...

71
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,450
I don't think I should go inside.

72
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:08,930
What are you saying?

73
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,770
You're my girlfriend.

74
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,920
You have to attend
different occasions with me.

75
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,090
What kind of occasion is this?

76
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,300
Weddings and funerals
are all very important occasions.

77
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,530
But I don't think
I'm dressed up for the occasion.

78
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:20,090
You should've told me earlier.

79
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,770
I would've changed them.

80
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,060
There's no way
we can predict the future.

81
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,260
I think you look fine.

82
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,500
Let's go.

83
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,500
They're so indecent.

84
00:04:32,577 --> 00:04:33,450
Just stay out of it.

85
00:04:33,688 --> 00:04:35,140
Do they even know where they are?

86
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,210
Yeah.

87
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,450
Dad.

88
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:38,290
Dad.

89
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:39,410
Mr. Gou is here.

90
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,650
Gou.

91
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,210
Sorry for being late.

92
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,290
Thank you for attending
Jingmin's memorial service.

93
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,700
My condolences.

94
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,180
Sit down.

95
00:04:49,844 --> 00:04:51,222
You have to look after yourself.

96
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,020
Don't grieve too much.

97
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,140
Duole, give your grandpa some water.

98
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:58,700
Okay.

99
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,820
Grandpa, have some water.

100
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:01,850
In-law,

101
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,022
please look after yourself.

102
00:05:04,044 --> 00:05:04,820
Have a seat.

103
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:05,770
Okay.

104
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,260
Shen.

105
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,260
Jingmin has left us.

106
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,333
At least she's free from her suffering.

107
00:05:13,043 --> 00:05:14,203
Think on the bright side.

108
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,140
Now that Jingmin is gone,

109
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:21,530
I have no one to talk to.

110
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,970
There's no one to nag me now.

111
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,530
That's why,

112
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,620
Shen,

113
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:30,740
we have

114
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,970
to keep on living

115
00:05:32,444 --> 00:05:34,140
for Jingmin's sake
and our children's sake.

116
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,090
That's right.

117
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,530
We still have a long way to go.

118
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:36,890
Yes.

119
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,770
We have to live well.

120
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:40,970
We have to look forward.

121
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:41,970
Yes.

122
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:42,500
Yes.

123
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:43,940
Just like me.

124
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:45,844
We should inherit
the past and forge ahead.

125
00:05:47,622 --> 00:05:49,140
Inherit the past and forge ahead?

126
00:05:49,644 --> 00:05:50,700
What do you mean by that?

127
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,530
My in-law just passed away not long ago,

128
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,410
- now, you want him to move on?
- Mom!

129
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,059
- Don't you have a conscience?
- Mom!

130
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,620
Sister-in-law.

131
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,529
Stop calling me that.

132
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,260
- What?
- Madam.

133
00:05:59,260 --> 00:05:59,580
Mom!

134
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,450
Who are you?

135
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,309
Stop it!

136
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,260
What do you mean by that?

137
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,090
You're overthinking it.
That's not what I mean.

138
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:04,650
Stop saying.

139
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,090
Stop it!

140
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:05,380
Mom!

141
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:06,820
Stop talking!

142
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,580
He told your father to forge ahead!

143
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,260
Stop it!

144
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,580
Stop it!

145
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,180
Madam!

146
00:06:11,222 --> 00:06:12,490
Enough. Stop explaining yourself.

147
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,770
Mr. Gou, I'm sorry.

148
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,530
Are you okay?

149
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:17,620
Do you need

150
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,330
some heart relief pills?

151
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,060
I have some.

152
00:06:20,177 --> 00:06:20,933
No need for that.

153
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,650
I'm fine.

154
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:22,620
I'm fine.

155
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,060
Dad.

156
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,940
It's almost time.

157
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,740
Let's head to the farewell hall.

158
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:34,940
Dad.

159
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:36,450
Let's go.

160
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:37,740
Slowly.

161
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:38,450
Slowly.

162
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:38,850
Duole.

163
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,620
Slowly.

164
00:06:39,644 --> 00:06:40,330
Help Grandpa out.

165
00:06:40,355 --> 00:06:41,311
Hurry. Support him.

166
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,380
Recalling the past, raising nephews
and grandchildren with frugality,

167
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,820
leaving behind a noble example.

168
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,970
Behold a hall of filial children,

169
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,290
mourning deeply,
yet the voice and presence are no more.

170
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,140
May such great virtue be passed down
to inspire future generations.

171
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,500
Dad, are you okay?

172
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,933
Whose phone is that? Switch it off!

173
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:10,650
Mom.

174
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:11,500
It's your phone.

175
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:11,890
No...

176
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,650
Give me your hand.

177
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,380
Come on.

178
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:20,410
Dad!

179
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:20,850
Dad!

180
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:22,940
Dad!

181
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,060
In-law!

182
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,410
Grandpa!

183
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:25,820
In-law!

184
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,210
Dad!

185
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:26,850
In-law!

186
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,155
Give him the heart relief pills!

187
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,090
In-law!

188
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:34,260
Call 120! We need urgent treatment!

189
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:41,330
(One Year Later)

190
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,060
Dear.

191
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,180
Time to eat.

192
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:57,890
Grandpa.

193
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,330
Dad.

194
00:08:04,622 --> 00:08:05,955
Do you want some tofu pudding?

195
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,180
No.

196
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,820
Why don't you let me organize
Mom's belongings today?

197
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,890
The Mid-Autumn Festival is nearing.

198
00:08:15,022 --> 00:08:16,990
Her coat is still hanging there,
collecting dust.

199
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:21,450
Lina, come.

200
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,290
Since Dad doesn't want that,

201
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,490
you should stop bringing it up.

202
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,700
Mom has passed away for a long time.

203
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,600
Look at how your father is acting.

204
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,220
He's playing the music again.

205
00:08:35,355 --> 00:08:37,088
I don't even have the mood to eat now.

206
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:43,460
Dad,

207
00:08:43,777 --> 00:08:45,360
I know you can't bear to part with her.

208
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,620
But you'll feel better

209
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,020
once her things are organized.

210
00:08:48,955 --> 00:08:50,220
Mom will surely be heartbroken

211
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,500
if she sees you like this.

212
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,220
Keep them, then.

213
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:57,980
I didn't forbid you from doing it.

214
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,620
She's already gone.

215
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,020
Her items remind me of her.

216
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:06,980
They torment me.

217
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,170
Lina!

218
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:09,740
Lina!

219
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,340
Mom.

220
00:09:13,422 --> 00:09:14,260
So, your unit is here.

221
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,340
- It's here.
- Give it to me.

222
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,000
Hold this for me.

223
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:16,890
It's so heavy.

224
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,340
Grandma.

225
00:09:18,377 --> 00:09:20,190
You're at home?
Is it not time for school yet?

226
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,260
Look.

227
00:09:21,288 --> 00:09:23,170
Look at the giant fish
your grandpa had caught.

228
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:23,770
It's huge.

229
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,460
Look.

230
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,230
Grandpa is amazing.

231
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:25,890
Yeah, right?

232
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,050
Mom, I have to send Duole to school.

233
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:28,760
I'm running late.

234
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:29,460
Okay.

235
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,577
Please enjoy the breakfast.

236
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,570
Okay. Go ahead.

237
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,340
Take care.

238
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,020
Goodbye, Grandma.

239
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,690
Alright.

240
00:09:33,822 --> 00:09:34,844
Have you had breakfast?

241
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,570
I have.

242
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,530
In-law.

243
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,530
Listen.

244
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,260
My husband caught a huge fish.

245
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,377
He said it was for you...

246
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,100
He's asleep.

247
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:53,570
Is he?

248
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,890
What's with the music?

249
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,260
It chills the heart.

250
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,190
Mom, he finally agreed to let me

251
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,530
organize my mother-in-law's items.

252
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,620
Lend me a hand later.

253
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,930
You should've done that long ago.

254
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,260
I waited until now.

255
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:11,050
It looks good on me, right?

256
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,140
Isn't it hot?

257
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,650
This coat is pretty nice.

258
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,410
The fabric is great.

259
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:21,111
The color is vibrant as well.

260
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:23,740
Listen.

261
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,980
I'll take it with me later.

262
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,355
Don't even think about it.

263
00:10:26,622 --> 00:10:28,530
Shen Dai bought this coat
with her scholarship.

264
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,640
She told me to mail it to the U.S.

265
00:10:30,644 --> 00:10:31,500
before she left.

266
00:10:34,444 --> 00:10:36,260
Your sister-in-law
is kind of troublesome.

267
00:10:36,422 --> 00:10:37,949
She wants you to mail it to the U.S.?

268
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,880
Do you know how much
the shipping fee will cost?

269
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,644
I'll ask her to do cash on delivery.

270
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:42,740
Cash on delivery?

271
00:10:43,088 --> 00:10:43,822
Take it with you.

272
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,355
Take all of them with you.

273
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,911
I can't take any of them.

274
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:48,930
Here.

275
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:49,288
This...

276
00:10:49,311 --> 00:10:50,177
Open the trash bag.

277
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:50,980
The cookies...

278
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,500
They're still sealed, you know?

279
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,450
All of them are expired.

280
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,400
I've checked all of them.

281
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,109
Open the trash bag.

282
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,080
Your mother-in-law was too particular.
That's why she passed away early.

283
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,020
Your father and I ate everything we had.

284
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,500
Look. We're still jumping around.

285
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,690
They're no longer edible.

286
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:04,888
Medical fees are
much more expensive.

287
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:05,311
Come.

288
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:06,500
Fine.

289
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,100
Here. Quickly.

290
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,220
Put all of them in the bag.

291
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,050
It's such a waste.

292
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,690
Enough. I'll do it.

293
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:17,500
This...

294
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:20,555
These slippers belonged
to your mother-in-law, huh?

295
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,500
- They're used.
- I know.

296
00:11:22,622 --> 00:11:23,819
- Don't take them.
- You...

297
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,980
You shouldn't throw them away!

298
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,980
But why?

299
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,340
You mustn't throw them away.

300
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,570
Just throw them away.

301
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:29,990
It can hold down the fort.

302
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,260
What do you mean?

303
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,220
Your mother-in-law is gone.

304
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,500
But her spirit has to remain with us.

305
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,050
This way, vixens dare not
invade your family.

306
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,020
Lina.

307
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,570
Mr. Gou?

308
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,530
Mr. Gou.

309
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,100
I called your father many times.

310
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,355
Why didn't he answer my calls?

311
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,000
Grandpa.

312
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,050
Look who's here.

313
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,410
Gou.

314
00:12:07,688 --> 00:12:09,050
Let me change into some slippers.

315
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:09,290
Yeah.

316
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,155
Get some slippers.

317
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,410
Are these okay?

318
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:14,690
It's fine.

319
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,020
You can enter with your shoes on.

320
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,044
I'll mop the floor later.

321
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:17,650
Okay.

322
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:18,810
- Tianzhen, here.
- Okay.

323
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:22,022
Have a seat.

324
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:24,260
Why have you

325
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,810
become this lethargic?

326
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,050
He looks dispirited.

327
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,810
I'm waiting for my demise.

328
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,170
Why should I look spirited?

329
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,100
Dad, what are you saying?

330
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,530
Hello, Professor Shen.

331
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:38,380
This is

332
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,810
my official girlfriend.

333
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:42,020
Her name is

334
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,770
Tian Zhenyang.

335
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,530
She's a great singer.

336
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,380
People call her Tianzhen.

337
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,380
That's enough.

338
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,050
She's young. How should we address her?

339
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,355
"Madam" would be inappropriate.

340
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,050
You can call me
Ms. Tian, Ms. Zhen, Ms. Yang,

341
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:55,800
anything you like.

342
00:12:55,822 --> 00:12:56,570
Hello, Ms. Zhen.

343
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,170
Hello.

344
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,810
Le, mind your manners.

345
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:02,066
You must remember your seniority.

346
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:02,890
You two,

347
00:13:03,111 --> 00:13:03,977
call her Madam.

348
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,170
Le, call her Grandma.

349
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:07,650
Anything is fine.

350
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:09,020
As long as you are happy with it.

351
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,190
I'll make some tea for you two.

352
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:10,890
Le, come here.

353
00:13:11,044 --> 00:13:12,040
Stop the music player.

354
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:12,810
Coming.

355
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,690
Play "Red Berries In Blossom."

356
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:16,100
Go away.

357
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:17,690
I have it on my phone.

358
00:13:18,488 --> 00:13:19,930
Your profile picture is so cool.

359
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:21,860
Shen.

360
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,190
Let me teach you how
to entertain yourself with a phone.

361
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:25,380
Look here.

362
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,020
Grandpa, I've added him for you.

363
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,410
Scroll upward.

364
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:30,622
Scroll upward.

365
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,866
That's Kong
from Mathematics Department.

366
00:13:32,911 --> 00:13:34,530
This is his current wife.

367
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:36,400
She's from the same department as him.

368
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,500
Look at how loving they are.

369
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,140
Look.

370
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,890
Kong and his original wife

371
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,100
were childhood sweethearts.

372
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,930
They were deeply in love.

373
00:13:49,177 --> 00:13:50,170
But his wife passed away.

374
00:13:50,488 --> 00:13:51,400
What should he do?

375
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,490
He can't just join her
in the afterlife, right?

376
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:54,530
Therefore,

377
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,170
he had to live on.

378
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,955
It's only been a few years
since he received his pension, right?

379
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,690
How can he live on?

380
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,810
By pulling himself together

381
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,410
and getting another partner.

382
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,380
Old women don't need new partners.

383
00:14:08,022 --> 00:14:09,100
Once their partner is gone,

384
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,100
they usually lead
better lives than before.

385
00:14:11,466 --> 00:14:12,933
Old men have to find new partners.

386
00:14:13,044 --> 00:14:14,140
Once their partner is gone,

387
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,460
they might seek to join them.

388
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:18,620
Fine, then.

389
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,050
Dad.

390
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:25,530
Mr. Gou.

391
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,570
Madam Tian, I...

392
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,020
I have two reports to finish.

393
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:29,340
You guys can go ahead.

394
00:14:29,355 --> 00:14:30,680
Just ignore us. Focus on your work.

395
00:14:30,688 --> 00:14:31,422
Go ahead.

396
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:32,380
Okay.

397
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,340
Go and do your work.

398
00:14:35,377 --> 00:14:37,220
What urgent report
do you have to finish?

399
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,340
That was sudden.

400
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,290
Entertain them for me.

401
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,170
Shen Qing.

404
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:53,690
Stop that.

405
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:54,860
Mom, that was great.

406
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,020
Come on. Sing more for me.

407
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,810
Enough. You guys should stop.

408
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,410
Grandma, here are some flowers.

409
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,260
I love that. Thank you.

410
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,740
Qing, film the flowers.

411
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,290
Aren't they beautiful?

412
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:10,822
Film them properly.

You stepped on my foot.

418
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:42,890
Help me out.

419
00:15:43,466 --> 00:15:44,650
Alright. I think you're fine.

420
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,620
I suppose I won't walk for long.

421
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,380
No need to see us off. It's fine.

422
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,220
Mr. Gou,

423
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,440
it would be great if you guys
could spend more time here.

424
00:15:58,444 --> 00:15:59,377
It's been so long.

425
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,530
It's rare for my father-in-law
to be this happy.

426
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,220
Really?

427
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,050
I can tell.

428
00:16:03,577 --> 00:16:04,955
Visit us more often in the future.

429
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,620
Okay.

430
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:06,140
Sure.

431
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:09,570
In my opinion,

432
00:16:09,622 --> 00:16:11,733
you have to find your father-in-law
another partner.

433
00:16:12,155 --> 00:16:14,380
It's different no matter how filial
one's children are.

434
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,620
Even if you live right
next to each other, door to door,

435
00:16:16,622 --> 00:16:18,260
you guys can't keep an eye on him 24/7.

436
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,044
An old man in our neighborhood
was diagnosed with depression.

437
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,666
He jumped off a building and died.

438
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,500
He did it because he was lonely

439
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:25,711
after his partner's passing.

440
00:16:25,711 --> 00:16:26,890
He didn't need to go that far.

441
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,460
Do you know what humans fear the most?

442
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:31,740
It's loneliness.

443
00:16:32,777 --> 00:16:34,466
And, I think your father is showing

444
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,020
signs of depression.

445
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,910
(Depression Self-Evaluation Form)

446
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,770
Persistent low mood.

447
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,500
Nihilistic view toward the world,
no appetite,

448
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,340
difficulty in sleeping.

449
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,530
Indeed. I can't sleep well lately.

450
00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:53,888
I wasn't referring to you.
I was referring to Dad.

451
00:16:54,755 --> 00:16:56,688
This is a self-evaluation form
for depression.

452
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:57,620
Look. There are more.

453
00:16:57,777 --> 00:16:59,020
Not willing to leave the house,

454
00:16:59,044 --> 00:17:00,400
not willing to pick up the phone.

455
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,390
That's what he did, right?

456
00:17:01,844 --> 00:17:02,260
This...

457
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,610
He fits every criterion.

458
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,290
Shen Qing, you see,

459
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,460
should we

460
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,850
find a partner for Dad?

461
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,180
What are you saying?

462
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:16,400
Look at what happened today.

463
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,940
Gou and Tianzhen were
happily performing away.

464
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,066
They looked so jovial.

465
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,180
Mr. Gou is an old playboy.

466
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,700
He's different from Dad.

467
00:17:25,288 --> 00:17:27,933
Among married couples,
one of them will inevitably leave first.

468
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:29,660
Dad needs time to get used to it.

469
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,260
Enough. Go to sleep.

470
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,733
Turn around.

471
00:17:54,444 --> 00:17:55,690
I need to turn it around, right?

472
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,311
That's right.

473
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:57,700
Come. Let's continue.

474
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,020
Three, two, one.

475
00:17:59,180 --> 00:17:59,460
Go.

476
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,330
Come on!

477
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:09,933
You can go ahead.

478
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,200
What are you looking at?

479
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,740
Lin Fengyun.

480
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,770
What are you doing lately?

481
00:18:14,777 --> 00:18:16,180
You didn't reply to our group chat.

482
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,940
I was busy with family affairs.

483
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,733
Aren't you cold for wearing
such a short skirt?

484
00:18:19,777 --> 00:18:20,333
Not at all.

485
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,020
Apple.

486
00:18:21,022 --> 00:18:22,349
I'll get a number for our table.

487
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:22,755
Okay.

488
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,050
Okay.

489
00:18:25,222 --> 00:18:25,755
Go ahead.

490
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,940
Do you know how old you are?
You still call yourself Apple?

491
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,050
What do you mean?

492
00:18:31,222 --> 00:18:32,460
I'm still strong, you know?

493
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,610
Does his mother know

494
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,890
that you're dating her young boy?

495
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,260
He's over 20, you know?

496
00:18:37,577 --> 00:18:39,822
My mother's boyfriend
is only eight years older than me.

497
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:41,980
So, it runs in the family, huh?

498
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,090
Age doesn't matter.

499
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,330
Really?

500
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,770
Miss, love isn't a job recruitment.

501
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:49,330
Age isn't the only factor for dating.

502
00:18:49,622 --> 00:18:51,810
Love is an unreasonable urge
of falling with someone.

503
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,770
Anyway, I like Apple.

504
00:18:56,355 --> 00:18:57,480
I'll continue with the queue.

505
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,190
- Sure. Call me when it's our turn.
- Okay.

506
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,130
Lin Fengyun.

507
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,740
No wonder you look so spirited lately.

508
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,020
So, you were playing dirty, huh?

509
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,700
What are you saying?

510
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,260
It's okay for men to date younger girls,

511
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,240
but I'm playing dirty
when I'm dating younger boys?

512
00:19:10,244 --> 00:19:11,090
I realize that you...

513
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,810
You have a frown on your face.

514
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,000
What's the matter?

515
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,500
It's because of my mother-in-law.

516
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,610
She's already in Heaven.

517
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,980
Why are you still fretting over her?

518
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,990
To put it more accurately,
it's my father-in-law.

519
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,940
He's so pessimistic.

520
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,260
I suspect that he has depression.

521
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:29,940
I'm getting depressed myself.

522
00:19:30,288 --> 00:19:31,940
If so, you have to find
a partner for him.

523
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,180
Love is compulsory for humans.

524
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,490
I know you can't find a new one.

525
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,133
But he can since his partner is dead.

526
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:38,980
Besides, this is for your own good.

527
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,460
Just look at the kindergarten teachers.

528
00:19:41,466 --> 00:19:42,969
They jump around happily every day.

529
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,030
But when you look at
the family members of patients,

530
00:19:45,044 --> 00:19:45,990
they all look depressed.

531
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,020
One's aura is very important, you know?

532
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,700
You always watch Shen Qing

533
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:52,169
go to work and send Duole to school

534
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,310
while you remain at home
and absorb the depressed aura.

535
00:19:54,311 --> 00:19:55,666
- Of course you'll frown.
- Apple.

536
00:19:56,022 --> 00:19:56,740
We got a table.

537
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:57,740
Coming.

538
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,000
I'll be leaving now.

539
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,420
Won't your knees hurt?

540
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,660
Mind your expression, okay?

541
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:18,900
Duole.

542
00:20:19,577 --> 00:20:21,800
Have some orange juice
to replenish your nutrients.

543
00:20:25,155 --> 00:20:27,511
Has anyone in your class
got into a premature relationship?

544
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:28,980
Mom.

545
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,810
Do you know how old we are?

546
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,733
Getting into a relationship
is no big deal.

547
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,610
Not like the meals.

548
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,440
It's never too early
to get into a relationship.

549
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:35,844
Mom.

550
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,420
Stop beating around the bush.

551
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,330
Young kids like you all
know nothing about love.

552
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,810
What is life without love?

553
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,570
A night without the morning!

554
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,222
What does that mean?

555
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,180
A life without love

556
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,644
is just like a night without morning.

557
00:20:51,511 --> 00:20:53,000
That's a quote from Robert Burns.

558
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,460
Who's that?

559
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,460
Do you know why Grandpa was depressed?

560
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,570
It's because he has lost his love.

561
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,020
When Grandpa was watering the plants,

562
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,370
he spoke to the plants more than us.

563
00:21:05,311 --> 00:21:07,600
Did you think Grandpa
was watering the plants with water?

564
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,420
He was watering them with his tears.

565
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,020
Jingmin.

566
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,290
I'll join you sooner or later.

567
00:21:27,311 --> 00:21:28,020
Listen to that.

568
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,740
Did you hear what Dad said just now?

569
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,180
A life without love

570
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,090
is just like a night without morning.

571
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:37,810
What are you saying?

572
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:39,711
That's a quote from Robert Burns.

573
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,260
Your son taught me that.

574
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,530
Shen Qing, listen.

575
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,755
Severe depression might
cause people to commit suicide.

576
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:49,330
After giving it some thought,

577
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,370
as children, we mustn't be selfish.

578
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,466
Why don't we request Mr. Gou
to find a partner for Dad?

579
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,180
Mom's picture is
hanging on the wall.

580
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,755
How could you say things like that?

581
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,400
Do you think Mom will be happy
if she sees Dad like that?

582
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:12,850
Dad,

583
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,570
your tea is ready.

584
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,090
Jingmin.

585
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,460
The flask has been fixed.

586
00:22:29,955 --> 00:22:30,700
It's still usable.

587
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,570
The children made you

588
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,460
your favorite jasmine tea.

589
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,530
It smells great.

590
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,200
Let's try to find one for him.

591
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:53,700
Mr. Gou.

592
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,850
I've arrived at Nanhu Park.

593
00:22:57,422 --> 00:22:59,680
(Nanhu Park, Dusk Sun)
Turn left after the entrance, right?

594
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:00,530
Okay.

595
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,810
Just keep left all the way.

596
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,940
You'll see a pavilion.

597
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,220
When you're there, look for Madam Hong.

598
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,220
Lina,

599
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,610
she's the leader of Dusk Sun.

600
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,330
She's got a whole bunch
of single elderly ladies in her hands.

601
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,940
Lina, heed my advice.

602
00:23:18,044 --> 00:23:19,020
Regarding this matter,

603
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,890
don't tell your father-in-law
about it for now.

604
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,500
When you see someone suitable,

605
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,260
give her a test.

606
00:23:24,355 --> 00:23:26,890
Then find an opportunity
to introduce her to your father-in-law.

607
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,330
Hello.

608
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,550
That's right.

609
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,090
Beauty.

610
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,130
Is this your first time here?

611
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:33,020
Me?

612
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:33,610
Yeah.

613
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,130
Good.

614
00:23:34,444 --> 00:23:35,610
Are you a host on TV shows?

615
00:23:36,577 --> 00:23:38,090
- No.
- I think I've seen you before.

616
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:38,900
That's not true.

617
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:39,500
I'm not.

618
00:23:39,555 --> 00:23:41,020
Lady, let's add each other on WeChat.

619
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,460
No thanks.

620
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:43,740
Come on.

621
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:45,590
- I'll scan your QR code.
- No thanks.

622
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,940
No thanks.

623
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,500
Miss, can I buy you a cup of coffee?

624
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,530
No thanks.

625
00:23:51,577 --> 00:23:52,180
Don't leave.

626
00:23:52,888 --> 00:23:54,530
How many times
have I told you guys this?

627
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,777
Don't add each other in private.

628
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,850
If not,

629
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,660
it'll result in a mess.

630
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,500
Hello.

631
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,770
Excuse me. Are you Madam Hong?

632
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,220
Gou introduced you to me.

633
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:07,090
Have a seat.

634
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,330
Okay.

635
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,090
How old?

636
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:12,850
You mean me?

637
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,050
I'm 45.

638
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,180
Do you have a job?

639
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,330
I don't.

640
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:17,090
So,

641
00:24:17,533 --> 00:24:18,420
do you have a child?

642
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:20,770
I do.

643
00:24:20,977 --> 00:24:21,900
Is it a boy or a girl?

644
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:22,740
A boy.

645
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:23,500
A boy?

646
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:24,660
How old is he?

647
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:25,610
16.

648
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,740
You have a great figure.

649
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,420
Did you contract
any disease before this?

650
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,700
Have you gone for any surgeries before?

651
00:24:33,577 --> 00:24:34,420
I had a C-section.

652
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,530
C-section doesn't count.

653
00:24:36,888 --> 00:24:37,940
Do you know how to cook?

654
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:39,290
I do.

655
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:39,940
Great.

656
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,333
It's great as long as you can cook.

657
00:24:41,377 --> 00:24:42,777
What was your previous occupation?

658
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,610
I was an accountant.

659
00:24:45,488 --> 00:24:46,570
Accountant? That's great.

660
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,330
That's great.

661
00:24:48,466 --> 00:24:49,311
That's great.

662
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:51,050
Even a wallet company
requires accountants.

663
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:51,740
That's right.

664
00:24:51,888 --> 00:24:52,940
Listen. What about this?

665
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:55,050
I'll find a match for you.

666
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,500
He's 65.

667
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,530
He's already retired. He's a...

668
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,370
He was a director.

669
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,220
65? A director?

670
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,260
What does that mean?

671
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:05,900
45 plus 20. That's the formula.

672
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:09,220
Madam Hong, I think Qi Zhongguo
is a great fit for her.

673
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:10,980
You shouldn't join the group.

He's only 60.

676

Isn't that great?

677
00:25:14,422 --> 00:25:15,460
He's a great fit for you.

678
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,555
I'm not the one looking for partner.

It's my father-in-law.

680
00:25:19,733 --> 00:25:21,460
His father-in-law
is getting a new partner!

681
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:22,810
Okay.

682
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,050
Okay.

683
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,940
List out his background.

684
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,900
I'll find a match for him.

685
00:25:28,977 --> 00:25:29,800
A five-star partner.

686
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,220
A professor? That's great!

687
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,130
I admire intellectuals the most.

You see, my father-in-law likes...

689
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,900
I have a question.

690
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,810
Will my children receive
any preferential treatment

691
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:46,790
if they get into the Normal University?

692
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,220
My youngest son will take
the NCEE this year.

693
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,500
Listen,

694
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,220
if he does it, I'll marry him anytime.

695
00:25:53,777 --> 00:25:54,770
I'm very straightforward.

696
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:55,900
You can tell, right?

697
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:57,500
I can tell.

698
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,460
I'm retired at the bureau level.

699
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,590
I'm continuing my contributions
even after retirement.

700
00:26:03,644 --> 00:26:04,500
I earn two wages.

701
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:05,660
You're amazing.

702
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,090
I've always been very busy.

703
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,740
I go on business trips often.

704
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,220
Can your father-in-law drive?

705
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,130
He can't.

706
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,260
Can he cook, then?

707
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,020
He can't either.

708
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:14,940
This is interesting.

709
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,200
Why is he attending a blind date
when he has no skills?

710
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,660
He's here to find a caretaker, huh?

711
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,420
What a joke.

712
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:20,930
Madam, you...

713
00:26:20,933 --> 00:26:21,555
Goodbye.

714
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,220
This is ridiculous.

715
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,370
But I can cook.

716
00:26:31,822 --> 00:26:33,222

00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,420
By the way,

750
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,130
listen up.

751
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,980
I'm blessed by the heavens indeed.

752
00:28:31,022 --> 00:28:32,600
You didn't manage to hide it from me.

753
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,660
Peng Yulan is my best friend.

754
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,610
We were partners in square dancing,

755
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:37,940
you know?

756
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:39,180
You see,

757
00:28:39,888 --> 00:28:41,370
she's been divorced for many years.

758
00:28:41,644 --> 00:28:42,770
She wants to find a partner.

759
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,220
She went for online blind dates lately.

760
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,090
However,

761
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,190
she was afraid
that she couldn't deal with them.

762
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,220
She left her phone with me

763
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,700
so that I could help her out.

764
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:53,370
You're pretty busy, aren't you?

765
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,810
That's why I told you

766
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:57,290
not to find a partner for
your father-in-law when he's that old.

767
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,260
All those old women

768
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:59,610
are too intelligent for him.

769
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,700
They're better at calculating money
than elite accountants.

770
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,220
They'll acquire the marriage certificate first.
Then their title deed.

771
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,050
Liu Lina, listen.

772
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,770
You have to protect

773
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,770
the old man's property

774
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:11,940
for Duole's sake.

775
00:29:12,688 --> 00:29:14,330
Not everyone is after a house, you know?

776
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,330
What else are they after, then?

777
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:18,090
Do you think they're trying to help

778
00:29:18,311 --> 00:29:20,177
your father-in-law
to cure his depression?

779
00:29:20,288 --> 00:29:21,800
Do you think they're Norman Bethune?

780
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,530
You have to teach your child

781
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,420
that the house and the assets

782
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,900
are only acquired after much effort.

783
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,777
Tell him that he shouldn't
get a new grandma.

784
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:31,570
Mom.

785
00:29:45,444 --> 00:29:46,622
Regarding Dad's affair,

786
00:29:46,977 --> 00:29:48,610
can you not let your mother intervene?

787
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,770
My mother did so out of kind intentions.

788
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,570
She's just worried for nothing.

789
00:29:56,311 --> 00:29:58,460
Don't take the pickled radish
made by her, then.

790
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,660
You...

791
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:10,460
Hello?

792
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,700
Duole, you can have it.

793
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,155
You couldn't get through our landline?

794
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,980
You see, it might be
an issue with the circuit.

795
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:17,660
Mid-Autumn Festival, huh?

796
00:30:18,088 --> 00:30:19,330
Okay. I'll tell my dad about it.

797
00:30:20,733 --> 00:30:23,360
Normal University is holding an event
for the Mid-Autumn Festival.

798
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,330
Why don't you attend it with Dad?

799
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,900
Maybe he'll find
a suitable partner there.

800
00:30:30,422 --> 00:30:32,577
The people there are his colleagues,
whom he knows well.

801
00:30:32,577 --> 00:30:34,222
It's better than
your stupid blind dates.

802
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,770
My stupid blind dates?

803
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,420
Fine.

804
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,050
I'm incompetent.
My mother is incompetent.

805
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,300
My entire family is incompetent.

806
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,777
You can do it if you're that competent.

807
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,090
I'll do it.

808
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:45,980
Whose side are you on?

809
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,260
Mom!

810
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,130
Whose side are you on?

811
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:48,500
Mom!

812
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,400
Whose side are you on?

813
00:30:49,444 --> 00:30:50,644
All of us are on the same side.

814
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,260
Mom,

815
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,050
I call this, "One World, One Dream."

816
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,500
Look at how wise my son is.

817
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,290
Stop being a smart alec.

818
00:30:59,370 --> 00:30:59,900
Here, Mom.

819
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:01,980
I have no appetite.

820
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,250
It's all because of your father.

821
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:07,900
Dad, talk to me.

822
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:09,810
I'm not going.

823
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,980
It's bad for you
to stay at home all day long.

824
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,529
You should go out and take a breather.

825
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:16,866
I've done the thinking for you.

826
00:31:16,866 --> 00:31:18,420
Just recite "Prelude to Water Melody."

827
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,700
It's a piece of cake for you.

828
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:21,740
Grandpa,

829
00:31:22,244 --> 00:31:23,610
the Mid-Autumn Poetry Festival

830
00:31:23,888 --> 00:31:24,850
sounds like a cool event.

831
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,530
Please show me around.

832
00:31:27,266 --> 00:31:28,370
I'll record a video for you.

833
00:31:28,688 --> 00:31:29,900
I'll post it on the Internet.

834
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:33,020
The title will be "Professor Shen
Reciting Ancient Poetry."

835
00:31:33,288 --> 00:31:35,066
I'm sure you'll be more popular
than Mr. Gou.

836
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,909
Yeah. Their international school

837
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:39,111
is particularly lacking
in traditional cultural education.

838
00:31:39,111 --> 00:31:40,180
Let him bask in it.

839
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:40,777
That's right.

840
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,090
Please take me there.

841
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,090
Alright.

842
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,370
Tell them this.

843
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,020
I'm going to recite the poem I wrote.

844
00:31:53,644 --> 00:31:55,333
You can recite whatever you like.

845
00:31:58,554 --> 00:32:01,820
(Bo'ai Building)

846
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:02,500
Here you are.

847
00:32:02,577 --> 00:32:02,980
Grandpa,

848
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:04,370
say hello.

849
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,420
Have a seat.

850
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:16,770
Shen,

851
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,420
you're next.

852
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,180
Okay.

853
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:20,530
Grandpa!

854
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,220
Our next program is a poem recital.

855
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,370
Our performer is Shen Zhuoran.

856
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,530
Everyone knows

857
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,810
that Ms. Jingmin, Shen's dearly beloved,

858
00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:36,290
had passed away last year.

859
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,850
I suppose Shen came today

860
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,900
to bid farewell to her

861
00:32:40,155 --> 00:32:42,000
- and begin a new journey.
- You look cool.

862
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,266
You can do it.

863
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,700
Give him a big hand.

864
00:32:53,133 --> 00:32:54,090
Thank you, everyone.

865
00:32:55,088 --> 00:32:56,330
Today's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

866
00:32:57,155 --> 00:32:58,330
I shall cater to the occasion

867
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,850
and recite

868
00:33:00,155 --> 00:33:01,290
"Prelude to Water Melody,"

869
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,980
written by Su Shi.

870
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,530
Mr. Shen is so cool.

871
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,660
He's such a gentleman.

872
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:08,660
Yeah.

873
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,900
When did the bright moon first appear?

874
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,220
Wine-cup in hand, I ask the blue sky.

875
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:20,900
I do not know what time of year

876
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,900
it would be tonight
in the palace on high.

877
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,530
Riding the wind, there I would fly,

878
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,330
but I'm afraid
the crystalline palace would be

879
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:34,130
too high and too cold for me.

880
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,090
I rise and dance,

881
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:41,740
with my shadow I play.

882
00:33:43,244 --> 00:33:45,044
Against man,
she should not have any spite.

883
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,660
Why then when people part
is she oft full and bright?

884
00:33:48,955 --> 00:33:51,290
Men have sorrow and joy,
they part and meet again;

885
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,700
The moon may be bright or dim,
and she may wax or wane.

886
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,130
There has been nothing perfect
since olden days.

887
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,460
So let us wish that man
live as long as he can.

888
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:07,330
Though miles apart,
we'll share the beauty she displays.

889
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,420
After reciting a poem from Su Shi,

890
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,860
I also wish to recite

891
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,090
a poem that I had written lately.

892
00:34:22,844 --> 00:34:23,844
It's called "Tombstone."

893
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,940
He's reciting a poem called "Tombstone"
during a festive occasion?

894
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,130
He hasn't gotten over her.

895
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,340
If he does get over her...

896
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,650
Let me send you somewhere far away.

897
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,730
Let me spend every single day

898
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,900
awaiting our reunion.

899
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:41,820
Dear teachers.

900
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,610
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

901
00:34:44,644 --> 00:34:48,080
May the tear-drenched flowers
cover your tombstone.

902
00:34:48,466 --> 00:34:50,500
To entrust my wails
to the sorrowful fall insects

903
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:54,300
as I go through grieving winters.

904
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,250
Why is he doing this?

905
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:55,980
You should stop.

906
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,090
Mr. Xu,

907
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:58,533
let's proceed with the next program.

908
00:34:58,622 --> 00:34:59,130
Precisely.

909
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:00,900
On the tombstone,

910
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,780
your name

911
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,420
is in black.

912
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,420
While mine

913
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,780
is in red.

914
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:19,130
Grandpa.

915
00:35:19,533 --> 00:35:21,000
- But from now on...
- Grandpa.

916
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:28,250
- ♪The moon on the 15th♪
- Grandpa.

917
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,090
I'm not done reciting it yet.

918
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:33,690
♪Has risen to the sky♪

919
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,210
Grandpa, you should come down.

920
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,690
Duole, help your grandfather down.

921
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,130
Make him stop. Hurry.

922
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:44,780
Excellent!

923
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:53,300
♪I await the beautiful ladies♪

924
00:35:54,844 --> 00:35:55,900
Grandpa, are you okay?

925
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:01,730
♪Why haven't you arrived yet?♪

926
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:02,820
Excellent!

927
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,530
Seems like the human emotions

928
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,780
are not interconnected.

929
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,340
Grandpa!

930
00:36:16,823 --> 00:36:19,350
(Emergency)

931
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:20,300
Shen Qing.

932
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,730
Head back with Duole.

933
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:25,090
You two have to work
and go to school tomorrow.

934
00:36:25,177 --> 00:36:26,377
Don't let this affect you two.

935
00:36:26,711 --> 00:36:28,550
Your father's condition
has been stabilized.

936
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:30,130
Lina and I will look after him.

937
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:32,780
Mom, Dad is hospitalized.
How could I leave?

938
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,400
- Enough. Just go.
- It'll be fine.

939
00:36:34,422 --> 00:36:35,177
Just listen to Mom.

940
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,020
Both of us look after him every time.

941
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,220
- Why are you worried?
- Yeah.

942
00:36:38,222 --> 00:36:39,155
Hurry. Just head back.

943
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,466
Please look after him, then.

944
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,610
Yeah, yeah.

945
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,420
Duole, go back.

946
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,460
It'll be fine.

947
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,170
Alright.

948
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,530
Take care.

949
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:51,980
Look.

950
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:55,777
You reprimanded me and stopped me
to find a partner for him.

951
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,250
He's consumed by grief.

952
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,440
He even fainted because of it.

953
00:36:58,444 --> 00:37:00,170
I didn't stop you from doing it.

954
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,250
Go ahead, then.

955
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:02,610
You forbade me from doing it.

956
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,780
But you need to find someone
suitable for him.

957
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:05,900
Fine.

958
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,500
I'll stay out of this.

959
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,570
Go and find a partner for him, then.

960
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,755
How did he faint and
get hospitalized just like that?

961
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:13,780
One of them had just passed away.

962
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,244
Don't tell me it'll happen again...

963
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:18,111
I forgot to bring the detergent...

964
00:37:18,177 --> 00:37:19,780
Go buy a bag from the convenience store.

965
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,780
We have them at home.

966
00:37:21,844 --> 00:37:23,020
You shouldn't bring them here.

967
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,260
The one at home is...

968
00:37:24,266 --> 00:37:25,460
Look at all the laundry we have.

969
00:37:25,466 --> 00:37:26,730
How is one bag enough?

970
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,250
Fine, fine.

971
00:37:54,266 --> 00:37:55,050
Professor Shen.

972
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,250
Your reserved shot is quite good.

973
00:37:58,822 --> 00:38:00,888
The osmanthus flowers
in the garden are blooming.

974
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,170
I'll open the window for you later.

975
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,340
This way, you can smell them.

976
00:38:07,487 --> 00:38:10,050
(Head Nurse, Lian Yilian)

977
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,900
Single sisters, take note.

978
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,090
Single sisters, take note.

979
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,940
After this weekend's dance practice,

980
00:38:48,977 --> 00:38:50,020
you guys should stay back.

981
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,050
I have something good for you all.

982
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:55,860
Wait.

983
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,940
I have a high-quality
elderly gentleman on hand.

984
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,420
He's 70 this year.

985
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,300
He was a professor before he retired.

986
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,860
His wife passed away some time ago.

987
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,690
We're looking for
someone suitable for him.

988
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:12,466
We have to keep the good stuff
among ourselves, right?

989
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:14,777
Sisters, this is your chance!

990
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:16,860
What?

991
00:39:16,866 --> 00:39:17,900
We ran out of tea leaves.

992
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,500
Yeah, yeah.

993
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:22,020
Can you stop drinking that much tea?

994
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:23,730
Your pension fund isn't that much.

995
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,640
It's not even enough
to cover your tea expenses.

996
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,511
Register my name!

997
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:31,170
Me too.

998
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:32,500
Me too.

999
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,420
Me too.

1000
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:35,090
Strange.

1001
00:39:35,222 --> 00:39:36,730
Why is everyone registering their names?

1002
00:39:36,733 --> 00:39:38,290
That's right. Old men are quite popular.

1003
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,860
I mean the kind of old men
who are cultured

1004
00:39:41,866 --> 00:39:43,980
and have a high pension fund.

1005
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,650
Old men like you

1006
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:46,570
won't do.

1007
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,650
Register my name!

1008
00:39:48,888 --> 00:39:49,650
Register my name!

1009
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:50,511
Give me my tea leaves.

1010
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:51,500
Register my name!

1011
00:39:52,311 --> 00:39:53,422
I'll buy them tomorrow.

1012
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,820
Me too!

1013
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,610
I'll register all of your names.

1014
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:04,900
Professor Shen,

1015
00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:07,880
sorry for the interruption.

1016
00:40:07,888 --> 00:40:08,444
Head Nurse.

1017
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,570
Sorry for the trouble I've caused.

1018
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:13,090
Not at all. This is my job.

1019
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,250
You're still working at this late hour?

1020
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,400
I'm working the night shift
on my friend's behalf.

1021
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,250
It ends at 12 A.M.

1022
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,088
You can only get off work at 12 A.M.?

1023
00:40:20,222 --> 00:40:22,050
If so, how can you
look after your family?

1024
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,900
My son is almost 20.

1025
00:40:27,222 --> 00:40:28,170
He's that old now?

1026
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:28,420
Yes.

1027
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:30,650
He could cook noodles and steamed buns

1028
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:31,680
when he was in 1st Grade.

1029
00:40:31,688 --> 00:40:32,955
I didn't need to worry about him.

1030
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,730
He learned how to cook
when he was in 1st Grade?

1031
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:39,020
But he was still a child.

1032
00:40:40,155 --> 00:40:41,933
Was there no one at home
to take care of him?

1033
00:40:42,177 --> 00:40:43,511
I got divorced when I was young.

1034
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,170
I raised him up myself.

1035
00:40:47,066 --> 00:40:48,866
A mother becomes strong
for her child indeed.

1036
00:40:49,377 --> 00:40:51,666
If only every man
were like you, Professor Shen.

1037
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:55,300
The most difficult period was

1038
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,650
when my child was sick

1039
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,210
when I was working,

1040
00:40:58,933 --> 00:41:00,666
when the patients complained about me,

1041
00:41:01,822 --> 00:41:04,070
and when my superiors thought
I was terrible at my job.

1042
00:41:04,133 --> 00:41:05,170
It was quite a dilemma.

1043
00:41:06,711 --> 00:41:07,755
I'm sure it was difficult.

1044
00:41:09,444 --> 00:41:10,780
Luckily, it's all in the past.

1045
00:41:20,733 --> 00:41:21,666
You're doing good.

1046
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,130
Difficulties aren't
insurmountable for me.

1047
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,940
They just come knocking
from time to time.

1048
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,090
But to me,

1049
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,610
since I can't avoid them,
I should face them.

1050
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,730
It doesn't matter how slow I go
as long as I keep going.

1051
00:41:33,733 --> 00:41:34,644
You're so strong.

1052
00:41:35,177 --> 00:41:37,066
I always thought
that I was strong as well.

1053
00:41:38,777 --> 00:41:39,520
You're doing good.

1054
00:41:40,066 --> 00:41:42,380
Your systolic pressure is 130,
your diastolic pressure is 90.

1055
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:42,730
Okay.

1056
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,460
- Thank you.
- Your surgery is tomorrow.

1057
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,250
Rest well tonight.

1058
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:51,730
Can you read them
when the handwriting is that tiny?

1059
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,980
This is my wife's note.

1060
00:41:54,288 --> 00:41:56,088
She likes
small regular script handwriting.

1061
00:41:56,422 --> 00:41:57,733
She said it was elegant.

1062
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,300
That's nice.

1063
00:42:00,622 --> 00:42:02,555
Both you and your wife
are cultured individuals.

1064
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,650
She passed away.

1065
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,940
Today's the 447th day of her passing.

1066
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,690
Sorry about that.

1067
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:13,460
It's fine.

1068
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:15,500
Actually,

1069
00:42:15,711 --> 00:42:17,300
I wish to talk about it too sometimes.

1070
00:42:18,133 --> 00:42:19,250
But the children at home

1071
00:42:19,844 --> 00:42:21,250
weren't willing to bring it up.

1072
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:23,780
They were afraid that I might be upset.

1073
00:42:24,511 --> 00:42:25,730
They don't understand at all.

1074
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,050
Sometimes, grief is just like

1075
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:29,500
flowing water.

1076
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,250
It cannot be stopped.

1077
00:42:31,644 --> 00:42:33,577
The more you try to stop it,
the more it'll flow.

1078
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,340
Indeed.

1079
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,900
They wanted me to recite poems

1080
00:42:39,022 --> 00:42:41,000
for the academy's
Mid-Autumn Festival celebration.

1081
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,340
When I was reciting the poem

1082
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,420
I wrote for my late wife,

1083
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,210
the other performers
rushed to the stage to sing.

1084
00:42:47,755 --> 00:42:50,244
I know that they were trying
to kick me out of the stage.

1085
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:52,250
Therefore, no one understands my grief.

1086
00:42:52,666 --> 00:42:55,422
No one was willing to listen to
the poem I wrote for my late wife.

1087
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,210
Can you please recite it for me?
