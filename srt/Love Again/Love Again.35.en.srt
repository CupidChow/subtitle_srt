That's it, right?

00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,390
Yes, of course.

6
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,950
I have to give you a huge thumbs-up.

7
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,720
Ms. Lv Yuan,

8
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,400
you're doing

9
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,120
something meaningful again.

10
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,040
Of course.

11
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,350
Let me tell you this.

12
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,550
After you pass away,

13
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,280
(Memorial Forest of Donors in Nanjing)
you'll be resting in this forest.

14
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,110
But your eyes

15
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,550
still see,

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,240
- and your heart still beats.
- Right.

17
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,230
How incredible is that?

18
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,790
I don't believe in

19
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,160
reincarnation stuff.

22
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,880
No, I don't want that.

23
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,550
I want to live in the moment.

24
00:02:26,644 --> 00:02:28,155
I want my death to be meaningful.

Ms. Lv Yuan,

26
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,670
I have to give you

27
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,480
a big thumbs-up, too.

28
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,960

Hello, Mr. Zhang?

Ms. Le,

53
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,133
I'm very sorry to tell you this.

54
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,240
It's been a while,

55
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,640
and you hadn't confirmed

56
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,240
the plot next to your parents was sold.

57
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,840
It's sold?

58
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,950
Guess I'm not fated for that.

59
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,280
It's all right.

60
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,680
Thank you.

61
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,950
Do you know who bought it?

62
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,880
I'll look it up

63
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:53,990
and let you know.

64
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,510
Sure, thank you.

65
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,790

70
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,510
What's it that you wanted to tell me?

(Body Donor Registration Certificate)

72
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,320
So you forfeit?

73
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,000
You caught me.

74
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,600
Lately,

75
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,320
I keep thinking of my father.

76
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,200
Before he passed,

77
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,240
all he thought about was enduring.

78
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,080
The word "endure"

79
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,800
has been ingrained in me.

80
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,320
But the world has changed,

81
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,430
hasn't it?

82
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,190

83
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,880
the life they want,

00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,280
including

85
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,200
their own funeral.

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,200
Instead of having children

87
00:05:29,355 --> 00:05:31,240
burn paper offerings
and pay respect to me

88
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,350
during Qingming Festival,

89
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,560
why not leave something useful behind

90
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,640
for the world?

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,590
You made a noble choice.

92
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,560
I respect that.

93
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,480
I mean it.

94
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,640
Won't you resent me?

95
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,830
I did while I was waiting for you.

96
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,510
But after hearing what you said,

97
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,240
I don't anymore.

98
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,670
Thank you.

99
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,880
Thank you for saying that.

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,120
Gou's passing

101
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,390
hit me hard.

102
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,560
He was happier than me

103
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,000
in his whole life.

104
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,520
He told me

105
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,440
to win you back from Li Heibao.

106
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,200
I told him it depends on fate
when it comes to love.

107
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,310
You know what he said?

108
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,800
He said, "You're already in your
seventies and still waiting for fate.

109
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,560
The Buddha would roll his eyes."

110
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,240
Gou was an interesting guy.

111
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,080
Right. He also told me

112
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,200
that the elderly relationship

113
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,950
is a countdown.

114
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,560
You have to seize the day.

115
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,990
Shuishan.

116
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,400
I, Shen Zhuoran,

117
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,070
am 70 years old now.

118
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,590
A ripe old age.

119
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,800
"Even dusk

120
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,830
can paint the sky red."

121
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,470
Don't hesitate anymore.

122
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,880
Marry me.

123
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,560
Are you proposing?

124
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,440
You're 70,

125
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,350
while I'm

126
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,230
nearly 60.

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,920
I never imagined

128
00:07:41,955 --> 00:07:43,750
someone would propose to me
at this age.

129
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,510
Mr. Shen,

130
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,110
you should do it properly.

131
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,680
Do you have a ring?

132
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,590
Let's buy one.

133
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,000
Are you going to kneel?

134
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,160
My knees won't make it.

135
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,080
You must cherish me.

136
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,350
Let's welcome

137
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,630
our new friend in
Fashion Design Class 3, Liu Lina.

138
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,120
Dear Duole,

139
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,400
congratulations.

140
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,000
I did it!

141
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,230
I did it!

142
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,440
I did it!

143
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,870
You finally got your admission letter!

144
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,870
Send it to them.

145
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,750
Tell them the good news!

146
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,360
Quick. Take a photo.

147
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,670
GCFMA.

148
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,920
Liu, look at this.

149
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,750
The admission letter

150
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
from a foreign university

151
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,160
looks like this.

152
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,630
Look.

153
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,550
Our Duole

154
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
is amazing.

155
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,920
Of course,

156
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,280
the eldest grandson of the Liu family
is talented.

157
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,190
Liu,

158
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,200
I don't want to be buried back home
with you

159
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,680
because

160
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,200
I want you to stay in Nanjing with me.

161
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,160
Let's have a columbarium niche.

162
00:10:18,644 --> 00:10:19,920
It's like an apartment house.

163
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,800
It's pretty good.

164
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,280
Yes, it is.

165
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,670
Liu,

166
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,830
I've been rough with you
for the past decades.

167
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,710
But deep down, I care about you.

168
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,480
Think about it.

169
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,040
I've always defended you, right?

170
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,400
Remember

171
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,240
that one time?

172
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,444
Your supervisor accused you
of stealing steel pipes,

173
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:02,200
and then I went and fought him.

174
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,470
He ended up

175
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,560
apologizing to you.

176
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,240
Right.

177
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,240
Without you,

178
00:11:11,711 --> 00:11:13,244
maybe I would've jumped into the river

179
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,470
when I was younger.

180
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,120
Baoqin.

181
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,710
I've thought it through.

182
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,110
I can just be buried anywhere.

183
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,950
When I die,

184
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,950
bury me

185
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,520
wherever you want.

186
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,670
Maybe

187
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,440
under the tree by the river
where you always go fishing.

188
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,590
That sounds good to me.

189
00:11:59,644 --> 00:12:00,920
The chicken wings are ready.

190
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,680
I'll check on it.

191
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,280
Hello?

192
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,550
Liu Dong,

193
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,040
I've made up my mind.

194
00:12:18,466 --> 00:12:20,288
I'm not buying a burial plot
in the hometown.

195
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,800
When I die,

196
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,470
bury me under the tree by the river.

197
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,360
Please

198
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,040
tell great-grandpa for me.

199
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,590
Tell him

200
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,880
that I, Liu Debao,

201
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,590
want to take a leave.

202
00:12:50,377 --> 00:12:52,422
Tuition alone is
over a few hundred thousand.

203
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,822
What about his living expenses?

204
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,270
Didn't Dad cover part of it?

205
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,088
I'll try to figure something out
for the rest.

206
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,870
We can't take your dad's money.

207
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,430
Lina.

208
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,630
Mom.

209
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,080
- Mom.
- Mom, Dad.

210
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,960
Why are you here at this hour?

211
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,630
- Didn't you call me
- Have a seat.

212
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,590
and say Duole's going to study abroad?

213
00:13:14,266 --> 00:13:15,666
- Please sit.
- Your dad and I think

214
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,222
we should visit you.

215
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,790
I roasted some chicken wings for Duole.

216
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,080
This is his favorite.

217
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,510
Thank you, Mom.

218
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,040
He's in study hall right now.

219
00:13:24,288 --> 00:13:25,911
I'll give it to them when he gets home.

220
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,120
Here.

221
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:32,590
This is all the money your dad and I
have saved over the years.

222
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,790
It's for Duole's tuition.

223
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,577
No, no.

224
00:13:35,622 --> 00:13:37,000
You need this money for yourselves.

225
00:13:37,022 --> 00:13:39,111
We have our pensions
and health insurance.

226
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,360
That's enough for us.

227
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,630
We're your parents.

228
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,070
Your problems

229
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,990
are our problems, too.

230
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,040
Right.

231
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,080
The password is Duole's birthday.

232
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,030
- All right, take it.
- Mom.

233
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,960
Liu, let's leave.

234
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,977
- You...
- Take this back.

235
00:13:54,977 --> 00:13:56,222
You can't leave unless you do.

236
00:13:56,222 --> 00:13:57,480
What's wrong with you, kid?

237
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,560
Kid? I'm over forty.

238
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,320
My kid is almost grown.

239
00:14:02,844 --> 00:14:05,000
Didn't you say you'd stay out
of our family business?

240
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,730
Shen Qing and I
will figure it out ourselves.

241
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:08,511
Right, Mom, we'll get it handled.

242
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,000
- Liu.
- How about this?

243
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,400
Hold onto this savings book

244
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,110
for us.

245
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,550
We're old.

246
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,230
We might get scammed.

247
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,800
Yes, there are scams everywhere
these days.

248
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,400
We can't keep up.

249
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,830
We'll feel safer if you keep it for us.

250
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,960
Liu, let's go.

251
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,880
Let's go.

252
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,280
Mom.

253
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,440
Take care.

254
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,950
I'll walk them out.

255
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,670
Now this column.

256
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:40,880
Sure.

257
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,800
Starts from here.

258
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,390
Le Yuebai.

259
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:45,950
My aunt.

260
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:48,800
"All I can see is the autumn moon

261
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
glowing faintly
in the middle of the lake."

262
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,750
My grandpa

263
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,830
was very knowledgeable.

264
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:55,750
Like you.

265
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,030
I could never compare.

266
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,630
I'm heading back to Suzhou tomorrow

267
00:16:03,911 --> 00:16:05,320
to visit my parent's graves

268
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,190
and tell them

269
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,470
about our wedding.

270
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,670
I can't join you.

271
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,430
I've booked time at the library.

272
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,280
Gou's books

273
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,670
need to go through

274
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,080
some donation paperwork.

275
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,160
No worries.

276
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,350
I'll go myself.

277
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,830
Thank you.

278
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,630
Push harder.

279
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,630
Harder.

280
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,080
Harder.

281
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,840
Right. Harder.

282
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,040
Good. Push harder.

283
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,840
Harder.

284
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,880
Harder.

285
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:46,670
Good. Harder.

286
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,510
Very well.

287
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,400
Mom,

288
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,555
Xibei is screaming so loud.

289
00:16:58,577 --> 00:16:59,390
It must hurt a lot.

290
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,630
Childbirth always hurts.

291
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,430
Every woman goes through this.

292
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,840
The baby is expected
to weigh about four kilograms.

293
00:17:05,844 --> 00:17:07,800
Big babies take longer.

294
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,000
Family of Li Xibei.

295
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,520
How is she, doctor?

296
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:15,680
Labor is progressing slowly.

297
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,769
She's becoming exhausted.

298
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,720
The amniotic fluid is starting
to get contaminated.

299
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,440
We suggest switching to a C-section.
Please sign the consent form.

300
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,230
Switch to C-section?

301
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,150
However, the recovery
would take a long time

302
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,070
and could delay plans
for the second child.

303
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,880
We had someone check her pulse.

304
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,350
The first child would be a girl,
so we have to try for a second.

305
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,960
Xibei's not afraid of pain.

306
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,200
She tore her Achilles tendon
in the 800-meter race,

307
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,355
and she still hopped to the finish line
with one leg.

308
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:47,150
But she's crying like that now.

309
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,190
It must be unbearable.

310
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,880
Do it.

311
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,640
Mom.

312
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,430
I'll sign.

313
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,670
And you are?

314
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,040
I'm Li Xibei's dad.

315
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,360
Sure.

316
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,740
(Li Heibao, father and daughter)

317
00:18:09,311 --> 00:18:10,870
Your dad agreed to the C-section.

318
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,190
Family of Li Xibei,

319
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,720
the baby is out.

320
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,990
A boy or a girl?

321
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,720
A girl, 4,100 grams.

322
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,830
Little sweetheart.

323
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,680
Li,

324
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,550
a daughter is pretty good, right?

325
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,470
Yes.

326
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,510
So beautiful.

327
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,390
I'm Grandma.

328
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,590
How's the mother?

329
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,110
She's being stitched up.

330
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,600
- Baby.
- She'll be out soon.

331
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,190
All right.

332
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,240
She looks like you when you were little.

333
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,350
I'm Grandma.

334
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,030
Xibei.

335
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,920
Dad.

336
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,990
Well done.

337
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,510
Does it still hurt?

338
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,190
It hurts.

339
00:19:22,222 --> 00:19:23,400
You've been through a lot.

340
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,190
You're incredible.

341
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,740
(Inpatient Department)

342
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,480
She's yawning.

343
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,240
Her hair is black and thick.

344
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,830
Just like your mom when she was little.

345
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,670
She's going to be a beauty.

346
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,510
Come.

347
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,480
Take some rest.

348
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,350
Dad.

349
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,270
Look.

350
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
She reacts when she hears your voice.

351
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,160
Dad.

352
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,800
I'm sorry.

353
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,910
Silly girl.

354
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,750
I mean it.

355
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,880
Sorry.

356
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,360
Don't be silly.

357
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,280
Mother's Glutinous Rice Balls Shop.

358
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:51,720
(Homemade Glutinous Rice Balls Shop)
The line is long.

359
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,640
You haven't been back here
for a while, right?

360
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,720
Not really.

361
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,960
It just never feels like enough
every time I come back.

362
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,860
(Li Xibei)

363
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,280
(Ms. Le, I'm a mom now.)

364
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,350
(Suddenly, I understand so much more.)

365
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,670
(So I'd like to say)

366
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,190
(I'm sorry.)

367
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,760
(Congratulations, Xibei.)

368
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,390
(It's okay.)

369
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,240
(I never blamed you.)

370
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:26,660
(Le Shuishan)
(Take care during your recovery.)

371
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,870
(I'm getting married next week.)

372
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:46,780
(Tomb of Late Father, Le Jiangping,
and Late Mother, Gu Meixin)

373
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,710
Dad, Mom,

374
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,910
I'm getting married.

375
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,910
He's Mr. Shen,
I brought him here last time.

376
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,520
He's gentle,

377
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,040
and his family is easy
to get along with.

378
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,830
I feel at peace

379
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,480
when I'm with him.

380
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,560
I have a companion now.

381
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,670
I'm not alone anymore.

382
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,180
(Sold)

383
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,560
The only thing is

384
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,350
he can't be buried with me here.

385
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,870
He chose to donate his body after death.

386
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,430
That's a noble act,

387
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,150
so I support him.

388
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,390
In that case,

389
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,040
we'll have to squeeze in together here.

390
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:41,750
Dad, Mom.

391
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,120
I miss you.

392
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,550
Stick it properly.

393
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,440
Dad,

394
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,040
should we lay the tablecloth now?

395
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,480
Go ahead. It looks good.

396
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,520
Let me help you, Lina.

397
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:07,960
Grandpa, does this look straight?

398
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,880
Very good.

399
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,740
(Wedding)

400
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,866
It looks festive, right?

401
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,440
Dad, this looks a little tight on you.

402
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,430
I've put on some weight.

403
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,440
Dad, that's muscle.

404
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,430
Qing, Dad's got pecs now.

405
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,240
Your workouts are paying off.

406
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,160
Yeah, a little.

407
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,510
They're starting to show.

408
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,620
(Forever Happiness)

409
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,350
We celebrate a joyful occasion.

410
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,550
(Wedding)

411
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,760
Forever happiness.

412
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,520
No matter who's right or wrong,

413
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,390
it's all Shen Qing's fault.

414
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:20,950
Lina.

415
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,760
It was my fault.

416
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,355
On the day
when that happened to Mr. Gou,

417
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,080
I turned on silent mode.

418
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,240
But even if I did see your call,

419
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,110
I wouldn't have answered.

420
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,480
Because I didn't know

421
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,520
what kind of mood you'd be in.

422
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,160
That day,

423
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,640
I was at the airport

424
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,600
seeing Ice off.

425
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,711
She went back to her hometown.

426
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,390
Nothing happened between us.

427
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,190
But I can't lie and say

428
00:25:11,888 --> 00:25:13,888
nothing was really going on
between us.

429
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,750
I'm sorry.

430
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,670
I let you down.

431
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,670
Shen Qing,

432
00:25:39,488 --> 00:25:41,110
after Duole leaves for school abroad,

433
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,630
I want to move out for a while.

434
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,760
We both need some space.

435
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,230
You stay here,

436
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,640
and I'll move out.

437
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,080
All right.

438
00:26:11,888 --> 00:26:14,760
(Le Shuishan and Shen Zhuoran's wedding)
The choir is sitting together.

439
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:18,066
(Le Shuishan and Shen Zhuoran's Wedding)

440
00:26:18,088 --> 00:26:18,960
Look.

441
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,911
- My goodness. You look gorgeous.
- Look at you.

442
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,510
Congratulations.

443
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,560
Thank you.

444
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,240
Gou came to my dream

445
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,350
and told me to catch your bouquet later.

446
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,000
Of course. No problem.

447
00:26:30,177 --> 00:26:31,320
Aim well when you toss it.

448
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,630
Don't miss it.

449
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,880
No problem.

450
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:36,640
Thank you for your red packet.

451
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,670
Shen Qing, hurry. Come.

452
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,444
- Please come in.
- What are you busy with?

453
00:26:40,444 --> 00:26:41,070
Bring her in.

454
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,680
- Come.
- The main table.

455
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,700
- Main table.
- All right.

456
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,040
Dear, you have two candies here.
Please eat to your fill tonight.

457
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,870
Please come this way.

458
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,360
Call me ma'am.

459
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,550
Why?

460
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,666
We'll stick to our own ways.

461
00:26:52,666 --> 00:26:53,630
I'll call you Tian.

462
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,030
You can't do that.

463
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,555
- This is the main table.
- Ms. Tian.

464
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,680
Ms. Tian, come over here.

465
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,600
Let's sit together.

466
00:26:59,644 --> 00:27:02,533
- I'll sit here. My friends are here.
- Sure. Shujing, please take care of her.

467
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:03,400
- Sure.
- Don't worry.

468
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,866
Call her Tian from now on.

469
00:27:04,888 --> 00:27:06,022
- We're all family.
- Sure.

470
00:27:06,044 --> 00:27:07,310
- Go on and do your thing.
- Okay.

471
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:08,280
Shen Dai.

472
00:27:08,511 --> 00:27:10,430
Get two packs of cigarettes
for each table.

473
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:11,640
Two pack each, right?

474
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,230
Yes.

475
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,800
Enjoy yourselves.

476
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,750
Professor Shen.

477
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,960
Yilian.

478
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,960
Thank you.

479
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,444
Thank you for coming to our wedding.

480
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,640
Old sir,

481
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,790
thank you.

482
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,710
I'm not old.

483
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:29,990
I'm only 80.

484
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,110
Sorry, my bad.

485
00:27:32,488 --> 00:27:33,920
You should drink as a penalty.

486
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,070
Of course. I'll drink later.

487
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,710
- I'll take three shots.
- Sure.

488
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:37,590
Dai.

489
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,470
Dai, come.

490
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,529
- Coming.
- Congratulations.

491
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,880
- Come here.
- Ms. Lian, you're here.

492
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,266
Bring Ms. Lian to the main table.

493
00:27:42,266 --> 00:27:43,350
Hello. Please come inside.

494
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,280
Please, old sir.

495
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,320
I'm sorry.

496
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,640
Mom.

497
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,590
Dad.

498
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:49,510
Come.

499
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,510
Ms. Lian.

500
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,177
Dad, stay here
and look after the guests.

501
00:27:53,288 --> 00:27:54,350
Everything is going well.

502
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,280
You're here. Sit here.

503
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,960
Let's sit here.

504
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,040
Look who that is.

505
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,800
Grandpa Shen!

506
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,590
Taotao.

507
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,577
Come, let me carry you.

508
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,360
Let me carry you.

509
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,240
You've gotten heavier.

510
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,590
Good girl. Do you miss me?

511
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,640
I do.

512
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,630
I miss you, too.

513
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:13,070
Mr. Shen, Ms. Le.

514
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:13,960
Happy wedding day.

515
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,070
This is our gift.

516
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,990
Thank you.

517
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,640
Please come inside.

518
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,560
I wish you both

519
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,990
a love as deep as the ocean

520
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,822
and a life as long as the mountain.

521
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,800
The bride looks gorgeous.

522
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,200
Really?

523
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,533
- You're beautiful.
- Shen Qing.

524
00:28:29,577 --> 00:28:30,670
Hurry.

525
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,750
The guests are here.

526
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,120
- Ms. Lv.
- Coming.

527
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,150
Ms. Lv,

528
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,750
I sent you a message earlier

529
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,030
asking where you were.

530
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,480
I didn't see it.

531
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,590
Ms. Lv, you're here.

532
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,750
Hello.

533
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,880
Taotao.

534
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,670
Look who is here?

535
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,920
Ms. Lv.

536
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,960
Sit here.

537
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,520
Lian, hi.

538
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,950
You're here.

539
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,720
This is my husband.

540
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:57,950
Nice to meet you.

541
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,720
Nice to meet you. Please sit.

542
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:05,950
Jiang.

543
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,560
Ms. Peng, it's been a long time.

544
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,880
It's Mr. Jiang.

545
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,800
He's handsome.

546
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,160
Ms. Lian,

547
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,510
did you know

548
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,590
Mr. Shen volunteered
to donate his body?

549
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,480
He's so compassionate.

550
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,440
Really?

551
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,590
Yes.

552
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,760
You're a medical practitioner.

553
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,155
You must understand
how meaningful that is.

554
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,000
Everyone dies,

555
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,840
but

556
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:35,520
people like Mr. Shen

557
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,240
are heroes forever.

558
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,870
Right. I really didn't expect that.

559
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,310
Actually, I've always
admired Professor Shen.

560
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,480
He's a remarkable person.

561
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,080
Truly admirable.

562
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,280
Mister,

563
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,520
do you exercise every day?

564
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:51,266
Do you walk 10,000 steps
every day?

565
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,510
No, I don't.

566
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,920
That's not good.

567
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,630
If you don't move,
you'll lose the ability to move.

568
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,480
Mom, it's a wedding.

569
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,520
Control yourself.

570
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,240
I'm giving good advice.

571
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,488
He's a famous traditional
Chinese medicine physician.

572
00:30:05,488 --> 00:30:06,733
He knows how to stay healthy.

573
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,960
Do I look like

574
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,760
someone

575
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,830
who suffered from late-stage cancer?

576
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,920
I

577
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,350
defied the illness.

578
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,080
I play sports,

579
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,600
sing,

580
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,920
kick shuttlecock,

581
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:26,830
walk 10,000 steps,

582
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,630
fall in love,

583
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,830
and work as a volunteer.

584
00:30:32,155 --> 00:30:33,390
As long as I've been alive,

585
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,830
I shine.

586
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,590
When I die,
I'll light up the whole world.

587
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,560
Lady,

588
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,200
you're incredible.

589
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,120
You flattered me.

590
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,070
You're so passionate.

591
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:45,990
No.

592
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,470
How nice.

593
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,080
He wanted to donate his body?

594
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,800
I don't think I'd do that.

595
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,390
My son would never agree.

596
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,880
When should we go check out

597
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,580
the columbarium niches at the Gongde
Memorial Park of Yuhua Terrace?

598
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,720
Let me think about it.

599
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,080
I'm not planning to buy it now.

600
00:31:11,533 --> 00:31:13,022
Are you thinking about donating, too?

601
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,960
I'm just thinking.

602
00:31:15,222 --> 00:31:17,066
I've still got plenty of time
before I die.

603
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,760
Don't say that here.

604
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,000
Madams, have some candies.

605
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,270
Here you go.

606
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,800
- Second Uncle, have some candies.
- And cigarettes.

607
00:31:26,933 --> 00:31:28,911
Let's enjoy
my father-in-law's good luck.

608
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,400
Shen Qing,

609
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,560
you're lucky.

610
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,430
Your wife is so capable.

611
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,840
Shen Qing,

612
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,520
after Duole leaves for school,

613
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,160
you are still young.

614
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,880
Why not have another child?

615
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,440
We're not young anymore.

616
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,750
That's beyond us.

617
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,880
Right. We finally have some freedom.

618
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,350
We should enjoy it.

619
00:31:54,777 --> 00:31:56,310
We'd like a pack of cigarettes here.

620
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,230
Here you go.

621
00:31:57,244 --> 00:31:58,377
Let's enjoy this good luck.

622
00:31:58,377 --> 00:31:59,120
Come.

623
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,510
Your cigarette.

624
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,080
Bravo!

625
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,755
(Le Shuishan, Shen Zhuoran;
Happy Life is Complete with Love)

626
00:32:10,755 --> 00:32:12,790
Dear friends

627
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,870
and guests,

628
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,990
hello.

629
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,320
Hello.

630
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,440
Hello.

631
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,830
On this vibrant day,

632
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,520
we gather here

633
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,350
to celebrate the wedding

634
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,600
- of a silver-haired couple.
- You look great in a suit.

635
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:26,480
Next...

636
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,720
- You look beautiful.
- Let's give a warm round of applause

637
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,777
to the stars of the day,

638
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,430
the groom, Mr. Shen Zhuoran,

639
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,830
and the bride, Ms. Le Shuishan,

640
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,390
for their grand entrance.

641
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,300
(Le Shuishan, Shen Zhuoran)

642
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,150
A warmer round of applause, please.

643
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,000
Thank you.

644
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:59,590
Just now, the host

645
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,520
called us...

646
00:33:01,311 --> 00:33:03,080
- Silver-haired.
- A silver-haired couple.

647
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,630
He got that wrong.

648
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:05,880
We're still young.

649
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,440
We're not even

650
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,150
130 years old together.

651
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,280
Thank you.

652
00:33:14,755 --> 00:33:15,920
I want to thank my children

653
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,480
for preparing

654
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,920
a grand wedding.

655
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,150
But at our age,

656
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,590
what we care more about is

657
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,590
to have all friends and families
gather together.

658
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,270
Bride, say something.

659
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,840
I...

660
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:38,040
I was afraid I'd forget what to say,

661
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,710
so I wrote them down

662
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,000
to share my feelings.

663
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,150
- It's with me.
- I'll read it.

664
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:50,040
Meeting Mr. Shen

665
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,520
is my blessing.

666
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,440
Mr. Shen

667
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,400
and his family

668
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,670
have been incredibly kind to me.

669
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,630
They've made me feel
the warmth of a home.

670
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,880
I want to say to Mr. Shen...

671
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,540
(Anxin Cemetery Purchase Receipt)

672
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,980
(Buyer: Le Shuishan,
Handled by Li Heibao)

673
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:22,990
Shuishan.

674
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,680
What's going on here?

675
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,280
What is this?

676
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,000
What's happening?

677
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,840
I've been at the hospital

678
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,350
because Xibei
was about to give birth.

679
00:34:48,355 --> 00:34:49,955
I didn't know you were getting married.

680
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,520
She just told me today.

681
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,680
Shen.

682
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,280
I'm sorry.

683
00:34:58,733 --> 00:34:59,990
I need to ask her something.

684
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,590
If I don't,

685
00:35:02,111 --> 00:35:03,666
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

686
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,840
Shen Qing, help Mr. Li take a seat.

687
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,070
- Mr. Li.
- No need.

688
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,760
Shuishan,

689
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,800
think about it.

690
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,670
If you choose Shen,

691
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,440
you'll be companions.

692
00:35:21,155 --> 00:35:22,840
You'll take care of him
for twenty years.

693
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,270
But if you choose me,

694
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,560
we'll be husband and wife.

695
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,920
I'll take care of you for thirty years.

696
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,150
I'm loyal. You know that.

697
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,670
I'll be with you, in life or death.

698
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,920
Will you

699
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,880
go with me?

700
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:22,990
If you think

701
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,590
he's better for you

702
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,270
and want to go with him,

703
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,920
I'll understand.

704
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,000
Ms. Le.

705
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,840
Ms. Le.

706
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,440
Ms. Le, you...

707
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,480
Wait, what?

708
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,790
The wedding is messed up again.

709
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,750
He can't take the bride away like that.

710
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,110
What era are we in now?

711
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,150
I can't believe

712
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,310
someone actually takes the bride away.

713
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,230
Call the police.

714
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,070
This is unfair.

715
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,710
What is this?

716
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:22,911
He messed up the wedding.

717
00:37:22,911 --> 00:37:23,933
This is betrayal.

718
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,310
He's ruined the wedding.

719
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,070
What's going on now?

720
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,840
Mr. Shen.

721
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,630
Dad.

722
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,200
Dad.

723
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,400
I'm okay, Qing.

724
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,310
As you can see,

725
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,840
an accident just happened.

726
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,040
The wedding's off.

727
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,110
But we must enjoy the food

728
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,670
and drinks.

729
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,360
Everyone,

730
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,680
please take a seat.

731
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,230
Enjoy the food

732
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,400
and drinks.

733
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,200
Please be seated.

734
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,110
Careful, Dad.

735
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,360
I'm okay.

736
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,360
I'm okay.

737
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,280
Don't worry.

738
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,440
That's just life.

739
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,480
Everything can happen.

740
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,150
It's impossible

741
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,080
for everything to be in control.

742
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:26,470
I've lived

743
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,510
more than half my life.

744
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,310
I can already see the end.

745
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,040
Throughout my life,

746
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:36,080
I've witnessed death and separation,

747
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,960
earned honors,

748
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,000
and endured many embarrassments.

749
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,270
This one stings the most.

750
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,960
Please sit.

751
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,550
That's how life is.

752
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:02,190
Sometimes, it's only when
you reach a certain age

753
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,190
that you'll truly understand
life is unpredictable.

754

00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,360
you've been given, do you?

757
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,750
Since we're already here,

758
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,960
why not live this life happily,

759
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,360
right?

00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,150
