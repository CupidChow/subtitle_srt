00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,040
=Episode 4=

3
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:44,533
Did someone move into our house?

4
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:47,933
Listen to it.

5
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,159
Can you keep your voice down?

6
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,640
Can you calm down?

7
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,599
I'll tell you about it.

8
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,799
I've been holding this in
for a long time.

9
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:58,719
I was afraid

10
00:01:58,755 --> 00:02:01,040
I couldn't explain it to you
properly over the phone.

11
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,560
So I've been writing messages to you,

12
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,159
you know?

13
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,840
I'm still working on it.

14
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:05,640
Dad,

15
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,360
you're hiding this from me.

16
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,280
Do you still see me as your daughter?

17
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:12,770
Are you taking advantage of the fact
that I'm far away in the U.S.?

18
00:02:12,777 --> 00:02:13,680
How did Shen Dai know?

19
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,400
Did you tell her?

20
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,879
No, I didn't.

21
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,319
Then how did she find out?

22
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,080
This is doomed. Jeez.

23
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,888
(Dad)
Shen Qing, come over.

24
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:27,159
Go ahead.

25
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,879
I don't want to see Ms. Lian.

26
00:02:31,622 --> 00:02:33,710
Just go. You have to face her
sooner or later.

27
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,666
Dad is asking for help now. Go on.

28
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,439
Dad.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,639
Listen.

30
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,439
Hurry up and fix my phone

31
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,680
so that I don't have to answer

32
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,159
any of Shen Dai's calls

33
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:52,680
or messages.

34
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,688
Turn on Silent mode.

35
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,199
No.

36
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,719
I'll turn on Night mode.

37
00:02:57,088 --> 00:02:58,120
I don't know what that is.

38
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,840
Just make sure I don't hear her calls.

39
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:01,133
(Do Not Disturb mode is on)

40
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:01,600
It's done.

41
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,022
- I won't hear it, right?
- No.

42
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,640
(Shen Dai)

43
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,599
Don't answer it. You'll be in trouble.

44
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,759
Here.

45
00:03:14,755 --> 00:03:15,790
- Ms. Lian.
- Eat fruits.

46
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,719
Please eat some.

47
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,000
Apples are fresh.

48
00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:18,470
Come on.

49
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,759
Sit down and have fruits.

50
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,280
Shen Qing,

51
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,960
eat more.

52
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:22,719
Dad,

53
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,520
my mom just left not long ago.

54
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,080
"Wishing a long life together with you"?

55
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,240
"Make a deal with the Death"?

56
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,879
A pack of lies!

57
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,120
Now that a woman has come,

58
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,879
you don't even dare to answer my call.

59
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,520
What do you guys mean?

60
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,080
Your daughter is not happy?

61
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:53,120
Maybe

62
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,400
I should go back.

63
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,520
This is my problem.

64
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,955
I didn't explain it to her properly.

65
00:03:59,022 --> 00:03:59,711
Grandpa.

66
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,639
Grandpa.

67
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,190
It's my...

68
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,360
Aunt Dai is calling you.

69
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,280
She's calling my phone.

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,680
Listen.

71
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,240
No matter how serious the matter is,

72
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,933
let's talk when you come home, okay?

73
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,199
I see it now.

74
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,319
I'll never come back again.

75
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,520
What happened?

76
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:16,800
Nothing.

77
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:17,839
It's nothing.

78
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,200
Aunt Dai left the group chat.

79
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,199
Duole, head home first.

80
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:24,720
I... I...

81
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,240
What...

82
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,439
What's wrong with her?

83
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:28,879
All right.

84
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:29,319
Yes.

85
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,040
Don't be mad.

86
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,279
Dad, calm down.

87
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,839
We'll talk to Shen Dai.

88
00:04:32,844 --> 00:04:34,630
- Yes, I'll talk to her.
- Shen Qing, right?

89
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,600
You guys should talk sense into her.

90
00:04:38,888 --> 00:04:39,950
We'll head home for now.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,460
All right.

92
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:41,759
We're leaving.

93
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:42,319
Go on.

94
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,711
I'm sorry about that.

95
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,279
I think

96
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,560
I should go.

97
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,759
Please hear me out.

98
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,079
It's my problem.

99
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,680
I didn't explain this

100
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,399
to her

101
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,600
properly.

102
00:05:15,955 --> 00:05:17,600
She went overseas at a very young age.

103
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,079
She's spoiled

104
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,120
and has a short fuse.

105
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:22,160
She...

106
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,360
But you see,

107
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,639
children always want the best
for their dad,

108
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:28,720
right?

109
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,959
We should live a good life together,

110
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,160
and she'll come around.

111
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,040
I've put you through this.

112
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,360
I'm sorry.

113
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:43,120
Actually,

114
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,120
it doesn't matter how I feel.

115
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,240
But children's opinion matters a lot.

116
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,920
I'll definitely fix this.

117
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,639
What are you doing?

118
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,399
You can't go now.

119
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm going to hide your shoes.

120
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:51,600
Mom.

121
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,240
You're back, Lina.

122
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,879
You're such a troublemaker.

123
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,920
Are you giving me a hard time
on purpose?

124
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,160
Wait.

125
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,155
Are you actually taking
that woman's side?

126
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,079
Am I your mom,

127
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,959
or is Ms. Lian?

128
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,920
You are. But still,
you can't stir up trouble.

129
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,480
What trouble have I stirred?

130
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,600
You've put the Shen family in hot water

131
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,079
and me in a tough spot.

132
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,519
Why are you fighting again?

133
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:13,360
- No.
- No.

134
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,680
Lina, can't you think?

135
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,959
Right now, only Shen Dai
can deal with Ms. Lian.

136
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,519
If neither your husband nor I
say anything,

137
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,600
everyone will suffer.

138
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,920
I'm doing this for your good.

139
00:07:26,377 --> 00:07:27,160
I don't need that.

140
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:28,749
You don't need that?

141
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,222
But I have to do something for you.

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,279
Use your brain and think.

143
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:35,519
Ms. Lian is

144
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,830
over twenty years younger
than your father-in-law.

145
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
She moved in so quickly

146
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,399
and even with fresh bedsheets ready.

147
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,600
She must be after something.

148
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,920
Something's off about this.

149
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,879
That's why Shen Dai must step in

150
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,560
and nip the threat in the bud.

151
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,000
Mom.

152
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,240
I...

153
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,639
Don't think too badly of her.

154
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,759
Plus, it's useless
for Shen Dai to step in.

155
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:55,629
She's far away.

156
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,980
They had a fight, and she left
the group chat right after.

157
00:07:59,079 --> 00:07:59,639
Seriously?

158
00:07:59,955 --> 00:08:00,800
What are you planning?

159
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,800
I'm thinking that Shen Dai

160
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,680
must step in.

161
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,429
If she does,

162
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,222
your family...

163
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:09,866
Mom, I really wish I could put a zipper
on your mouth

164
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:10,577
and zip it shut.

165
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:11,511
What's wrong with you?

166
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,680
Mom, listen.

167
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,680
Things are a mess right now.

168
00:08:14,755 --> 00:08:15,580
You stirred the pot,

169
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,879
and Shen Qin has pinned

170
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,240
all the blame on me.

171
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
If you really want us to get divorced,

172
00:08:20,888 --> 00:08:22,240
then go ahead and keep this up.

173
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,630
No, I didn't mean that.

174
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,639
Enough talk. Get up.

175
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:26,639
You're sitting on my bag.

176
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,240
I'm off. Dad, I'm leaving.

177
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,560
Eat before you go.

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,919
I'm already full.

179
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,080
Your fan.

180
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,039
That's your daughter.

181
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,960
She's driving me mad.

182
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,039
Ms. Lian,

183
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,200
please come in.

184
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,288
I've made some glutinous rice balls
in sweet soup

185
00:08:54,311 --> 00:08:54,888
for you.

186
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,559
It smells great.

187
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:58,000
Thank you.

188
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,120
Try it.

189
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,840
By the way, this weekend,

190
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,720
your dad and I would like
to invite you over for dinner.

191
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,600
Please bring your parents along.

192
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,440
Okay?

193
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,444
Thank you, Ms. Lian.

194
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,869
My parents are going on
a farm trip this weekend.

195
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,111
They might not be able to make it,
but we'll be there.

196
00:09:15,155 --> 00:09:15,777
All right.

197
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,559
That's good.

198
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:19,039
Well, I'll leave you be.

199
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,279
All right.

200
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,240
Thank you.

201
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,749
Thank you.

202
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,066
I won't bother you any longer.

203
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,080
Um...

204
00:09:27,822 --> 00:09:29,240
Do you think I should tell my mom?

205
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:29,799
I'm afraid...

206
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,559
We're not familiar with her yet.

207
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,039
If your mom says
something inappropriate,

208
00:09:34,066 --> 00:09:35,340
everyone will be uncomfortable.

209
00:09:35,488 --> 00:09:37,200
Shen Qing, what's that supposed to mean?

210
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,800
My mom makes everyone uncomfortable,

211
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,159
but Ms. Lian doesn't?

212
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,360
Fine, I said something stupid.

213
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,000
My bad.

214
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,240
Gou,

215
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,377
don't make plans
for this coming weekend.

216
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,279
Bring Tianzhen to my place

217
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,960
to taste Yilian's cooking.

218
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,720
You'll love it.

219
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:10,440
Come.

220
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,400
You won't be disappointed.

221
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,240
Mom, there's an undercurrent

222
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,240
in the Shen family right now
because of Ms. Lian.

223
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:22,790
It's because of you.

224
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,960
The family dinner isn't going to
be just a meal.

225
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:26,799
Listen,

226
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,600
Dad and you must not come.

227
00:10:28,977 --> 00:10:31,150
I told her you were going on a farm trip
this weekend.

228
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:33,510
I saved you the trouble
of buying a welcome gift.

229
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,022
Granny must be laughing right now.

230
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:40,000
Done, this is the only thing
I called you for.

231
00:10:41,177 --> 00:10:42,555
You can't blame me for that.

232
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,279
Know-it-all.

233
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:45,720
Don't touch it.

234
00:10:46,066 --> 00:10:46,600
I'll clean it.

235
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:48,790
Don't eat too many glutinous rice balls.

236
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,490
They're not easy to digest
in the morning.

237
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:53,399
I'm using the toilet.

238
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,960
Can't you respect my privacy?

239
00:10:55,444 --> 00:10:56,333
Privacy?

240
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,330
You always need privacy
when you're on your phone.

241
00:10:58,377 --> 00:11:00,550
I took care of you
when you had hemorrhoid surgery.

242
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,844
Where was your privacy then?

243
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,360
So annoying.

244
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:05,510
You're talking just like your mom.

245
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,679
Only I can criticize her.
No one else is allowed to.

246
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,279
She gave birth to me, raised me,

247
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,044
and married me off to serve your family,

248
00:11:14,044 --> 00:11:14,840
even with a dowry.

249
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,200
Yet you're badmouthing her.

250
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:17,733
Do you have no conscience?

251
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,240
I was just joking.

252
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,960
Don't be so feisty.

253
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,159
My clothes got wet.

254
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:26,000
Ms. Lian is here, and she's peaceful.

255
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,279
From now on, she can feed you Shens.

256
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,279
Close the door.

257
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,320
Fine. I'll give you privacy.

258
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:37,600
Your dad is pooping.

259
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,360
Do you need a loudspeaker
to announce it?

260
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:41,840
Why are you laughing?

261
00:11:41,955 --> 00:11:43,355
What's so funny about pooping?

262
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,480
Yilian.

263
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,200
Letter of Commendation.

264
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,039
Ms. Lian Yilian

265
00:12:16,688 --> 00:12:18,000
deserves recognition.

266
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:20,840
Thank you.

267
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:24,600
Ruifeng,

268
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,133
have you read the report

269
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:27,977
about the financial
early warning system?

270
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,909
The smoother things go,

271
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,088
the more we need to know
when to hit the brakes.

272
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,200
Okay.

273
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,111
Let's meet after you finish reading it.

274
00:12:42,355 --> 00:12:43,929
(Dad)
Dinner this Saturday

275
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,422
will start promptly at 6 PM.

276
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,600
As the elder son,

277
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,360
I hope you can support me

278
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:49,759
and convince Dai.

279
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,039
Dai,

280
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:11,960
it's great.

281
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:13,440
You finally picked up.

282
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:14,440
Shoot.

283
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:17,480
Dai,

284
00:13:18,177 --> 00:13:18,870
here's the thing.

285
00:13:19,044 --> 00:13:20,240
You left the family group chat,

286
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,440
so here's some update.

287
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,240
This coming weekend,

288
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,799
Dad and Ms. Lian ask us over for dinner.

289
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,120
Since we are where we are,

290
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,960
don't be mad at Dad.

291
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,720
He's our father, after all.

292
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,600
Video call him later.

293
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:42,840
Don't make things awkward for him.

294
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:43,879
I'm telling you,

295
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,559
don't try to guilt-trip me.

296
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,279
That's my home too.

297
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,720
A woman came into our house.

298
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,960
Forget about not asking for my consent.

299
00:13:53,044 --> 00:13:55,355
But you should've at least given me
the right to know.

300
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,720
I'm to blame.

301
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:59,200
I asked Lina not to tell you.

302
00:13:59,488 --> 00:14:00,444
I didn't let you know

303
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:02,600
because I was afraid
you might overreact.

304
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:04,799
Nevertheless,

305
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,320
ever since Ms. Lian came,

306
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,399
Dad has felt better.

307
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,080
You know what he was like before this.

308
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,080
He was too lonely.

309
00:14:12,177 --> 00:14:14,000
Being alone is a quiet celebration.

310
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,159
What are you talking about?

311
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,360
You should talk to Dad.

312
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:20,466
I'm not going to talk to him anymore.

313
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:22,044
Do you want to abandon your father?

314
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,670
I decide my own life, not my dad. Bye.

315
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,960
What's she on about?

316
00:14:31,822 --> 00:14:34,000
I didn't know you knew
how to make egg dumplings.

317
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,440
My mom taught me.

318
00:14:37,488 --> 00:14:39,288
We used to make it
during Chinese New Year.

319
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,759
We set up a stove,

320
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,320
heated up a pot,

321
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,159
and the family sat around it together.
How nice.

322
00:14:46,822 --> 00:14:47,870
All the children grew up

323
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,360
in the blink of an eye.

324
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:53,066
The festive atmosphere has faded

325
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,240
over the years.

326
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,279
Jingmin has also left.

327
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:06,320
From now on, I'll stay by your side

328
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,200
on her behalf.

329
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,320
Yilian, I give you my word.

330
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,159
I'll definitely

331
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,039
convince my children

332
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,200
so that they can accept us

333
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,399
as quickly as possible.

334
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,840
And your children too.

335
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,320
You should call him over.

336
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,200
We're family, after all.

337
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,733
We'll have to meet sooner or later.

338
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:30,279
No rush.

339
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:32,088
We'll take our time.

340
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,720
We'll wait until your family accepts me,

341
00:15:36,622 --> 00:15:37,555
all right?

342
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,720
I'm sorry for making you feel wronged.

343
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,480
That's only when I force myself
to compromise.

344
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,270
I'm doing this willingly,

345
00:15:46,444 --> 00:15:47,800
so it doesn't feel that way.

346
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:51,080
All right. Beat the eggs.

347
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,399
I can smell the egg dumplings now.

348
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,279
Really?

349
00:15:58,519 --> 00:15:58,879
Yes.

350
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,279
Dad,

351
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:01,919
we're here.

352
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,360
Come here.

353
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,389
You're here.

354
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,311
Did you smell the food?

355
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:05,800
Grandpa.

356
00:16:06,177 --> 00:16:07,750
You're making egg dumplings, Miss Nurse?

357
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,240
Yes.

358
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,159
That's rude.

359
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:10,039
Show some respect.

360
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,750
Can I give you a hand?

361
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,000
No need.

362
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,960
You're a guest here.

363
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,039
Right. Please have a seat.

364
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:16,799
Go take the dishes out.

365
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:17,320
All right.

366
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,679
Let me.

367
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,120
Take a rest.

368
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,120
It's almost done.

369
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,266
I was busy too back then,

370
00:16:22,288 --> 00:16:23,550
but no one helped me.

371
00:16:23,755 --> 00:16:25,670
Guess the newcomers
get special treatment.

372
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,840
What are you talking about?

373
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:28,000
Duole is right.

374
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:30,080
Professor Shen.

375
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,799
Shen.

376
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,480
We're here.

377
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,399
Gou is here.

378
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,839
Get us slippers.

379
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,960
No need.

380
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,720
No need today.

381
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,799
Lina said no need.

382
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,039
Are these egg dumplings?

383
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:43,080
These are supplements for patients.

384
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,559
Right?

385
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,879
You're so thoughtful.

386
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:47,480
I'll put them here.

387
00:16:47,955 --> 00:16:49,200
No one is allowed to eat them.

388
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,679
Come.

389
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,155
Look at this.

390
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,519
He wrote a letter of commendation.

391
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,799
Ms. Lian certainly helped.

392
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,480
Of course.

393
00:17:00,488 --> 00:17:02,488
Professor Shen, you have
a great complexion now.

394
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:03,279
Shen Qing,

395
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:04,440
look at your dad.

396
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:05,960
His face is radiating.

397
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,119
What gives a 70-year-old man

398
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,680
a new lease on life?

399
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,880
It's the power of love.

400
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,720
Power of love.

401
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,599
Oh, my, Gou.

402
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,519
Mr. Gou

403
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,599
has a knack for twisting anything good

404
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:21,555
into something completely different.

405
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,799
You should know what he's like.

406
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,000
I certainly do.

407
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:27,240
Is everything done?

408
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:27,509
Yes.

409
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,459
Please be seated.

410
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,480
- Please sit down.
- Come.

411
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,200
How should we sit?

412
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,720
You sit here.

413
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,520
I'll sit over here.

414
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:32,960
Gou, give a toast.

415
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:33,680
You go ahead.

416
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:37,759
Look at this lively family.

417
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,160
I'm very touched.

418
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,000
You're truly blessed.

419
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:43,119
Envious, aren't you?

420
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,680
We'll share your blessings

421
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,000
with you.

422
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,519
Come.

423
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,839
I'm so blessed

424
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,880
to have met Yilian.

425
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,720
Come on.

426
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,480
She prepared

427
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,680
the entire meal.

428
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:57,440
Try it.

429
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:00,599
Wishing you a long life, Professor Shen.

430
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,960
Don't stand up. Sit.

431
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:03,559
Come.

432
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:04,599
Cheers.

433
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:21,839
Mom.

434
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,480
I'm home, Mom.

435
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:35,680
Dai, why didn't you tell me
you were coming back?

436
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
I could've picked you up.

437
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:37,720
Right.

438
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:43,720
This is my home.

439
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,720
Can't I come back?

440
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:49,400
I missed Mommy!

441
00:18:51,355 --> 00:18:52,350
Dai, you must be tired

442
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:53,720
from the long journey.

443
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,519
Come and sit.

444
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,400
Get another chair.

445
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,519
Another chair.

446
00:18:57,733 --> 00:18:58,590
Where should I put it?

447
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:00,720
I... I'll go get you some utensils.

448
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:02,039
Dai, sit here.

449
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:04,799
Sit next to your brother.

450
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,720
Come.

451
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,822
Here's a new pair of chopsticks
and a set of bowls.

452
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,240
Please move over a bit.

453
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:18,960
Well,

454
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,440
you must be Shen Dai.

455
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:23,759
I always hear your dad

456
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,079
talk about you.

457
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,680
It's good that you're back.

458
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,200
- That's good.
- Right.

459
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:31,880
Yes, I'm Shen Dai.

460
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,119
Who are you?

461
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,640
Dai, don't be rude.

462
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,039
This is Ms. Lian. I told you.

463
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:43,599
Yes, right.

464
00:19:43,888 --> 00:19:45,222
Ms. Lian, the head nurse.

465
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:45,839
Well.

466
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:47,640
Nice to meet you, Ms. Lian.

467
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,599
Are you working at my home

468
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,640
part-time

469
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:52,880
or doing overtime?

470
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,519
Dai.

471
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,755
That's uncalled for.

472
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:05,920
Dai.

473
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,599
You see,

474
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:08,599
you had a long trip back home.

475
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,200
Let's eat first.

476
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,160
Food is everyone's top priority.

477
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:13,270
Come on.

478
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:15,510
Food can soothe any discontent.

479
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:16,550
- That's right.
- Come on.

480
00:20:16,622 --> 00:20:18,200
- Eat first.
- Let's welcome Dai back.

481
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:19,960
Come on. Dai, raise your glass.

482
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,240
Dai.

483
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:21,119
Dai.

484
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,160
Dad,

485
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,920
you just had surgery.

486
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,839
You can drink now?

487
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,240
You're right.

488
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,319
Shen,

489
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,640
you should drink tea.

490
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,119
My bad.

491
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,240
We drink liquor,

492
00:20:38,422 --> 00:20:39,800
and Professor Shen drinks tea.

493
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:41,590
The dishes are going cold. Dig in.

494
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,720
Exactly.

495
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,920
Dai, the weather is hot.
Take off your coat.

496
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:46,359
You feel the heat,

497
00:20:47,422 --> 00:20:49,000
but it's cold deep inside me.

498
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,720
Shen Dai.

499
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,000
Professor Shen,

500
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:59,200
you're quick to recover this time.

501
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,480
That's amazing. Congrats.

502
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,759
Let me and Gou drink to you.

503
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:06,079
I think we should go back.

504
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,599
We are outsiders here.

505
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,920
Your family should
enjoy your time together

506
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,039
and have a nice chat.

507
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,000
Right. Come.

508
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,960
Professor Shen, we...

509
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:13,519
Sit down.

510
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:15,119
Please sit down.

511
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:18,680
Don't go.

512
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,039
There are no outsiders here.

513
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,640
Sit.

514
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:26,559
Sit.

515
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,640
Let's eat.

516
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:37,839
Dai.

517
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,960
This is your favorite egg dumplings.

518
00:21:41,311 --> 00:21:42,830
You know egg dumplings are my favorite?

519
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:45,800
Do you remember I only
eat egg dumplings Mom made?

520
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,799
Also, tell me.

521
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:49,519
Why do people live?

522
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,920
To eat?

523
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,319
To take the medicine?

524
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,160
You even made a list of it

525
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,759
and stuck it on the wall.

526
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:59,279
You're going too far.

527
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,559
Are you born in a barn?

528
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,839
Where is your manner?

529
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,200
Don't be mad.

530
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,640
She's not a stepmother yet,

531
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,799
but I've already lost my home.

532
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,240
I see what this is.

533
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,519
It's a wrong decision
for me to be back here.

534
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,720
I shouldn't have come back.

535
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:19,920
I'll go.

536
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,279
Dai.

537
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:21,160
Shen Dai, calm down.

538
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,720
Dai.

539
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,559
- Dai.
- Dai.

540
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:24,680
Why are you lashing out?

541
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:25,319
Let go.

542
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,920
You traitor!

543
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:29,119
Don't be rude to your sister-in-law.

544
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,720
All of you are traitors!

545
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,440
Cynical and ungrateful.

546
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:33,680
You're only after benefits.

547
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:36,790
If you want to leave, go!

548
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,377
Go back to wherever you came from.

549
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,799
Go back to the U.S. Now!

550
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,480
Shen Qing, don't make things worse.

551
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,160
Shen Dai.

552
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,480
- Go and sit down.
- Go now.

553
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:44,119
Stop it.

554
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:44,829
Fine, I'll go.

555
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:46,244
- Shen Qing.
- I'm not afraid of you.

556
00:22:46,244 --> 00:22:46,822
Don't go.

557
00:22:46,844 --> 00:22:47,750
Mr. Gou, let go of me.

558
00:22:47,844 --> 00:22:48,640
Let me leave.

559
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,079
Dai.

560
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,079
I'm leaving then.

561
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:50,866
- Go then.
- Dai.

562
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,680
Dai, don't go.

563
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,759
Don't pull me.

564
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:53,160
Dai.

565
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,359
You're family. Don't do this.

566
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,519
Do me a favor, please.

567
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,200
Right.

568
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,111
She came back frustrated.
Don't take it personally.

569
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:00,240
How could she yell at Dad and you?

570
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,720
Yes, I know.

571
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,920
Sit down.

572
00:23:02,022 --> 00:23:03,260
Stop saying things out of anger.

573
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,688
You just got back from a long trip.

574
00:23:04,688 --> 00:23:05,240
Take it easy.

575
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,279
Just take care of Dad.

576
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,039
Go on.

577
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,799
If no...

578
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:08,599
Say it nicely.

579
00:23:08,622 --> 00:23:09,270
Say it nicely.

580
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:10,799
Calm down.

581
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:11,519
Say it nicely.

582
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:13,480
- How can I stay calm?
- Calm down.

583
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,039
I'll talk to Qing later.

584
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,920
Come and sit.

585
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:17,519
Sit.

586
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:18,440
Come.

587
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,240
Come.

588
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:25,920
Sit.

589
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:26,680
Sit down.

590
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
Shen.

591
00:23:37,844 --> 00:23:39,030
Dad, stop drinking so much.

592
00:23:39,266 --> 00:23:40,155
Eat the dishes.

593
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,200
Shen Dai,

594
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,680
the garland chrysanthemum is tender.

595
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,319
You can't get this abroad.

596
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,599
Exactly.

597
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,044
The vegetables of southern regions
are fresh.

598
00:23:50,088 --> 00:23:51,110
Garland chrysanthemum

599
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,640
was Dai's favorite when she was a kid.

600
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,279
Really?

601
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:56,400
Grandpa Gou,

602
00:23:56,488 --> 00:23:58,070
garland chrysanthemum isn't native here.

603
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,800
It originally came
from the Mediterranean.

604
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,319
We didn't have this here back then.

605
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:02,519
And actually,

606
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,480
Aunt Dai liked riverside wormwood.

607
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,509
There are vegetables, anyway.

608
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,666
They're from the same family.

609
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:09,759
One family.

610
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,200
Yes.

611
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:11,759
All he remembers is vegetables.

612
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,880
Both are almost the same.

613
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,466
Yes, right.

614
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,640
Duck from Xu Store.

615
00:24:18,888 --> 00:24:20,288
If I had known you were coming back,

616
00:24:20,288 --> 00:24:22,644
I would've had Lina buy
the signature duck dish back.

617
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,039
If I had told you I was coming back,

618
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,288
would I even have made it back at all?

619
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,509
This is your home.

620
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,111
No one would stop you from coming back.

621
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:35,720
Is it?

622
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:37,480
A woman has moved in.

623
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,160
Did any of you bother to tell me?

624
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,279
Did you?

625
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,680
You kept it from me
as long as you could.

626
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,000
You even tried...

627
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,240
Are you done yet?

628
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,279
What are you getting at?

629
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,640
I'm saying

630
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,920
if you want this outsider
to replace my mom,

631
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,119
I won't accept it.

632
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:58,720
Dad.

633
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,880
- Shen.
- Dad.

634
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:00,839
Well.

635
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,519
Let me say something, all right?

636
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:06,839
Dai.

637
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,839
Actually,

638
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,079
I never wanted

639
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,119
to replace your mom.

640
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:19,079
Besides,

641
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,680
everyone knows

642
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,079
your dad

643
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,359
loves her.

644
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,960
It's not just me.

645
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:26,359
The entire neighborhood

646
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,519
and campus know.

647
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,359
Not only am I aware of it,

648
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:33,960
but I also deeply admire it.

649
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,880
I came here without any purpose.

650
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:39,839
I just

651
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,880
want to take care of your dad.

652
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,319
I...

653
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:47,920
I don't want him

654
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,759
to be alone,

655
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:52,839
sad,

656
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,799
lying awake at night,

657
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,640
or skipping meals.

658
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:06,200
Just now,

659
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:08,920
you called me head nurse.

660
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,559
That's accurate.

661
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:13,799
You can also call me a cook

662
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:15,880
or a caregiver.

663
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:17,359
Because all I want is

664
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:18,720
to take care of your dad.

665
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,030
Also, I think

666
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:21,440
we share the goal here.

667
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,200
That's for him to be happy

668
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:26,960
in his later years.

669
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,440
You sure talk a good game.

670
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,599
Shen Dai,

671
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,799
can you be sensible?

672
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,240
Shen.

673
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,240
Dad.

674
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:59,039
Slowly.

675
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:08,519
This is too much. I can't finish.

676
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:11,920
Eat slowly.

677
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,519
The pink pill is
for your blood pressure.

678
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:15,880
Don't forget to take it.

679
00:27:16,066 --> 00:27:16,750
After your meal.

680
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,240
The water is hot.

681
00:27:18,377 --> 00:27:20,070
It's perfect to take it after the meal.

682
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:23,920
Remember to mark it down
after you take it.

683
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:25,559
Don't forget.

684
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,960
Don't worry, Ms. Lian.

685
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:29,640
Keep it down.

686
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:32,079
Dai is still jet-lagged.

687
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,799
I'm being too loud.

688
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,480
What's wrong? Haven't you left yet?

689
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:54,920
Nothing.

690
00:27:55,222 --> 00:27:56,400
I'm looking for my shoes.

691
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:16,839
Professor Shen.

692
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,720
I'm off to work.

693
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:22,839
See you.

694
00:28:37,622 --> 00:28:39,590
Lian, Bed Three's blood pressure
has stabilized.

695
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,422
Ready for surgery.

696
00:28:40,444 --> 00:28:40,933
Really?

697
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:41,830
That's great.

698
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:42,480
Say,

699
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,440
your son called the department earlier.

700
00:28:44,533 --> 00:28:46,311
He said he's been trying to reach you.

701
00:28:48,088 --> 00:28:49,960
My phone is on silent mode.
I didn't hear it.

702
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,039
Didn't want to disturb
Professor Shen's rest?

703
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,359
Get back to your work.

704
00:29:00,955 --> 00:29:02,440
If you're hungry, eat some congee,

705
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,240
Heat it up with the small clay pot.

706
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,400
Yes.

707
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,759
It's in the middle cabinet.

708
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,160
It's pretty good.

709
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:37,480
Mom.

710
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,133
Good morning.

711
00:29:45,288 --> 00:29:46,790
It's not morning anymore, Dai.

712
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,480
It's already ten.

713
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,000
Hurry up and eat.

714
00:29:50,244 --> 00:29:51,977
Ms. Lian prepared breakfast for you.

715
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,799
Did she make this for you or me?

716
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,200
Dai,

717
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,920
I've already compromised.

718
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,720
You should, too.

719
00:30:14,466 --> 00:30:15,777
I don't see why

720
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:17,519
I should.

721
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:25,200
I can only see memories.

722
00:30:34,711 --> 00:30:36,022
This purple clay bottle

723
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:40,119
is Mom's, right?

724
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,720
This cushion

725
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,880
was sewn by Mom.

726
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,759
I threaded the needle.

727
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:04,759
Dai,

728
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,920
we need to talk.

729
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:12,640
Dai,

730
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:15,960
your mom is gone.

731
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,079
I'm heartbroken too.

732
00:31:21,177 --> 00:31:22,200
I haven't forgotten her.

733
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,079
I think about her all the time, okay?

734
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:24,799
Not okay.

735
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:27,680
Dad,

736
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,799
this is too fast.

737
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:34,359
"May we have

738
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,519
a long life together."

739
00:31:36,777 --> 00:31:39,022
You recited this
during the Mid-Autumn poetry recital,

740
00:31:39,088 --> 00:31:40,830
and that had me in tears.

741
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:42,622
How come another woman moved in

742
00:31:42,622 --> 00:31:44,350
after you were discharged
from the hospital?

743
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:45,920
She's even living here now.

744
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,920
You and Qing kept it from me.

745
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:48,920
Me.

746
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,240
I'm your daughter.

747
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,589
Qing has explained it to you.

748
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,577
We kept it from you

749
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,240
because we knew you'd react like this.

750
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:58,519
How am I reacting?

751
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,720
How exactly am I?

752
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:05,880
When I was overseas,

753
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,599
I thought about you every single day.

754
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,960
I worried whether

755
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:11,960
you ate well,

756
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:13,119
slept well,

757
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,920
and took your medicine on time.

758
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:17,359
But you?

759
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,590
You had someone marking
your meds for you.

760
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,559
You didn't even tell me.

761
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,240
You didn't miss any of your meds.

762
00:32:32,022 --> 00:32:33,550
But you've forgotten your daughter.

763
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:34,880
How could...

764
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,359
How could I possibly forget about you?

765
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,920
Then what do you want me to do?

766
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,200
Your mom is gone.

767
00:32:44,844 --> 00:32:46,488
Should I just lie there all day

768
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,039
and die early

769
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,519
so I can meet her sooner? Is that okay?

770
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,319
Who understands

771
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,079
my pain?

772
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,279
My son lives nearby,

773
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,720
but he's busy with work.

774
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,640
My daughter is far away from me.

775
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,440
So tell me,

776
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:12,920
what should I do?

777
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:22,933
Tell her to leave.

778
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,759
Impossible.

779
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:36,039
I asked Ms. Lian many times
before she agreed

780
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:37,559
to move in to look after me.

781
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,110
I can't go back on my words,

782
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,400
and I won't.

783
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,960
She's kind to me.

784
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
We get along well.

785
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:48,680
I'm already old.

786
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:51,799
I don't want to grow old alone.

787
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:53,680
I seize the time I have.

788
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,000
I hope you can understand me.

789
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,240
I can understand you,

790
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:00,466
but who will understand Mom?

791
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:04,440
Dai.

792
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:06,200
Fine.

793
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:08,400
You have the freedom to remarry,

794
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,440
and I have the freedom to come home.

795
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:13,639
From now on,

796
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,800
we will live our own lives

797
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:18,155
and not interfere with each other.

798
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:04,933
Eat your food.

799
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,159
Smart lock.

800
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,070
Shen Dai bought this too.

801
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:42,719
If it meets her high standards,

802
00:35:42,733 --> 00:35:44,000
this lock must be one of a kind.

803
00:35:44,066 --> 00:35:45,070
We should use this too.

804
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,400
Sure.

805
00:35:46,533 --> 00:35:48,733
It saves me the trouble
of forgetting to bring the keys.

806
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,360
Exactly. We'd have to go
to your dad's place to get a spare.

807
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,440
Such a hassle.

808
00:35:53,022 --> 00:35:53,920
You install it later.

809
00:35:56,133 --> 00:35:57,533
It doesn't come with installation?

810
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:01,199
That costs 300 yuan. That's robbery.

811
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,360
They're doing the work.

812
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,159
We have someone do it as well.

813
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,920
Why pay an outsider?

814
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,320
I checked the manual. It's simple.

815
00:36:12,777 --> 00:36:13,320
Read this.

816
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,719
Mr. Shen,

817
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:18,239
don't always sit in front
of your computer.

818
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:19,719
Move a little.

819
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,400
Move your precious butt

820
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,960
and contribute to the household.

821
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,039
Fine, I'll do it.

822
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,199
I'll contribute to the family.

823
00:36:30,199 --> 00:36:31,239
I appreciate that.

824
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,440
Who do you think installed Dai's lock?

825
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,039
She probably paid 300 yuan for it.

826
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:38,519
Look, I've got the tools ready.

827
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,119
We have to remove the old lock first.

828
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,159
Let me study the manual.

829
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,559
Let me see.

830
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:48,039
Wait.

831
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,119
This is complicated.

832
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:52,519
Not at all.

833
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:52,880
Look.

834
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:54,589
It's all step by step. Easy.

835
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:55,440
Step by step, you say?

836
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,239
Don't I need to remove
the old lock first?

837
00:36:58,679 --> 00:36:59,400
Who's back?

838
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:03,480
Who?

839
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:04,719
Ms. Lian.

840
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:07,079
Leave her be.

841
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:08,280
Let's focus on the lock.

842
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:10,239
Fourteen.

843
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:11,199
Lina,

844
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,079
I think we should hold off on this.

845
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:14,800
Why?

846
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,280
Think about it.
They're having a conflict now.

847
00:37:18,577 --> 00:37:19,630
If we install this lock now,

848
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:21,599
isn't that like taking sides?

849
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:23,639
Yeah.

850
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,800
You're thinking ahead.

851
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:30,199
When do you think Shen Dai

852
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,000
will ever make Ms. Lian leave?

853
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:33,960
I doubt that.

854
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,599
The house is full of tension,

855
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,559
but she's as cool as a cucumber.

856
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,159
Who knows,

857
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,760
she might outstay Dai.

858
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,679
True.

859
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:46,000
Shen Dai acts all tough,

860
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:47,679
but she's actually a paper tiger.

861
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:54,880
Mom.

862
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,599
I'm home.

863
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,800
I bought a lavender-scented candle
for today.

864
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:06,599
Trust my taste.

865
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,480
You'll love this.

866
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,320
Oh, Mom,

867
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,644
I also bought you

868
00:38:17,666 --> 00:38:19,800
the water chest cake
from Lvliu Confectionery.

869
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,577
It's your favorite.

870
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:37,039
Every time I passed by,

871
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,440
I wanted to get it for you,

872
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,920
but the line was always too long,

873
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,440
so I'd think,

874
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:45,239
"Forget it.

875
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:47,400
Next time."

876
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:53,920
Now, I finally got it.

877
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,800
And you're not here to eat it.

878
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:09,960
Mom,

879
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:13,400
a daughter like me

880
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,519
deserves punishment, right?

881
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:24,800
I miss you so much, Mom.

882
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:27,360
So much.

883
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,840
You're at it again.

884
00:39:47,022 --> 00:39:49,000
I have been fine on my own
all these years.

885
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,079
You don't have to worry.

886
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:51,559
That was before.

887
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:53,159
Now, you have me.

888
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,599
Are you hot?

889
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:17,679
Do you smell that?

890
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:18,960
There's a scent.

891
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:21,800
It's like

892
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,679
fragrance.

893
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:34,000
Is today Dai's Mom's death anniversary?

894
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,440
No.

895
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,920
She must be missing her mom.

896
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,239
Look, she bought her mom's favorite

897
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:44,844
and lit a candle.

898
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,679
She's such a nice girl.

899
00:40:52,688 --> 00:40:53,320
What's wrong?

900
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:54,320
Nothing.

901
00:40:55,577 --> 00:40:56,711
Did you catch a cold?

902
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,400
No.

903
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,229
What's wrong?

904
00:40:59,230 --> 00:40:59,977
You keep sneezing.

905
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,070
It's nothing.

906
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:06,679
I'm just sensitive to this scent.

907
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,480
You scared me.

908
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,599
I thought you caught a cold

909
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,000
from the wind earlier.

910
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,400
No big deal.

911
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,599
It's serious.

912
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,199
Did you forget to take your meds?

913
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:27,559
Meds?

914
00:41:28,622 --> 00:41:29,960
I've put them in the container.

915
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:32,639
I was too busy picking you up,
so I forgot.

916
00:41:32,688 --> 00:41:33,911
You need a spanking for that.

917
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:34,599
Right.

918
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,000
Take it now.
