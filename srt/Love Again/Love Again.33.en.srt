00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,140
=Episode 33=

3
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,150
Mom,

4
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,060
forgive me.

5
00:01:42,444 --> 00:01:43,550
No one can replace you.

6
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,830
No matter how similar they look.

7
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,870
You're overreacting.

8
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,340
The truth is,

9
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,030
I still can't forget about Mom

10
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,180
after all that trouble.

11
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:02,740
I understand.

12
00:02:04,044 --> 00:02:05,111
Have some water.

13
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:07,500
Qing,

14
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,220
what kind of funeral arrangement
do you want

15
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:12,340
after you pass away?

16
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:14,390
Jeez, I'm still alive and kicking.

17
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,377
Why should I think
about my funeral arrangement?

18
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:17,870
Then I...

19
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,150
I...

20
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:21,800
I want to be buried at sea.
Just give me a sea burial.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,870
You want a sea burial?

22
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,870
Would Lina agree to that?

23
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:26,688
I had no say when I was alive.

24
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,990
Can't I at least choose how I go?

25
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,022
Well, that's not for sure.

26
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,340
It depends on whether you
or Lina goes first.

27
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:36,460
Anyway,

28
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,310
don't stress.

29
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,060
I know you're usually busy with work.

30
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,940
You finally got off early.

31
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,150
Instead of going out for your run,

32
00:02:44,355 --> 00:02:46,320
couldn't you stay
and spend some time with Lina?

33
00:02:46,444 --> 00:02:48,300
She has been doing so much
for the family.

34
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,780
It really hasn't been easy for her.

35
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,900
I know it is not easy.

36
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,830
But who has it easy?

37
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,900
I work all day out there.

38
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:55,200
By the time I get home,
I don't even want to say anything.

39
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:56,390
Fine, I get it.

40
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,900
I know it's hard to find someone

41
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,150
who thinks like you.

42
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,660
I understand Lina.

43
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,066
She's going through a failed startup.

44
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:10,070
Now, her parents keep fighting over

45
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:11,266
their burial site.

46
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,630
It's driving her crazy.

47
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,622
When she's overwhelmed,
she shares it with me.

48
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,777
But the thing is,

49
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,630
I can't handle it either.

50
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,190
That's why I run to get a breather.

51
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:25,390
Let's all aim

52
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,750
to live long.

53
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:29,710
I still have a bunch of medicine
to finish developing.

54
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,510
This is Mom's jasmine tea.

55
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:38,220
It can clear the gunk
from your arteries.

56
00:03:40,977 --> 00:03:42,222
This is too hard to manage.

57
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,340
Ding,

58
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,980
do you think people know
who they're buried with

59
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,980
after they die?

60
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,030
After death?

61
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,030
Apparently, it matters

62
00:04:12,511 --> 00:04:13,866
who you're buried next to.

63
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,390
Lately, I've been dreaming a lot

64
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,950
about my father.

65
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,660
In the dream,

66
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,950
he has this huge white banner pinned
to his back.

67
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,660
It said,

68
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,710
"Down with Shen Changhe."

69
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,900
He was trying to rip it off.

70
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,390
But he just couldn't reach it.

71
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,270
I tried to help.

72
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:49,711
But no matter how hard I try,
I can't get it off either.

73
00:04:53,466 --> 00:04:54,420
When we reached home,

74
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,420
my dad

75
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,220
collapsed.

76
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:00,950
He kept saying it was cold.

77
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,340
He felt cold.

78
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,860
My mom put two heavy quilts on him.

79
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,830
But he's still shivering.

80
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,300
So she told me

81
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,750
to take off my thermal pants
and put them on him.

82
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,460
The next morning,

83
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,420
I woke up and saw my pants folded neatly

84
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,860
at the foot of my bed.

85
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,300
My dad...

86
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,300
He had thrown himself into the river.

87
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,340
He used

88
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,030
to tell me to endure everything.

89
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,900
But why couldn't he endure it?

90
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,590
Before my mom passed,

91
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,710
she made me promise

92
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,070
to move

93
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,980
his grave

94
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,860
and bury them together.

95
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,780
So, do people really know

96
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,220
who they're buried with
after they're gone?

97
00:06:38,577 --> 00:06:39,270
What's wrong?

98
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:43,900
What is it?

99
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,830
It's not moving?

100
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:08,630
It's gone.

101
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,270
It flew off.

102
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:19,900
Mr. Shen.

103
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:27,244
What's the matter, Mr. An?

104
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,270
I have something to tell you.

105
00:07:30,622 --> 00:07:32,780
Mr. Shen, Shide Capital has taken
our financial records

106
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,060
because of what happened with Ice.

107
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,580
They can't do that.

108
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:40,390
If there's going to be an audit,

109
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,280
they need to follow the process.
They can't just inspect us at will.

110
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,750
Maybe Ice paid

111
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,820
too much attention to us.

112
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:47,940
Maybe

113
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,150
someone sabotaged her.

114
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,110
Ice is dedicated.

115
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,660
She doesn't deserve to be the scapegoat.

116
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,955
I'm going to talk to Mr. Qiao.

117
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,630
Can you calm down?

118
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,030
It's common to be wronged
in the workplace.

119
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,420
Ice won't take it to heart.

120
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,700
But I do!

121
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,700
I care more than you!

122
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,060
Right now, the most important thing

123
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,820
is to get 701 ready.
That's the best comeback.

124
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,888
Dr. Qin, please go ahead.

125
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,030
Is it that serious?

126
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,470
What happened?

127
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:34,844
I'll be there right away.

128
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,180
A clinical trial participant
had a cardiac arrest.

129
00:08:39,266 --> 00:08:40,977
I need to get to the hospital
right away.

130
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,470
Okay, go.

131
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,350
Week 24 is almost up.

132
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,580
If we get a fatality in the trial...

133
00:08:59,150 --> 00:08:59,780
No, no...

134
00:08:59,955 --> 00:09:01,700
We still need to wait
for the final data.

135
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,820
Medicine development

136
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,230
is like knitting a sweater.

137
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:08,270
You have to sort out
a thousand tangled threads.

138
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,150
It takes endless effort.

139
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,110
If it fails,

140
00:09:11,266 --> 00:09:12,990
everything will be over in an instant.

141
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,030
Dr. He, how is the patient?

142
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:20,740
The patient is stable now.

143
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:22,880
We did defibrillation
and gave the patient some meds.

144
00:09:22,888 --> 00:09:23,800
The vitals are stable.

145
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,110
Was the cardiac arrest related

146
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,510
to M701?

147
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,230
Probably not.

148
00:09:29,266 --> 00:09:31,133
The patient
had a pre-existing heart condition.

149
00:09:31,422 --> 00:09:32,900
Looks like he hid his medical history

150
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,180
when he joined the trial group.

151
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:36,580
So I'll get back to work now.

152
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,380
Let's keep in touch
in case anything comes up.

153
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,044
Okay.

154
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:46,900
Shen Qing.

155
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:47,700
Shen Qing.

156
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,470
Shen Qing.

157
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:55,820
Shen Qing.

158
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,230
Shen Qing, what's wrong?

159
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,180
That scared me to death!
That really scared me!

160
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,900
Me too.

161
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:07,400
Why do I feel like
something is wrong with my heart?

162
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,470
Maybe I should go inside
and lie down for a bit.

163
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,870
Stop joking around.

164
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,780
Your heart?

165
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,180
What about mine?

166
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:22,820
Dad,

167
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,300
you're home.

168
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,030
Yes.

169
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,230
Vegetarian again?

170
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,510
Stay there.

171
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:32,900
I'll cook some eggs.

172
00:10:33,577 --> 00:10:34,570
You can have it with me.

173
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,660
It's okay, Dad.

174
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,110
So...

175
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,060
I talked

176
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,350
to Qing today.

177
00:10:45,222 --> 00:10:47,111
He said he wants a sea burial
after he dies.

178
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,540
He told me

179
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:52,110
there are so many things in life
he doesn't get to choose.

180
00:10:52,244 --> 00:10:54,866
So he wants to make his own decisions
about his funeral.

181
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,110
I think he has a point.

182
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,420
So

183
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,900
I can be buried with Mom.

184
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,000
Then you do
whatever feels right for you.

185
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:51,210
(A moment of tolerance avoids disaster.
A step back can lead to a brighter path)

186
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,300
Have more greens.

187
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,180
Don't just eat meat.

188
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,020
(Ms. Liu Lina:
This is a friendly reminder.)

189
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,380
(Your business loan is due today.
Ignore this message if payment is made.)

190
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:20,888
I'll go get you some soup.

191
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:30,900
Bai,

192
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,150
why is the revenue from Joy Academy

193
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,350
not credited this month?

194
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,300
Lina,

195
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,630
it's the tax filing season.

196
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:37,933
There might be a short delay.

197
00:12:38,511 --> 00:12:39,390
Lina, don't worry.

198
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,110
This project is solid.

199
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,780
Okay, I understand.

200
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,660
Lina,

201
00:12:44,955 --> 00:12:47,044
you still have
to pay your business loan, right?

202
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,110
I can cover the interest for you now.

203
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,390
It's okay.

204
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,030
I can still manage
the interest payments.

205
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:53,780
All right.

206
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,660
That's all.

207
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,540
Out of these 300 patients,

208
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,390
there are  212 showed

209
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,680
a clear increase in platelets.

210
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,540
That's great news.

211
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,540
We should find more trial participants

212
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,660
to confirm the drug's safety
and effectiveness.

213
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,060
I agree.

214
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:10,940
Shen Qing...

215
00:13:11,155 --> 00:13:12,230
You need a budget, right?

216
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:13,660
Yes.

217
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:14,444
Approved!

218
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,300
I just don't get it.

219
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,870
How did death
become such a problem?

220
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:27,820
What problem?

221
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,420
Oh, you know.

222
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,230
When Jingmin passed away,

223
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,870
didn't the kids buy
a double plot for her?

224
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:38,990
Ding.

225
00:13:41,066 --> 00:13:42,270
- Ms. Lv?
- You're all here.

226
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,070
- Hello, Ms. Lv Yuan.
- What a coincidence.

227
00:13:44,511 --> 00:13:45,470
What brings you here?

228
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,222
It's really great to see you guys here.

229
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,510
Listen.

230
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,870
Now,

231
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,060
I'm a volunteer promoting body
and organ donation.

232
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,900
We're doing an awareness campaign.

233
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:57,150
Here are some brochures.

234
00:13:57,422 --> 00:13:58,390
Take one home to read.

235
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,700
Take one each.

236
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,030
Here.

237
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,390
Give me.

238
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,390
One is enough.

239
00:14:05,688 --> 00:14:07,200
Don't take more than one.

240
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,350
Ding,

241
00:14:10,444 --> 00:14:11,110
it's upside down.

242
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:11,700
Turn in.

243
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,390
You flipped it again.

244
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,060
Ms. Lv Yuan,

245
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,110
Ding's condition is getting worse.

246
00:14:22,377 --> 00:14:24,422
His family can't care
for him at home anymore.

247
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,110
So we brought him to the nursing home.

248
00:14:26,311 --> 00:14:27,300
Gou and I drop by often

249
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,350
to keep him company.

250
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,030
Mr. Ding,

251
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,660
you're looking well.

252
00:14:36,288 --> 00:14:37,955
Your brain may not be
what it used to be.

253
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,577
But you must keep your body strong.

254
00:14:39,688 --> 00:14:40,230
Stay strong.

255
00:14:40,888 --> 00:14:41,644
Stay strong.

256
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,470
Good for you!

257
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,110
Develop physical fitness!

258
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,110
Strengthen the people's health!

259
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,700
Stay alert!

260
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,350
Defend the motherland!

261
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,639
Strengthen the people's health!

262
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,288
Ding, slow down!

263
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:52,060
Stay alert!

264
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,060
Don't wander off!

265
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:55,030
He remembers everything

266
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,900
from the past.

267
00:14:55,977 --> 00:14:57,700
But nothing about what's happening now.

268
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,150
I guess so.

269
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,350
Body donation.

270
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,030
A selfless act of compassion.

271
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,230
That's right.

272
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,030
Think about it.
We turned into ashes after we died.

273
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,580
Then we have to find a place
to be buried

274
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,630
and take up space.

275
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,900
What's the point?

276
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,660
If you donate your corneas,

277
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,780
your eyes can still see.

278
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,060
Your heart could keep beating
in someone else's chest.

279
00:15:20,622 --> 00:15:21,977
It's incredibly meaningful.

280
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:23,540
Then...

281
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,300
I have a layman's question.

282
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,820
We're all old now.

283
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,780
Our eyesight is bad too,

284
00:15:30,955 --> 00:15:32,660
and our hearts aren't
what they used to be.

285
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,670
Would our organs still be useful?

286
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,270
Yes, absolutely.

287
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,820
If you donate your body
to medical science,

288
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,244
they'll use it for research

289
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,540
and to train future doctors.

290
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,860
Body and organ donation

291
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,430
is a great act of service to humanity.

292
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,470
Take some time to read up on it.

293
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:50,580
Shen,

294
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,030
Ms. Lv is impressive.

295
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:54,022
Impressive, indeed.

296
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,380
Gou! I mean Ding!

297
00:15:57,533 --> 00:15:58,422
I'll go and get him.

298
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,100
He called his own name.

299
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:02,620
Have a seat.

300
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,230
Okay.

301
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,470
I have to say

302
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,060
you look sharp and feminine

303
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,430
in that skirt and leather shoes.

304
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,270
Really?

305
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:15,430
They look pretty, right?

306
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,060
Yes.

307
00:16:16,555 --> 00:16:18,222
My son-in-law bought them for me.

308
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,190
Look.

309
00:16:20,888 --> 00:16:22,100
They're stylish and practical.

310
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,100
These are more comfortable
than walking shoes.

311
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,133
I could do the long march in these
with no problem.

312
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,230
Your son-in-law?

313
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,470
Yes.

314
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:31,540
Xinghuo is already married?

315
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:32,990
Yes.

316
00:16:33,488 --> 00:16:35,022
She just got her marriage certificate.

317
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:37,100
Mr. French Fry is now a dad.

318
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,620
Taotao

319
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,230
is especially happy.

320
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,444
- What about you?
- I can imagine that.

321
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,511
I'm doing pretty good.

322
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,540
Are you still keeping up
with 10,000 steps a day?

323
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:48,910
No.

324
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,510
I have a reason.

325
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,580
You see,

326
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,990
I hurt my knee.

327
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,820
You must not give up.

328
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,060
I would do a minimum
of 20,000 steps a day.

329
00:16:59,355 --> 00:17:00,380
Hear me out on this.

330
00:17:00,444 --> 00:17:02,111
If you want to be an organ donor,

331
00:17:02,777 --> 00:17:04,030
it's not as easy as it sounds.

332
00:17:04,622 --> 00:17:06,177
You've gotta stay alive first.

333
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,470
We must stay alive.

334
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,133
That's right.

335
00:17:10,177 --> 00:17:11,910
The same goes for you.

336
00:17:11,933 --> 00:17:12,860
We're in the same boat.

337
00:17:12,933 --> 00:17:13,755
We have to stay alive.

338
00:17:13,777 --> 00:17:14,355
Stay alive.

339
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:37,990
Dr. Qin,

340
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,430
I'm at home to grab a change of clothes.

341
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:43,820
Yes, I know about it.

342
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,444
Is it really that serious?

343
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:47,950
Okay, I'll be there right away.

344
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,960
(Ice Li)

345
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,750
(Project Manager)

346
00:18:53,050 --> 00:19:00,810
(Project Manager)

347
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,264
(Shide Capital)

348
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,670
Ice.

349
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,670
Long time no see.

350
00:19:17,044 --> 00:19:17,822
Where...

351
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,060
Where are you going?

352
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,540
I resigned.

353
00:19:21,822 --> 00:19:22,933
I'm returning to Xiamen.

354
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:25,666
See you around,

355
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,300
Jin.

356
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,190
Mr. Shen,

357
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:52,377
here's the budget list
from the finance department.

358
00:19:52,422 --> 00:19:53,288
Please sign it.

359
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:00,300
You turned your office
into a second home.

360
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:02,820
It can't be helped.

361
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,190
It's a crucial time.

362
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,800
Thank you for your hard work.

363
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,780
Not at all.

364
00:20:09,977 --> 00:20:12,777
You and Dr. Qin have been working hard
for an even longer time.

365
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,300
Oh,

366
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,670
I saw Ice when I was at Shide Capital.

367
00:20:20,222 --> 00:20:21,311
How is she doing?

368
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:22,540
She resigned

369
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:24,311
and is heading back to her hometown.

370
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:30,540
I see.

371
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,030
Ice,

372
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,230
I heard you're going back
to your hometown.

373
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,030
Do you have time to meet
before you leave?

374
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,355
I'm flying out the day after tomorrow.

375
00:21:43,422 --> 00:21:44,860
So I'm pretty busy.

376
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,510
Perhaps

377
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,710
we can grab some coffee at the airport.

378
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:55,780
Okay.

379
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,620
Then send me your flight information.

380
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,430
Bai, when is the interest
from Joy Academy going

381
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,470
to be credited this month?

382
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,670
Still being calculated?

383
00:22:15,955 --> 00:22:17,270
Can you push them a little?

384
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,620
Okay.

385
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:41,540
Mr. Shen,

386
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,340
you just snuck back here

387
00:22:44,377 --> 00:22:46,111
and dumped
a pile of dirty laundry on me.

388
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,820
Do you think this place is a hotel?

389
00:22:47,955 --> 00:22:49,911
You could at least tell me
you're coming home.

390
00:22:49,955 --> 00:22:51,711
Even hotels need ID to check-in.

391
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,860
My beautiful sister-in-law,

392
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,780
I've been using
this amazing face mask lately.

393
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,444
I brought two boxes just for you to try.

394
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:08,950
What's the point?

395
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:10,133
Who am I getting pretty for?

396
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,860
Did you fight
with my brother again?

397
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,950
I don't even meet him.

398
00:23:18,311 --> 00:23:20,577
He just dumps his dirty laundry here
and disappears.

399
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,866
I can't argue with someone
who's not around.

400
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,060
Shen Dai, tell your brother

401
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,860
to stop using work as an excuse
not to come home.

402
00:23:29,311 --> 00:23:31,177
If he doesn't want this marriage,
just say so.

403
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,470
Look,

404
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,710
we're all adults here.

405
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,340
I can't solve this for you.

406
00:23:35,488 --> 00:23:36,520
Figure this out yourselves.

407
00:23:37,911 --> 00:23:39,488
You're not going to talk to him?

408
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,860
Then I'll talk to your dad.

409
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,670
I gave everything to the Shen family,

410
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,444
and now no one wants
to take responsibility?

411
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,140
That's not true.

412
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,340
Actually,

413
00:23:49,044 --> 00:23:50,340
I already talked to my brother.

414
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:51,670
What did he say?

415
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,030
He said

416
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,270
he's exhausted

417
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,470
from work every day.

418
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,430
When he gets home,
he just wants to relax.

419
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,230
But

420
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,470
you're always talking to him

421
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,066
about all kinds of things non-stop.

422
00:24:02,088 --> 00:24:03,822
He said he feels like he can't breathe.

423
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,670
Can't breathe?

424
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,380
When we were dating,
he said I was his oxygen.

425
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,580
Now I'm suffocating him?

426
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,340
He should go to the hospital

427
00:24:11,355 --> 00:24:12,650
to see if it's a brain issue

428
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,910
or poor circulation in his heart.

429
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,600
Lina, can you calm down?

430
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,140
I told you

431
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,270
what was on his mind

432
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,990
because I want things to get better
between you two.

433
00:24:22,088 --> 00:24:23,030
But after you heard it,

434
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,230
you're making it worse.

435
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,750
Oh, I'm making it worse?

436
00:24:26,866 --> 00:24:27,733
No, it's me.

437
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,060
I made it worse.

438
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,620
But your attitude shows

439
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,510
you want your life

440
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,780
to fall apart.

441
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,060
He's the one not coming home.

442
00:24:37,155 --> 00:24:38,577
Is it me or he who wants to give up

443
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:39,266
on this marriage?

444
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,620
I said calm down.

445
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:43,177
How about this?

446
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,300
Calm down.

447
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,030
Then think

448
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,230
about what you really want.

449
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,100
Okay?

450
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:50,990
Calm down.

451
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,430
Even Duole asked me

452
00:24:54,555 --> 00:24:56,860
what I was going to do
after he left for university.

453
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:59,100
I don't know.

454
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,540
I can't breathe either.

455
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,711
It's suffocating for me too.

456
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,620
Moment

457
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,644
of disaster...

458
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,430
How did it go, Aunt?

459
00:25:16,511 --> 00:25:18,311
Did my mom scare you off again?

460
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,230
I was just talking to her for a bit.

461
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:23,340
You know

462
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:26,060
I really feel bad for your dad.

463
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,030
Of course, your mom has it tough too.

464
00:25:28,666 --> 00:25:29,711
But I could hardly breathe

465
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:31,200
just spending a few minutes with her.

466
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,266
When my dad doesn't come home,

467
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,510
my mom gets like this.

468
00:25:36,066 --> 00:25:37,030
When she acts like this,

469
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,422
my dad won't want to come home
even more and it's a cycle.

470
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,470
Would you be okay
if your dad wants a sea burial?

471
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,100
Sea burial?

472
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,470
Why wouldn't I be?

473
00:25:49,644 --> 00:25:51,750
I'd even find him
the most beautiful ocean for it.

474
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,860
Don't you think

475
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,670
a proper burial is still important

476
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:57,780
after someone dies?

477
00:25:59,300 --> 00:25:59,990
I don't think so.

478
00:26:00,888 --> 00:26:02,140
Even my maternal grandparents

479
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,777
are still arguing about cemetery plots.

480
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,060
Aunt,

481
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,380
I really don't get it.

482
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,380
Why do people spend
their lives getting upset

483
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,140
about what happens after they're gone?

484
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,430
Why not think about it when it happens

485
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,380
and just live well now and be happy?

486
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,140
You really are your father's son.

487
00:26:22,888 --> 00:26:24,140
You'll have a sea burial too.

488
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,580
A moment of tolerance
can avoid disaster.

489
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:28,910
A step back...

490
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:30,688
What's the rest?

491
00:26:30,711 --> 00:26:32,000
"Can lead to a brighter path."

492
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,760
(Body Donation.
A Selfless Act of Compassion)

493
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,750
Come and take a look.

494
00:27:06,844 --> 00:27:08,155
I've searched for some information

495
00:27:08,155 --> 00:27:09,311
on a few universities

496
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:10,750
on the laptop for you.

497
00:27:12,977 --> 00:27:13,844
Take a look.

498
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:17,580
This one.

499
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,670
This one?

500
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,540
Okay.

501
00:27:23,466 --> 00:27:24,266
You can do this.

502
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,100
Of course.

503
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:52,540
Baoqin,

504
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,030
bring me my fishing vest.

505
00:27:55,177 --> 00:27:55,990
I'm going fishing.

506
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,620
Getting all dressed up
just to go fishing?

507
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,222
Are you trying to catch a mermaid
or something?

508
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:08,100
What do you mean?

509
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:11,380
You know exactly what I mean.

510
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,300
Then explain what this is.

511
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,300
This is...

512
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,466
Which farm-to-table restaurant
is this again?

513
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,780
Is it the one
with the clay pot fish head?

514
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,510
You spent five thousand yuan

515
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,270
just to eat fish head?

516
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:34,750
Wait.

517
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,860
Where did you get the money?

518
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,620
Lina gave it to me.

519
00:28:41,777 --> 00:28:43,244
She transferred 10,000 yuan to me.

520
00:28:43,266 --> 00:28:44,270
I recharged 5,000 yuan.

521
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:45,910
Lina?

522
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,510
She gave you 10,000 yuan

523
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,340
and you recharged 5,000 yuan?

524
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:52,670
My goodness.

525
00:28:53,044 --> 00:28:55,340
Do you think your daughter
is some kind of millionaire?

526
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,430
Is she rich?

527
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,190
She already lost money running
that business.

528
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,820
She has been struggling to stay afloat.

529
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:06,340
It would have been great
if you could lend her a hand.

530
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,270
How can you even take her money?

531
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,140
Liu Debao, you're unbelievable.

532
00:29:10,244 --> 00:29:11,133
I can't believe you...

533
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,990
You've been stingy your whole life.

534
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:16,910
Now, suddenly you recharged
five thousand yuan like it's nothing?

535
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:19,030
Are you out of your mind?

536
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:22,780
You know what?

537
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,820
I'm done talking.

538
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,060
Just get a refund.

539
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,230
But

540
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,270
it's non-refundable.

541
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,990
Non-refundable or not, get it back.

542
00:29:32,866 --> 00:29:34,066
Get the money back.

543
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,750
Maybe

544
00:29:45,844 --> 00:29:47,022
we can wait a couple of days?

545
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,780
No, we can't.

546
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,780
Cancel it now.

547
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,060
Give me back my hard-earned money!

548
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:52,380
Hey!

549
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,030
Where's your boss?

550
00:29:54,066 --> 00:29:56,000
(Return my pension)
Calm down and let me explain!

551
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,510
Calm down and listen to me.

552
00:29:57,511 --> 00:29:58,750
I will take the responsibility.

553
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,060
Pay us back!

554
00:30:00,088 --> 00:30:01,030
(Lina)
Pay mine first!

555
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:01,860
Pay back!

556
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,540
Pay mine!

557
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:02,990
Pay back!

558
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,422
(Lina)
Return our hard-earned money!

559
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,670
(Pay us back)
Hello, Lina.

560
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:06,780
Bai,

561
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,230
has Joy Academy gone under?

562
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,620
I don't know what's going on.

563
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,670
I invested in it too.

564
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,820
Bai, what's happening?

565
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,950
Where's your boss?

566
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:20,950
Tell him to show up!

567
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,710
Pay us back!

568
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,470
Pay back!

569
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,230
Come out! Come out!

570
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:51,470
The number you've dialed
is not available.

571
00:30:53,933 --> 00:30:55,755
(Joy Academy)
I heard the legal rep ran off.

572
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,140
That investment is likely gone.

573
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,340
Look.

574
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,190
All the Joy Academy locations
have closed down.

575
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,910
What do we do now?

576
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:13,460
(Joy Academy is packed with people.
My family came, but I didn't see Bai.)

577
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,030
I did tell you I was coming back today.

578
00:31:41,244 --> 00:31:43,133
I sent you a message,
but you didn't reply.

579
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,190
Lina.

580
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,380
Lina, what's wrong?

581
00:32:02,355 --> 00:32:03,950
I lost my investment in Joy Academy.

582
00:32:05,511 --> 00:32:06,466
It was 500,000 yuan.

583
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:07,580
It's all gone.

584
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,977
Where did you get that kind of money?

585
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:10,710
I...

586
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,910
I took out a business loan.

587
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:18,340
Are you serious?

588
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,380
What did I tell you?

589
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,533
Why do you always fall for
other people's sweet talk?

590
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,380
Bai didn't sweet-talk me.

591
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,780
He invested a lot himself.

592
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,780
I told you

593
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,030
Bai couldn't be trusted.

594
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:30,022
I majored in accounting, and I analyzed it
for you, but you still didn't listen.

595
00:32:30,044 --> 00:32:31,666
How can you be so foolish?

596
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,190
I guess I am a fool.

597
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,750
If I weren't, would I marry you?

598
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:37,340
Wait.

599
00:32:37,644 --> 00:32:39,140
Can we just stick to the issue here?

600
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:39,950
Okay.

601
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,180
You said you "analyzed" it for me?

602
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,310
Your so-called analysis

603
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,510
was just saying "No."

604
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,740
You didn't even bother
to look at the product brochure

605
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,950
or even talk to me.

606
00:32:50,311 --> 00:32:52,540
All the family money goes
to your company ventures.

607
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,180
I want to make some money.

608
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,100
I want to do something

609
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,260
to prove that I can do more
than just cook and do laundry.

610
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,030
But you paid such a high cost
to prove it.

611
00:33:01,644 --> 00:33:02,844
After all these years,

612
00:33:02,911 --> 00:33:04,377
I've given everything to this family.

613
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,690
So, do you think
it's not even worth 500,000 yuan?

614
00:33:06,733 --> 00:33:08,390
Don't talk like
you're a slave or something.

615
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,888
No one's playing lord and servant here.
We only split the roles.

616
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:12,466
Didn't I give you
all the money I earn?

617
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,060
That's how much I trust you.

618
00:33:14,066 --> 00:33:15,466
You changed your phone password.

619
00:33:15,466 --> 00:33:16,400
Do you call that trust?

620
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,140
That's different.

621
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,060
Oh, please.

622
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,580
You come home looking all dazed

623
00:33:23,755 --> 00:33:25,333
as if you just had your heart broken.

624
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,533
Do you think I can't tell?

625
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:27,830
Fine.

626
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,100
You barely even come home now.

627
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,733
Have you ever thought about how I feel?

628
00:33:32,044 --> 00:33:33,470
If you cared about me even a little,

629
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,310
would I have fallen for that scam?

630
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,200
So I am heartbroken
because I looked dazed, huh?

631
00:33:39,377 --> 00:33:40,244
What about you?

632
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,260
You acted like you were in love

633
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:44,622
and took out a 500,000 yuan loan
to invest in Joy Academy.

634
00:33:44,644 --> 00:33:45,700
No one can stop you!

635
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:47,390
I only wanted to earn
a little more money.

636
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,511
Lina, I know you've sacrificed
a lot for this family.

637
00:33:49,511 --> 00:33:51,888
But I can't give you the kind
of return you want from me.

638
00:33:51,933 --> 00:33:54,310
You cook a meal and want me
to praise you for half an hour.

639
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,060
I would rather not eat.

640
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,220
Every little thing you do,

641
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,377
you expect me
to repay with love and admiration.

642
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,620
I'm really exhausted.

643
00:34:01,866 --> 00:34:03,250
After a full day working out there,

644
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,510
I only want to come home

645
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,510
and rest.

646
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,620
I can't give
you emotional support anymore.

647
00:34:07,644 --> 00:34:09,640
But I know you have enough
to give emotional support

648
00:34:09,644 --> 00:34:10,822
to someone on your phone.

649
00:34:15,911 --> 00:34:17,044
You're not even denying it?

650
00:34:17,311 --> 00:34:18,288
So I was right.

651
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,740
My phone is right here.
Go ahead and check it.

652
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:27,022
Would you dare to do the same?

653
00:34:32,066 --> 00:34:33,511
It's not that I'm afraid.

654
00:34:33,644 --> 00:34:34,540
I just don't want to.

655
00:34:34,555 --> 00:34:36,060
That's because you're hiding something!

656
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:36,870
Shen Qing!

657
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,990
Why did you change your password?

658
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,870
You must be hiding something.

659
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:42,790
Mom.

660
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:43,777
What have you done, huh?

661
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,260
Liu Lina,

662
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,470
you sure have the nerve.

663
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:52,790
You took out a 500,000 loan
to invest in the Joy Academy!

664
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,100
Have you completely lost it?

665
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,470
I only wanted to make some money
to cover the financial gap.

666
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,410
Did you make any profit?

667
00:34:57,444 --> 00:34:58,659
That gap has only gotten bigger!

668
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,470
Mom, Lina was only...

669
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,422
Don't take her side!

670
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,140
Tell me.

671
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,950
What about the 800,000 yuan
you invested in your company?

672
00:35:05,266 --> 00:35:06,444
Did you get your return?

673
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:08,540
No, right?

674
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,740
You put in 300,000 yuan more than Lina.

675
00:35:11,844 --> 00:35:13,911
What gives you the right to judge her?

676
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,430
Mom, that 800,000 yuan

677
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,220
was crowdfunding.

678
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,060
It could've come back
several times over.

679
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,470
Or you could lose everything.

680
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,030
What kind of shady company is that?

681
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:25,700
Who knows

682
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,666
what black hole
that money's fallen into.

683
00:35:31,866 --> 00:35:33,260
And Shen Qing, let me tell you.

684
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:36,060
I can criticize Liu Lina.

685
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,430
I can scold her.

686
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,060
But nobody else can,

687
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,030
not even you!

688
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,740
Be grateful to those who helped you.

689
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,620
Have you forgotten?

690
00:35:44,644 --> 00:35:46,955
Would you have today's
accomplishment without Lina?

691
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,140
Would Duole have grown up so well

692
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,870
without us taking care of him?

693
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,030
When your mom was sick,

694
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,910
could you have worked in peace,

695
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,990
climbing the ladder

696
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:57,870
at your company

697
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,180
if we didn't help out?

698
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,430
Listen here.

699
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,950
Our whole family has been serving yours.

700
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,660
You were living the good life.

701
00:36:07,711 --> 00:36:09,470
But no, you had to chase
some startup dream.

702
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,060
Without us,

703
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,700
you wouldn't be living
this comfortably and this carefree.

704
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:14,620
Carefree?

705
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,580
Comfortable?

706
00:36:15,844 --> 00:36:18,955
The weight of your so-called generosity
is crushing me that it suffocates me!

707
00:36:18,955 --> 00:36:21,000
- I don't want to come back anymore.
- Then don't!

708
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:21,910
Get out!

709
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,580
Take your dirty laundry and get out!

710
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,180
Divorce!

711
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:24,870
No...

712
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:25,620
Lina.

713
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:29,660
As you wish.

714
00:36:30,444 --> 00:36:31,060
Divorce it is.

715
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:31,790
Shen Qing.

716
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,220
Shen Qing.

717
00:36:33,533 --> 00:36:34,266
Shen Qing.

718
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:38,990
Look at his attitude.

719
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,990
What kind of husband did you marry?

720
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:42,222
Did you see his attitude?

721
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,100
Why are you crying?

722
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,540
What's the use of crying now?

723
00:36:48,822 --> 00:36:50,422
Don't just cry without doing anything.

724
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,510
Go get the money back!

725
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,310
Use that to wipe your tears.

726
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:03,470
That's enough.

727
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:04,060
Stop crying.

728
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,140
Stop crying already.

729
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,620
He said it in a moment of anger.

730
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,000
He wouldn't really divorce you.

731
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:09,260
Right?

732
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,140
All couples fight.

733
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,740
It's totally normal.

734
00:37:13,888 --> 00:37:15,377
Your dad and I have been bickering

735
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,400
our whole lives.

736
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,150
That's what marriage is.
That's what being a couple means.

737
00:37:19,155 --> 00:37:21,066
That's what
a lifetime together is like.

738
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,390
Liu Lina, listen.

739
00:37:26,422 --> 00:37:28,777
Every time I think about that money,
I just want to hit you.

740
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:29,660
Do you know that?

741
00:37:30,088 --> 00:37:31,666
And you're being all stubborn with me?

742
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,180
If your life

743
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,950
is already a struggle,

744
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,350
why on earth did you give

745
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,740
your dad 10,000 yuan?

746
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:40,870
Huh?

747
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:54,430
Lina.

748
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:57,430
Lina,

749
00:37:57,644 --> 00:37:58,660
it's going to be okay.

750
00:37:59,060 --> 00:37:59,790
I'm here for you.

751
00:37:59,933 --> 00:38:00,822
Don't be afraid.

752
00:38:01,555 --> 00:38:02,733
There's nothing to fear.

753
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,030
And just in case,

754
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,510
if Shen Qing does divorce you,

755
00:38:06,733 --> 00:38:08,777
you don't have to be scared
of that either.

756
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,060
Just look

757
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,355
at your father-in-law's age.

758
00:38:11,377 --> 00:38:13,150
He still managed
to date four to five women.

759
00:38:13,155 --> 00:38:14,777
You're still in your prime.

760
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,200
So don't worry.

761
00:38:16,244 --> 00:38:17,888
You'll definitely find a better one.

762
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:18,540
Mom,

763
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,030
please stop.

764
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,510
Please go home.

765
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,470
I don't feel like talking.

766
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:07,870
One is investing,

767
00:39:08,222 --> 00:39:09,400
the other is raising funds.

768
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,350
One took 800,000 yuan,

769
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,755
and the other one took 500,000 yuan.

770
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,511
At this rate...

771
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,990
At this rate,
we could lose everything in an instant.

772
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,790
Whether it's 500,000 yuan

773
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,620
or 800,000 yuan,

774
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:22,260
didn't they earn the money themselves?

775
00:39:22,311 --> 00:39:23,888
It's not like they asked you for it.

776
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:26,220
But it will affect my grandson.

777
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,350
He's about to study abroad.

778
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,540
That would cost a fortune.

779
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:34,310
Shen Qing is unbelievable.

780
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,910
He's truly a wolf in sheep's clothing.

781
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:37,660
You know?

782
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:38,950
He actually wants

783
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,540
to divorce my daughter.

784
00:39:41,777 --> 00:39:42,830
Who does he think he is?

785
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,350
In his dreams!

786
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,660
There, there.

787
00:39:45,866 --> 00:39:46,950
Don't get so worked up

788
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,100
over the divorce talk.

789
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:48,540
Here.

790
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,260
I baked some cookies. Try them.

791
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,350
This one tastes good.

792
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,950
That whole family...

793
00:39:55,511 --> 00:39:56,790
This is actually really good.

794
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:57,511
It is, right?

795
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,580
They're finally showing

796
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,220
their true colors.

797
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,910
The son is a mess,

798
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,140
and the father is even worse.

799
00:40:06,177 --> 00:40:06,830
Am I right?

800
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,088
Look at all the girlfriends.

801
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,350
It's one after another.

802
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:12,660
Peng Yulan,

803
00:40:12,666 --> 00:40:14,977
it's a blessing you didn't end up
with that old man.

804
00:40:15,044 --> 00:40:16,155
Such a lucky escape.

805
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,580
I've thought it through.

806
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:21,790
I'm actually

807
00:40:21,911 --> 00:40:23,180
doing just fine on my own now.

808
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,910
Once I send my grandson off to school,

809
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,950
I will be free.

810
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,660
I would come home, brew some tea,

811
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:29,990
tend to my flowers,

812
00:40:30,844 --> 00:40:31,950
and live a peaceful life.

813
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:33,260
Hold on.

814
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:34,470
Peng Yulan,

815
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:37,620
you were the one who told me

816
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,870
you were afraid of being lonely.

817
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,660
That's why I tried setting you up.

818
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,470
I know.

819
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,950
But now I get it.

820
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,580
Even if you do find someone again,

821
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:50,910
one of you is still going
to leave first.

822
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,430
No matter who you're with,
they only join a part of your life.

823
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,790
Peng Yulan, you've really become

824
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,870
so wise with age.

825
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:05,580
Yes.

826
00:41:06,111 --> 00:41:08,533
Yes, it's something
that needs to be thought through.

827
00:41:09,488 --> 00:41:10,620
But I still can't let it go.

828
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:12,488
I need to settle some scores
with my husband.

829
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,100
What did Liu do again this time?

830
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,310
But it's a little salty.

831
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:18,950
Add this.

832
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,310
Our honored guest!

833
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:22,260
Liu.

834
00:41:22,288 --> 00:41:22,870
Hello, madam.

835
00:41:23,155 --> 00:41:24,450
- Come here.
- Liu, you're here.

836
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,130
- You're eating?
- Where's the rest of the group?

837
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:28,030
They are not here yet.

838
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,030
So I came first.

839
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:33,022
You're all having your meals now?

840
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:34,577
How about you join us?

841
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,470
Come and join us.

842
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:36,030
Me?

843
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:36,620
Come on, Liu.

844
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:36,990
I...

845
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:37,660
Sit.

846
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:38,790
Come on.

847
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,220
Don't be shy.

848
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,140
Sit down.

849
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,390
Get the utensils.

850
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,390
Okay.

851
00:41:46,266 --> 00:41:46,866
All right.

852
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,022
Okay then.

853
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,060
You're so polite.

854
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:49,660
Eat some.

855
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,470
Please make yourself at home here.

856
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:51,950
Okay.

857
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:52,430
Here, Liu.

858
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:53,220
Thank you.

859
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,220
Thank you.

860
00:41:54,266 --> 00:41:55,133
Please enjoy your meal.

861
00:41:55,422 --> 00:41:56,140
Give him some rice.

862
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,430
Serve some rice.

863
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:58,740
Madam,

864
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,430
you don't have to serve me.

865
00:42:00,711 --> 00:42:01,377
Here you go.

866
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:02,030
Eat more.

867
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,180
Okay.

868
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,830
Here, have some chives.

869
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:05,910
Thank you.

870
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,030
Actually,

871
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,580
I came here today...

872
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:09,620
I...

873
00:42:09,755 --> 00:42:10,430
All right.

874
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,620
I wanted

875
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:14,470
to discuss

876
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,220
something with you.

877
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,310
Well, you see.

878
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,620
Don't be a busybody.

879
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,466
Just eat your meal.

880
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,470
Let's eat.

881
00:42:25,888 --> 00:42:26,822
Yes, eat our meal.

882
00:42:29,955 --> 00:42:30,866
What is it?

883
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,540
Well...

884
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,540
Actually...

885
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,260
It's about the...

886
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,470
Well,

887
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,100
it's pretty simple.

888
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,100
I wanted to...

889
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,088
How about you eat something first?

890
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,430
Eat first.

891
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:54,511
Then you can tell me later.

892
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,540
Tell me after you eat.

893
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,580
Oh,

894
00:42:57,844 --> 00:42:59,222
