=Love Again=

2
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,000
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,200
Shen Qing.

4
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,680
You don't know
what I went through this night.

5
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,719
Your sister just had surgery.

6
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,769
She can't even walk upright

7
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,190
and is already lashing out
at everyone and her fellow patients.

8
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,760
How exaggerated. Really?

9
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,879
Back then,

10
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,239
she waited for Liang for years

11
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,519
and ended up with a lot of diseases.

12
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,079
I still have to take care of her.

13
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,079
I pity my dad.

14
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,400
For years,

15
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,869
he was always a phone call away

16
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,577
to fix the toilet
and install light bulbs.

17
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,590
He served loyally
and achieved many great things.

18
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,840
You claimed to be building your career

19
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:15,088
and left all work to others.

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,199
Even your sister gave my dad attitude.

21
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
Unbelievable.

22
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:21,280
I know your dad is good to us.

23
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,280
Look.

24
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,319
(Paid)
A fishing rod worth 1,688 yuan

25
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,520
is already on the way.

26
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,400
Not all gratitude
is expressed with words.

27
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,759
That's all I earned

28
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,520
from working all day,
taking care of everyone in your family.

29
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,759
Our family is scholarly,

30
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,840
but you portrayed us as feudal remnants.

31
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,919
Are you a child bride?

32
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,960
You have to pay for a child bride.

33
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:47,520
I came with a dowry.

34
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,680
I'll stop talking. I'm going to work.

35
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,719
You can't outtalk me.

36
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:53,680
Drink your milk.

37
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,240
Be safe.

38
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,240
Here, Dai.

39
00:03:03,088 --> 00:03:04,222
Take your medicine.

40
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:10,560
Thank you.

41
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:15,755
Drink some water.

42
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,080
Take a few more sips, okay?

43
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:22,555
No, that's enough.

44
00:03:22,555 --> 00:03:24,622
You need to drink more water
when taking medicine.

45
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,444
It will promote your metabolism, okay?

46
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,680
Do you...

47
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,800
want to go to the bathroom?

48
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,960
Don't hold it in.

49
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,560
Here, I'll help you down.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,360
No need.

51
00:03:43,755 --> 00:03:44,520
I can do it myself.

52
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,919
Don't move.

53
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,955
The sister-in-law is incapable.

54
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,599
This sister is efficient.

55
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,319
Sister?

56
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,159
They don't look alike.

57
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:58,879
It seems so.

58
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,000
Is she the aunt?

59
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,560
It must be the woman's family

60
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,039
who takes care of her.

61
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,479
She's still spoiled by so many people
at her age.

62
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:08,360
No wonder she has such a bad temper.

63
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,240
I'll do it myself.

64
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:17,879
It's okay.

65
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,000
It's okay.

66
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,279
Here, I'll help you unbutton your pants.

67
00:04:24,577 --> 00:04:25,600
No, I can do it myself.

68
00:04:25,777 --> 00:04:27,360
Be careful of the vein-detained needle.

69
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,800
No, I can do it.

70
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:29,920
It's a special circumstance.

71
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Just consider me a nurse.

72
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:32,600
Okay?

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,090
It's a special circumstance.

74
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,879
Here, slow down.

75
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:40,879
Don't do it.

76
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:47,160
Okay.

77
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:48,759
Here.

78
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,439
Don't panic. Take it slow.

79
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,040
Here.

80
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,160
Okay, be careful.

81
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,079
Tanghulu for sale.

82
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,839
Tanghulu for sale.

83
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:09,759
Tanghulu for sale.

84
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:11,950
I want two sticks.

85
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:12,940
How many?

86
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,680
- Two sticks.
- Okay.

87
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:16,680
How do I pay you?

88
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:17,480
QR code.

89
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,422
- I can pay by QR code.
- You can pay by QR code.

90
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:22,240
Paid.

91
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:22,639
Okay.

92
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,519
Okay.

93
00:05:25,066 --> 00:05:25,960
- Thank you.
- Okay.

94
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,480
Be careful.

95
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,044
Thank you.

96
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:27,488
Okay.

97
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,079
Okay.

98
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,079
Here.

99
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,511
Here, take your time.

100
00:05:34,244 --> 00:05:35,190
It's finally quiet.

101
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,266
Looks like everyone
has gone for their checkup.

102
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,160
Good timing.

103
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,030
Take advantage of this opportunity.

104
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,319
Take a short nap.

105
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,160
I'll do it. Here.

106
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,000
- Here.
- I'll do it. Don't stretch.

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,360
Here.

108
00:05:53,088 --> 00:05:54,000
Give me a minute.

109
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:55,360
Drink some water first.

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,040
You can drink water now.

111
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,800
Drink some water.

112
00:06:03,755 --> 00:06:06,266
You should take care of yourself
when you're young.

113
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,000
Otherwise,

114
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,270
it will be difficult to treat

115
00:06:08,977 --> 00:06:10,200
if it becomes a lasting issue.

116
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:19,639
How about we

117
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,120
take advantage of the silence

118
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,120
to have a good chat?

119
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:32,839
Go ahead.

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,720
Actually,

121
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,040
I...

122
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:46,079
I decided

123
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,040
to be with your dad

124
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,355
because of how loyal he was

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,560
to your mother.

126
00:06:57,288 --> 00:06:59,480
People only go to the hospital
once every few years.

127
00:06:59,844 --> 00:07:00,920
They don't understand

128
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,800
the feeling of needing someone's care.

129
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,079
But your dad

130
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,279
has high blood pressure
and an unhealthy heart.

131
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,199
Maybe

132
00:07:12,511 --> 00:07:14,630
he needs to go to the hospital
every month or so

133
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,199
to have a checkup.

134
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,360
You and Shen Qing are busy.

135
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,360
With me by his side,

136
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,688
you two can work without worry,

137
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,879
no matter how busy you are.

138
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,240
Ms. Lian.

139
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,920
My dad is so much older than you.

140
00:07:55,155 --> 00:07:56,480
He's not in good health either.

141
00:07:58,444 --> 00:07:59,955
What do you want from him?

142
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,399
What I want?

143
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,519
If you demand a reason,

144
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,639
I think it might be

145
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,360
because I admire him

146
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,639
and love him.

147
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,319
Speak of the devil.

148
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,480
Dad.

149
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,040
Dai.

150
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,120
Why are you here?

151
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,120
I brought you some food.

152
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,090
How are you?
Are you feeling better today?

153
00:08:28,222 --> 00:08:29,088
I feel much better.

154
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,311
It's so heavy.

155
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,279
Dai.

156
00:08:35,888 --> 00:08:37,222
(Tanghulu)
Look what this is.

157
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,559
Dad.

158
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,240
I'm not a kid anymore,

159
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,555
yet you still bought this for me.

160
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,480
Let me tell you.

161
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,240
People's tastes don't change
as they age.

162
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,399
Do you remember loving this

163
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:51,559
when you were a kid?

164
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,389
Your mom always said, "It's dirty.

165
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,400
Don't buy that for her."

166
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:56,090
Later,
I often bought it for you secretly.

167
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,977
Remember that?

168
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,759
When I came to deliver food today,

169
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,840
I saw a stall next to the hospital

170
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,399
and hurried over to buy it for you.

171
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:06,000
Eat it.

172
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,639
Ms. Lian.

173
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:12,919
Can I eat this?

174
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,960
I forgot. Can she eat it?

175
00:09:16,377 --> 00:09:17,000
It's okay.

176
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,240
Just don't eat so much.

177
00:09:19,422 --> 00:09:20,200
Don't eat so much.

178
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,399
Have a good chat with your daughter.

179
00:09:25,422 --> 00:09:26,511
I'll go get some water.

180
00:09:26,577 --> 00:09:27,150
Dad, have one.

181
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,200
No thanks.

182
00:09:28,244 --> 00:09:28,870
You can eat.

183
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:31,360
Yilian.

184
00:09:35,711 --> 00:09:37,111
(Tanghulu)
You have one too.

185
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,111
Hurry and eat it.

186
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,360
Okay, I'll eat later.

187
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:43,360
Eat it.

188
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,279
Look.

189
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:45,480
Come on.

190
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,679
Is it sweet?

191
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,039
(Emergency)

192
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:17,600
Shen Qing.

193
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,120
We're out.

194
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,320
Drive to the east entrance.

195
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,120
Ms. Lian, I'll take the bag.

196
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,644
It's okay.

197
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,100
You must follow the doctor's advice.

198
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,679
Remember not to eat spicy food.

199
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,360
You two, don't... Wait a moment.

200
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,480
There's a wheelchair
at the nurse's station.

201
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,288
I'll go borrow one.

202
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,799
- Let me go.
- Dad.

203
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,639
I don't need a wheelchair, do I?

204
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,440
Well, you just got discharged.

205
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:36,666
You should be careful.

206
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:09,519
Lin Fengyun.

207
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,679
Are you free?

208
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,840
Steven's mom opened a steakhouse.

209
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,733
I need to bring some friends
to support her.

210
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,080
You're about to meet his mom?

211
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,200
Are you going to call her Miss

212
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,279
or Aunt?

213
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,960
You'll find out what I call her
if you come.

214
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,749
I can't go.

215
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,955
My annoying sister-in-law
is getting discharged today.

216
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,600
Goodbye then.

217
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,200
Bye.

218
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,679
Shen Dai.

219
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,039
Look.

220
00:11:34,288 --> 00:11:35,820
This isn't a discharge
from the hospital.

221
00:11:35,822 --> 00:11:37,200
It's more like a triumphant return.

222
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,440
She's a princess going home.

223
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:39,799
Dad and Ms. Lian together

224
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:40,909
are over 100 years old.

225
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,960
They're always by her side.

226
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,399
The two of us line up to welcome her.

227
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,720
You're not allowed to laugh at me.

228
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,177
The princess has given the order.

229
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,080
I'm so scared.

230
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,799
Dad, look at them.

231
00:11:48,888 --> 00:11:51,066
You two are not allowed
to make fun of Dai anymore.

232
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:53,510
Dad said you two are not allowed
to make fun of Dai anymore.

233
00:11:53,511 --> 00:11:54,200
We'll stop.

234
00:11:54,466 --> 00:11:55,720
Come on, let's get into the car.

235
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,000
Okay.

236
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,080
Pull back again.

237
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,320
Push out again.

238
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,480
Let it form a gas.

239
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,000
Turn the gas into a circle.

240
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,519
Yes, turn it into a circle.

241
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:15,919
Look.

242
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:18,679
The gas is all in your hand,
no matter how you turn it.

243
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:19,159
Right?

244
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,440
How professional.

245
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,080
Today I learned.

246
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,000
(Medication Plan)

247
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:34,960
Get up at 6.30 AM,

248
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,720
go downstairs at 6.35 AM
and exercise for half an hour.

249
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,666
(Health Check-In Table)
Go downstairs at 7.20 AM.

250
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,480
Help Dad get the newspaper.

251
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,399
Attention: Can't take the elevator.

252
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,559
What the hell is this?

253
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,919
It's a health check-in table.

254
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,559
I learned this from Ms. Lian.

255
00:12:52,311 --> 00:12:53,910
She not only prepared one for your dad.

256
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:55,320
She also prepared one for Shen Dai.

257
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,480
I'll serve Mr. Shen

258
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
in the professional way.

259
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,111
I work daily and need to clock in.

260
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:02,750
I still have to check in
when I get home.

261
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,030
Are you trying to kill me?

262
00:13:04,444 --> 00:13:07,355
You should take good care of your health
when you reach middle age.

263
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:09,600
How can you be ungrateful?

264
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,120
Where are you going?

265
00:13:11,244 --> 00:13:12,360
I'm having dinner with Dad.

266
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:13,960
Dad has a beautiful companion.

267
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,190
You don't need to accompany him.

268
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:16,066
Don't go!

269
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,840
Coming.

270
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,440
Dai.

271
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,039
Lina.

272
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,759
What's this?

273
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,000
Where did you get this?

274
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:44,919
You sent something

275
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,440
this sexy and private

276
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,159
to the wrong address.

277
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
Luckily, I helped you intercept it.

278
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,679
I didn't buy this.

279
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:53,440
It's not you?

280
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,000
Your brother and I don't need this.

281
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,120
How much is it?

282
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,440
456 yuan?

283
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,600
Who would spend this money?

284
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:17,799
Hurry over.

285
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,759
Right here.

286
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,679
This one.

287
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,799
Turns out your dad likes this.

288
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,639
Your dad might like this too.

289
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,559
Your dad is already 70 years old.

290
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:39,720
Speaking of which,

291
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,240
I think my dad must have met the one.

292
00:14:44,755 --> 00:14:46,390
What do we do with this? You opened it.

293
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:48,440
Find an empty box.

294
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:49,559
Is this okay?

295
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,720
Not bad.

296
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,120
It's just right.

297
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:53,919
I've put it.

298
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,799
Go ahead.

299
00:14:59,039 --> 00:14:59,879
Go back.

300
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,200
Okay.

301
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,120
Dad.

302
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:10,080
There's a package for you at the door.

303
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,200
Do you need help opening it?

304
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:14,720
No.

305
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:33,840
Don't panic.

306
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,200
- Be safe.
- Okay.

307
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,159
Come back early tonight.

308
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:36,840
Sure.

309
00:15:37,577 --> 00:15:40,150
Remember to take the traditional
medicine to adjust your sleep.

310
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,030
I'll take it on time.

311
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,919
Eat a good breakfast.

312
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,120
Eat a full lunch.

313
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,440
Try to eat less for dinner.

314
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,399
Health tips.

315
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,480
Ms. Lian made you

316
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,240
sea cucumber millet porridge.

317
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,320
Eat more. Here.

318
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,000
We've eaten.

319
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,759
How is that eating?

320
00:16:03,244 --> 00:16:04,480
You're counting the rice grains.

321
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:05,679
Here.

322
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,440
Let me pour you some more.

323
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,440
It's enough, Dad.

324
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,030
You replied in unison.

325
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,720
Dad, it's mainly because

326
00:16:13,777 --> 00:16:15,288
those who are capable work harder.

327
00:16:15,355 --> 00:16:16,155
Eat more.

328
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:18,733
Being able to eat is a blessing.

329
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,000
Delicious.

330
00:16:25,711 --> 00:16:26,666
Speaking of, Dad.

331
00:16:27,622 --> 00:16:28,511
I don't think

332
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,155
there's anything for me to do here.

333
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,870
I'm going to check the plane tickets

334
00:16:31,955 --> 00:16:33,555
to go back to the United States.

335
00:16:34,755 --> 00:16:36,030
You're going back so soon?

336
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:39,000
No.

337
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,559
Your wound hasn't healed yet.

338
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,080
It's a long flight.

339
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,688
You'll be on the plane for so long.

340
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:47,200
If your wound is exposed again...

341
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:47,960
Besides,

342
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:50,559
who will take care of you
after you return?

343
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,679
Is the food abroad

344
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,720
nutritious?

345
00:16:54,244 --> 00:16:55,600
It's better to stay at home.

346
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,600
Rest a bit longer.

347
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,720
No, Dad.

348
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:01,960
Stop eating for a while.

349
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,639
Here, let me ask you a question.

350
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:04,640
Answer me honestly.

351
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:07,880
Are you reluctant to let me go?

352
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,119
Yes.

353
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,720
You've learned to express your feelings.

354
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,720
There's progress.

355
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,880
You have to go even if he's reluctant.

356
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,200
You're a hindrance here.

357
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,880
Shut up.

358
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,920
Eat more sea cucumber porridge.

359
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,060
Let me pour you another bowl.

360
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:26,800
Give it to Dad.

361
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,400
Yes.

362
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,777
Those who are capable work harder.

363
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,711
Dad, have another bowl.

364
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,960
(Sleepwear)

365
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,000
You're back?

366
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,519
Why do you reek of alcohol?

367
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,622
Here, give it to me.

368
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,839
I drank at noon.

369
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:49,799
I've rested in the company
the entire afternoon.

370
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,960
I really can't drink this much.

371
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,088
It's really a waste of time.

372
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,079
Take a shower first.

373
00:17:55,244 --> 00:17:55,955
Take a shower.

374
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:04,559
Dear, do you want me to help you?

375
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,680
I'll help you rub your back.

376
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:06,880
What are you doing?

377
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:09,640
- I'm afraid you'll fall.
- I'm taking a shower.

378
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,519
Aren't you drunk?

379
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,790
Let me help you wash.

380
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,666
You make me sound like a three-year-old.

381
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:15,799
Get out.

382
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,920
Okay, wash yourself.

383
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,000
Close the door.

384
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,319
Here, have a glass of honey water.

385
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,400
Sober up.

386
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,279
Miss.

387
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,200
You've ruined the warmth
in the bathroom.

388
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:33,749
Who are you calling Miss?

389
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,400
Drink it now.
Are you drinking it or not?

390
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:36,079
I'll drink it.

391
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,000
Hurry up and get out.

392
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:38,799
It won't kill you.

393
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:42,359
You...

394
00:18:42,711 --> 00:18:44,422
You didn't close the door again.

395
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,839
Mature women are treasures.

396
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,240
There are new surprises every day.

397
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,310
What do you think of this sleepwear?

398
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,599
My wife looks beautiful in anything.

399
00:18:53,955 --> 00:18:55,222
It's not me who wears it.

400
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,920
Ms. Lian bought this sleepwear.

401
00:18:59,488 --> 00:19:00,400
She's exposing here

402
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,599
and here.

403
00:19:03,022 --> 00:19:04,880
Who do you think she's wearing this for?

404
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,920
Your dad is already 70 years old.

405
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:11,279
You'll also buy one when I'm 70.

406
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,200
Your dad and Ms. Lian
are the embodiment of love.

407
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,920
Do you hear me?

408
00:19:20,044 --> 00:19:21,920
I can't make a mistake
on even a decimal point.

409
00:19:21,955 --> 00:19:23,977
You can't make a mistake
on even a decimal point?

410
00:19:24,022 --> 00:19:26,266
(Financial Statement)
You can ignore your wife then?

411
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,269
Every day, you either drink or work

412
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,266
and sit in front of the computer
when you get home.

413
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:31,720
You don't care about me at all.

414
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,644
How do you want me to care about you?

415
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,960
I drank.

416
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,160
I drank today.

417
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,480
You said it last time.

418
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,800
Drinking and indulging in sex
are harmful to my health.

419
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,880
Hug me then.

420
00:19:42,777 --> 00:19:44,160
It shouldn't be hard to hug me.

421
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,960
This report is urgent.

422
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,680
I told you.

423
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,319
Hug me.

424
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,279
Just one minute.

425
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:06,279
Shen Qing.

426
00:20:06,422 --> 00:20:08,511
How long has it been
since we last hugged each other?

427
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,350
You have 30 seconds left.

428
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,066
Do you think hugging your wife
is like doing a plank?

429
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,000
Is it unbearable

430
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,279
that you even have to count down?

431
00:20:19,311 --> 00:20:20,679
I think you're overly unromantic.

432
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,510
You need to fix that.

433
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,600
Fix it however you want.

434
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:23,577
One minute is up.

435
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,319
Shen Qing.

436
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:27,359
I'm talking to you seriously.

437
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,440
Starting tomorrow,

438
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,133
you have to learn from your dad.

439
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:32,030
You must hug me
before going to bed at night

440
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,890
and kiss me goodbye
when leaving in the morning

441
00:20:33,955 --> 00:20:35,711
There are no specific rules
during the day.

442
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:36,400
But you

443
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,444
have to send me
a WeChat message at noon.

444
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:41,440
Liu Lina, what triggered you?

445
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:44,319
When you reach middle age,

446
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:46,920
you need a sense of ritual in life
all the more.

447
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,480
What kind of idol drama
have you been watching?

448
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,519
Dai.

449
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,160
This is for you.

450
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,680
Life needs a sense of ritual after all.

451
00:21:15,755 --> 00:21:17,830
I remember
that these are your favorite flowers.

452
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,079
Dai.

453
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:31,680
Dai.

454
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:33,480
I think

455
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,240
some things should be made clear.

456
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,119
I received a call

457
00:21:40,044 --> 00:21:41,270
at the operating room door.

458
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,200
The school called.

459
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:47,039
They said my son
was beaten by his senior.

460
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:48,644
He was seriously injured.

461
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,200
That's why I...

462
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,160
Liang.

463
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,319
Let me come clean.

464
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:03,960
My illness this time

465
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,640
cured all the after-effects

466
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,279
from before.

467
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,920
We had a serious relationship.

468
00:22:22,088 --> 00:22:23,350
I think that's good enough.

469
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:26,400
Don't you think so?

470
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,200
I've moved on.

471
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,599
I hope you can move on too.

472
00:22:47,155 --> 00:22:48,355
A toast to the present.

473
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,920
(Tomb of Loving Mother, Chen Jingmin)

474
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,279
Mom.

475
00:23:32,066 --> 00:23:34,266
I will be returning
to the United States tomorrow.

476
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,960
The next time I come back

477
00:23:38,977 --> 00:23:40,866
will probably be
during the Qingming Festival.

478
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,680
I never came back
during the Chinese New Year.

479
00:23:45,088 --> 00:23:47,266
Now, I come back every year
for the Qingming Festival.

480
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:50,599
How unfilial am I?

481
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:56,799
Mom.

482
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,759
I still miss you very much.

483
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,079
I really miss you.

484
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,160
And why do you

485
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,160
keep appearing in Shen Duole's dreams?

486
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,519
Why don't you appear in my dreams?

487
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,160
My last name is Shen too.

488
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:13,240
And didn't you say before

489
00:24:13,355 --> 00:24:15,733
that I will always
be your and Dad's little princess?

490
00:24:15,777 --> 00:24:16,444
Alright.

491
00:24:16,466 --> 00:24:18,177
Mom doesn't want to see you cry.

492
00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:23,111
Speaking of, Mom.

493
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,160
I visited Dad this time.

494
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,920
He's doing well in every aspect.

495
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:29,680
Well...

496
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,960
Ms. Lian is pretty good too.

497
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,200
Why are you telling Mom this?

498
00:24:33,844 --> 00:24:34,890
It's almost time to leave.

499
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,200
Mom, we'll go now.

500
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,759
I'll stop talking.

501
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,640
Mom, we'll go now.

502
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,911
(Tomb of Loving Mother, Chen Jingmin)

503
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:46,720
Qing.

504
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:47,920
Sorry.

505
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
I'm still so willful at this age.

506
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:51,640
I was even mad at you.

507
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:53,079
We're a family.

508
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:54,960
There aren't
that many things to apologize for.

509
00:24:56,133 --> 00:24:58,310
We're all geniuses
when it comes to expressing hatred.

510
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,640
But we only say one thing
when it comes to expressing love.

511
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,519
We're a family.

512
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,200
Alright, stop being sentimental.

513
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,640
Did I forget to tell you?

514
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:31,880
Have you added ginger?

515
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,680
Dai doesn't like ginger.

516
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:37,359
I asked before.

517
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,319
Don't worry.

518
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,119
But I added a little ginger juice

519
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,000
to remove the meat's raw smell.

520
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,720
Good.

521
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:45,640
Is that okay?

522
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,079
Okay.

523
00:26:47,066 --> 00:26:48,711
Do you think this is about right?

524
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,400
Good job.

525
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:54,720
Look at this.

526
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:55,920
It's pretty good, right?

527
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:57,440
Not bad.

528
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,266
It smells good.

529
00:26:58,711 --> 00:27:00,110
You seem to be quite good at it.

530
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:00,599
Dad.

531
00:27:01,222 --> 00:27:02,955
Are you making me some egg dumplings?

532
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,480
Yes, Ms. Lian said

533
00:27:04,933 --> 00:27:07,720
we should make your favorite
egg dumplings for the last meal.

534
00:27:08,755 --> 00:27:09,888
Have you packed your things?

535
00:27:09,911 --> 00:27:11,311
I'm almost done packing my luggage.

536
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,039
Dad.

537
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,640
After I leave,

538
00:27:16,444 --> 00:27:17,733
take good care of yourself.

539
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,200
Most importantly,

540
00:27:20,088 --> 00:27:20,960
be nice to Ms. Lian.

541
00:27:24,866 --> 00:27:26,022
I'll keep that in mind.

542
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,488
Then I'll give you
a few words of advice.

543
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,680
After you go back,

544
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,920
take care of yourself

545
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:33,359
and eat on time.

546
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,640
Also,

547
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,799
consider moving home
as soon as possible.

548
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:37,960
This home

549
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,519
will always be yours.

550
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,519
I know.

551
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,279
Ms. Lian.

552
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,720
The password to my room
is my dad's birthday.

553
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,400
I think you already know that.

554
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,440
If you find

555
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,960
any of my mom's belongings,

556
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:57,559
just put them in my room.

557
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:58,480
Okay.

558
00:27:59,079 --> 00:27:59,400
Okay.

559
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,640
Ms. Lian.

560
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,279
Thank you again
for taking care of my dad.

561
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:10,920
You gave my dad the courage to live

562
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:12,680
and also made our home

563
00:28:13,444 --> 00:28:14,590
feel like a home again.

564
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:34,559
Ms. Lian.

565
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:36,319
I will now

566
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:38,319
leave my dad to you.

567
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:43,759
Okay.

568
00:28:55,377 --> 00:28:57,688
A mother worries about her son
when he's away from home.

569
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,000
My daughter

570
00:29:02,066 --> 00:29:04,622
appears tough but is soft-hearted.
And she's stubborn.

571
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:07,000
Fortunately,
she got sick here this time.

572
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:08,680
If it happened abroad,

573
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,720
it would be a big problem.

574
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,720
No matter how old the children are,

575
00:29:15,022 --> 00:29:16,640
they're
the apple of their parents' eyes.

576
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,222
That's right.

577
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:18,759
Here.

578
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:19,640
I'll do it myself.

579
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:24,350
What is this? Eggplant?

580
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:26,759
Hello? Son.

581
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,640
It's okay. Don't worry.

582
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,440
Okay, I got it.

583
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:34,960
Okay.

584
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,560
Is there a problem?

585
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,480
How about

586
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:42,519
I go home first?

587
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:43,511
Take your time to eat.

588
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:44,480
Let me go with you.

589
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,400
No need.

590
00:29:45,466 --> 00:29:46,370
Take your time to eat.

591
00:29:47,466 --> 00:29:48,590
Let me assign you a task.

592
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:50,680
If you're willing,

593
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,880
help me buy some vegetables

594
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,160
after you wake up.

595
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,280
Can you?

596
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:55,440
If I'm willing?

597
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:56,319
I'm willing.

598
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:57,759
I'm always willing and ready

599
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:59,680
to carry out the tasks

600
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,519
assigned by Ms. Lian.

601
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,390
But don't forget to take your medicine.

602
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,160
I've set an alarm for you.

603
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,355
Make sure to tick the box
after taking the medicine.

604
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:07,920
I remember.

605
00:30:07,955 --> 00:30:09,600
You should
hurry over and come back soon.

606
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,400
I'm leaving.

607
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,466
(RF Pharmaceuticals)
The essence of the M701

608
00:30:18,511 --> 00:30:19,830
we're currently developing

609
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:22,160
is to activate T cells in the body

610
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,400
to immunologically kill tumor cells,

611
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:27,640
thereby inhibiting
the growth of tumor cells.

612
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,920
The inhibitor developed
by Dr. William and his wife

613
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:34,359
can recruit T cells
to the tumor cells...

614
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:40,599
Dear.

615
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:42,200
Have you eaten?

616
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,200
I'm in a meeting.

617
00:30:44,622 --> 00:30:45,822
I'll get back to you later.

618
00:30:47,822 --> 00:30:48,800
Let's continue.

619
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:52,039
He has meetings around the clock.

620
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,519
Madam, you can't pinch it.

621
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,519
How can I know if it's fresh
if I don't pinch it?

622
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:01,920
Right? Look.

623
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:03,319
Is this edible?

624
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,509
It's inedible.

625
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,711
If you pinch it, it's yours.

626
00:31:05,755 --> 00:31:07,160
How about this?

627
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,240
Give me a discount.

628
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,240
How about 5.5 yuan?

629
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:10,240
Alright.

630
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,240
Zhuoran.

631
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,000
Zhuoran.

632
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,400
How much for the tomatoes?

633
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,920
I knew I saw you.

634
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:18,880
Baoqin.

635
00:31:19,022 --> 00:31:19,790
What a coincidence

636
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,279
to bump into you.

637
00:31:21,288 --> 00:31:22,900
It's not a coincidence
if you bump into me.

638
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,350
It's a coincidence if I bump into you.

639
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:25,880
I buy vegetables here every day.

640
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:26,960
What's the matter?

641
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,960
You buy vegetables yourself?

642
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:31,079
This market is quite interesting.

643
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:31,880
Interesting?

644
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,720
Let me tell you.

645
00:31:33,488 --> 00:31:35,088
Go to the vegetable stall over there.

646
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:36,319
I've got a discount.

647
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,240
I just...

648
00:31:37,311 --> 00:31:37,790
Let's go.

649
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:38,519
I'll buy here.

650
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,440
Let's go.

651
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:41,799
I'm telling you.
This stall has a lot of vegetables.

652
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,279
We can get a bigger discount.

653
00:31:43,955 --> 00:31:45,911
See if there are any vegetables
you want to buy.

654
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,319
This loofah is pretty good.

655
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,720
I have to see if it's in the list.

656
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,839
Okay. Take a look.

657
00:31:51,622 --> 00:31:53,688
(Shopping List:
Loofah, Lettuce, Chinese Cabbage...)

658
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,244
Have you taken a look?

659
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:55,839
No.

660
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:00,240
Yes, you need loofah.

661
00:32:01,066 --> 00:32:02,440
- Okay.
- What a coincidence.

662
00:32:02,466 --> 00:32:03,270
What a coincidence.

663
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,759
Let me choose for you.

664
00:32:04,888 --> 00:32:06,310
You have nothing to worry about.

665
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:07,880
Well...

666
00:32:07,911 --> 00:32:09,777
Look,
I got you another customer, didn't I?

667
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,222
This...

668
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:11,359
You can't pinch it.

669
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,599
I have to pinch it.

670
00:32:13,733 --> 00:32:15,400
Madam,
I've already given you a discount.

671
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,488
You can't pinch it anymore.

672
00:32:16,488 --> 00:32:18,270
I can just cut it off when I get home.

673
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:19,720
No.

674
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,039
This is heavy.

675
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,920
You men
don't know how to buy vegetables.

676
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:24,359
I never let Liu buy.

677
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:27,119
Of course, you're different now.

678
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,240
Okay.

679
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:28,790
That's all.

680
00:32:29,622 --> 00:32:31,440
Weigh it properly
and make sure it's enough.

681
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,240
Don't worry.

682
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,480
8.2 yuan.

683
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,079
0.2 yuan?

684
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,839
8 yuan. We'll both prosper.

685
00:32:36,866 --> 00:32:37,770
Fine, scan the QR code.

686
00:32:37,777 --> 00:32:38,470
Okay, I've paid.

687
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:39,640
I've paid.

688
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,119
Let me...

689
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:42,759
We're a family. Don't be so polite.

690
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:43,640
Here. Open it.

691
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,400
See if you need any more vegetables.

692
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:45,960
Here.

693
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,759
No.

694
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:47,755
I've bought everything.

695
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,555
I'll go home first.

696
00:32:48,622 --> 00:32:49,830
Fine. Okay.

697
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:51,440
Okay, bye. Be careful.

698
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,309
You work hard.

699
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:56,866
You're even doing housework.

700
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:03,960
Dad.

701
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,440
I brought you the newspaper.

702
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:07,960
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

703
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,160
Ms. Lian is occupied today.

704
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,119
I'll cook myself.

705
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:14,240
If Ms. Lian is occupied, let me do it.

706
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,200
Do you know how to cook?

707
00:33:15,288 --> 00:33:17,310
No need. I'll learn
if I don't know how to cook.

708
00:33:17,311 --> 00:33:18,955
I can't spend my whole life

709
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:21,269
waiting for others to feed me, can I?

710
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:21,930
Let me help you.

711
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,160
Here. Let me do it.

712
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,799
No.

713
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,960
I want to do it myself.

714
00:33:25,644 --> 00:33:26,480
By the way, Lina,

715
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:29,039
I ran into your mom at the market today.

716
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,559
You even went to the market?

717
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:34,519
Ms. Lian really trained you well.

718
00:33:34,644 --> 00:33:36,750
We learn from each other
and make progress together.

719
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,960
Okay.

720
00:33:50,466 --> 00:33:51,200
What do you think?

721
00:33:51,933 --> 00:33:52,510
It tastes good.

722
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,920
Your father-in-law

723
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,359
knows how to buy vegetables

724
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:00,519
and can cook now.

725
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:03,119
Yes.

726
00:34:03,266 --> 00:34:05,155
But when your mother-in-law was alive,

727
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,279
he couldn't

728
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,359
do any housework.

729
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:12,920
My mother-in-law
didn't get to enjoy much.

730
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,400
Let me see.

731
00:34:17,444 --> 00:34:18,280
Let me see who it is.

732
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,119
What are you doing?

733
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:19,920
Let me see who it is.

734
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,280
You're back.

735
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,440
Here.

736
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,840
Hurry, you worked hard.

737
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,666
Give this to me.

738
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:25,155
It's okay.

739
00:34:25,177 --> 00:34:25,755
Here.

740
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,440
It's necessary.

741
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,440
Take your time. Please come in.

742
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:30,039
Lina.

743
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,000
Come here.

744
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,880
What are you doing?

745
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,239
Look, Ms. Lian is back.

746
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,679
They do this every day. I'm used to it.

747
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,159
You...

748
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,559
Look at me.

749
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:47,190
You imitated her pretty well.

750
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,000
I must say.

751
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,719
She's gentle killer.

752
00:34:57,044 --> 00:34:58,320
She's over 50 years old, right?

753
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:00,800
She had him wrapped around her fingers.

754
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,840
Ms. Lian

755
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:07,519
just acts coquettishly
and wipes her tears.

756
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,440
She says nothing else

757
00:35:09,511 --> 00:35:11,022
and settles everything.

758
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,480
You...

759
00:35:13,577 --> 00:35:14,190
What?

760
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:16,239
You need to learn from her.
She's your role model.

761
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,159
Here. Hurry up.

762
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,960
Here.

763
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:24,230
Please take a look.

764
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,159
I bought the ingredients, cooked them,

765
00:35:27,555 --> 00:35:29,222
and served them all by myself.

766
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:32,199
Let's not talk about the taste first.

767
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,360
Isn't my intention commendable?

768
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,154
I've always been the one
to rush home to cook.

769
00:35:39,155 --> 00:35:41,222
It's the first time
I've eaten ready-made food.

770
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,280
Let me tell you.

771
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:44,280
Those days are forever gone.

772
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:46,711
You're finally getting your reward
after all the hardship.

773
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:49,280
Come and take a seat.

774
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:50,000
Here.

775
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:52,199
Try it.

776
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,280
Try it.

777
00:36:05,866 --> 00:36:06,800
I didn't expect it.

778
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:08,199
This

779
00:36:09,644 --> 00:36:10,360
is the best dish

780
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,519
I've ever eaten

781
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,320
in my life.

782
00:36:19,066 --> 00:36:20,866
This is the most exaggerated praise

783
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:23,920
I've ever heard.

784
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,719
But I can accept it.

785
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,199
Here. Eat more.

786
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:33,920
If it tastes good, eat more.

787
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,239
Can I

788
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,719
take something to pack the food?

789
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,880
You have even more exaggerated praises?

790
00:36:47,222 --> 00:36:49,200
Pack the food?
Where are you taking it with you?

791
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:49,960
To exhibit it?

792
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,199
No, that's not what I meant.

793
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:53,320
What I mean is...

794
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:56,599
Well...

795
00:36:58,511 --> 00:36:59,666
- Well...
- What's wrong?

796
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:00,880
Lian Jin

797
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,840
has a slight fever.

798
00:37:02,866 --> 00:37:04,530
His white blood cell count
is a bit high.

799
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:07,119
The doctor suggested
that he should use some antibiotics.

800
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,760
So he's still in the hospital.

801
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,960
I have to bring him some food.

802
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

803
00:37:14,088 --> 00:37:16,019
It's my fault.
I didn't take good care of him.

804
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,280
I thought he just caught a cold.

805
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,355
It's not your fault.

806
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,480
It's my fault.

807
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:24,480
You were just hurrying back
to cook for me.

808
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,770
You were so busy taking care of me

809
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,880
that you ignored him.

810
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:28,639
Let's go.

811
00:37:28,644 --> 00:37:30,480
Let's go to the hospital together
to see him.

812
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,000
Alright.

813
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,719
I can travel back and forth by myself.

814
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:33,719
I don't need to take you

815
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:34,320
with me.

816
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,119
What do you mean?

817
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:39,320
You took good care of my daughter.

818
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:41,519
Why can't I

819
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:43,000
take care of your son?

820
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:45,400
Besides, we're a family.

821
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,466
There's no need
to differentiate between us.

822
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,400
Thank you.

823
00:37:59,466 --> 00:38:01,280
Thank you for not minding my son and me.

824
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,000
Look at me.

825
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,199
I should be the one to thank you.

826
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,079
I'm old and frail.

827
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,155
Thank you two for not minding me.

828
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,022
While it's hot,

829
00:38:37,466 --> 00:38:38,644
let's pack them up.

830
00:38:39,288 --> 00:38:40,710
We'll eat together in the hospital.

831
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:00,880
Dear, is your banquet over?

832
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,679
When can you come home?

833
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,599
Gentle killer.

834
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,119
Gentle killer.

835
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:25,079
Dear, you're home.

836
00:39:27,044 --> 00:39:28,070
Why are you still awake?

837
00:39:28,444 --> 00:39:29,400
I was waiting for you.

838
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,960
Why are you waiting for me?

839
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,920
I can't sleep if you don't come home.

840
00:39:35,044 --> 00:39:37,200
You're not suffering from insomnia too,
are you?

841
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:40,599
Are you going through menopause?

842
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,549
It's a problem.
You need to see a doctor.

843
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,090
You're the one going through menopause.

844
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:44,519
No.

845
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,519
You're not young anymore.

846
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:48,199
Don't drink until so late next time.

847
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,480
Got it.

848
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:51,000
Where did you eat today?

849
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,079
Jiangnan Stove.

850
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:53,119
With whom?

851
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:54,800
An Ruifeng.

852
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,880
Who else?

853
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,079
And two of his university classmates.

854
00:39:58,088 --> 00:39:59,377
One is from Haixin Pharmaceuticals.

855
00:39:59,377 --> 00:40:02,040
The other is from a state-owned enterprise.
Neither of them brought their wives.

856
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,577
There are only four of us. We hired
designated drivers after drinking.

857
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,309
No one drove.

858
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,488
Are there any other questions?

859
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:07,760
No.

860
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,288
I'll go take a shower then.

861
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,320
Dear.

862
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:21,679
I suddenly remembered

863
00:40:21,733 --> 00:40:23,822
that we hadn't installed
a smart lock at home.

864
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,639
How about

865
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:25,960
you install it over the weekend?

866
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:26,719
Got it.

867
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:29,679
Dear, you're nice.

868
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,000
What do you mean I'm nice?

869
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,599
The smart lock.

870
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,920
Lina, are you okay?

871
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:41,599
I just think you work so hard.

872
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,400
I should be nice to you.

873
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:46,119
Spring Breeze Package.

874
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:47,590
Are you satisfied?

875
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,400
Yes.

876
00:40:51,711 --> 00:40:52,630
I'm very satisfied.

877
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,639
Wash up then.

878
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,044
I'll go prepare breakfast.

879
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:57,679
We're having
your favorite Xu's tofu pudding today.

880
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,119
What a feast.

881
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,840
Dear, you have muscles.

882
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:10,480
Look.

883
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:13,079
Is this muscle?

884
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:13,639
Amazing.

885
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:15,199
Is this muscle?

886
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:16,320
It's muscle.

887
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,440
Yeah, look.

888
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,360
Amazing.

889
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,199
Alright.

890
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:21,599
Whatever you say.

891
00:41:21,711 --> 00:41:23,733
I've warmed the milk for you.
It's over there.

892
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,559
Got it.

893
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,000
Let me get it for you.

894
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:28,440
This...

895
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:32,159
My dear, eat more.

896
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,119
How nauseating.

897
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,280
Drink it here.

898
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,800
I'm checking homework
with my classmates.

899
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:41,000
This kid.

900
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,480
Dear, drink some.

901
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,760
It's Ningxia's black gouqi berries.

902
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,599
I just bought it.

903
00:41:48,688 --> 00:41:50,149
It nourishes the liver and kidneys.

904
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:52,370
Why would I drink this
if there's nothing wrong with me?

905
00:41:52,377 --> 00:41:53,280
The doctor said

906
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,488
you need to take care of your health
during middle age.

907
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,440
Drink it.

908
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:58,880
Finish it.

909
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,711
Jin,
if there's any problem with the results

910
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:09,422
of the physical examination
organized by the company,

911
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:10,670
will they contact the patient

912
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:11,920
or the family?

913
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,559
Mr. Shen, don't worry.

914
00:42:13,644 --> 00:42:14,630
If there's a problem,

915
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:16,519
they'll call your phone non-stop.

916
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,320
No phone call means no problem.

917
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:22,800
Dear, why are you taking so long?

918
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,760
Is your hemorrhoid acting up again?

919
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:27,559
I'll hang up first.

920
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:30,840
I found out

921
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,639
that ever since my grandpa
started dating,

922
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,955
my mom has also started
to take the gentle approach.

923
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:36,280
She's starting to date my dad.

924
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:38,239
Can your dad handle it?

925
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,840
It'll be difficult.

926
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:46,639
Why is the door open?

927
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:47,639
Dad.

928
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:54,719
Who are you?

929
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:00,000
You...
