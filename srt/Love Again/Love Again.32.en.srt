=Love Again=

2
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,140
=Episode 32=

3
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:40,555
Here you go.

4
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:41,290
Okay.

5
00:01:41,822 --> 00:01:42,610
I'm heading back.

6
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,290
Please come in.

7
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:04,640
Sure.

8
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,680
We're back.

9
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,480
Dad, you're home.

10
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:11,311
- It's all done.
- Lina.

11
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,200
I'm so sorry.

12
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,480
I'll put these things away.

13
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:18,570
The bed sheets and blanket cover

14
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,080
in Shen Dai's room are all new.

15
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,760
The blanket has been aired out.

16
00:02:21,822 --> 00:02:23,190
Sorry to bother you for a few days.

17
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,290
Don't be.

18
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,422
Go ahead and settle in.

19
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,480
This is Dai's room.

20
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,570
Stay here,

21
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:42,200
and you'll be all right.

22
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,610
It's a good place.

23
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,290
Well,

24
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:45,680
take some rest.

25
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,440
Sure.

26
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,000
Thank you.

27
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:50,210
If you need anything,

28
00:02:50,555 --> 00:02:51,422
just let me know.

29
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:09,850
Ms. Le,

30
00:03:09,888 --> 00:03:10,920
just relax and stay here.

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,111
Treat it like your home.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,050
Thank you, Dai.

33
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,880
Why are you still up?

34
00:04:51,622 --> 00:04:52,770
Having trouble sleeping?

35
00:04:59,170 --> 00:04:59,880
I can't sleep.

36
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,850
I saw Shen Qing

37
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,090
take down the photo.

38
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,730
It must be hard for him.

39
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:11,480
He didn't have to do that.

40
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,480
Shen Qing is always considerate.

41
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,530
He takes care of everyone's feelings.

42
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,090
I thought the hard times were over,

43
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,920
but they weren't.

44
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,880
It's all in my head.

45
00:05:43,355 --> 00:05:44,933
Now, it's all coming flooding back.

46
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,770
I've always felt like

47
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:54,880
duckweed.

48
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:56,970
It looks all green

49
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,440
on the surface,

50
00:05:59,440 --> 00:05:59,880
but

51
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,360
underneath,

52
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,610
it has no roots.

53
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,440
I didn't know

54
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,410
someone who laughs a lot like you

55
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,050
could carry so much sorrow.

56
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,410
This is unfair, Mr. Shen.

57
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,050
I'm the victim.

58
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,090
Why, after all these years,

59
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,320
am I still being bullied?

60
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,730
That's because you never fought back.

61
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,410
You're all alone.

62
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,440
But you have me.

63
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,970
We will fight back together.

64
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,440
We must make sure the bad guy

65
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,290
pays for what he did.

66
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,560
What are you up to, Liu?

67
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,800
Try to rebel?

68
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,290
No, I'm chopping the fish.

69
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:40,890
I see.

70
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,960
Once you're done,

71
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,770
I'll bring it over to Lina.

72
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:45,370
Sure.

73
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:47,770
The fish is huge.

74
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:49,920
Do it gently.

75
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,290
Move aside. I got this.

76
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,370
Chop it smaller.

77
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,290
I know.

78
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,250
Good morning, Mr. Shen.

79
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,320
Good morning.

80
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:02,800
Come.

81
00:08:03,155 --> 00:08:04,133
Have some breakfast.

82
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,080
That's a feast.

83
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,010
Thank you.

84
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,530
Plain congee and some sides.

85
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,890
A simple meal is a delight.

86
00:08:15,155 --> 00:08:15,840
How was it?

87
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,720
Did you sleep well last night?

88
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,960
I slept well
in the second half of the night.

89
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,890
I had a dream.

90
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,170
I dreamt of my dad and mom.

91
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,250
We were sleeping together
in the same bed.

92
00:08:31,488 --> 00:08:32,560
You must be very happy.

93
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,650
It was a long dream.

94
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,800
My mom told me,

95
00:08:37,355 --> 00:08:39,130
"You don't have to be afraid anymore.

96
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,920
We're all together now."

97
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,010
Right?

98
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,200
She's telling you not to be afraid.

99
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,320
This is home.

100
00:08:45,755 --> 00:08:47,022
Just stay here without worries.

101
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,050
Oh,

102
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,650
Dai called and said

103
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,590
she'd be staying in Shanghai
for a few more days.

104
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,440
Isn't that perfect?

105
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,650
That's good. If so, I'll stay

106
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:57,720
a few more days.

107
00:08:58,488 --> 00:08:59,888
I'll treat this as home.

108
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:00,800
Welcome.

109
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,490
Sorry.

110
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:04,970
(Heibao)

111
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:06,410
It's Heibao.

112
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,650
Maybe it's about my dog.

113
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:10,960
You take it.

114
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:14,770
Heibao.

115
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,720
Shuishan,

116
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,890
Oppo won't eat at home,

117
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,770
so I brought him here.

118
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,440
Where are you?

119
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,130
I'm downstairs at Shen's place.

120
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:23,920
Come down.

121
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,600
Oppo won't eat,

122
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,410
so he brought him over.

123
00:09:31,977 --> 00:09:32,890
They're downstairs.

124
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:33,650
You should go.

125
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:36,840
Come with me.

126
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,650
No, you go ahead.

127
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,010
All right. I'll be back shortly.

128
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,370
I'll head down to check.

129
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:30,800
Hello?

130
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,320
Sun,

131
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,370
are you doing your job right?

132
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:36,920
There's a big black guy

133
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,130
bringing a dog inside.

134
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,720
Lina,

135
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,290
I brought over the fish your dad caught

136
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,080
and also a lot of groceries.

137
00:10:44,288 --> 00:10:45,490
You don't need to come down.

138
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,770
By the way,

139
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,960
who let Le Shuishan move in?

140
00:10:50,244 --> 00:10:51,355
What's the situation now?

141
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,250
Should I go upstairs and say hello?

142
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:54,960
Oppo.

143
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:56,530
Wait.

144
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,050
She's down here.

145
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,130
- I miss you so much.
- Get up now.

146
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,130
Are you being good?

147
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,200
Why isn't Shen with her?

148
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,400
All right, I'm hanging up.

149
00:11:05,377 --> 00:11:06,800
He's been behaving at my place.

150
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,530
Really?

151
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,720
But he won't eat.

152
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,960
You didn't eat?

153
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
Why not?

154
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:17,890
Le.

155
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,650
You're Le, right?

156
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:21,720
Hello.

157
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,920
You don't know me?

158
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,600
I'm Lina's mom.

159
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,840
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Liu.

160
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,890
Nice to meet you, too.

161
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:30,890
This dog...

162
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,440
This dog is so adorable.

163
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,370
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,410
He's shy.

165
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,290
Did he bite you?

166
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,840
No worries.

167
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,490
He doesn't bite.

168
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:39,410
I know.

169
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:48,920
Lina.

170
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,440
Lina.

171
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:51,530
Lina.

172
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,050
Mom.

173
00:11:52,177 --> 00:11:54,266
Do you know who I ran into downstairs
just now?

174
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:54,840
Who?

175
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,290
Le Shuishan

176
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,920
and a big guy.

177
00:11:58,511 --> 00:11:59,890
They were feeding the dog together.

178
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,370
The three of them
looked so peaceful together.

179
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,890
Big guy?

180
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,920
That's her ex-boyfriend.

181
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:11,680
My goodness.

182
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,320
Ex-boyfriend?

183
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,720
Her ex came here?

184
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,130
Le Shuishan is really something.

185
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,960
She lives here
but hangs out with another guy.

186
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,200
She's nothing like Jingmin.

187
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,290
So ridiculous.

188
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,177
Don't talk nonsense.

189
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:25,770
I...

190
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,050
What's this?

191
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,680
What's this?

192
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,320
Why is your mother-in-law's photo

193
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,010
here?

194
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,080
Mom.

195
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,888
What's going on?

196
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,290
I brought it back.

197
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,600
You did?

198
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,770
Oh, well.

199
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,080
Shen Qing, you're so kind.

200
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:48,333
You married the right person.

201
00:12:50,022 --> 00:12:50,920
Mom, I'm off to work.

202
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:53,560
Sure. Take care.

203
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,840
Well, go ahead. I'll take care of it.

204
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,050
Sure. Thanks, Mom.

205
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:00,890
Yeah.

206
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:03,200
Be careful.

207
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:13,290
Why care about Le Shuishan's feelings?

208
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,890
To welcome a new woman,

209
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,440
he moved

210
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,720
your mother-in-law's photo.

211
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,800
This is simply ridiculous.

212
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,010
He probably

213
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,844
hasn't met someone like me in his life.

214
00:13:26,866 --> 00:13:28,440
I'm just worried he'll get back at you.

215
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,200
Him?

216
00:13:29,977 --> 00:13:30,955
Does he have the guts?

217
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,410
Look!

218
00:13:47,466 --> 00:13:48,290
There's the big guy.

219
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,600
Look. There he is.

220
00:13:50,155 --> 00:13:51,360
Le Shuishan's over there too.

221
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:53,600
Shen Qing.

222
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:54,600
Shen Qing.

223
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:55,410
Go.

224
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:57,680
Shen Qing.

225
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,170
Mom,

226
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,320
can you please stop?

227
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,000
Stop causing trouble for us again.

228
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,170
Are you Director Wu?

229
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,920
Yes, I am. You must be Professor Shen.

230
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:18,440
Yes.

231
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,720
Nice to meet you.

232
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,170
Zhang told me about this place.

233
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,410
He mentioned you.

234
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,200
Oh, yes.

235
00:14:24,111 --> 00:14:25,800
Feel free to ask me
if you need anything.

236
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:26,440
Sure.

237
00:14:26,844 --> 00:14:28,000
I'd like to look into

238
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,680
the regulations
about job transfer in expedition

239
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,770
in 1988 and local policies

240
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:40,010
related to high-risk occupations.

241
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,410
1988?

242
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,080
That's over 30 years ago.

243
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,650
Yes.

244
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,320
Professor Shen,

245
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,010
I can only try my best.

246
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:51,920
Sure.

247
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:52,560
Thank you.

248
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,920
No trouble at all.

249
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,800
Sure.

250
00:15:23,444 --> 00:15:24,720
Sorry, I need to take this call.

251
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:32,650
Hello?

252
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:33,920
Shen,

253
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,290
I saw Tang Jialin.

254
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,120
You found him?

255
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,050
He's at the main gate
of the chemical plant.

256
00:15:41,955 --> 00:15:42,770
He went inside.

257
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:45,533
I've sent you the location.

258
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,050
I'll hurry up.

259
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:55,210
Ice,

260
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,770
I don't think what you did
was appropriate.

261
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,010
Since Mr. Lu raises concerns

262
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,600
about the investment in RF,

263
00:16:05,311 --> 00:16:06,880
that means there are risks involved,

264
00:16:07,244 --> 00:16:08,840
and we should start an investigation.

265
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,050
But you had finance transfer the funds
so quickly.

266
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,560
Don't you think it was rash?

267
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,690
Mr. Qiao,

268
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,400
RF is at a critical stage now.

269
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,290
They desperately need this money.

270
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:26,844
I believe that since we've
signed the contract,

271
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:28,333
we should show commitment.

272
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,120
In venture capital investment,

273
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,770
venture comes before investment.

274
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,450
We can't back out

275
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:37,222
just because things don't seem
to be in our favor.

276
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,400
What are you getting at?

277
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,080
Didn't we put real money
into this before?

278
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,970
The venture is like the wind.

279
00:16:45,177 --> 00:16:46,640
Is it wrong to ride along the wind

280
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,640
and steer clear when there are risks?

281
00:16:48,866 --> 00:16:50,266
Where's your professional integrity?

282
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,880
My professionalism includes
managing risks

283
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,160
and pushing projects forward.

284
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:00,840
Mr. Qiao,

285
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,250
Mr. Lu,

286
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,490
if RF can't pass
the third clinical trial,

287
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,930
the money we've invested
will go down the drain

288
00:17:07,977 --> 00:17:09,822
and cause a great loss to the company.

289
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,290
As far as I'm concerned,

290
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,800
RF has cut salaries
and minimized expenses.

291
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,400
The higher-ups

292
00:17:15,511 --> 00:17:16,930
even put in their personal savings

293
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,400
just to push this project forward.

294
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,120
They've done all they can.

295
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,840
You seem to know a lot about RF.

296
00:17:28,244 --> 00:17:30,400
So, how are
the third clinical trial's results?

297
00:17:30,555 --> 00:17:32,222
Can you guarantee anything?

298
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,210
I know their R&D very well,

299
00:17:35,244 --> 00:17:36,800
and I'm very confident in them.

300
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:38,490
You're confident in them?

301
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,640
If you think you stand a point,

302
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:42,400
why didn't you explain this to everyone?

303
00:17:42,511 --> 00:17:44,770
Why did you make the transfer one minute
before closing?

304
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,530
Were you afraid we'd stop you?

305
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:49,133
I was acting according
to my professional judgment.

306
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,050
I did that with a clear conscience.

307
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,160
Clear conscience?

308
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:58,640
Ice,

309
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,050
are you sure?

310
00:18:02,933 --> 00:18:04,120
What are you trying to say?

311
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,530
You and Mr. Shen from RF

312
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,955
take the same night running route
every day.

313
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:12,080
They eat stir-fried dumplings
in the morning

314
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,840
and run at night.

315
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,160
You're so close.

316
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,930
Is there any secret deal between you?

317
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,600
It's natural for investors and founders

318
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,400
to be interested in each other
and collaborate closely,

319
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,600
but it doesn't involve
personal relationships.

320
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,010
I don't think

321
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,770
eating stir-fried dumplings together
means anything more.

322
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,360
If the company

323
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,080
questions my decisions,

324
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,490
it means our values aren't aligned.

325
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,530
I see no reason to stay.

326
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:04,840
I'll resign.

327
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:08,970
You resign
right after the funds were transferred.

328
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,320
That makes me suspicious of you.

329
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,450
You

330
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:16,000
will be suspended for investigation.

331
00:19:21,155 --> 00:19:22,377
Do as you see fit.

332
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,930
Dr. Qin, I just signed.

333
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,555
The money will come through today.

334
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,250
Don't worry.

335
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,560
The B+ round funding came in.

336
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:43,800
Okay.

337
00:19:44,288 --> 00:19:45,800
Let me know if anything comes up.

338
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:46,450
Sure.

339
00:19:54,355 --> 00:19:56,973
(An Ruifeng)

340
00:19:56,998 --> 00:20:00,370
(Ice has been suspended
for investigation.)

341
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:10,020
(Ice Li)

342
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,050
Hello.

343
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:15,120
The number you've dialed
is currently unreachable.

344
00:20:15,488 --> 00:20:16,560
Please try again later.

345
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,210
Hello.

346
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:23,320
The number you've dialed
is currently unreachable.

347
00:20:23,466 --> 00:20:24,600
Please try again later.

348
00:20:29,891 --> 00:20:34,770
(Honest, Innovative,
Eco-friendly, Communal)

349
00:20:34,888 --> 00:20:36,400
How could you allow this to happen?

350
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,840
Rules are rules.

351
00:20:40,444 --> 00:20:41,822
Tell them to put up with it.

352
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:44,730
Jeez.

353
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,711
You can't even handle something
this trivial.

354
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,120
This place is nice.

355
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,010
You...

356
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,730
Are you here to pick a fight?

357
00:21:11,555 --> 00:21:12,880
There are cameras up there

358
00:21:14,466 --> 00:21:15,840
and security guards downstairs.

359
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,010
If you break the law,

360
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,250
I'll report you immediately.

361
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,770
The canoe team will fire you,

362
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,730
believe it or not?

363
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,360
Mr. Tang, why are you
being so aggressive?

364
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,450
We didn't mean any harm.

365
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,120
We just came here

366
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,290
to catch up on old times

367
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,120
peacefully.

368
00:21:43,222 --> 00:21:44,755
And you even came to my workplace.

369
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,080
If you could find Le Shuishan's place,

370
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,290
why wouldn't we be able
to find your office?

371
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,160
You...

372
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:56,050
Don't.

373
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,120
This is a small world.

374
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,770
We will cross paths eventually.

375
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,290
Unless you can fly away.

376
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,560
What exactly do you want?

377
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,880
Didn't I tell you just now?

378
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,050
We're here to catch up on old times.

379
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,930
We want you to apologize to Le Shuishan

380
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,970
and her late husband, Zhang Yali.

381
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:24,930
That's impossible.

382
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,730
You've hurt your leg.

383
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,840
Did you hurt your brain too?

384
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,320
Do you have no shame?

385
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,080
Watch your words.

386
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,640
Have a look at this document.

387
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,600
Listen up.

388
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,770
This is the headquarters personnel
transfer expedition regulation.

389
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,210
Regulations No. 36.

390
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,160
This is Article 4:

391
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,840
Anyone involved in high-risk work

392
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,010
such as extraction, drilling,
or expedition

393
00:22:57,066 --> 00:22:58,844
must undergo
a medical history assessment.

394
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,320
Anyone with heart disease,

395
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:03,160
lung disease, high blood pressure,
diabetes, or other conditions

396
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:05,120
is not allowed to participate
in extraction,

397
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,690
drilling, or expedition.

398
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,400
See this?

399
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,290
This is Zhang Yali's medical record.

400
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,690
It's written here,
rheumatic heart disease.

401
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,800
And atrial fibrillation.

402
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,290
In that same month and the same year,

403
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,050
after you reviewed this medical record

404
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,250
and this document,

405
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,320
you issued this order.

406
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,600
It says here, "Overcome difficulties.
Depart immediately."

407
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:30,530
By Tang Jialin.

408
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:31,730
Was it you?

409
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:32,840
Take a good look.

410
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,840
Where did you find this?

411
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,690
Someone righteous
stepped forward to help,

412
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,770
and someone combed through
every book.

413
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:48,490
Do you think

414
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:49,730
Le Shuishan

415
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,120
didn't sue you

416
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:52,770
because she forgave you?

417
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,360
Do you see her as a pushover?

418
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:56,490
Well.

419
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,010
What's the point of bringing this out?

420
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:03,770
This only proves my negligence of duty.

421
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,400
I overlooked his heart condition.

422
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,880
My vision was poor.

423
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,450
I didn't read
his medical record carefully.

424
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,120
Besides, the statute of limitations
has passed.

425
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,690
I'm not scared of a lawsuit.

426
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,160
Shen,

427
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,450
I told you.

428
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,400
Words don't work

429
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,640
on rascals like him.

430
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,400
You have to use your fists.

431
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:30,880
No.

432
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,320
Heibao,

433
00:24:32,044 --> 00:24:32,880
I agree with you.

434
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,120
But let me say one thing
before you do.

435
00:24:36,133 --> 00:24:37,770
The status of limitations has expired,

436
00:24:37,955 --> 00:24:40,266
and the court
can't hold you accountable.

437
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:41,250
However,

438
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,210
what you did can't be erased.

439
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,360
We might not sue you,

440
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,690
but we can

441
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,050
let everyone know

442
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,080
what kind of person you are.

443
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
We'll expose all the filthy things
you've done.

444
00:24:56,422 --> 00:24:58,155
Let's see if you can
still sit comfortably.

445
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,010
Right.

446
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,930
We agreed

447
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,600
not to threaten me.

448
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,210
We're not threatening you.

449
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,290
We're serious about this.

450
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,640
Look at this photo.

451
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,080
Look.

452
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,160
Look at Zhang Yali.

453
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,530
Now, look at yourself.

454
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:23,050
You think you didn't owe him anything?

455
00:25:23,244 --> 00:25:25,688
Can you really face your children
and grandchildren?

456
00:25:27,844 --> 00:25:29,840
If you don't apologize today,
this won't be over.

457
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,450
Wait...

458
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,360
Shen, don't waste your breath on him.

459
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,730
We'll go to the disciplinary board

460
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,250
to expose him.

461
00:25:38,377 --> 00:25:38,840
Let's go.

462
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,290
Hold on.

463
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:40,970
Hold on.

464
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,290
Don't be mad.

465
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,210
I...

466
00:25:50,022 --> 00:25:50,770
I'll apologize.

467
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,050
I'm willing to apologize.

468
00:25:58,755 --> 00:26:01,330
(I apologize to Le Shuishan
and Zhang Yali. By Tang Jialin)

469
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,490
He apologized.

470
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,800
I don't need to fear him anymore.

471
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,490
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

472
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:13,250
Not just me,

473
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:16,840
Li Heibao helped you too.

474
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,290
We've all got your back.

475
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,320
He had to write a report

476
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,320
for punching that Smiling Tiger.

477
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,290
People say,

478
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,120
"With deep love protected,

479
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,930
it's like wearing armor

480
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,730
and holding a sword."

481
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,400
If you want to sue him,

482
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:35,360
this is

483
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,600
your evidence.

484
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,250
If you want to let it go,

485
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,320
this is still your weapon.

486
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:45,880
Either way,

487
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,360
with the evidence,

488
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,800
he won't dare bother you again.

489
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:02,770
Even if I sue him,

490
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:07,250
Yali and my kid won't come back.

491
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,970
Mr. Shen, I just want to live peacefully

492
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,490
for the rest of my life

493
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:18,840
without

494
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,970
shadows casting over me.

495
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,250
At least I have this now.

496
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,530
This is justice for me.

497
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,290
Thank you.

498
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,120
Thank you.

499
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:35,880
Thank you.

500
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,250
Thank you.

501
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,280
(Have you heard about that?)

502
00:27:55,288 --> 00:27:56,360
(Ice has been suspended.)

503
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,800
(It's because of RF.)

504
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,690
(They say she was close with Mr. Shen.)

505
00:28:08,371 --> 00:28:14,800
(Ice Li)

506
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,160
Cheers.

507
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,450
Let's celebrate Duole's video
hitting over 100,000 views.

508
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,690
I wish my son a bright future
and great success.

509
00:29:08,311 --> 00:29:08,930
Let's dig in.

510
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:09,800
Here.

511
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,120
Dad, try this steak.

512
00:29:12,111 --> 00:29:12,822
Here you go.

513
00:29:12,822 --> 00:29:13,600
Thank you, Duole.

514
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,320
Mom, have some too.

515
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,640
You're the goddess.

516
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,840
You've really grown up.

517
00:29:18,888 --> 00:29:19,600
So thoughtful.

518
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,120
Come.

519
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:20,933
He can do it himself.

520
00:29:20,977 --> 00:29:21,555
You eat too.

521
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,010
Eat up.

522
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,530
Why aren't you filming today?

523
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:28,530
Oh, that reminds me.

524
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,160
I'm enjoying this great meal
my son treated me to.

525
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,450
Dad,

526
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,870
I want to apply to
the Department of Directing.

527
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,711
What do you think?

528
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:38,422
You're at it again.

529
00:29:38,422 --> 00:29:40,050
Directing? Why do you
want to study that?

530
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,490
Mom,

531
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,930
my video hit 100,000 views.

532
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,320
I'm a genius.

533
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,980
It'd be too bad if I didn't study that.

534
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:46,880
Stop bragging.

535
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,930
Duole, I think that's a good idea.

536
00:29:50,111 --> 00:29:52,360
If you study what you like,
it'll be much easier for you.

537
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:53,970
See?

538
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,560
My dad knows me well.

539
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,210
Yes, he knows you well.

540
00:29:58,444 --> 00:29:59,977
But does he actually do anything?

541
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:02,590
All he does is support you
but never take real responsibility.

542
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,733
I'm the one who takes care of everything
in the end.

543
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,120
What do you mean by that?

544
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,600
Do you know how expensive art school is?

545
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,880
It costs way more than regular majors.

546
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,010
We're not a well-off family.

547
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,066
Arts just aren't for us.

548
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,080
Kids from ordinary families

549
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,466
should study finance or
pick up a skill, isn't that better?

550
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,970
But I like it, Mom.

551
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,770
Hobbies can't put food on the table.

552
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,640
Can you not kill his passion?

553
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,490
You should encourage him
to do something he loves.

554
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,080
Duole,

555
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,360
I studied accounting.

556
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,970
I didn't like it,

557
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,490
so I changed my career in my thirties.

558
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,290
If you hadn't done that,

559
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,933
Duole could've studied what he loved.

560
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,770
You put all the money
into the investment.

561
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,050
How are you going to support him?

562
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:45,800
Mom.

563
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:47,690
Liu Lina,

564
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,930
Duole invited us to celebrate,

565
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:50,880
not to argue.

566
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,930
I don't want to argue either.

567
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,880
I just want to let him know
that he should stay grounded.

568
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,010
If you don't have the ability,
don't pursue your dream.

569
00:30:59,050 --> 00:30:59,970
You won't reach them.

570
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,360
Who are you hinting at?

571
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:09,730
Duole,

572
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,560
I'm sorry.

573
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:12,640
Dad.

574
00:31:13,422 --> 00:31:14,311
Come back.

575
00:31:14,488 --> 00:31:16,511
Even if it's your treat,
don't waste the food.

576
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:17,488
Finish the steak.

577
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:34,160
When my mom had me,

578
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:35,600
she had major bleeding.

579
00:31:36,222 --> 00:31:38,355
She had her uterus removed after that.

580
00:31:39,288 --> 00:31:40,511
I'm the only child

581
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,120
in the family.

582
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,120
When I was a kid,

583
00:31:46,111 --> 00:31:47,911
my parents were always stationed abroad.

584
00:31:47,933 --> 00:31:49,160
I hardly saw them.

585
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:50,600
Here.

586
00:31:58,806 --> 00:32:03,520
(I apologize to Le Shuishan
and Zhang Yali. By Tang Jialin)

587
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,360
The past is in the past.

588
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,490
I'll live my life well.

589
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:11,880
Don't worry about me.

590
00:32:17,466 --> 00:32:19,400
Don't worry about her, mister and madam.

591
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,560
I don't have kids,

592
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:29,355
and my parents passed away early.

593
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,050
A few years ago,

594
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,800
my mom passed.

595
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,210
My dad followed a year later.

596
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,280
Before this,

597
00:32:39,711 --> 00:32:41,240
they were buried in the village.

598
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,240
This willow tree

599
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,530
looks just like the one

600
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,680
we had in our hometown.

601
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:51,930
Ms. Le,

602
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,930
since you haven't arrived at 2 PM,

603
00:32:53,977 --> 00:32:56,022
I figured you'd probably
come to visit your parents,

604
00:32:56,022 --> 00:32:57,088
so I came out to meet you.

605
00:32:57,111 --> 00:32:59,330
We were talking about
this big willow tree.

606
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:02,410
This tree was actually transplanted
from Xishan Island.

607
00:33:02,755 --> 00:33:04,511
It stands guard over those
who rest here.

608
00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:05,333
It's full of life.

609
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,330
Ms. Le, you have fine taste

610
00:33:07,422 --> 00:33:08,920
in picking this plot for your parents.

611
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,066
The third plot in the third row
of Garden Ding

612
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,222
is an excellent location.

613
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:13,720
High ground, wide view,

614
00:33:13,822 --> 00:33:14,810
surrounded by water,

615
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:15,810
and near a creek.

616
00:33:15,866 --> 00:33:17,300
Plus, it's right next to your parents.

617
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,222
It's in high demand.

618
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,466
Many people are interested.

619
00:33:19,488 --> 00:33:20,640
If you've decided,

620
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:22,155
you can leave a deposit first.

621
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,640
Sorry,

622
00:33:26,355 --> 00:33:27,511
I need to take this call.

623
00:33:27,711 --> 00:33:28,800
Don't let us keep you.

624
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,530
I really want to buy this spot.

625
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,680
That way, when I pass away,

626
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,490
I can rest

627
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,370
next to my parents.

628
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:46,533
That sounds good.

629
00:33:47,466 --> 00:33:48,600
You can keep them company.

630
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,890
Mr. Shen.

631
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,050
If

632
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:58,120
we really get together,

633
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:02,280
will you be buried with me

634
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,200
here?

635
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,560
Shen.

636
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,410
Two women

637
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:29,640
fighting over you, in life and death.

638
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,890
What a lucky problem.

639
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:35,530
Well,

640
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,240
that's basically

641
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:39,450
a proposal, isn't it?

642
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:40,970
A burial proposal

643
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:43,450
is more intense than
a marriage proposal.

644
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:48,530
How about this?

645
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,280
Split

646
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,080
your ashes

647
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,280
in two

648
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,066
so that you can keep two sides happy.

649
00:34:54,111 --> 00:34:54,850
No one gets upset.

650
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:56,890
Use a scale

651
00:34:57,377 --> 00:34:58,370
to divide it equally.

652
00:34:59,410 --> 00:34:59,930
Well...

653
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,370
Are you two doing a cross-talk

654
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,280
and using me as a joke?

655
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:04,330
If so, I'll go.

656
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:05,490
No.

657
00:35:05,777 --> 00:35:07,330
I'm helping you come up with ideas.

658
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:12,240
Everyone should live each day

659
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,890
with joy.

660
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,050
You can promise her first.

661
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,530
As for what you'll do,

662
00:35:21,888 --> 00:35:22,850
you can decide later.

663
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,720
You want me to say yes,

664
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,760
but I don't really mean it?

665
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:30,600
Isn't that disrespectful?

666
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,930
If you don't want to say yes,

667
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,370
you'll be in trouble.

668
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,850
You'll have to go home

669
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,490
and discuss it

670
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,240
with Shen Qing and Shen Dai.

671
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,010
Patience.

672
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,450
Patience.

673
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:46,600
Take your time

674
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:47,370
to figure it out.

675
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:48,240
No rush.

676
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,200
Will you be buried together?

677
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:05,120
How could she ask something
so outrageous?

678
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,410
I was so kind to give her my room.

679
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:09,640
Because of her,

680
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,640
Mom's photo was moved to Qing's place.

681
00:36:11,733 --> 00:36:12,711
I can't agree with this!

682
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:13,930
I'm calling her now.

683
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,911
I was the one
who brought Mom's photo back.

684
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,850
Calm down.

685
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,240
I can't calm down.

686
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:20,240
She wants to be buried next to you, Dad.

687
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:21,330
What about Mom?

688
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,530
I can't accept it.

689
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,410
Dad,

690
00:36:24,466 --> 00:36:25,955
this is really not appropriate.

691
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,490
Mom was your wife.

692
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,490
You bought a companion grave.

693
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,370
Both of you are the roots
of the Shen family.

694
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,530
You can't be separated.

695
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:36,680
Exactly.

696
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,860
If that happens, we'll have
to visit two graves in the future.

697
00:36:40,088 --> 00:36:40,640
Wait a second.

698
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,600
Does that mean

699
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:44,970
our names will be
on someone else's tombstone?

700
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,530
Grandpa,

701
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:55,680
don't worry about it.

702
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,330
The living matter most.

703
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:00,280
Shen Duole,

704
00:37:00,577 --> 00:37:01,760
Grandma loved you so much.

705
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,010
You're betraying her, you know?

706
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,240
Shen Duole,

707
00:37:05,888 --> 00:37:06,890
don't give bad advice.

708
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,200
When I die,

709
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,800
will you be okay with your dad
being buried with your stepmom?

710
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:12,930
Mom,

711
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,560
stop making this more complicated.

712
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,200
Grandpa,

713
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:24,890
I'll ask Grandma tonight.

714
00:37:25,066 --> 00:37:27,666
She always comes to my dreams
whenever something big happens.

715
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:30,755
Why is my mom so good to you?

716
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:32,530
Grandpa,

717
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,930
there's only one message from her

718
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:35,890
every time she comes.

719
00:37:36,488 --> 00:37:37,760
She just wants you to be happy.

720
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,930
She'd support anything you do.

721
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,530
What matters the most is being alive.

722
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,450
That's true love, okay?

723
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:55,050
Can you try to understand each other?

724
00:37:55,244 --> 00:37:56,640
Can't you be a little more tolerant?

725
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,760
Split the ashes

726
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,240
in half?

727
00:38:21,555 --> 00:38:22,377
My goodness.

728
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:23,490
How is that

729
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:24,680
any different

730
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,530
from dismemberment?

731
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,330
Mom, think before you speak.

732
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,530
He's my father-in-law.

733
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:31,930
Why?

734
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,810
We're just talking at home.

735
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:39,240
Lina.

736
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:40,850
Liu Dong said

737
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:43,120
each family pays an 8,000 yuan deposit

738
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,810
to reserve the plot.

739
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:46,680
I see.

740
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:48,450
Well...

741
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:50,560
Lina,

742
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,850
can you smell the bean curd knot?
Have they gone bad?

743
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,280
Dad, don't worry.

744
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,280
Got it.

745
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,530
I'll take care of it.

746
00:38:58,890 --> 00:38:59,200
Okay.

747
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:01,560
Smell it.

748
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,330
I'm not sure about this.

749
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,970
They've gone bad.

750
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,450
That rancid smell.

751
00:39:08,822 --> 00:39:09,700
I'll throw them away.

752
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:10,370
Lina.

753
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,370
Lina, give them to me.

754
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,050
I'll do it.

755
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,160
You eat.

756
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:14,680
Eat.

757
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,280
Lina,

758
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,120
I noticed

759
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:20,160
Liu Dong

760
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,050
has liked your WeChat posts.

761
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,530
Ignore him.

762
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:25,450
If he asks for a deposit or anything,

763
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,120
do not agree.

764
00:39:27,511 --> 00:39:28,450
I'll be honest with you.

765
00:39:29,022 --> 00:39:30,890
I've picked out a spot
for my columbarium.

766
00:39:31,422 --> 00:39:33,410
It's behind your mother-in-law's
memorial park.

767
00:39:33,577 --> 00:39:34,750
It's under planning right now.

768
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:36,280
They say it'll be ready

769
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,680
in 15 years.

770
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,080
By then,

771
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:41,330
I'll be just about the time

772
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,560
to move in.

773
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,050
Oh, come on.

774
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,330
Why?

775
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:49,080
I'll be in my eighties.

776
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,680
That's long enough to live.

777
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,050
Isn't that great? A blessed death.

778
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,600
Listen.

779
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,080
Don't bury me

780
00:39:57,111 --> 00:39:58,410
in the Liu family's plot.

781
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:01,160
I raised you

782
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,200
and I'm not asking much.

783
00:40:02,244 --> 00:40:03,890
I have only one task for you.

784
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:06,330
Sure.

785
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,400
Can you do this for me?

786
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:21,280
Come.

787
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,720
Have a look.

788
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,120
Today, I made this specialty
from the Northwest.

789
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,280
Tea.

790
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,240
And this.

791
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:34,640
You like mug bean cake.

792
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,120
Right.

793
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:35,970
I looked up

794
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,970
how to make them online.

795
00:40:38,911 --> 00:40:39,955
What do you think of it?

796
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:42,930
A heart.

797
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:45,530
Loving hearts.

798
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,640
Loving hearts.

799
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,720
Come on and try it.

800
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:54,530
The texture really takes me back

801
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:56,050
to when I was a kid.

802
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,080
I made it!

803
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:59,120
Delicious.

804
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:05,490
Mr. Shen,

805
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:09,680
I asked you before

806
00:41:10,444 --> 00:41:11,810
if we could be buried together...

807
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,850
Have you thought about it?

808
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,330
Shuishan,

809
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,680
to be honest,

810
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:23,810
I've thought about it seriously.

811
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,120
I discussed it

812
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:27,760
with my children.

813
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:31,280
I still think

814
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:33,600
it's not appropriate.

815
00:41:39,777 --> 00:41:41,044
It's not appropriate?

816
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:44,680
It's fine.

817
00:41:45,444 --> 00:41:47,000
I didn't mean to put you on the spot.

818
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,410
I'm fine

819
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:52,640
being buried alone.

820
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,200
I'm fine with that.

821
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,010
Don't go just yet.

822
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:05,810
Stay a little longer.

823
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:20,680
I thought

824
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,450
you were different from Heibao.

825
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,160
But when

826
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,120
your children object,

827
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,490
you're all the same.

828
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,410
Is that how you see it?

829
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,930
Then give me a little more time.

830
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:43,977
