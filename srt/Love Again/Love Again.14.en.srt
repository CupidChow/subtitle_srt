=Love Again=

2
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,110
=Episode 14=

3
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,930
Hello.

4
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,740
Hi.

5
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,869
This is it. No.237.

6
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,869
One, two, three, four, five.

7
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,459
This is it.

8
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,540
- Yeah, this one.
- Alright.

9
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,619
Let's go.

10
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,690
Quick, hurry up.

11
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,460
One, two, three, four...

12
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,130
It's 237.

13
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,669
It's definitely her.

14
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,410
That's her.

15
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,090
She looks sickly though.

16
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,429
Are you sure it's her?

17
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,250
No idea.

18
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,740
Nie Juanjuan?

19
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,780
It's free if it isn't sweet.

20
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,490
That's her.

21
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,700
I'm sure.

22
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,589
Come on, let's go.

23
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,229
Keep up.

24
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,090
Follow her. Come on.

25
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,020
She looks so miserable.

26
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,970
She's nowhere near your level.

27
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,499
You can't say that.

28
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,260
It all comes down to fate.

29
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,349
At 17, it's fate.

30
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,909
At 70, it's hard work.

31
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,700
Understood?

32
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,460
Even in this summer heat,

33
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,349
she still puts on a shawl.

34
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,970
She's not in good health.

35
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,410
You are leagues better.

36
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:24,909
She's turning!

37
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,460
Come on! Let's catch up.

38
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,220
This is the place.

39
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,490
Go!

40
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,340
Coming.

41
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,229
This place is so elegant.

42
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,220
Yeah. It looks nice.

43
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,220
She grows flowers too.

44
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,340
Really?

45
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,869
Oh my god,

46
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,220
she has so many books!

47
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,469
No wonder she gets along
with Professor Shen.

48
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,140
They're both intellectuals.

49
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,530
Intellect? Can you eat intellect?

50
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,900
Seriously.

51
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,650
No, step aside.

52
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,530
Let's check over there.

53
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:46,030
(For Ms. Nie)

54
00:04:50,385 --> 00:04:54,200
(For Ms. Nie)

55
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,580
Why does the place feel so empty?

56
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,610
Yeah.

57
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,820
I think she lives all by herself.

58
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,970
There's not even a kid around.

59
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,140
No wonder.

60
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,850
No wonder she has time
to write and paint.

61
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,090
She is...

62
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,780
Is she already eating?

63
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,460
My goodness.

64
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,780
Is she some kind of lay nun?

65
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,970
Seriously, it's possible.

66
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,029
People with deep knowledge

67
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,610
tend to think too much.

68
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,490
Oh right.

69
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,580
This place is pretty close
to Jiming Temple.

70
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,780
That could be it.

71
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:54,819
Let's go.

72
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,580
Come on.

73
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:01,939
You know,

74
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,780
getting along is one thing.

75
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,410
But, living together is
a whole different story.

76
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,619
This fairy lady here

77
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,580
only eats a big pancake for lunch.

78
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,379
That's way too simple for life.

79
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,429
Our in-law isn't like that.

80
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,939
He needs his meat.

81
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,410
He can't eat without

82
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,650
a big pork knuckle.

83
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,970
That is true.

84
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,619
Even with all that knowledge,

85
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,610
you still need to get dressed and eat.

86
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,820
She does not look great.

87
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,650
Her health does not seem good either.

88
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,290
Her life seems even worse.

89
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,530
Seeing all that

90
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,819
is such a relief.

91
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,020
It's a big relief.

92
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,259
Why would you feel relieved?

93
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,460
Peng Yulan!

94
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,340
Professor Shen is yours to take.

95
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,650
Stop it! You're being ridiculous.

96
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,090
Dad?

97
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,730
Dad?

98
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,619
Loquats turn yellow,
and bayberries turn purple.

99
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,095
Summer is here.

100
00:07:15,096 --> 00:07:17,900
(Loquats turn yellow, and bayberries
turn purple. Summer is here.)

101
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,660
Beautiful.

102
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,490
My beloved Qing.

103
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,250
I'm exhausted from all the work.

104
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,970
Come here.

105
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,580
What is this about?

106
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:57,899
Look.

107
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,820
You actually found all this stuff.

108
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,970
These are ancient relics.

109
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,970
Don't be silly.

110
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,250
These are mementos.

111
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,420
Listen.

112
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,730
In the deep of night,
I wake from dreams,

113
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,060
with nowhere to place the love
that fills my heart.

114
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,540
So, I write it down.

115
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,610
From afar, all I see is your name.

116
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,490
Up close, it is all my true love.

117
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,610
There is no way I wrote that.

118
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,499
You definitely wrote this.

119
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,890
Isn't this your handwriting?

120
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,970
Flowers float slowly
across the water's surface.

121
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,970
Fish swim gently beneath it.

122
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,340
Swallow, what are you saying?

123
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,540
How can I not think of her?

124
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,820
I wrote that too?

125
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,109
No, that one is not yours.

126
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,770
You copied that from Liu Bannong.

127
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,420
When I was young,

128
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,460
I really was quite the romantic.

129
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,619
Now, I can't even remember
Liu Bannong's poems.

130
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,370
You were more than just a romantic.

131
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,770
You knew the law very well.

132
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:22,220
"Ten things Shen Qing
wants to do with Liu Lina."

133
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:23,010
One.

134
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:28,300
Shen Qing watches
the stars with Liu Lina.

135
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,619
Men in love really have no brains.

136
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,989
You can't back out now.

137
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,730
Look.

138
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,420
You even left your fingerprint on it.

139
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,189
Wait, what was number one again?

140
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,660
Watching the stars.

141
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:42,850
Come on.

142
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,139
A sky full of stars, right?

143
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,700
Come on, I'll show you.

144
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:47,890
Look at the stars.

145
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,970
Where are the stars?

146
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,370
Is this...

147
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,730
Is it cloudy tonight?

148
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,420
Yeah, it is.

149
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,019
Weather conditions
are out of my control.

150
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,060
We will try again tomorrow.

151
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,010
Yeah, tomorrow.

152
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,970
Then, number two.

153
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,060
Shen Qing watches the blue sea

154
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,610
and sky with Liu Lina.

155
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,619
I really can't go
to the ocean right now.

156
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,259
Our company just bought a new patent.

157
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,069
We have to develop two drugs
at the same time.

158
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,250
And we have to cut costs.

159
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,659
This task is practically
impossible to complete.

160
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,490
I am so stressed lately.

161
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,300
Then, let's try a more budget option.

162
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,060
Let's go to Lianyungang.

163
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,250
A quick trip to Lianyungang.
Two days and one night.

164
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,580
Lina.

165
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,370
Let's take it to the next level.

166
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,730
Where to?

167
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,180
Let's just go to

168
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,189
Xuanwu Lake.

169
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,349
We can look at flowers,
take a walk, and have dinner.

170
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,970
It takes less than three hours.

171
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,349
When you're in love,
it's stars across the sky,

172
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,540
and the azure ocean.

173
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,379
After marriage,
you just look up at the cloudy sky

174
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,770
and walk around Xuanwu Lake.

175
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,069
It's about the two of us, right?

176
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,739
What matters is being together.

177
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,419
Where we go doesn't matter, right?

178
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,460
It's about us.

179
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,370
That's what really counts.

180
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,250
Alright.

181
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,379
Tomorrow,

182
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,060
I'll cook for Dad
and Duole a bit earlier.

183
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,060
You still owe me a trip to the sea.

184
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,490
Yes.

185
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,300
As long as I live, the debt stands.

186
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,229
Number three.

187
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,250
Shen Qing reads poetry to Liu Lina.

188
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,060
Hey! Where are you running off to now?

189
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,970
Number four.

190
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,730
Shen Qing goes to a concert
with Liu Lina.

191
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,300
By the way, you promised to take me
to a Jacky Cheung concert.

192
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:25,770
Hand me the hair tie.

193
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,490
Okay.

194
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,580
I'm leaving next week.

195
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,460
Here's my address in London.

196
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,220
I can send you spicy sticks.

197
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:20,960
(59 Honaur Swam Avenue, London)

198
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,820
Did you meet anyone Dr. Qin recommended?

199
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,360
I couldn't fit them all in one day.
Then, schedule them one by one.

200
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,700
We're racing against time here.

201
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,220
Shen Qing.

202
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,730
Okay. That's it for now.

203
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,010
You didn't even hear me.

204
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,660
Are you in a hurry for a lake dive?

205
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:47,069
Comrade Liu Lina, watch your tone.
If we're fighting, let's do it at home.

206
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,269
I shouldn't take a leave
to argue at Xuanwu Lake.

207
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,700
No more phone calls.

208
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:51,970
Let's go.

209
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,530
Don't answer it.

210
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,419
It's from An Ruifeng.

211
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,490
Don't pick it up.

212
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,530
Fine.

213
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,380
It's Duole.

214
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,100
Hey, son.

215
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,940
Are you home yet?

216
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,420
Yeah.

217
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,109
Your dad and I are out today.

218
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,420
- We won't be back.
- Rui Feng.

219
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,749
I just wanted to tell you...

220
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,139
I made dinner for you.

221
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,979
We rechecked the budget again yesterday.

222
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,939
Eat with Grandpa, okay?

223
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,979
It was cut by ten percent.

224
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,900
Yes.

225
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,269
Things are tough as is.

226
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,700
There's fish soup in the pot.

227
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,309
Take a look.

228
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,350
- If it's good, I'll send it to Ashley.
- Listen to me.

229
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,620
Don't talk while you're drinking
the soup with Grandpa.

230
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,900
Fish bones can choke you to death.

231
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,459
Duole's grown up now.

232
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,010
You need to learn to let go.

233
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,699
Alright.

234
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,660
Okay, that's all.

235
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,220
Do your homework after dinner.

236
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,659
You're basically just running off.

237
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,490
This was supposed to be a date,

238
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,100
not a trip to the market.

239
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,810
Relax. Breathe.

240
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,250
Where's the restaurant?

241
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,010
That way.

242
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,380
It's getting hot.
We're an old married couple.

243
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,309
Don't be so mushy.

244
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,420
Why not?

245
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,619
Your dad is seventy
and still dating online.

246
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,899
We're in our prime.

247
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,010
Why can't we be mushy?

248
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,100
Come on.

249
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,100
Let's take a photo.

250
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,620
Give me a smile.

251
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,330
You're so annoying.

252
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,269
Can you be serious?

253
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,530
Look how happy I'm smiling.

254
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,180
My wife is beautiful.

255
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,250
Posting this to Moments.

256
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,660
Seriously?

257
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,770
There's abalone in here.

258
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,530
And there are two of them.

259
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,330
Is it expensive?

260
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,220
It's okay.

261
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,940
Why did you pick this restaurant?

262
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,380
Looks pricey.

263
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,380
Didn't you want me
to show you that I cared?

264
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,770
We didn't see the starry sky.

265
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,660
We didn't make it to the beach.

266
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,420
At least let me buy you a good meal.

267
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,939
Then, eat your own food.

268
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,620
We have to be mindful of the budget.

269
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,330
Right.

270
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,250
Let me check if there are coupons.

271
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,050
I found them!

272
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,899
Ten yuan off for every hundred.

273
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,490
Look. I'll make it just over a hundred.

274
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,940
We can be more efficient.

275
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,349
No out-of-town trips.

276
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,589
We can save on travel and hotel costs.

277
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,349
We'll spend it on good food.
That's efficiency.

278
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,660
Eat. Check the bill later.

279
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:32,770
Alright.

280
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,490
This actually tastes pretty good.

281
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,730
It's worth the price.

282
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,620
Should we

283
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,420
pack some to go for Dad and Duole?

284
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,620
Sure. It'll still be warm

285
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,050
when we bring it home.

286
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,050
Always so thoughtful.

287
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,940
Ruifeng, what do you think?

288
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,860
Looks good, right?

289
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,530
I'll send it.

290
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,730
Alright.

291
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,380
Okay.

292
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,250
Let me show you something.

293
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,699
I don't want to see it.

294
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,940
I get mad just watching you
glued to your phone.

295
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,050
Just look.

296
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,570
(I'm here. Don't be scared.)

297
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,420
"I'm here. Don't be scared."

298
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,380
I sent that to you?

299
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,100
You forgot?

300
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,660
You sent it during
that campus singing competition.

301
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,940
I remember now.

302
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:59,459
You were so nervous.
You wrote the lyrics on your hand.

303
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,900
I was cheering for you
like crazy in the audience.

304
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,250
You saved that?

305
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,010
At least you're not heartless.

306
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,589
After that,

307
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,660
whenever I ran into
something bad, I'd think,

308
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,829
"I managed to handle a woman like you,

309
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,970
nothing can scare me."

310
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,530
Waiter, one beer please.

311
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,330
Eat up.

312
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,810
Is there a coupon for drinks?

313
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,660
Enough. Just eat up first.

314
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,810
"Doesn't apply to drinks."

315
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,050
Grandpa.

316
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,570
What are you doing?

317
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,050
Writing on a fan.

318
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,530
People used to gift fans

319
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,140
as a token of their bonds.

320
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,460
And then,

321
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,250
they'd do calligraphy
and painting on them together.

322
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:49,810
Among ancient Chinese scholars,

323
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,860
that was a refined pastime.

324
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,660
I want to try too!

325
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,180
You too?

326
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,660
Alright.

327
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,970
Let's do something cultured. Come on.

328
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,770
Here you go.

329
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,940
What should I write?

330
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,069
Whatever you want.

331
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,860
Give it to whoever you want.

332
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,219
Can I use watercolor markers then?

333
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,290
Of course you can.

334
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,770
Didn't I mention that?

335
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:16,380
Okay.

336
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,220
I got the kit.

337
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,860
Duole,

338
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,860
I've lived a long life

339
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,220
to finally realize something.

340
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,620
I think that young people

341
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,620
should go wild while they can.

342
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,940
Grandpa.

343
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,460
You're awesome.

344
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,570
Oh right.

345
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,109
Don't tell your mom

346
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,730
I ever said that.

347
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,140
I promise.

348
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,220
Pinky swear.

349
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:55,660
Stamp it.

350
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,100
Let's start writing.

351
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,420
Grandpa.

352
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,810
Take a look.

353
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,940
Nice.

354
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,050
It looks promising.

355
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,109
Grandpa. Can I have
an envelope and a stamp?

356
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,140
I want to mail mine too.

357
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:31,900
Sure.

358
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,100
Here.

359
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:33,970
An envelope.

360
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,860
The stamps are...

361
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,730
Right here.

362
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:48,260
(To Susan)

363
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,460
She's leaving for the UK soon.

364
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,050
The world's so big,

365
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,420
she is exploring it.

366
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,620
Pick a stamp to stick on.

367
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,290
This one.

368
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,460
Wait.

369
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,620
I was wrong.

370
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,290
I meant, pick a stamp

371
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,420
the recipient would actually like.

372
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,180
Grandpa,

373
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,900
when did you become this slick?

374
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,250
Watch your tone.

375
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,490
Just kidding, Grandpa.

376
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,530
You little rascal.

377
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,460
Ms. Nie.

378
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,269
Of course I knew.

379
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,330
I knew it had to be you calling.

380
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:50,140
I was just painting fans
with my grandson.

381
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,530
He painted one too.

382
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,010
Guess what he drew?

383
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,250
He used watercolor markers
to draw a meteor shower.

384
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,180
Really?

385
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,810
Kids these days are so interesting.

386
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,180
He's coming over too.

387
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,309
How about I put you on speaker?

388
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,810
We can talk to you together.

389
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,140
Hello, Ms. Nie, I'm Duole.

390
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,620
Hello, young man.

391
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,620
You know what?

392
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,509
When a comet orbits the sun,

393
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,050
it leaves behind a trail of debris.

394
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:26,250
And when the Earth
passes through that trail,

395
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,970
all those pieces of the comet

396
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:30,010
enter our atmosphere.

397
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,330
That's how we get a meteor shower.

398
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,730
Ms. Nie,

399
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,509
do wishes made on shooting stars

400
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,900
actually come true?

401
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,810
Only if you believe they do.

402
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,530
The sky is so clear tonight.

403
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,660
You can even see Altair and Vega.

404
00:24:59,030 --> 00:24:59,940
Really?

405
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,100
Over there.

406
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,570
I see them! There are so many stars!

407
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,349
Right above your head,

408
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,309
there's a bright white star.

409
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,380
Do you see it?

410
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,269
Over my head?

411
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,940
A bright white star?

412
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,220
Over there!

413
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,660
I see it!

414
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,490
That's Vega.

415
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,109
Now, look a bit northeast from there.

416
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,730
There's another bright star.

417
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,509
Northeast? Grandpa?

418
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,770
Let me check on my phone.

419
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,179
No need for that.

420
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,770
Northeast is that way.

421
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,069
That one?

422
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,789
Yes!

423
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,549
See it?

424
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,309
I see it!

425
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,109
I see it!

426
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,459
That must be Altair, right?

427
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,490
I can see it too!

428
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,380
That's actually Deneb.

429
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,939
Altair is just

430
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,730
southeast of Vega.

431
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,490
It's also called the Cowherd Star.

432
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,010
Its scientific name is Alpha Aquilae.

433
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,730
Southeast is over here.

434
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,330
That way.

435
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:00,979
I see it!

436
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,309
I see it!

437
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,100
I see it!

438
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,620
Ms. Nie,

439
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,100
I have a question.

440
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,620
Can you see all three stars from the UK?

441
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,380
Of course you can.

442
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,100
Otherwise,

443
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,380
why would they be called stars?

444
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,530
No matter where you are in the world,

445
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:20,010
no matter the time period,

446
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,970
they're always there.

447
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,810
They can transcend time

448
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,860
and cross through space.

449
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,900
Fascinating.

450
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:33,900
In ancient times,
people connected the stars into shapes,

451
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,570
and that's how constellations
came to be.

452
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:39,770
Altair

453
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,420
is the brightest star
in the Aquila constellation.

454
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,490
And Vega

455
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,730
is the brightest star
in the Lyra constellation.

456
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,700
Yes, Ms. Nie.

457
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,219
Just like you said, after I put in

458
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,899
the lotus root mud.

459
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,330
Then, I watched

460
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,220
as the orchids

461
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,940
came back to life!

462
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,860
Then,

463
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,380
I watered it,

464
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,730
and praised it a little.

465
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,530
And guess what?

466
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,730
It sprouted three flower buds!

467
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,380
Isn't that amazing?

468
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,970
It looks like it'll bloom in a few days.

469
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,730
When it does,
I'll send you a photo for sure.

470
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,620
Great.

471
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,490
I'll be waiting for the good news.

472
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,940
What brings you here?

473
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,180
I need your help.

474
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,860
The college

475
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,660
is planning a centennial celebration.

476
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,940
All retired teachers are expected

477
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,940
to perform something.

478
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,219
We discussed it and figured

479
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,460
a chorus might be the best fit.

480
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,179
Everyone says you're cultured.

481
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,220
So, I came to you for some ideas.

482
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,810
I can give you some ideas,

483
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,660
but I'm not joining the choir.

484
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,810
Why not?

485
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,010
Still won't go back to campus?

486
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,589
You literature folks

487
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,730
overthink everything.

488
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,749
When people get old,

489
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,380
they become

490
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,029
forgetful! You know?

491
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:50,869
No one else remembers

492
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,420
except you.

493
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,220
It's all the same.

494
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,810
Some people remember everything.

495
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,660
Come on, haven't we all moved on?

496
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,660
I heard Ms. Lian

497
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,100
has a new man now.

498
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,010
Besides, you've started
a new chapter too.

499
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,269
Men should not be so petty.

500
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:14,420
You fall down, you get back up.

501
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,179
Listen up,

502
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,490
if you won't go,

503
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,220
I won't form the choir.

504
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,220
Am I really that important?

505
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,140
What song do you have in mind?

506
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,940
How about "Wildflowers"?

507
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,330
We're good at that one.

508
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,700
Can't you be serious for once?

509
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,619
You haven't forgotten.

510
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,050
Look at you.

511
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,549
Helping you is pointless.

512
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,860
I know that for sure.

513
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,180
"Jasmine Flower"?

514
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,970
How about "Jasmine Flower"?

515
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:52,220
♪What a beautiful jasmine flower♪

516
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:56,660
♪What a beautiful jasmine flower♪

517
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,899
It's a Jiangsu folk song.

518
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,730
Exactly.

519
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:00,970
Not bad.

520
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:02,700
Let's lock that in.

521
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,269
Also, I was thinking.

522
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,349
While we're at it,

523
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,810
we'll form a choir.

524
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,419
I'll bring in Tian to coach everyone

525
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,069
and polish their singing.

526
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,069
See?

527
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,309
An ulterior motive!

528
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,570
Using this for your own gain.

529
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,140
Let me finish it.

530
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,970
As for you,

531
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:22,620
bring Ms. Nie in as our advisor.

532
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,050
You old fox.

533
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,459
Alright.

534
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,140
I'll talk to Ms. Nie about it.

535
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,700
(Bo'ai Building)
The centennial celebration is nigh.

536
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,100
The schedule for
the auditorium is already packed.

537
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,379
Honestly,

538
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,730
if I hadn't stepped in,

539
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:43,250
we probably wouldn't have a venue.

540
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,810
Agreed.

541
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,899
So,

542
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,829
we just have to

543
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:49,789
bring in

544
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,770
someone like

545
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,789
Dean Ding,

546
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,069
who's highly respected by all

547
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,509
and always gets things done right,

548
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,970
to lead this whole thing.

549
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,419
With Dean Ding around,

550
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,570
everyone will feel reassured.

551
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,069
With the venue

552
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,140
and budget sorted,

553
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:07,869
May I know

554
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,730
what the two of you contributed?

555
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,619
This is crucial.

556
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,899
Let me report to you.

557
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,770
I,

558
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,810
Under my grandson's guidance,

559
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,379
I created a WeChat page

560
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,010
for our choir.

561
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,379
And I had my daughter-in-law, Lina,

562
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,220
look up costume info online.

563
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,939
We're sorting out
the outfits as we speak.

564
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,180
Not bad.

565
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,100
What about you?

566
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,330
I'm in charge of the equipment.

567
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:34,860
I went to borrow it.

568
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,490
I'm also recruiting members.

569
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,620
We need to recruit members?

570
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,379
We do have standards for this choir.

571
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,810
We have to pick people
who can sing and perform!

572
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:46,010
But, we can't make
the bar too high either.

573
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,659
Zhou Chun's oldest sister

574
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,549
has no teeth left.

575
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:51,309
She can't even speak clearly.
How could I possibly let her in?

576
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,840
She might be getting old,
but her enthusiasm is still strong.

577
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,460
We can't douse her spirit.

578
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,899
Since you're her supervisor,

579
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,749
cover her dentures,
then I'll let her join us.

580
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,699
Honestly, I think letting her in
is not a bad idea.

581
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,220
She can sing a solo part.

582
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,490
You're just messing around again, Shen.

583
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,460
Ms. Nie,

584
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:14,330
could you help us

585
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,250
name our choir?

586
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,109
I came up with a few ideas,

587
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,460
but none felt quite right.

588
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,940
Let's call it...

589
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,900
"Wind and Rainbow".

590
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,770
Wind and Rainbow.

591
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,700
These words

592
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,180
sum up our entire lives.

593
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,450
It's perfect.

594
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,730
Great.

595
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,540
That settles it.

596
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,036
Hang it up.

597
00:32:57,037 --> 00:32:58,309
(Wind and Rainbow Choir)

598
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,060
Almost there. Can we tighten it up?

599
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:01,810
I hereby announce,

600
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,939
the Wind and Rainbow Choir

601
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,660
is officially established today.

602
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:12,890
First of all,

603
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,180
let's give a warm welcome
to Professor Shen's return.

604
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:23,220
Professor Shen is truly
a man of great knowledge.

605
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,540
I believe that moving forward,

606
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,770
he'll surely provide our choir

607
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,850
with literary nourishment

608
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:32,629
and cultural enrichment.

609
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,330
Wonderful.

610
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,620
Spare us the fancy speech.

611
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,379
Actually, the one we should thank most

612
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,099
is Dean Ding.

613
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,220
This auditorium was fully booked.

614
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,379
But as soon as he stepped in,

615
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,099
he made the call.

616
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,250
From now on,
this will be our rehearsal venue.

617
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,810
Thank you, Dean Ding!

618
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,939
Pretty impressive, right?

619
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,930
Very impressive.

620
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,660
Jiang!

621
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,980
Mr. Jiang,

622
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,979
how should we run our rehearsals?

623
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,890
And how do we divide the vocal parts?

624
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,059
You're the expert on that.

625
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:04,979
Yeah.

626
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,789
Come on, Mr. Jiang. Take over.

627
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,459
Mr. Jiang!

628
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,349
Come on, Mr. Jiang.

629
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,979
All of you,

630
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,410
ladies and gentlemen.

631
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,349
Men, please step to the back.

632
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,770
Ladies, come to the front.

633
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,229
Okay, let's get into position.

634
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,019
Great.

635
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,850
I got it right by accident.

636
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,140
Everyone, leave about one fist

637
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,180
of space between you.

638
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:23,499
Good.

639
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,459
One fist apart.

640
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,810
One fist's space for everyone.

641
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,579
Why don't we try it out, Mr. Jiang?

642
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,140
Sure, I'll play.

643
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:50,309
♪What a beautiful jasmine flower♪

644
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:55,140
♪What a beautiful jasmine flower♪

645
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:00,099
♪Though the whole garden
is full of spring blooms♪

646
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,810

647
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,730
Sorry I'm late.

648
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,890
Ms. Nie, you're here.

649
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,059
I still didn't dare take the bus.

650
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,850
So, I stopped and rested a few times.

651
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,250
I ended up being late.

652
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:19,899
It's my fault.

653
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,629
Have a seat, catch your breath.

654
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:24,149
Sit down. It really is my fault.

655
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,189
I should've asked to meet
somewhere near your place.

656
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,189
I didn't think it through. Silly me.

657
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,330
Here, have some water.

658
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,810
Thank you.

659
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,330
Look at you.

660
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,980
Why do you blame yourself

661
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,850
for everything that goes wrong?

662
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,060
Did you forget?

663
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,410
I was the one

664
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,450
who picked this place.

665
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,500
Indeed.

666
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,770
I was just sitting here alone thinking,

667
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,410
this really is a great spot.

668
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,620
The view is stunning.

669
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,309
By the way,

670
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,060
Ms. Nie,

671
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,969
before you arrived, I was just watching
our rehearsal video.

672
00:35:56,969 --> 00:35:59,059
Look, this was our very first rehearsal.

673
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,020
A bit messy.

674
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,349
But everyone sounds so good.

675
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:06,930
It doesn't seem like the first time.

676
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,669
It helps that "Jasmine Flower"

677
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,979
is a Jiangsu classic.

678
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,250
Everyone can sing it.

679
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,060
While I was singing, I kept thinking

680
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,250
it was such a familiar song.

681
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,980
Should we do something creative

682
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,829
with the arrangement
to make it really stand out

683
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:24,850
and special?

684
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,540
Well...

685
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,060
Can we

686
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:33,250
add a line of Kunqu lyrics

687
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,540
into the song?

688
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,730
Mixing a folk song with opera brings out

689
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,180
the best in both.

690
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,060
That's wonderful.

691
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,419
Truly wonderful.

692
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,250
Crossovers are the trend these days.

693
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,019
Right?

694
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,019
Yes.

695
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,349
Which line of Kunqu do you think

696
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,330
would fit into "Jasmine Flower"?

697
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,980
Let us both

698
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,410
think about it.

699
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,700
No rush, okay?

700
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:02,749
Take a sip.

701
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,140
Alright, thank you.

702
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,140
In spring and autumn,

703
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,850
when the weather's clear,

704
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,290
you can see the Milky Way

705
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,980
from the top of Mount Zijin.

706
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,620
This place is beautiful.

707
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,540
You can even see

708
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,330
the astronomical dome.

709
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,730
Do you see that balcony?

710
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,709
That one?

711
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,410
Yes.

712
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:34,450
When I worked the night shift

713
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,540
in my younger days,
I used to lean on that railing

714
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,250
and just stare at the sky.

715
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:45,890
Very tasteful.

716
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,770
Do you remember I once told you

717
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,020
about the girl I met

718
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,500
who played the flute

719
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,059
on a windy night?

720
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,980
The one playing "Peony Pavilion"?

721
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,540
- Remember her?
- I do.

722
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,060
She lived near Taiping Gate.

723
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,020
Not far from here.

724
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:09,180
She said she often came up
to Mount Zijin at night.

725
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,370
She said the top of the mountain

726
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,269
was the closest place in the city

727
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,899
to the sky.

728
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,410
She said if you reached out,
you could pluck a star

729
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:21,810
to light up

730
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,370
the lantern that led you home.

731
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,770
When we're young,

732
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,100
our heads are full of wild,
beautiful ideas.

733
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,060
Every time I come here,

734
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,540
I stop at this spot

735
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,290
and take a photo.

736
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,330
How romantic.

737
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,370
I want to leave it for her.

738
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,540
Because that girl

739
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:52,730
is gone.

740
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,930
She's gone?

741
00:38:59,100 --> 00:38:59,810
Yes.

742
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,290
There was a slot

743
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,250
to return to the city.

744
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,770
It was hers.

745
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:10,410
She told me,

746
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,580
"You have a heart condition.

747
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,540
You should go back."

748
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,370
So, we made a promise.

749
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:21,930
When she came back the next year,

750
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,180
we'd come up this mountain

751
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,770
to watch the stars.

752
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,810
I came to this mountaintop as soon

753
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,330
as I came back.

754
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,220
I wanted to take

755
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,850
a beautiful photo for her.

756
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:40,060
I shot from sunrise to sunset

757
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,890
until the moon came out.

758
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,100
I took so many photos.

759
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:45,850
I then picked one.

760
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,450
The best shot I liked.

761
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,810
I mailed it to her.

762
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,180
And then?

763
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:57,100
Her reply never came.

764
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:00,700
I started asking around to find out why.

765
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,700
Then I learned that

766
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,290
there was a landslide
while she was working.

767
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,500
She went missing.

768
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,700
They've never found her.

769
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,540
People of our generation...

770
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,730
went through too much hardship.

771
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,410
We saw too much impermanence.

772
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,410
Later on,

773
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,850
I met Jingmin.

774
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,140
We fell in love and got married.

775
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,180
Our life was smooth and steady.

776
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,789
But somehow,

777
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:40,770
I always felt

778
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,540
a little guilty deep down.

779
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:45,250
Especially

780
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:46,770
when I hear

781
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,410
"Peony Pavilion".

782
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,020
I feel like I let her down.

783
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,220
Look.

784
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:04,140
Just in the Milky Way alone,

785
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,500
there are hundreds of billions of stars.

786
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:09,290
The universe is so vast.

787
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,540
And Earth

788
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,020
is just a tiny speck in all of that.

789
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,250
I don't really go out much,

790
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,410
but every time I look up at the stars,

791
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,770
I feel completely free.

792
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,220
Do you think maybe one day,

793
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,770
at some random moment,

794
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,140
someone who's gone

795
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,890
could send us a message

796
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,290
from another planet?

797
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,770
It's possible.

798
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:41,669
Or maybe it's a fold in time and space.

799
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,220
We might never truly know.

800
00:41:45,056 --> 00:41:46,100
Think about it.

801
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,330
When we calm down and listen to Kunqu,

802
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,290
don't you sometimes feel like

803
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,100
you've somehow traveled back in time?

804
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,100
Yeah.

805
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,220
I do.

806
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,850
Then tell me,

807
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,220
do you think

808
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,620
we might come back

809
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,290
from the past too?

810
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,850
Then, we should leave a mark for today.

811
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:11,850
Look.

812
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,100
The Big Dipper

813
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:17,290
it's like a ruler laid out in the sky.

814
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,250
You see it there, at three o'clock?

815
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:21,379
I see it.

816
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,500
That star

817
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,220
is the North Star.

818
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:34,700
Ms. Nie,

819
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,250
spending time with you

820
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,850
makes me feel

821
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,980
a sense of vastness
I've never known before.

822
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,020
Ms. Nie.

823
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,020
I'm sorry.
