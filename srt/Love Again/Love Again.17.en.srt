=Love Again=

2
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,140
=Episode 17=

3
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:38,810
What?

4
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,419
Ms. Nie wasn't willing
to see my father-in-law, huh?

5
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,450
That's right.

6
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,220
However,

7
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:47,450
Ms. Nie was pretty courteous to me

8
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,570
and Ms. Peng.

9
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,090
But we were pretty sensible.

10
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,010
We said we were heading out
to buy some stuff.

11
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,500
We gave them time to speak

12
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,500
in private.

13
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,730
But your father-in-law came out

14
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:58,800
before we went downstairs.

15
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,230
I was calling him from the back.

16
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,980
I called him multiple times.

17
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,340
He didn't hear me.

18
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,320
He was distracted.

19
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,420
Mom,

20
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,930
how was Ms. Nie's condition
when you guys went there?

21
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,060
The caretaker thought
she was doing well.

22
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,680
She said she took half a bowl of congee.

23
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,220
I don't think she was doing well.

24
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,250
She was so pale.

25
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,930
She looked like a vampire.

26
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,410
I think

27
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,530
she didn't want Dad
to see her in that state.

28
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,750
When is her son coming back?

29
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,340
In two days.

30
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,780
In two days?

31
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,060
My goodness.

32
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,250
This is...

33
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,660
Let me answer a call.

34
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,370
Jin.

35
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:48,900
Mr. Shen.

36
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:49,689
What's the matter?

37
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,370
It's like this.

38
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,639
By the way,

39
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,340
you have to tell Shen Qing about this.

40
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,130
He should stop jogging like that.

41
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,090
Working overtime
is already a huge burden

42
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:58,970
to his body.

43
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,950
He might die if he does
long-distance jogging.

44
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,399
If something does happen to him,

45
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,020
no one can rescue him.

46
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:04,810
Mr. Shen.

47
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,220
Mr. Shen?

48
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,300
Is that okay?

49
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,410
Alright. Send it to Mr. An.

50
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,130
Alright.

51
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,639
I'll send it to Mr. An, then.

52
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,060
Okay.

53
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,650
As humans,

54
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,180
we need to look after our bodies.

55
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,650
Just look at Ms. Nie.

56
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,930
She was so pitiful.

57
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,530
You get yourself a partner

58
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,180
to enjoy your later years in life,

59
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,220
not to look after you
and see you off one last time.

60
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,410
That's about it.

61
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:37,910
Don't you agree?

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,680
His wife just passed away. And now,
he's facing a similar situation.

63
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,180
Who could withstand such an event?

64
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,500
Lower your volume. Stop saying that.

65
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,810
What's wrong? Did I say something wrong?

66
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,650
Fine. I'll stop here.

67
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,130
I need to head back now.

68
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,800
I have to cook for your father.

69
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,409
I've been visiting the hospital too much

70
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,800
that I didn't have time
to look after your father.

71
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,649
It must've been tough.

72
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,780
Alright. I'll be going now.

73
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,529
You can go ahead.

74
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,770
I'll stop telling him about it.

75
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,370
Okay.

76
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,500
Stop seeing me off.

77
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,870
You guys have to cook as well.
I'll make a move now.

78
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,060
Mom, take care.

79
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,250
Alright.

80
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,139
How could you
not bid farewell to my mother

81
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,020
when she was leaving?

82
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,510
Can you ask your mother
to think before she speaks?

83
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,899
What does she mean by
my father is facing a similar situation?

84
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,950
That's terrible, you know?

85
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,220
My mother has the right to say anything.

86
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,090
When your mother was sick,
my mother took care of her.

87
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,780
This time, my mother was the one
who rescued Ms. Nie as well.

88
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,849
If my mother actually
gave it some thought,

89
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,650
she would never come to the Shen family

90
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,049
and work as a free labor.

91
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,490
So what if she said that?

92
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,140
Where are you going?

93
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,140
I'm going to jog.

94
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,220
You shouldn't just jog
when I criticize you.

95
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,220
Even my mother knows

96
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,530
working 9-9-6 and jogging
can easily lead to sudden death.

97
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,250
I'll stop, then. Are you happy now?

98
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,340
I know you're worried about your father.

99
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,700
You think I'm not worried about him?

100
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,380
But love is fragile in the face

101
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,290
of reality.

102
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,090
Dad.

103
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,340
Dad?

104
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,260
You're here, huh?

105
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,290
Dad, where did you go?

106
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,260
It's so windy outside.

107
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,700
I went to the market.

108
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,020
I bought some chrysanthemum greens.

109
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,490
Ms. Nie likes lighter food.

110
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,020
Dad,

111
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,380
you should take some medicine.

112
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,090
Okay.

113
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,769
You want to make chrysanthemum
greens soup with egg, right?

114
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,530
I'll make it.

115
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,490
It's fine.

116
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:19,989
This is a simple soup to make.

117
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,940
I can make it myself.

118
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:24,700
Dad,

119
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,290
didn't Ms. Nie say

120
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,470
that she didn't want you
to visit her at the hospital?

121
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,380
I have to visit her.

122
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,410
If I don't go now,

123
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:37,700
then when?

124
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,580
I have a cough.

125
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,460
I won't enter her ward.

126
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,380
Professor Shen?

127
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,220
What are you doing here?

128
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,649
Aren't you entering her ward?

129
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:13,970
I...

130
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,339
I was planning to head there.

131
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,340
But I have a cough.

132
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,260
I'm afraid that I might

133
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,020
infect her.

134
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,900
Great timing.

135
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,170
So,

136
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,050
please deliver this soup
to her on my behalf.

137
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,460
I made this chrysanthemum
greens soup with egg. It's light.

138
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,900
Did you make it yourself?

139
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:33,900
That's right.

140
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,780
Look. There's one more thing inside.

141
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,410
There's a radio.

142
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,710
That's quite a serious cough
you have there.

143
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:44,850
I'm fine.

144
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,460
And this.

145
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,090
For this radio,

146
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,560
there’s an opera channel in there.

147
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,970
I've downloaded some
to the memory card.

148
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,120
Tell her that I've downloaded
some opera songs.

149
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,070
She can listen to them
when she likes it.

150
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,460
You...

151
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,360
Please help me out.

152
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,340
You're so thoughtful.

153
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:13,850
If so,

154
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,339
sorry for the trouble.

155
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,620
I'll surely deliver them to her.

156
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,040
By the way,

157
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,090
Peng,

158
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,850
don't tell her that I was here.

159
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,610
Just say

160
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:32,000
that you brought these things for her.

161
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,380
I'll entrust this task to you.

162
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,460
Please go now.

163
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:40,890
Okay.

164
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,180
Ms. Nie,

165
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,890
Professor Shen made this for you.

166
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,060
I made this for you.

167
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,420
He was afraid that he might
infect you with his cough.

168
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,660
That's why he told me
to deliver this to you.

169
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,130
He even wanted me
to send his regards to you.

170
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,220
You have two sets of soup

171
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,870
that are filled with love.

172
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,060
Ms. Nie, you're amazing.

173
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,920
Thank you guys so much.

174
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,060
Was Professor Shen's cough serious?

175
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,660
I think he caught a cold.

176
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:20,610
It's not that bad.

177
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:23,330
By the way,

178
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,300
there's this as well.

179
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,840
Professor Shen told me
to hand this to you.

180
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,610
He said he recorded your favorite songs.

181
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,370
You mustn't get off the bed.

182
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:11,820
It's fine.

183
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:18,610
Slowly.

184
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,300
Was it nice?

185
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:56,540
Yeah.

186
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,250
Ms. Nie.

187
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,660
Ms. Nie, your son is calling you.

188
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,610
Your son is calling you.

189
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:47,490
Hello?

190
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,730
Hello, Mom?
I have something to tell you.

191
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:50,490
What is it?

192
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,060
Ru will give birth soon.

193
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:52,500
What?

194
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,509
Her delivery is two days earlier
than the due date.

195
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,940
Ru is going to give birth?

196
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,240
That's right.

197
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,930
I plan to change into sterile clothing
and keep her company inside.

198
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,610
Mom, I'm sorry.

199
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,460
I won't be flying there tonight.

200
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,239
I've changed my flight
to tomorrow afternoon.

201
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,420
It's fine.

202
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,060
You don't need to rush back here.

203
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,300
At this moment,
you should keep Ru company.

204
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,610
I've gotten much better.

205
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,800
My condition has been stabilized.

206
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,850
And, Ms. Wang took great care of me.

207
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,730
Don't worry about it.

208
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:21,820
Mom, I...

209
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,060
Son, listen to me.

210
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,010
Love is

211
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,220
passed down from the top.

212
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,060
I'm old now.

213
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,070
But your child
is just born into the world.

214
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,090
At this moment,

215
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,770
you have to look after Ru

216
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,250
and witness the moment

217
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,910
as a new life is born into the world.

218
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:46,770
Okay.

219
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,460
Mom, I'll head inside first.

220
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,090
Am I wrong?

221
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,220
Love is actually strong
in the face of reality.

222
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,060
(Healthy lotus seeds and red bean soup)
Lotus seeds.

223
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,970
How much should I put?

224
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,420
My goodness.

225
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,690
She's inferior to the matron.

226
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,940
The matron took care of
the entire family herself.

227
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:00,540
But Ms. Nie?

228
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,180
Her entire family
took care of her instead.

229
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,340
She’s having a cancer relapse.

230
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,300
My goodness.

231
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,820
Peng Yulan is considered her love rival.

232
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,250
Even so, she's looking after her.

233
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,220
You keep comparing them.

234
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,580
What's the point?

235
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,730
I was just stating facts.

236
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,490
And, I'm only telling you about it.

237
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:28,940
Hello?

238
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,130
Peng Yulan.

239
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,420
Baoqin.

240
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,090
Ms. Nie just got herself a grandson.

241
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,800
She didn't want her son
to come back and visit her.

242
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,940
Isn't that like forgetting your mother
after having a son?

243
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,610
That's ridiculous!

244
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,470
His son was just born.

245
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,730
He can keep his child
company for the rest of his life.

246
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,300
But her mother
is suffering from a cancer relapse.

247
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,820
How long can he keep her company?

248
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,890
Am I right? How many times
can he come back and visit her?

249
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,890
Does he intend to come back
during her memorial service?

250
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,730
I said it already! One shouldn't
send their children abroad.

251
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,539
Once you do it,
your child is no longer yours.

252
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,670
They'll turn into ingrates.

253
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,700
You guys...

254
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,730
Mom, calm down. Talk nicely.

255
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,090
Fine. I'll calm down.

256
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,490
I'll talk nicely. Got it.

257
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,700
In-law.

258
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,540
If her son doesn't come back,

259
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,610
what does Ms. Nie intend

260
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,370
to do with her condition?

261
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,890
Ms. Wang said

262
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,250
she had chosen conservative therapy.

263
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:38,790
Conservative...

264
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,700
By the way, Shen Qing,

265
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,300
did you show her X-ray film
to the experts at the cancer hospital?

266
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,130
What did they say?

267
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:44,660
Yeah.

268
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,130
There's no better solution.

269
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,180
Even so, we can't just leave
Ms. Nie in the hospital

270
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,760
and let the caretaker take care of her.

271
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:55,770
Dad,

272
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,610
does Ms. Nie have any other relatives
in the country?

273
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:01,220
No.

274
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,770
Why don't I deliver meals
to Ms. Nie every day?

275
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:08,180
You?

276
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:09,440
Will you...

277
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,610
Who'll cook?

278
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:13,850
I...

279
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:14,890
I...

280
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,770
Can you stop? You can't do it.

281
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,250
This won't do.

282
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,850
Do you know how particular

283
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,420
the meals of a cancer patient are?

284
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,160
You have to
make them different every day.

285
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,490
When your wife was sick,

286
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,890
our entire family took care of her.

287
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,890
Each of us had a mission, you know?

288
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:30,580
Dad,

289
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,610
calm down.

290
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,130
Let's think of other solutions.

291
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:38,420
How about we bring Teacher Nie home
to rest and recover?

292
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:40,660
This...

293
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:42,890
But,

294
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,250
Dad,

295
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,520
I don't think that's appropriate.

296
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,220
What do you mean by that?

297
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,580
It's very inappropriate.

298
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,060
Who's Ms. Nie to our family?

299
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,190
Now, you want to take her to our house?

300
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,770
Mom, stop talking.

301
00:16:58,770 --> 00:16:59,730
Why should I?

302
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:00,970
You keep making me talk less.

303
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,250
But I have to tell him this.

304
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,580
I have to clarify things.

305
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,939
I was the one who rescued Ms. Nie.

306
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,950
I have the right to speak.

307
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,130
In-law.

308
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,530
You see,

309
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,730
you can't just take pity
on Ms. Nie forever.

310
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,729
You should take pity on your son.

311
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:15,660
Just look at Shen Qing.

312
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,050
He works overtime every day.
Isn't he pitiful?

313
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,099
Look at your daughter-in-law as well.

314
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,290
She's busy all day long.
Isn't she pitiful?

315
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:22,870
Enough already.

316
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,420
When your wife was sick,

317
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,900
we were so exhausted.

318
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,380
Lina's headaches

319
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,100
kept acting up,

320
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,859
yet she still took care
of her mother-in-law.

321
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,170
Now, the family can finally rest.

322
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,660
If you bring Ms. Nie here,

323
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,220
who will suffer? You? Or Lina?

324
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,700
Mom, calm down.

325
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,180
Dad was just saying.

326
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:38,900
What was that?

327
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,380
He can't think

328
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,810
or say something like that.

329
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:42,380
Mom.

330
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:42,940
Listen to me.

331
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,100
I'll talk to him.

332
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:44,660
I...

333
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,910
Let me talk to him!

334
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,330
In-law,

335
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,810
Ms. Nie feels sorry for her son.

336
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,769
That's why she didn't
want him to come back.

337
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,570
I also feel sorry for my daughter,

338
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,100
you know?

339
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,810
Why must my daughter

340
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,720
take care of her
when her son isn't around?

341
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,970
In-law, we can't just do that.

342
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,290
Back then,

343
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,220
when my daughter wasn't married yet,

344
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,120
she didn't even need to do any chores.

345
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,809
Now that she's married into your family,

346
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:12,810
I don't expect you guys
to treat her like a princess.

347
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,220
But you guys can't just
keep taking advantage of her.

348
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,620
When she lived with us,

349
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,900
she was our baby too.

350
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,460
Don't you agree?

351
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,530
I was being inconsiderate.

352
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,380
Enough, Mom. Stop it.

353
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:27,940
Let's go.

354
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,700
Dad, rest early.

355
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,130
We'll figure something out.

356
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:31,730
Let's go.

357
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,530
In-law,

358
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,480
listen to me...

359
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,940
I have to talk to him.

360
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,100
- In-law.
- Let's go.

361
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,620
Why are you dragging me?

362
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,460
Dad,

363
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:51,770
calm down.

364
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,770
Let's think of other solutions.

365
00:19:15,057 --> 00:19:17,100
(Love Will Never Fade)

366
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,420
Thank you.

367
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,730
Ms. Zhang, you're here.

368
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,140
Thank you for coming.

369
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,180
Thank you.

370
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:25,900
Okay.

371
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,730
Thank you.

372
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,050
Thank you.
I didn't expect you to show up.

373
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:32,970
Dad.

374
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,180
Qing has told me

375
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:36,830
about Ms. Nie's condition.

376
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,010
I think we can consider a nursing home
with rehabilitation functions.

377
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,529
After all, they're professionals.

378
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,530
Alright. Please come inside.
Your name is inside.

379
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,860
Please come inside. Take a look.

380
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,700
Isn't this Lyu?

381
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,760
I don't even recognize her.

382
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,330
She's getting younger and prettier.

383
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,180
Thank you.

384
00:19:54,604 --> 00:20:02,990
(Dai, I think that's a good idea.
Find a nursing home for me.)

385
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:15,249
(Gou Bingqiang, Tian Zhenyang, Love Will Never Fade)
Dear guests, I'm very honored to witness

386
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,050
the sacred wedding of our couple
together with you all.

387
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,860
Next, let us give a big hand

388
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,660
to the happiest couple of the day.

389
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:30,940
Excellent!

390
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,200
Firstly, I would like to thank

391
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,900
you all for sparing your time

392
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,220
to attend

393
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,180
the second wedding

394
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:45,970
of Tian and I.

395
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,180
Secondly,

396
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,200
I have to apologize.

397
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:52,900
Look.

398
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,180
I got myself a beautiful wife.

399
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,760
I'm sure you guys are envious.

400
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,330
Look at that old fool.

401
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,970
Although our wedding is quite simple,

402
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,010
our relationship

403
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,700
has been through the refinement process.

404
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:09,530
We got to know each other

405
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,860
during our dance lessons.

406
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,729
After the dance lesson was over,
I wanted to send her home.

407
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,489
She said that she could return home herself.

408
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,420
I told her to stop being courteous

409
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,100
as I was passing by her house.

410
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,180
In the end, she realized

411
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,730
that I made a detour
just to get to her house.

412
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,480
But during our journey, she told me

413
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:33,050
that she loved

414
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,620
the sound of saxophone.

415
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,420
I was elated!

416
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,570
I was a great saxophone player.

417
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,050
Actually,

418
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,100
He's great indeed.

419
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,570
He's great at bragging!

420
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,730
She's right.
I didn't know how to play a saxophone.

421
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:56,770
However,

422
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:57,970
on the very next day,

423
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,820
I bought a saxophone
and started learning how to play it.

424
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,530
I went to Mount Zijin to play a song.

425
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,660
The birds were my audience.

426
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,140
I was out of breath.

427
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,570
But it took me just 28 days

428
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,380
to learn how to play a song.

429
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,380
Excellent!

430
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,010
Gou, that's amazing!

431
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:18,700
To be honest,

432
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,530
people do grow old.

433
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,970
However, love never grows old.

434
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,900
When you fall for someone,

435
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,140
it's always convenient for you
no matter where her house is.

436
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,660
You're free every day of the year!

437
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:36,210
Excellent words!

438
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:36,810
Excellent!

439
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,769
Some people might say things like,

440
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,140
"Do you know how old you are?

441
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,450
What's with all the lovey-dovey stuff?
It's too mushy."

442
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,700
I don't agree with that.

443
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,290
It's precisely because of our age.

444
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,050
Especially me. I have a weak heart.

445
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,530
I might die at any time.

446
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,050
Therefore,

447
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:59,100
I’ve come to understand more
the impermanence of life,

448
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,470
and the occasional
coming together and parting.

449
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,570
Therefore, if you love someone,

450
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,420
you must express it.

451
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,250
You must marry her or him.

452
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,660
Don't leave any regrets behind!

453
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,290
Excellent!

454
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,200
I'll put it on for you.

455
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,050
Tian,

456
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,140
we encountered each other
halfway into our lives.

457
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,180
Let's lead a good life together.

458
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,530
Let's love each other as much as we can.

459
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,220
Alright.

460
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,450
I'll heed your will.

461
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:09,860
In the future,

462
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,420
no matter which of us passes away first,

463
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,720
the other party

464
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,700
must give them a good farewell.

465
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,620
Excellent!

466
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,340
Excellent!

467
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:36,700
Kiss her!

468
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:44,970
Excellent!

469
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,100
Excellent!

470
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,250
Excellent!

471
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,380
Excellent!

472
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,100
Lastly,

473
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,940
I would like to thank everyone

474
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,100
for attending our wedding.

475
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,770
Thank you so much.

476
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:03,290
Excellent!

477
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,900
Excellent!

478
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,046
(Shen Dai, I'm worried about her.)

479
00:25:10,046 --> 00:25:11,180
Excellent!

480
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:12,720
Excellent!

481
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:20,010
Cheers!

482
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:25,860
Dai,

483
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,770
have you found a nursing home?

484
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,940
I found several of them online.

485
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,560
I'll send them to you right now.

486
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,240
Send them to me.

487
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,530
I'll check them out one by one.

488
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:37,970
Dad,

489
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,010
are you upset?

490
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,460
Gou, what are you doing outside?

491
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,100
I'm truly sorry about Ms. Nie.

492
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,569
I didn't know that she was sick

493
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:02,010
when I introduced her to you.

494
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:04,390
Don't say that.

495
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,100
I should thank you instead.

496
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,010
The universe is vast.

497
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,750
And, you helped me
to find my kindred spirit.

498
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,220
I'm serious.

499
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,729
Don't let me spoil your mood. Let's go.

500
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:18,110
Let's go.

501
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:21,570
(Gou Bingqiang, Tian Zhenyang)

502
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,290
My father is using Ibrutinib

503
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,010
However,

504
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,770
he's resistant to the drug now.

505
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,400
I just want to ask you guys

506
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,710
if there are any new drugs
that have been developed lately.

507
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:32,380
Or

508
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,200
do you guys have any drugs
that are undergoing clinical trials?

509
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,530
I can send my father there
to be a volunteer.

510
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,290
Alright.

511
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,570
Please keep an eye out for it.

512
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,180
Thank you.

513
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,140
Gou.

514
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,570
Thank you

515
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,220
for visiting all those
nursing homes with me.

516
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,250
I introduced Ms. Nie to you.

517
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,990
I have to be accountable for it
until the end.

518
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:11,780
What are you laughing at?

519
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,580
You're such a responsible person, huh?

520
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,480
That's an unknown number.

521
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:20,700
Answer it.

522
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:23,460
Hello?

523
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,220
Hello?

524
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,620
Is this Professor Shen?

525
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,220
I'm Nie Juanjuan.

526
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,180
Ms. Nie?

527
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:31,770
Ms. Nie,

528
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:32,570
you...

529
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:33,960
Have you gotten better?

530
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:34,770
I...

531
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,530
May I visit you?

532
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,730
I'm much better now.

533
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,940
Are you free tomorrow at 3 P.M.?

534
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,620
The flowers in the hospital's garden
have bloomed.

535
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:49,970
We can

536
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:51,490
go and admire them.

537
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:57,530
You can walk now?

538
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,140
That's great.

539
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,290
Alright.

540
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,290
I'll be there by 3 P.M.

541
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,420
Coincidentally, I have

542
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,480
an important decision to make.

543
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,620
I wish to share it with you.

544
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:14,100
Sure.

545
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,290
I'll lend you my ears.

546
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:18,380
Alright, then.

547
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,530
See you there.

548
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:22,490
See you there.

549
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:25,860
It's Ms. Nie.

550
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,220
She called me first.

551
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,860
She asked to meet me tomorrow at 3 P.M.

552
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,810
This is great!

553
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,100
You have to tell her everything

554
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,900
about your plan,

555
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,620
including the details.

556
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:47,530
You have to.

557
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,010
You want to live in a nursing home?

558
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,100
And, Ms. Nie will be there as well?

559
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,860
Dad, your health isn't the best.

560
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,520
You have to visit the hospital often.

561
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,329
And now, you want to
look after another patient?

562
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,870
Will your body be able to withstand it?

563
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,180
That's right.

564
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,970
Ms. Nie lives alone.

565
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:11,010
I can understand
if she's moving to a nursing home.

566
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,010
But you have children and grandchildren.

567
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:15,000
Why are you moving to a nursing home?

568
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,140
I don't agree with it.

569
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,860
A few years back,
when your mother was sick,

570
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:23,420
you, Lina, and Lina's parents

571
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,220
had made huge sacrifices.

572
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,380
All these years,

573
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,180
this family of ours

574
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,620
had been a blissful one.

575
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,769
If so, why are you moving to a nursing home?

576
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,730
Why would someone blissful
move to a nursing home?

577
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,290
What should we do about Ms. Nie, then?

578
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,330
She can no longer live alone.

579
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,460
I've been to all those nursing homes.

580
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,890
I've made my inquiries as well.

581
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,809
The nursing homes
have great living conditions.

582
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,390
They even have professional caretakers.

583
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,570
This is what I think.

584
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,100
You see, you're busy with work.

585
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,180
Duole is growing up as well.

586
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:55,830
If I move to a nursing home

587
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,380
and take care of Ms. Nie,

588
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,049
there will be more time for everyone.

589
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,010
Lina can even do the things she likes.

590
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:01,480
Am I right?

591
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,490
Dad, stop using me as an excuse.

592
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,830
No matter how good the living conditions
are, it's not as good as our family's.

593
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,530
I know you want to spend
more time with Ms. Nie.

594
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,170
If so, we can think of other solutions.

595
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:14,330
Dad,

596
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:15,810
what about this?

597
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,050
If you insist on moving
to a nursing home,

598
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,700
can we find one
that's near to our house?

599
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:20,900
I can

600
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,660
send you there when I go to work

601
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,010
and pick you up after work.

602
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,010
Is that okay?

603
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,620
But you never get off work.

604
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,460
Even so, you're still around, right?

605
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,490
In the end, I still have to do it.

606
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,870
I have to do everything.

607
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,100
I spoke up for you when my mother

608
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,429
felt sorry for me, you know?

609
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,899
After all this time, you never stopped
to consider my feelings.

610
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,770
Wait. Lina, you...

611
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:41,420
You...

612
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:44,140
Look.

613
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,250
You two are arguing

614
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,729
because of this point again, right?

615
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:49,640
You guys got into a conflict
because of me again.

616
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,180
If I move to a nursing home now,

617
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,530
you guys will have more time,

618
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,810
and you guys won't
need to worry about me.

619
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,900
This way, you guys
wouldn't need to argue.

620
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,380
Dad, I'm your son.

621
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,330
Who else should I be worried about?

622
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,290
You can show concern to Ms. Nie,

623
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,490
write to her,

624
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,770
or visit her anytime you like.

625
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:09,630
But why must you

626
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,380
move to a nursing home
together with her?

627
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,060
Can't you spare a little thought for me?

628
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,970
What are you saying?

629
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,530
How am I not sparing a thought for you?

630
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,490
Enough.

631
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,530
Anyway, I'm just here
to notify you guys.

632
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:23,900
No.

633
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,530
I've already made up my mind. That's it.

634
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:26,380
But...

635
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:27,940
Dad,

636
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:28,620
you...

637
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,050
This...

638
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,620
What should we do?

639
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,290
How should I know?

640
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,160
What should we do?

641
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,380
Mom is right.

642
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:41,330
Your father

643
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:43,810
is there to provide for
Ms. Nie's care in her last few years.

644
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,620
How can we not worry about him?

645
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:47,700
Our entire family

646
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,940
had to take care of her

647
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,150
when Ms. Nie was hospitalized.

648
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,620
You should stop.

649
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,650
You're behaving more and more
like your mother.

650
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:55,870
What's wrong with my mother?

651
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,009
My mother delivered meals
to your mother in hospital.

652
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,420
She did the same for your father.

653
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,100
She even did the same for Ms. Nie.

654
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,180
Did my mother offend you?

655
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,049
The Shen family is full of hypocrites.

656
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,720
You guys adopt realism on the one hand
and criticize it on the other.

657
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:10,660
Talk to me.

658
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,070
Why are you keeping quiet?

659
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:15,770
Where are you going?

660
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,000
I'm going to jog.

661
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,020
He always goes jogging
when the situation isn't in his favor.

662
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,740
Don't come back if you're that capable.

663
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,060
Here. Have some water.

664
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:27,660
It's fine.

665
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:28,910
Who's there?

666
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:32,810
Lina texted me.

667
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:36,179
(Lina: My father-in-law said he wanted
to move to a nursing home with Ms. Nie.)

668
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,860
She said my in-law
wanted to move to a nursing home

669
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,460
with Ms. Nie.

670
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,280
What should we do?

671
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,770
I don't know.

672
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,620
Is he sick in the head?

673
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,690
He doesn't want to live in his own house
with his children.

674
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:53,370
He wants to waste his money
on a nursing home instead.

675
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:54,660
What is he thinking?

676
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:55,970
My goodness.

677
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,770
Are all men sick in the head?

678
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,140
Why am I involved now? Geez.

679
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,110
My goodness.

680
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:05,780
How dare you talk back...

681
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,530
You should stop arguing.

682
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:15,730
Say, why do you think he wants
to live in a nursing home?

683
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,000
What about his treatment?

684
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,330
I have no idea.

685
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,010
Peng Yulan.

686
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:23,940
I think my in-law

687
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,620
is still a loyal person
with deep feelings.

688
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,920
You should wait for him.

689
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:28,760
It's worth it.

690
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:33,250
Sweet talk means nothing.

691
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,660
This is what you call true love.

692
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:39,810
Baoqin, say,

693
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,100
in this life,

694
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,050
do you think

695
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,380
we've experienced true love before?

696
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,530
True love, huh?

697
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,660
Look at Liu.

698
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,290
I...

699
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,940
Although our love isn't anything flashy,

700
00:33:59,290 --> 00:33:59,860
I...

701
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,570
Anyway, if he doesn't
return home tonight,

702
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,900
I won't be able to sleep.

703
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,810
Is that love?

704
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,700
Or is that just a habit?

705
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,970
When a habit becomes second nature,
that's love.

706
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,320
Peng Yulan, you're something else.

707
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:18,800
You're quite fancy with your words.

708
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:27,470
Excellent!

709
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,450
Excellent!

710
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:29,540
Drink up!

711
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:32,060
No. I sang out of tune just now.

712
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:32,980
Drink up.

713
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:35,330
You're finally here.

714
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,250
RF's professional singer is here!

715
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,020
Welcome!

716
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,590
Let's welcome Mr. Shen.

717
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:40,760
Welcome, Mr. Shen.

718
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:42,850
Where's Dr. Qin?

719
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:45,410
I thought we were going
to discuss the research.

720
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,410
Dr. Qin?

721
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,300
You would never come
if I didn't tell you that.

722
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,290
This is a fine hour.
Stop talking about research.

723
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,810
Life is short.
We should enjoy it while we can.

724
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:54,580
Come on. Pour Mr. Shen some liquor.

725
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:55,160
Mr. Shen.

726
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,290
Ice, it's your song.

727
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,700
Sit down.

728
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,930
This is actually a song for my mother.

That was nice.

750

You guys sang amazingly.

751
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,020
You two are something else.

752
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:58,980

I feel terrible.

760
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,810
My father-in-law finally
found his kindred spirit.

761
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:36,680
But in the end,

762
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,140
she has a terminal disease.

763
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,449
What should you guys do, then?

764
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,330
I have no idea.

765
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,330
He wants

766
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:45,100
to move to a nursing home
together with her.

767
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,249
Shen Qing and I argued because of that.

768
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,300
Shen Qing went for a jog.

769
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,620
Why did you argue with him, then?

770
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:54,280
Shen Qing feels sorry for his father.

771
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:55,060
According to him,

772
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,450
his father shouldn't stay there
together with her.

773
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:58,900
He can visit her every day.

774
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:00,730
Every day, you know?

775
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,620
Who'll send him there and pick him up?

776
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,830
He's always busy. I have
to fetch my father-in-law.

777
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,660
I have to send both
his father and his son.

778
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,180
Doesn't that make me

779
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,250
a free chauffeur?

780
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,660
You're full of anguish and complaints.

781
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,730
I would've gone for a jog as well
if I were Shen Qing.

782
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,370
I'm in my prime, you know?

783
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,660
But my husband never comes home early.

784
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,689
Although the old madam
has a terminal disease,

785
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:26,289
my father-in-law is still willing
to spend time with her, you know?

786
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:28,580
That old madam is outstanding indeed.

787
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,540
You should learn from your elders.

788
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,220
Why should I learn from her?

789
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,960
Why can't Shen Qing
learn from his father?

790
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,500
Shen Qing's father
was an old baby, you know?

791
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,619
He only became a love saint
after his wife's passing.

792
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,360
What do you want Shen Qing
to learn from him?

793
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,020
Does that mean he'll only learn
after he changes his wife?

794
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,530
If so, I'll live for as long as I can

795
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,700
to stop Shen Qing
from taking after his father's steps.

796
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:50,700
Liu Lina, you're something else.

797
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,500
You're truly ruthless.

798
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,730
My husband is never home.

799
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:57,890
My father-in-law wants to live
in a nursing home.

800
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:00,770
My son wants to study abroad.

801
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:04,180
All of them want to leave the house.

802
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,790
Do they think
I don't know how to do that?

803
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,220
I'll leave the house as well.

804
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,250
Alright!

805
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,180
Don't go back tonight.

806
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,290
Make them panic.

807
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:14,930
Sure.

808
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,450
Come with me tonight.

809
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,219
I have plenty of spare rooms
in my house.

810
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:18,640
Let's go.

811
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:19,980
Cheers.

812
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,250
Mom, where are you?

813
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,630
I'll be back in a second.

814
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,160
Go to sleep first. Don't wait for me.

815
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,690
What do you mean by that?

816
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,160
You're going back, aren't you?

817
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,850
No one's sending Duole
to school tomorrow.

818
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:49,330
Duole has grown up, you know?

819
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,850
Can't he go to school himself?

820
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,500
There are no direct buses
to their school entrance.

821
00:39:59,250 --> 00:39:59,860
Enough already.

822
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:02,100

will never understand

823
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,909

824
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,260

Are you leaving?

826
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,580
You better stop nagging them
when you get back.

827
