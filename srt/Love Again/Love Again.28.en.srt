00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,140
=Episode 28=

3
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,610
Liu Family Ancestral Hall.

4
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,466
Blessed with fortune and wisdom.

5
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,020
This is great.

6
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,100
Shen,

7
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,650
I should thank you
on behalf of the Liu family.

8
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,020
Don't say that.

9
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,170
We're the marriage alliance
of the Liu and Shen families.

10
00:01:52,644 --> 00:01:54,170
That makes us part of the Liu Family.

11
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,360
That's the least I can do.

12
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:55,890
Dad,

13
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,580
the last time I heard you mention

14
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,450
"marriage alliance"

15
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,000
was when you told me about
Songtsen Gampo and Princess Wencheng.

16
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:03,980
Marriage alliances

17
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,380
aren't just for royalty.

18
00:02:07,177 --> 00:02:09,260
During the Republican Era,
marriage certificates

19
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,380
were written like this.

20
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,140
"Two families unite

21
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,380
in this grand hall."

22
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,650
"A fine bond is tied for eternity

23
00:02:17,755 --> 00:02:19,488
for the destined, perfect match."

24
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:19,930
Look.

25
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:20,580
Got it.

26
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,860
See, Dai.

27
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,700
Your dad is a professor.

28
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,700
He's so knowledgeable.

29
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,020
Mr. Liu, how much is the renovation
of the ancestral hall?

30
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:29,022
Twenty thousand.

31
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,730
Only twenty thousand?

32
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,540
Here's the story.

33
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,770
I have

34
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,170
five siblings

35
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,044
in my family.

36
00:02:37,044 --> 00:02:38,400
My eldest uncle's family has six,

37
00:02:38,444 --> 00:02:39,822
and my other uncle has four.

38
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,540
Each son contributes twenty thousand,

39
00:02:42,555 --> 00:02:43,770
and each daughter ten thousand.

40
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:45,980
That adds up to over
two hundred thousand.

41
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,066
Two hundred thousand.

42
00:02:47,288 --> 00:02:48,580
Twenty thousand from each family.

43
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,620
Lina's mom is frugal,

44
00:02:52,822 --> 00:02:54,549
but when it comes to
the ancestral hall,

45
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,640
she agrees to give twenty thousand
without hesitation.

46
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:57,755
She's so understanding.

47
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,290
Not really.

48
00:02:59,410 --> 00:02:59,940
Well,

49
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,090
she disagreed with this.

50
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:07,450
She said the younger generation
struggles with money,

51
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:10,155
so there's no point in spending it
on the ancestral hall.

52
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:11,890
It's fine.

53
00:03:11,955 --> 00:03:13,933
I'll go to my nephew,
he'll figure something out.

54
00:03:13,955 --> 00:03:15,450
If that doesn't work,

55
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,890
I'll ask my fishing buddies for help.

56
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:17,820
No.

57
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,260
I'll transfer the money to you.

58
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,260
No, that won't do.

59
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,022
Don't reject me.

60
00:03:23,022 --> 00:03:25,290
- You can't do this.
- The money has been transferred.

61
00:03:25,444 --> 00:03:26,030
I can't take...

62
00:03:26,044 --> 00:03:26,777
Please check it.

63
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,580
What is that?

64
00:03:28,844 --> 00:03:29,910
Take a look at your phone.

65
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,530
No, I can't take your money.

66
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,530
Mr. Liu.

67
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,970
When my mom passed away,

68
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,333
Mrs. Liu and you covered the money

69
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,333
for my mom's burial plot.

70
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,911
That's why I have your account number,

71
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:44,333
and I transferred the money to you.

72
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:44,850
Good.

73
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,090
- Good.
- No.

74
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,620
I can't accept the money.

75
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,410
I'll talk to Lina
and figure something out.

76
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,890
Why not?

77
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,700
My dad said we're all family.

78
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:56,030
Marriage alliance
of Liu and Shen families.

79
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,260
A strong bond forever.

80
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,500
You picked that up fast.

81
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,500
Who's Liu Debao

82
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,290
talking with now?

83
00:04:23,804 --> 00:04:25,370
(Account balance: 24,200 yuan)

84
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,355
Over twenty thousand?

85
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,940
Excuse me.

86
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,090
Hello, please come over.

87
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,850
I have something to ask you.

88
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,140
Hi, ma'am.

89
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:36,740
Are you...

90
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:37,666
I'm the manager.

91
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,940
My husband's workplace

92
00:04:40,311 --> 00:04:42,311
transferred twenty thousand
to his account,

93
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,770
and I want to withdraw it.

94
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,850
But I don't have his card with me.

95
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,140
You can't make a withdrawal
without the card.

96
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,530
Manager, look.

97
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,020
I have his ID.

98
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,140
I brought mine too.

99
00:04:54,244 --> 00:04:54,933
How about this?

100
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,210
If you know the card number
and password,

101
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,260
you can transfer the money
to your own account.

102
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,500
I see.

103
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,700
Oh, that's good.

104
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,770
Don't go just yet.

105
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,529
I need your help.

106
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,140
- I don't know how to do it.
- Don't worry.

107
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,890
Good.

108
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:06,940
Press this.

109
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,410
Press this.

110
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,810
Yes, and press the transfer button.

111
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,460
(Turn your head...)
Follow the instructions.

112
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:12,511
Mr. Liu, turn your head.

113
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:13,890
It's done.

114
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,890
Now, blink.

115
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,140
Good.

116
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,400
Your identity is verified.

117
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,890
Then, you're asked to enter a password.

118
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,500
Enter the bank card's password,

119
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,822
and the money will be transferred.

120
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,320
(Transfer 20,000 yuan)
Your password.

121
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,533
I won't look.

122
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:30,700
Okay.

123
00:05:30,844 --> 00:05:31,466
It's done.

124
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,060
It's done?

125
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,890
That was easy.

126
00:05:33,977 --> 00:05:35,733
Don't worry.
The money has been transferred.

127
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,380
Great.

128
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,560
The money is gone!

129
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,666
(Account balance: 4,200 yuan)
It was over 20,000 yuan just now.

130
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:40,733
How did it disappear?

131
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:41,850
Did someone hack my account?

132
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,870
Someone hacked it, right?

133
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,700
What's wrong with this ATM?

134
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,820
Call the police!

135
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,820
Don't panic.

136
00:05:47,955 --> 00:05:49,330
Let's use the machine over there.

137
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,700
I'll check the transaction history.

138
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,290
Yes, hurry.

139
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,577
It can't just be gone so suddenly.

140
00:05:53,577 --> 00:05:54,850
(Transfer from Shen Dai)
Impossible!

141
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,800
(Transfer to Liu Dong)
It's the transaction made on a phone.

142
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,770
Twenty thousand has
been transferred to Liu Dong.

143
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,500
Do you know this name?

144
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:09,820
Uncle,

145
00:06:10,133 --> 00:06:10,890
just let you know.

146
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,260
I received the money.

147
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,580
The calligraphy you sent me.

148
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,700
Who wrote it?

149
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,260
It's nice.

150
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,770
Of course, it is.

151
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,180
Well...

152
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:26,620
What's wrong, Uncle?

153
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,410
Nothing.

154
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,290
I'm hanging up.

155
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,970
What's wrong with you?

156
00:06:32,311 --> 00:06:33,888
Why are you sitting alone in the dark?

157
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:34,711
You scared me.

158
00:06:35,577 --> 00:06:37,666
Why are you so jumpy
if you do nothing wrong?

159
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,620
I... I got a calligraphy from Shen.

160
00:06:41,844 --> 00:06:42,600
Take a look.

161
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,410
Look.

162
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,311
What do you think?

163
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,800
(Liu Family Ancestral Hall.
Blessed with Fortune and Wisdom)

164
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,060
Liu Family Ancestral Hall.

165
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:56,940
Blessed with fortune and wisdom.

166
00:06:57,466 --> 00:06:57,890
Very good.

167
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,060
Excellent.

168
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:01,290
I was thinking,

169
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:02,930
if we don't contribute money,

170
00:07:03,244 --> 00:07:05,066
we can at least do something, right?

171
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,500
Shen's calligraphy

172
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:07,570
is truly exceptional.

173
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,170
I've been thinking about it.

174
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:14,044
I still think we should
chip in some money.

175
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,380
It's for the plaque
for the ancestral hall.

176
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,570
You should contribute
both money and effort.

177
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,050
Well...

178
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,140
What about the twenty thousand?

179
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:33,690
Uh...

180
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,630
Where did it come from?

181
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,500
Where did it go?

182
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,580
I borrowed it from Shen Dai.

183
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,044
I... I transferred it to Liu Dong.

184
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,650
My goodness.

185
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:42,650
Oh my goodness.

186
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,500
How could you use Shen Dai's money?

187
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,170
You've embarrassed Lina

188
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,100
in front of the Shen family, you know?

189
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,410
The Liu family is begging for money

190
00:07:54,511 --> 00:07:56,740
to renovate the ancestral hall
and put up a plague.

191
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:57,850
You think they deserve that?

192
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,930
Unbelievable. Jeez.

203
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,860
I thought you were busy working.

204
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:53,740
What are you listening to?

205
00:08:53,777 --> 00:08:55,320
You look totally lost in it. Let me see.

206
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,570
I'm just listening to music.
Why do you want to check my phone?

207
00:08:58,570 --> 00:08:59,500
We agreed on this.

208
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,600
You can change the password,

209
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,866
and I can check your phone.

210
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,100
Check it if you like.

211
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,311
I'm just testing you.
I don't actually care.

212
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,200
Have some fruit.

213
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:10,140
It gives you vitamins.

214
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:12,650
Start with the apple.

215
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,200
It'll turn brown soon.

216
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,530
I put toothpicks there for you.
Why are you using your hand?

217
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:19,810
Fine.

218
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:20,930
Eat them all.

219
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:22,444
Finish everything.

220
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:31,890
Liu Lina!

221
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:33,890
Mom, you scared me.

222
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,190
Why are you here at this hour?

223
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,460
I'm furious! Your dad is insane!

224
00:09:37,866 --> 00:09:39,155
Nothing can stop him now.

225
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,020
What happened?

226
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,530
Your dad's salary account

227
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,340
suddenly had twenty thousand in.

228
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,340
I thought

229
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,930
it was some housing allowance.

230
00:09:47,244 --> 00:09:49,333
But then the money was gone
in the blind of an eye.

231
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,500
He transferred it to Liu Dong.

232
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:53,220
Straight to the Liu family.

233
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,890
Mom, you scared me.

234
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,311
I thought it was something serious.

235
00:09:58,311 --> 00:09:59,500
It's just twenty thousand.

236
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,380
That's his little wish.

237
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,570
Just let him be.

238
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,460
You and your dad

239
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,500
always cast me out
when something important happens.

240
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,570
Fine, I'm so done with you two.

241
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,000
You're taking your dad's side, right?

242
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,155
Fine, I won't say anything.

243
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:14,460
Not a word. I'm leaving.

244
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:15,422
- Mom.
- I'm leaving.

245
00:10:15,422 --> 00:10:16,111
Drink some water.

246
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:17,149
No. I'm leaving right now.

247
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,311
You can't leave just like that.

248
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,350
Of course, I'm not calm.

249
00:10:19,355 --> 00:10:20,000
Well.

250
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:22,100
It's no big deal.
Don't get so worked up.

251
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,140
Take a sip.

252
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,100
You're a family.

253
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,311
I have nothing to do with you.

254
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,340
I'm an outsider.

255
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,570
I'm your daughter.

256
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,177
How can I have nothing to do with you?

257
00:10:35,555 --> 00:10:36,844
Return the money to Shen Dai.

258
00:10:36,866 --> 00:10:38,422
Don't let them look down on us.

259
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,100
All right, I'll return it.

260
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,770
Keep the money.

261
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,050
What are you doing?

262
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,500
I can transfer it to her.

263
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:44,620
You...

264
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:45,810
Look.

265
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:46,659
It's done.

266
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,220
(Transfer successful.
Recipient: Shen Dai)

267
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,810
Dai, I've transferred
the twenty thousand

268
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,770
my dad borrowed from you.

269
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:52,622
Please accept it.

270
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,488
Thank you.

271
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,810
Problem solved.

272
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,410
Fine. I'll keep the money.

273
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:57,740
Happy now?

274
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,020
Let me warn you.

275
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,340
Shen Qing's company is
looking for funding, right?

276
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,340
He's surely keeping an eye
on the family's account.

277
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,500
You need to be careful.

278
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,380
Your dad is an honest man,

279
00:11:11,466 --> 00:11:12,740
yet he did that behind my back.

280
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,740
You can't give men too much freedom.

281
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,740
If you do, they'll bankrupt the family.

282
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,460
Understand?

283
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:21,340
By the way,

284
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,650
why don't you

285
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,020
transfer that eight hundred thousand
to me?

286
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,133
I'll hold onto it for you.

287
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:26,650
Right?

288
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:29,080
That way, Shen Qin
won't secretly transfer the money around

289
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,620
like your dad did.

290
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,100
I invested the money

291
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,020
in Shen Qing's company.

292
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:39,770
Oh...

293
00:11:48,022 --> 00:11:49,911
You transferred eight hundred thousand

294
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,810
to Shen Qing?

295
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,220
His company is working on new research
and needed funding.

296
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:59,770
Once the new drug is released,
the return will be great.

297
00:12:00,111 --> 00:12:01,460
It's basically an initial share.

298
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,140
I'm not listening to this.

299
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,740
Don't talk about this to me.

300
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,100
Seriously?

301
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,100
The guy selling goat milk powder

302
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,980
is recruiting people,
claiming it's an initial share.

303
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,410
Liu Lina,

304
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:15,810
I've always told you

305
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,220
to keep a tight grip on this money.

306
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,810
It's not about that.

307
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,690
Everyone is investing.

308
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,688
He's the COO.
How could he do nothing about it?

309
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,530
Stupid company!

310
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,020
Stupid company.

311
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,340
Well, stay out of it.

312
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,511
Look what you've done.

313
00:12:33,555 --> 00:12:34,866
Investing both effort and money

314
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,220
into the company.

315
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,690
There are scientists
working to combat cancer.

316
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,860
If they succeed,

317
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:44,050
they'll win a Nobel Prize.

318
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,220
Shen Qing is just an account.

319
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,140
Why must he invest the money?

320
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:48,690
Right?

321
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,690
It's eight hundred thousand
we're talking about.

322
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,140
If cancer can be cured,

323
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:56,460
no one will need burial plots anymore.

324
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:00,740
Ugh!

325
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,340
This is driving me crazy.

326
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,690
Everyone, I have an announcement.

327
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,690
Our choir will be performing
at East Suburb Nursing Home

328
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:14,500
next week.

329
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,100
Also,

330
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,620
since we have a few new members,

331
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,410
we need to practice more.

332
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,830
(Heibao)
I'd like to add

333
00:13:20,831 --> 00:13:22,300
(Heibao)
an extra session each week.

334
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,570
Are there any problems with that?

335
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:24,500
No problem.

336
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,770
Please try again later.

337
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,140
Everyone, that's all for today.

338
00:13:38,244 --> 00:13:38,930
See you tomorrow.

339
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,500
See you tomorrow.

340
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:41,170
Bye.

341
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,620
Bye.

342
00:13:48,111 --> 00:13:49,340
Shuishan, you sang very well.

343
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,530
Oh, it was nothing.

344
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,220
Bye, Dean Ding.

345
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:54,500
Shuishan.

346
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,690
So, how are you getting home?

347
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,340
Don't worry about me. Just go.

348
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:04,530
Shuishan.

349
00:14:10,288 --> 00:14:12,511
Do you want me to leave,
or do you want a ride home?

350
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,380
Why didn't you answer my calls?

351
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,620
I'll try to talk to Xibei.

352
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,620
Give me some time.

353
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,220
No need.

354
00:14:27,088 --> 00:14:28,355
I've had enough of it.

355
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,260
Why can't you try to understand?

356
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,650
Xibei is my only daughter.

357
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,490
It's not that I didn't want to spend
the Mid-Autumn Festival with you.

358
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:39,690
And about the house...

359
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,290
I'm fine to sell it.

360
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,770
Can we not talk about the house here?

361
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,140
Just go.

362
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,100
I need to make this clear.

363
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,530
If not,

364
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,570
you'll block me again,

365
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:53,770
and I won't have a chance to explain.

366
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,620
I'm telling you to stop explaining.

367
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,170
It's over

368
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:58,770
between us.

369
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:01,530
Calm down.

370
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,460
She said it was over.

371
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,650
Understand?

372
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,930
Who do you think you are?

373
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,050
Don't think I don't know
you're a backup?

374
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,290
What are you talking about?

375
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,311
She told you to leave,
didn't you hear her?

376
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,290
Didn't you hear her?

377
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,020
Why?

378
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,860
Ganging up on me, huh?

379
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,500
Bring it.

380
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,500
All three of you, come at me.

381
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:28,620
Heibao.

382
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,140
Listen,

383
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,340
if you keep acting like this,

384
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:32,570
I...

385
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:33,930
I'll be mad

386
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,530
and block you.

387
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:36,810
Go.

388
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,850
"Backup" will send you home.

389
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,810
Designers are too expensive.

390
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:03,810
I need to rely on myself

391
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,700
to make money.

392
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,177
I think it's great,

393
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:08,050
Lina.

394
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,290
Besides,

395
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,420
you may become a designer yourself.

396
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:12,660
Right.

397
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:16,180
There are so many paths in life.

398
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,460
All paths lead to Rome.

399
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,610
Exactly.

400
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,090
Hello, Mr. Ye.

401
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,850
What? Duole wants to be a director?

402
00:16:31,688 --> 00:16:33,290
He's a kid. Don't take that seriously.

403
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,770
He changes his mind every day.

404
00:16:35,022 --> 00:16:37,444
How's he supposed to find a job
if he studies filmmaking?

405
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,260
Yes, right.

406
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,980
We'll talk him out of it later.

407
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:41,900
All right.

408
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,330
Thank you.

409
00:16:43,355 --> 00:16:44,600
Thank you for letting me know.

410
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,044
The life of a middle-aged woman
is always dealing with the mess.

411
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,850
Lina, I have two concert tickets.

412
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,810
You can go with Mr. Shen.

413
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,810
Thanks, Bai.

414
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,700
(Sub Vouchers)
You're welcome, Lina.

415
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:05,530
This is great.

416
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,422
Sorry to keep you waiting.

417
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:22,050
Not at all.

418
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,180
I asked you here

419
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,610
to share some good news.

420
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,644
The third clinical trial of M701

421
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:28,900
hasn't been conducted yet,

422
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,290
but Mr. Lu brought his team

423
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,260
for a full evaluation.

424
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,090
He's confident in RF Pharmaceuticals.

425
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,570
The B+ round of funding

426
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,260
should come in on time.

427
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:40,290
Really?

428
00:17:42,155 --> 00:17:42,850
That's amazing.

429
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,700
This is indeed good news.

430
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,220
Ice, thank you.

431
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,090
I know

432
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,660
you must've put in a lot of effort.

433
00:17:52,844 --> 00:17:53,377
Not at all.

434
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,610
We all have the same goal.

435
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:58,940
By the way,

436
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,688
we're doing some research
at the hospital next time.

437
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:02,740
Would you like to join?

438
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:04,980
I'd love to,

439
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,740
but I'm taking a sabbatical
starting next week.

440
00:18:07,777 --> 00:18:09,177
I'm going back to my hometown.

441
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:10,850
Hometown?

442
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,330
In that case, enjoy your time off.

443
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,022
My dad was diagnosed with lung cancer.

444
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:22,660
Terminal.

445
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:37,770
I always thought

446
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,810
I could handle any changes
life threw at me.

447
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:45,530
But the truth is

448
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,940
I wasn't prepared at all.

449
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,050
Please.

450
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,090
Get M701

451
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,090
developed.

452
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,660
Please come in.

453
00:19:10,911 --> 00:19:11,370
All right.

454
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,570
This is my home.

455
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,020
Oppo.

456
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:18,980
Little dog.

457
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:20,180
Oppo.

458
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,220
I don't have kids,

459
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,370
so I treat him like my son.

460
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,530
I see.

461
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,610
So beautiful.

462
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,050
Mr. Shen, would you
like some water or tea?

463
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,260
Water is fine.

464
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:31,850
Sure.

465
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,500
Your home is beautifully decorated.

466
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:39,630
I can tell the owner
has a passion for her life.

467
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:45,980
So many photos.

468
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,260
These were taken when I was younger.

469
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:53,050
I wasn't even twenty yet in this one.

470
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,530
Just started working.

471
00:19:54,955 --> 00:19:55,888
Here's your water.

472
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:56,740
Thanks.

473
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:58,570
This is

474
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,420
me and my husband.

475
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,090
We were in the Northwest.

476
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,260
Look,

477
00:20:04,933 --> 00:20:06,688
I was five months pregnant at that time.

478
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,090
Dai said

479
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,290
you lost the baby.

480
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,850
Just after this photo was developed,

481
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,220
my husband was sent to the Gobi Desert
for an expedition

482
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:27,290
by a cruel team leader.

483
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,420
He was caught in extreme weather

484
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,266
and lost his life there.

485
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:37,740
This might be

486
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,420
the last photo of him.

487
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,090
I was

488
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,530
devastated.

489
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,740
I wanted to demand justice

490
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:48,850
and an explanation.

491
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:51,711
But I lost the baby.

492
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,500
That's heartbreaking.

493
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,770
The worst part is

494
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,850
it wasn't a natural disaster.

495
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,130
It was caused by people.

496
00:21:06,955 --> 00:21:08,244
Let me show you his face.

497
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:08,610
Here.

498
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,570
This is a group photo from back then.

499
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,980
His name is Tang Jialin.

500
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:22,980
We called him

501
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,850
"Smiling Tiger" behind his back.

502
00:21:25,488 --> 00:21:26,260
He's the leader?

503
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,940
He's wicked.

504
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:30,050
Also,

505
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,050
he's lewd.

506
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,090
Yali is truly lucky.

507
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,530
He married such a good wife.

508
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,020
You're pretty and virtuous.

509
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,130
When will Yali be back?

510
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,570
Probably not anytime soon.

511
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,660
He's on patrol.

512
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,080
He's working overtime again?

513
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,700
The factory arranged this.

514
00:21:55,777 --> 00:21:56,850
There's nothing I can do.

515
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,260
In that case, I won't wait for him.

516
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,530
I'll head back.

517
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,610
Yali is working late.

518
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,130
Aren't you scared of being home alone?

519
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:10,850
How about

520
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,130
I keep you company?

521
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,500
What are you trying to do?

522
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,460
Let go.

523
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,020
Help!

524
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,700
Help!

525
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,370
Yali!

526
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,570
Yali, stop it.

527
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,530
Yali, you might kill him.

528
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,220
Yali.

529
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:31,500
Go away!

530
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,850
Touch her again,

531
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,050
and I'll kill you!

532
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:34,900
Zhang Yali,

533
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,370
just you wait.

534
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,180
I'll be waiting.

535
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,180
Yali, let's leave.

536
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:49,020
After that, he used his power
to get back on my husband

537
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,740
by transferring him
to the Gobi Desert.

538
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,570
My husband

539
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,740
had heart disease

540
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,570
and severe nearsightedness.

541
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,020
He wasn't eligible

542
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,700
for that kind of transfer.

543
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,940
But he still signed the order.

544
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,850
How can someone be so vicious?

545
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:09,260
Yeah.

546
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,260
Where is he now?

547
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,020
No idea.

548
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,020
It's been so many years.

549
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:22,066
I don't dwell on it anymore.

550
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,770
We must find him.

551
00:23:24,844 --> 00:23:26,700
No one can get away
with their punishment.

552
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,610
He'll get what he deserves one day.

553
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,370
Mr. Shen, look at this.

554
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,500
This is the group photo

555
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,940
of an event between
the Qipao team and the canoe team.

556
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,020
Li Heibao is in it.

557
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,330
He's the captain.

558
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:46,020
They want to win
in the senior sports games.

559
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:48,570
Li Heibao and you

560
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:50,050
seem like a good match.

561
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:51,980
What a shame.

562
00:23:52,244 --> 00:23:53,511
We're just not meant to be.

563
00:23:58,288 --> 00:23:59,600
It's lung adenocarcinoma.

564
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,290
I'll send his test results

565
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:01,850
to you later.

566
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,020
Help me check

567
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:03,810
if there are any

568
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,460
new clinical trials

569
00:24:05,488 --> 00:24:06,511
that might help.

570
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,570
All right. Thank you.

571
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:09,610
Thank you.

572
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,577
Are you helping someone
find medicine again?

573
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,290
A friend's dad.

574
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,740
You come home late every day

575
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,800
and always worry about
other people's problems.

576
00:24:19,644 --> 00:24:20,700
Have a look at my design.

577
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,570
I designed this school uniform.

578
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:25,940
That's amazing.

579
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:30,290
But why does it look so much
like Duole's uniform?

580
00:24:31,088 --> 00:24:32,370
Will there be copyright issues?

581
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:34,050
The client's budget is limited.

582
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,260
They can't expect me to hire
a Chanel designer.

583
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,900
Still, you can't copy.

584
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,050
What if they sue you?

585
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,500
You'll be in big trouble.

586
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,770
All right. Mr. Shen
is so hard to please.

587
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:45,850
I can't even buy a compliment
with eight hundred thousand.

588
00:24:45,977 --> 00:24:47,111
I won't ask you then.

589
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,090
Mr. Shen,

590
00:24:51,377 --> 00:24:52,866
I'll invite you to a concert.

591
00:24:53,311 --> 00:24:54,644
Where did you get the tickets?

592
00:24:54,644 --> 00:24:55,755
Bai gave them to me.

593
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,370
I checked online.
They cost 888 yuan each.

594
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:01,090
Stay away from that financial adviser.

595
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,420
He must be after something.

596
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,020
What can it be?

597
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:08,370
He introduced me to the school business,

598
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,466
and I treated him to a meal.

599
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,911
He only ordered a few simple dishes.

600
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,330
He's honest.

601
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,050
Anyway, I have no comment for him.

602
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:16,850
Will you go with me?

603
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,290
You promised to go to a concert with me.

604
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,810
When is it?

605
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:22,610
28th.

606
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,460
28th...

607
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:29,660
I can't.

608
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,460
An Ruifeng and I have a meeting
with Mr. Qiao from Shide

609
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,377
for an important investment discussion.

610
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,500
Fine.

611
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,940
Everything is more important than me.

612
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,020
Whatever.

613
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,850
(Ice: Solace)

614
00:25:57,235 --> 00:26:01,880
(Ice)

615
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:11,897
(To Ice: I'm checking
if any clinical trials might help.)

616
00:26:15,072 --> 00:26:19,470
(To Ice: I'm checking
if any clinical trials might help.)

617
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,940
(Your dad is an honest man,)

618
00:26:48,955 --> 00:26:50,290
(yet he did that behind my back.)

619
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,460
(You can't give men too much freedom.)

620
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,050
(If you do, he'll bankrupt the family.)

621
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:55,700
(Understand?)

622
00:27:24,204 --> 00:27:27,030
(Enter password)

623
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:27,570
(Incorrect.)

624
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,620
(You have two attempts remaining.)

625
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,466
(One attempt remaining)

626
00:27:44,155 --> 00:27:45,577
Don't you ever get tired of this?

627
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,260
I went to Le's place yesterday.

628
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,090
I saw a photo of her and Li Heibao.

629
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,090
Did you know?

630
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,460
They've been together for three years.

631
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,370
They have feelings for each other.

632
00:28:14,155 --> 00:28:16,180
It's just that his daughter
is against it now.

633
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,530
But they can still try to
work things out, right?

634
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,570
How can elderly people afford
to wait for three years?

635
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,940
They hesitate when their kids object.

636
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,770
Their love isn't strong

637
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:28,530
and deep enough.

638
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:29,130
Got it?

639
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,900
Le looks so much like Jingmin.

640
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,850
That's fate, isn't it?

641
00:28:33,955 --> 00:28:36,133
Letting fate take its course
is always a good thing.

642
00:28:36,511 --> 00:28:38,400
You're too old
to let fate take its course.

643
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,020
Those young people

644
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,911
are so active that they go to "If You
Are the One" to look for partners.

645
00:28:42,933 --> 00:28:45,460
You're at seventy
and you still wait for fate?

646
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,370
The Buddha would look down on you.

647
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,460
Look down on you.

648
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,050
He's laughing.

649
00:28:51,177 --> 00:28:52,600
Do you understand this, Ding?

650
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,180
You've got a winning hand,

651
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,700
you must play it well

652
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,660
and knock that tough guy
out of the game.

653
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,640
All right, that's enough.

654
00:29:00,644 --> 00:29:01,355
Calm down.

655
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:04,090
Give me some time

656
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:05,940
to think about it.

657
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,420
Shujing,

658
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:18,420
what's going on here?

659
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:18,940
Slowly.

660
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:19,570
Careful.

661
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,460
The house is flooded.

662
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:22,420
It's flooded.

663
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,000
What happened?

664
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,220
Ding turned on

665
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,770
the bathroom faucet.

666
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,480
When I got back from the grocery store,

667
00:29:29,488 --> 00:29:30,644
the whole place was flooded.

668
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,180
The floor is soaked.

669
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,570
So I quickly called Shujing over.

670
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,330
Ding is giving you a hard time.

671
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:38,660
Ding,

672
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,500
was it you?

673
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:42,810
It was you, right?

674
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,090
He won't admit it,

675
00:29:48,133 --> 00:29:49,488
yet he tries to blame someone else.

676
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:49,980
Exactly.

677
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:53,900
Don't get electrocuted!

678
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:55,900
Dad!

679
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,130
Don't touch me.

680
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,290
Don't touch me.

681
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,050
Ding,

682
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,130
what are you doing?

683
00:30:02,155 --> 00:30:03,266
What are you doing?

684
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,610
What are you doing?

685
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,090
Dad, what's gotten into you?

686
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,130
That's Mom. Your wife.

687
00:30:17,488 --> 00:30:18,644
Are you all right, Mom?

688
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:29,290
It's okay.

689
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:30,980
It's okay.

690
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:32,980
Let's go back.

691
00:30:33,466 --> 00:30:34,244
Let's go inside.

692
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,330
Careful.

693
00:30:39,533 --> 00:30:40,400
Don't be afraid.

694
00:30:40,466 --> 00:30:40,955
It's okay.

695
00:30:41,022 --> 00:30:41,866
Ding, we're all here.

696
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:42,420
Come.

697
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:43,330
Careful.

698
00:30:44,066 --> 00:30:44,530
All right.

699
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:46,260
Don't be afraid.

700
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:48,740
It's okay.

701
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,610
Sit down slowly.

702
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,370
Calm down.

703
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,050
Calm down.

704
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:56,810
Dad,

705
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,260
how could you slap Mom?

706
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,980
It's okay. I'm used to it.

707
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:08,940
See that?

708
00:31:09,155 --> 00:31:10,740
Three years is too long to prove love.

709
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,530
Elderly relationships

710
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,290
are on a countdown.

711
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:42,810
Very well.

712
00:31:42,822 --> 00:31:43,330
Here we are.

713
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,866
We took a little tour here.

714
00:31:44,866 --> 00:31:45,400
Remember this.

715
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,260
This is 307.

716
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:48,050
You're back, Dad.

717
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,370
We're back.

718
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:50,660
- We took a walk.
- Thank you.

719
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:51,444
Don't mention it.

720
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,570
Come, Ding.

721
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,260
We're back.

722
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,577
We took a little walk just now.

723
00:31:59,422 --> 00:32:00,330
Come and sit here.

724
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:00,570
Sit.

725
00:32:00,644 --> 00:32:02,022
Dean Ding, please have a seat.

726
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:02,940
All right.

727
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,330
You'll be staying here

728
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,900
from now on.

729
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:11,770
This is a nursing home.

730
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,290
Gou and I came here before

731
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,130
to check it out.

732
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:16,900
Yeah.

733
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,980
It wasn't for you. It was for Ms. Nie.

734
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:19,700
Right.

735
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:20,900
This place is pretty good.

736
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,900
This place is nice.

737
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:24,330
They have a water purifier.

738
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:24,740
Right?

739
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,180
It has great reviews online.

740
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,980
The nurses are very professional.

741
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:29,660
Look.

742
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:30,810
You hear that?

743
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,977
- Water purifier, professional nurses...
- Come.

744
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,660
Shen.

745
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,530
Hello, I'm the nurse in charge,
Ding Wei.

746
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,770
You can call me Ding.

747
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,020
Hello, Ms. Ding.

748
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,050
What a coincidence.

749
00:32:40,155 --> 00:32:40,980
You're also a Ding?

750
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,380
He's Ding too.

751
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:43,940
Please look out for him.

752
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,210
Of course.

753
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,820
My dad has Alzheimer's.

754
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,650
Don't worry.

755
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:49,860
Your dad's condition

756
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,090
is considered mild here.

757
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:52,940
We provide rehab training here.

758
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,090
With proper care,

759
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:55,610
the progression can slow down a lot.

760
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,570
That's great.

761
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:57,610
Great.

762
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,210
Mr. Ding

763
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:02,500
is an important member
of our senior choir.

764
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:05,300
We'd like to bring him out
for practice sometimes.

765
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,130
Would that be okay?

766
00:33:06,133 --> 00:33:07,622
- Right.
- Just notify us in advance.

767
00:33:08,577 --> 00:33:09,555
That's very considerate.

768
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,020
Considerate.

769
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:11,860
All right.

770
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,570
You can stay here with Mr. Ding.

771
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,266
Press the bell if you need anything.

772
00:33:15,355 --> 00:33:16,000
Press that one.

773
00:33:16,377 --> 00:33:17,130
Okay. Thank you.

774
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:18,820
Ms. Ding, thank you.

775
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,300
Please take care of my dad.

776
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:21,755
Of course.

777
00:33:21,777 --> 00:33:22,619
You should rest too.

778
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,022
All right.

779
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,170
Take a rest.

780
00:33:24,777 --> 00:33:26,020
I'm tired from all the walking.

781
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:36,570
Ding,

782
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,940
I brought your favorite neck pillow.

783
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,980
You can sleep just as comfortably
as at home.

784
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:45,860
Okay.

785
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:47,940
That's nice.

786
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,090
So comfortable.

787
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:50,460
Dad,

788
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:51,690
I think

789
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:53,090
Mr. Ding likes this place.

790
00:33:53,688 --> 00:33:55,111
- Dad.
- The credit goes to you.

791
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:55,530
Dad.

792
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,460
This is your favorite tea cup.

793
00:33:57,777 --> 00:33:59,022
I'll put it on the nightstand.

794
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,090
Okay.

795
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,380
Thank you, young woman.

796
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,020
You're welcome, Dean Ding.

797
00:34:05,266 --> 00:34:05,860
Very good.

798
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,090
Dean Ding,

799
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:08,690
Gou and I

800
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:11,650
will also live here in the future.

801
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,733
We'll keep you company.

802
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:13,690
We'll live here.

803
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,210
You're coming?

804
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:17,955
Yes, both of us.

805
00:34:18,066 --> 00:34:20,610
The whole floor will be us.

806
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,090
We'll make you the floor leader.

807
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:24,610
Floor Leader Ding.

808
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,300
This is a big responsibility.

809
00:34:28,644 --> 00:34:30,090
He loves the idea of being a leader.

810
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:30,730
Good.

811
00:34:32,844 --> 00:34:33,690
A big responsibility.

812
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:36,730
Shujing.

813
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,170
Honestly, I really admire you.

814
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,300
You've been through so much,

815
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:42,690
yet you're still so calm.

816
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:44,730
If it were me, and my dad forgot me,

817
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,570
I'd have lost my mind.

818
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,690
Anything is possible

819
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,460
in life.

820
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,380
Sometimes, he might forget you,

821
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,210
or you might even forget him.

822
00:34:57,244 --> 00:34:58,822
So you have to cherish the present.

823
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,460
I've decided

824
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,500
I'm not leaving this time.

825
00:35:06,022 --> 00:35:07,622
I want to spend more time with my dad.

826
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,500
Or maybe

827
00:35:11,133 --> 00:35:12,650
I want him to spend more time with me.

828
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,380
I'd love to stay with my dad.

829
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,050
But now he's been

830
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,250
getting more unpredictable.

831
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:26,730
My mom and I

832
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,570
can't take care of him at home.

833
00:35:29,577 --> 00:35:31,311
Luckily, this place is close to home.

834
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,500
We can visit every day.

835
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,020
He's like

836
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,730
a kid now.

837
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,170
An old kid.

838
00:35:39,355 --> 00:35:40,300
He behaves like a kid.

839
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:41,780
And this.

840
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,130
Floor Leader Ding.

841
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:47,650
Mr. Ding.

842
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:49,170
He loves the idea of being a leader.

843
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,730
I'll measure your blood pressure.

844
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,900
It's nap time.

845
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,020
Family members can leave now.

846
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,730
Okay.

847
00:35:57,422 --> 00:35:58,020
All right.

848
00:35:58,730 --> 00:35:59,170
Ding,

849
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,170
keep practicing the song.

850
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:08,500
♪The garden is quiet at night♪

851
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,610
♪In a little garden,
I dig and dig and dig♪

852
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,980
♪Whatever seed you plant,
that's the flower you'll get♪

853
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:20,570
Ding,

854
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,210
we're leaving.

855
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,050
Be good.

856
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,210
Don't argue with others.

857
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,340
Okay.

858
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:26,780
Okay.

859
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:27,780
Yajun.

860
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:28,570
Yajun.

861
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:31,570
Yajun.

862
00:36:31,666 --> 00:36:32,420
- Let's go.
- Dad.

863
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,570
Be good.

864
00:36:33,822 --> 00:36:35,222
Make sure you take your medicine.

865
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:37,610
Don't worry.

866
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:38,570
Don't worry.

867
00:36:39,177 --> 00:36:40,644
Don't let him grab things randomly.

868
00:36:40,666 --> 00:36:41,377
Let's go.

869
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,170
We're leaving.

870
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,380
Wave goodbye. Bye.

871
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,250
Bye.

872
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:52,820
Don't worry.

873
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,980
When will you pick me up?

874
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,730
I don't want him to stay here.

875
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:23,610
I want him to come home.

876
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:32,500
Yajun,

877
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,050
it's all right.

878
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:35,860
This place is good.

879
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:37,820
Ding will get used to it.

880
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:38,650
Let's go.

881
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:39,570
Let's go home.

882
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:41,980
He'll adjust in time.

883
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:42,610
Right.

884
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,340
Everything is fine here.

885
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:44,911
Let's go.

886
00:37:44,911 --> 00:37:46,570
He'll be worried
if he sees you like that.

887
00:37:46,577 --> 00:37:47,210
Right.

888
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,570
Let's go.

889
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:49,980
He'll get used to it.

890
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,570
Let's go.

891
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,460
Shujing.

892
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:01,130
Shujing.

893
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:12,020
I'm good.

894
00:38:13,444 --> 00:38:15,170
I just suddenly remember
when I was little,

895
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,210
my dad sent me to kindergarten.

896
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,900
When I grew up,
I sent him to the nursing home.

897
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,050
Back then, he used to say
to me every day,

898
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,170
"Shujing,

899
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,860
I'll be the first to pick you up."

900
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,300
But now

901
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,940
I can't bring him back home.

902
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:37,610
I...

903
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,460
There, there. Shujing, don't be sad.

904
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,020
They provide professional care here.

905
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:43,570
It's good.

906
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,090
And we're close by.

907
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,530
We can visit all the time, all right?

908
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,340
Don't cry.

909
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,130
You make me want to cry too.

910
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,066
All right, don't cry.

911
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:53,570
Let's go.

912
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:54,570
Let's go.

913
00:38:59,050 --> 00:38:59,460
Come on.

914
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:07,130
Qing,

915
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:10,690
we sent Mr. Ding
to the nursing home earlier today.

916
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,940
I think Alzheimer's

917
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,650
is just too tragic.

918
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:17,730
Do you think

919
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,250
Dad might get it

920
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,690
and forget us one day?

921
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:23,780
What are you talking about?

922
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,340
Dad is perfectly fine.

923
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,288
Are you cursing him?

924
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,340
You have a wife and a son.

925
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,600
You have nothing to worry about.

926
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,666
Someone will take care of you
even if you're sick.

927
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:34,500
I'm single.

928
00:39:34,777 --> 00:39:37,000
I'll definitely end up
in a nursing home in the future.

929
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,210
The nursing home is pretty decent.

930
00:39:39,266 --> 00:39:40,380
Make sure you take me there

931
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,288
and bring all my stuff
when the time comes.

932
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,530
What are you thinking about?

933
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,420
That's too far ahead.

934
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:50,900
In the future,

935
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:53,570
we can't burden Duole either.

936
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,020
We'll have to go to a nursing home.

937
00:39:55,111 --> 00:39:56,900
Maybe you'll have
to send me there first.

938
00:39:59,500 --> 00:39:59,980
Come, Qing.

939
00:40:00,466 --> 00:40:01,822
Let's toast to the nursing home.

940
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,066
Let's go there together, right?

941
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:03,600
Yeah.

942
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,020
Let's try to get into the same one.

943
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:11,020
Ding moved into the nursing home today.

944
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:14,500
If you keep borrowing money
or spending money,

945
00:40:14,644 --> 00:40:16,111
I want to stay in a nursing home too.

946
00:40:16,933 --> 00:40:18,533
It's seven or eight thousand a month.

947
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,022
Are you willing to pay for that?

948
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,820
The Liu family is not reliable at all.

949
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,340
I'm giving you a heads-up.

950
00:40:31,511 --> 00:40:32,844
I'm not going with you

951
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:34,020
to the ceremony

952
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,570
of the ancestral hall.

953
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:38,460
You...

954
00:40:38,977 --> 00:40:39,844
If you don't go,

955
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,820
you'll miss red packets.

956
00:40:43,088 --> 00:40:44,420
You spent twenty thousand on it.

957
00:40:44,422 --> 00:40:45,955
It'd be a loss if you don't go.
