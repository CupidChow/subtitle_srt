00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,040
=Love Again=

2
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,140
=Episode 24=

3
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,570
You mean to say

4
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,240
my husband's company
is worth investing in?

5
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,890
I think it's okay.

6
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,330
Biopharma is a hot investment sector.

7
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,480
And they are already in Phase Ⅲ trials.

8
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,570
They are basically one step away

9
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,920
from succeeding.

10
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,080
I'm still a bit torn.

11
00:01:57,422 --> 00:01:58,330
I'll think it over.

12
00:01:59,410 --> 00:01:59,850
Of course.

13
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,060
High risk always comes
with high returns.

14
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:04,800
It never hurts to think more about it.

15
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,680
Exactly.

16
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,050
But

17
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,050
I've made up my mind
about the business loan.

18
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,570
Once I started the business,

19
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,330
I realized cash flow was an issue.

20
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,640
It's still small now, so I can manage.

21
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,730
But if I get the chance to grow it big,

22
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,200
I can't afford to bet everything I have.

23
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:20,610
Right.

24
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,730
We have to make good use of

25
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,360
financial tools.

26
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,330
Exactly.

27
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,730
Getting a loan
doesn't mean we're broke.

28
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,890
It just keeps the money flowing.

29
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:31,330
Yes.

30
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,240
With my qualifications,
how much can I borrow?

31
00:02:36,177 --> 00:02:37,410
Five hundred grand, easy.

32
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:39,800
Alright.

33
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,480
I'll apply for that.

34
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:42,610
Good.

35
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,360
Bai,

36
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:50,290
you used to swim competitively?

37
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,210
You even won championships?

38
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,770
Only when I was little.

39
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,170
I even got bonus points
on my high school entrance exam for it.

40
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,680
Do you still swim now?

41
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,530
Now?

42
00:03:02,777 --> 00:03:03,650
Work keeps me busy.

43
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,920
I only swim when I get the time.

44
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,360
Ms. Liu, people always say

45
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,920
athletes are bad with numbers.

46
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,290
I don't think so.

47
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,920
I'm pretty quick with math.

48
00:03:13,755 --> 00:03:14,920
Let me get the paperwork.

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,480
Being young is such a blessing.

50
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,680
You have nothing to worry.

51
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:27,530
Ms. Liu.

52
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,970
Today is September first.

53
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,560
The start of the semester.

54
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,730
Yeah.

55
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,120
That calls for a celebration.

56
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,480
We athletes love this day the most.

57
00:03:37,688 --> 00:03:38,770
No more hellish training.

58
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,730
I couldn't wait till school starts.

59
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,540
The little monsters are
back in their cages.

60
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:43,730
There's a new brunch spot

61
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,650
near us.

62
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,120
You just landed a big order.

63
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,120
Come on. Let's celebrate it!

64
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,170
Let's go.

65
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,560
Bai, thanks for bringing me here.

66
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,530
You're welcome.

67
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:01,210
Oh right.

68
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,170
The latest order I took was a rush job.

69
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,800
Is that so?

70
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:06,800
It's for a client's appreciation event.

71
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,360
A total of 120 outfits.

72
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,970
All kinds of shapes and sizes.

73
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,170
So I made a spreadsheet,

74
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,920
and then checked
every single one by hand.

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,480
That sounds like a lot of work.

76
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,850
That's what I get paid for.

77
00:04:23,466 --> 00:04:24,320
And that's not all.

78
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,120
The client asked me

79
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,440
to deliver everything within 72 hours.

80
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:29,680
Seriously?

81
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,444
You know how things are
with Mr. Yu.

82
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,090
The workers tend to drag their feet.

83
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,650
Yeah.

84
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,560
I kept watch from morning till night.

85
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,610
We packed each one
as soon as it was done.

86
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,530
Everything was shipped out just in time.

87
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,560
That's amazing!

88
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:52,730
Ms. Liu,

89
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,090
let's switch seats.

90
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,360
I'm feeling hot.
I'd like some wind on me.

91
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,320
Sure.

92
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,170
Thanks.

93
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,066
Don't mention it.

94
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:05,880
Ms. Liu,

95
00:05:06,244 --> 00:05:06,844
try this.

96
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:07,920
Okay.

97
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,480
Ms. Liu,

98
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,090
I just realized

99
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,360
how amazing you are.

100
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,240
I've worked with

101
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:19,360
a few housewives
who started their own businesses.

102
00:05:20,422 --> 00:05:21,320
They all did great.

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,050
They're so patient,

104
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,650
and have great execution.

105
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,850
Exactly. Think of everything
it takes to run a home.

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,530
If you can handle a household,
chances are you'll do just fine.

107
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,210
I have a client

108
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,770
who runs
a vocational school in Jiangbei.

109
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,970
They want to custom-order
uniforms for their staff.

110
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,240
If you're interested,

111
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,333
I can take you there.

112
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,850
Of course I'm interested.

113
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,970
That sounds like a big deal!

114
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:44,610
Bai,

115
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,800
thank you.

116
00:05:46,177 --> 00:05:47,170
You're welcome, Ms. Liu.

117
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:53,970
Salmon and veggie salad.

118
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,050
Enjoy.

119
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,170
Thanks.

120
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,440
This dish looks gorgeous.

121
00:05:58,755 --> 00:05:59,530
I need a picture.

122
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,880
Me too.

123
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,290
Today has been such a joy.

124
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,320
You took that? It looks amazing.

125
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:27,090
No way, I have to post this on Moments.

126
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:28,170
I'll give it a like.

127
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,530
A refund?

128
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:41,560
What happened?

129
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,560
All 120 pieces got returned?

130
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,480
The call never goes through.

131
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,970
Mom, this one even has a hole in it.

132
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,000
Your hotline is impossible to reach!

133
00:06:56,622 --> 00:06:58,622
Please take a look
at my return request.

134
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,120
You see it, right?

135
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,560
This is a malicious return!

136
00:07:01,644 --> 00:07:02,560
They already wore it.

137
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,466
There's lipstick stains
and perfume all over it.

138
00:07:04,488 --> 00:07:05,666
And they returned them all?

139
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,440
How could your platform approve that?

140
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,650
I took photos. I'll send you everything.

141
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,290
I'm filing a complaint.

142
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,650
Mom, I'll take pictures.
Let's expose them!

143
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:18,130
What kind of people do this?

144
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,920
They're abusing
the seven-day return policy!

145
00:07:20,177 --> 00:07:21,250
They must answer for this.

146
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,010
Come on, take the pictures.

147
00:07:25,822 --> 00:07:26,370
Like this?

148
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:27,890
Is it good?

149
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,080
Take a few more.

150
00:07:29,177 --> 00:07:30,150
- Take the shot.
- Lina.

151
00:07:30,377 --> 00:07:32,010
This is definitely the buyer's fault.

152
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,250
We have proof.

153
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,440
Let the platform investigate it.

154
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,440
I told you before.

155
00:07:37,577 --> 00:07:38,920
Starting a business is not easy.

156
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:39,960
Don't be too anxious.

157
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,560
Me? Anxious?

158
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,170
They were the ones rushing me

159
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,250
non-stop!

160
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,800
I kept rushing to the factory
to get them ready

161
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,800
and deliver the order.

162
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,990
I even paid the express delivery
out of my own pocket!

163
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:51,680
And now?

164
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,720
They wore it and returned
the whole batch!

165
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:55,840
How am I supposed to sell them now?

166
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,170
There are lipstick stains and holes.

167
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,800
How is that even fair?

168
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,370
Is there no justice anymore?

169
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,680
You can't just blow up at every setback.

170
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,770
Getting mad won't solve anything.

171
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,530
But business is about rules and trust.

172
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,790
They can't take advantage of us.

173
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,200
I can't just swallow it all in silence.

174
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,650
The platform has its own process too.

175
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,170
The platform's just run by robots.

176
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,250
We panic, but it doesn't.

177
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,840
Lipstick stains are
all over the clothes.

178
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,290
That's just shameless.

179
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,530
We can't let
this selfish behavior slide.

180
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,170
They must be taught a lesson.

181
00:08:30,355 --> 00:08:32,050
Exactly. I'm done relying
on the platform.

182
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,370
I'll go confront them myself.

183
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,250
Right.

184
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:35,770
We're in the right here.

185
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,170
We have to get that money back
no matter what.

186
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,170
I just can't let this go.

187
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,680
Navigation started.

188
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,650
Distance to destination, 193 kilometers.

189
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,050
That far away?

190
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,840
It's too risky to just storm over there.

191
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:51,600
Don't go.

192
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:53,290
Then, come with me.

193
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,010
I have a full schedule.

194
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:56,920
You know that.

195
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,890
Calm down. The platform will handle it.

196
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,720
Shen Qing, are you even my husband?

197
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,370
Ms. Lv is an outsider,
and even she supports me.

198
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,290
And you're telling me to let it go?

199
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,320
Why are you blaming me
for someone else's mistake?

200
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,800
And you think I'm overreacting?

201
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,290
I'm a living, breathing person.

202
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,377
This is what I should do.

203
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,600
I'm just worried about you.

204
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,680
Look at the clothes already.

205
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,050
If anything else happens to you,
it's not worth it.

206
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,130
Worried about me?

207
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,290
Or are you worried no one
will look after your family?

208
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,080
How can you even say that?

209
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,044
Because it's the truth.

210
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,650
The moment I refused to pitch in,

211
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,530
you've been walking around
with that sour face.

212
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,155
Being a full-time housewife was wrong.

213
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:31,800
Starting a business was wrong.

214
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,200
Even the buyer's fault is my fault.

215
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,733
Even taking a breath feels wrong now.

216
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,410
That's not the same thing, okay?

217
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,410
It's the same thing.

218
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,530
Since I started this business,

219
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,920
have I ever skipped cooking dinner?

220
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,490
Have I ever missed picking up Duole?

221
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,200
Tell me, have you ever encouraged me?

222
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,720
Do you care about me?

223
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,720
Liu Lina, I do support your business.

224
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:49,960
But you have to understand.

225
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,250
You're doing this to enrich your life,

226
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,560
not to seek anyone's praise.

227
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,440
And I'm drowning in my own mess too.

228
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,022
I don't have
the energy to cheer you on.

229
00:09:59,044 --> 00:10:00,133
What's going on?

230
00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:05,155
What's really going on?

231
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,050
I know the company's financial state

232
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:09,933
better than anyone.

233
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,440
If I lead the fundraising,
everyone else will follow.

234
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,920
If I don't, they'll just watch.

235
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,650
And the company might fall apart
before the finish line.

236
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:18,960
That's not my problem.

237
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:21,440
It took me five to six years
to save 800 grand.

238
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:23,290
And you want me
to throw it all in at once?

239
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,250
Not a chance.

240
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,770
My mom is right.

241
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,440
I threw myself into this.

242
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,840
I can't throw in my money too.

243
00:10:29,955 --> 00:10:31,200
Fine, whatever your mom says.

244
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,170
She's the boss.

245
00:10:33,022 --> 00:10:34,410
What is that supposed to mean?

246
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,622
She brings you fish soup every day,

247
00:10:36,622 --> 00:10:38,111
and you are nothing but ungrateful.

248
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,250
Hey, what are you doing with my phone?

249
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,050
I'm calling the buyer.

250
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,200
Hello?

251
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
I sold you the costumes.

252
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,650
Why did you block me?

253
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:04,680
Fine.

254
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,800
I swear in my family name

255
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,822
that I'll make you pay.

256
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,560
Ms. Lv?

257
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,960
What are you doing?

258
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,490
Where are you going, Lina?

259
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,130
Confronting that buyer.

260
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,560
I have to get this off my chest.

261
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,490
I got everything settled at home.

262
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,250
I'll be back before dark.

263
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,890
I'm getting in.

264
00:11:33,911 --> 00:11:34,680
I'm going with you.

265
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,955
Let's go.

266
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:36,650
Really?

267
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,530
Come on.

268
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:38,840
Let's go!

269
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,410
Alright!

270
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,130
Ms. Lv,

271
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,770
which way at the next turn?

272
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,530
Straight ahead.

273
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,770
Just keep going straight.

274
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:08,840
Got it.

275
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:17,370
♪Forward, forward, forward♪

276
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,200

285
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,530
Not bad, Lina.

286
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,440
You drive pretty well.

287
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,410
Of course I do.

288
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,600
Actually, when I first got my license,

289
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,920
I was too scared to drive at all.

290
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,644
- Really?
- Shen Qing helped me practice.

291
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,080
Once, Shen Qing was away
on a business trip.

292
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,600
Duole had a high fever.

293
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,530
And I couldn't get a taxi.

294
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:17,440
I had no choice but to drive myself.

295
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,200
The whole way,

296
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,410
Duole was crying
like his heart was breaking.

297
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,080
I gritted my teeth

298
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,960
and floored it straight
to the children's hospital.

299
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,410
Sometimes, life forces you to step up.

300
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:31,680
Exactly.

301
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,650
I remember

302
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,250
when Xinghuo's father
had just gotten his license.

303
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,530
He and I went out to the suburbs
to buy building supplies.

304
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,440
On the road,

305
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,490
his phone rang.

306
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,680
I told him to pull over
and take the call.

307
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,320
He refused.

308
00:13:51,311 --> 00:13:52,320
And I knew right then

309
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,890
it was the homewrecker calling.

310
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,290
I grabbed his phone,

311
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:58,800
and threw it out the window.

312
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:00,600
My wrist

313
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,560
hit the edge of the car window.

314
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,720
It started bleeding right away.

315
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,370
Look.

316
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:07,800
It left a big scar.

317
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,650
Yeah.

318
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,490
He pulled over.

319
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,170
I told him, "If you dare go
look for that phone,

320
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,200
I'm leaving."

321
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,410
He didn't even respond.

322
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,490
He went looking for it anyway.

323
00:14:26,777 --> 00:14:27,822
I jumped out of the car

324
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,320
and walked off.

325
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,010
That place was remote.

326
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:33,600
I left.

327
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,960
It took me over five hours to get home.

328
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,920
When I walked in,

329
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,130
I saw him lounging there,

330
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,530
legs crossed, on the phone.

331
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,290
I was so furious.

332
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,600
I completely lost it.

333
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,490
I smashed up the entire house.

334
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,130
Then, I grabbed pliers
and chased after him.

335
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,410
My daughter was crying
her eyes out in fear.

336
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,170
I told her,

337
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,050
"Remember this, sweetie,

338
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,800
I am all you need.

339
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,320
A cheating dad

340
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,490
is nothing worth missing."

341
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,370
We have to rely on ourselves.

342
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,410
You have to guard
your man like a fortress.

343
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,170
Some mistakes are unforgivable.

344
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,200
But, we can also nip them in the bud

345
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,770
so they never get the chance to happen.

346
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,450
Ms. Lv, you're something else.

347
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,840
You've really got a whole system.

348
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:39,450
Lina,

349
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,210
don't laugh.

350
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,770
Tell me this.

351
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,320
When Shen Qing works that late,

352
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,050
is he really working?

353
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,690
Or is he just avoiding home?

354
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,530
Do you even talk to him
about this stuff?

355
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:58,250
He...

356
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,080
He's really just busy.

357
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,290
Well then, just make sure
you keep repeating your mantra.

358
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,080
"If you dare cheat on me,

359
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,160
I'll bring misery on you!"

360
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:16,730
You got that?

361
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,360
You're a tough one.

362
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:20,970
Definitely.

363
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,640
If every woman in the world
stood strong,

364
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,640
would men still dare cheat?

365
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:29,970
Exactly.

366
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,160
Am I right?

367
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,160
Yes.

368
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:39,222
Looks like this is the place.

369
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,880
It's 268 Changqiao Road. This is it.

370
00:16:55,511 --> 00:16:56,120
Let's go.

371
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:56,888
Yeah, let's go.

372
00:17:00,112 --> 00:17:04,480
(Huijia Shoes)

373
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,120
Huijia Shoes. This is the place.

374
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,010
Go on.

375
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,010
Hello.

376
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:14,530
Hi, hello.

377
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,160
Excuse me, is Tan Xin here?

378
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,010
Tan Xin?

379
00:17:17,288 --> 00:17:18,622
No one by that name is here.

380
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,290
But this is 268 Changqiao Road, right?

381
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,560
Yes, it's 268.

382
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,555
No one by that name.

383
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:24,600
This phone number,

384
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,400
does anyone here use it?

385
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,320
How would I know?

386
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:32,450
I'm busy.

387
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,320
Okay, thank you.

388
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:35,640
It's fine. Let's ask someone else.

389
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,210
Go on.

390
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,120
Excuse me...

391
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,600
Sorry, I'm busy right now.

392
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,320
Sorry to trouble you.

393
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,930
Madam, you're disrupting our work.

394
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,320
I'm really sorry.

395
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,290
Tan Xin from your company

396
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,560
bought over a hundred costumes from me.

397
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:05,250
She wore them and then returned them.

398
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,250
She even blocked me.

399
00:18:07,977 --> 00:18:08,880
Let me say it again.

400
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,640
There's no Tan Xin here.

401
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:11,840
You got the wrong place.

402
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,450
We're really busy here.

403
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,970
Did your company hold
an appreciation event?

404
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:18,730
No.

405
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,050
No?

406
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,640
Who are you?

407
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,400
This is a workplace, you know.

408
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:25,640
Why are you yelling?

409
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,530
Because when you see injustice,
you speak up.

410
00:18:31,022 --> 00:18:33,288
Huijia Shoes Appreciation Event.

411
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,290
Where did you buy these costumes?

412
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,530
Who bought them?

413
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,320
These are costumes from my store.

414
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,120
Look at this ballet dress

415
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,488
and the Mongolian costumes!

416
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,320
I packed all of these myself.

417
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,730
Your company bought them.

418
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,400
This is solid evidence.

419
00:18:50,466 --> 00:18:51,577
The truth is right here.

420
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,290
Solid evidence? Truth? Seriously?

421
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,210
What a joke.

422
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,050
Who are you, a judge?

423
00:18:56,577 --> 00:18:57,400
Keep making a scene,

424
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,290
and I'll call security.

425
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,530
Go ahead. Call them.

426
00:18:59,530 --> 00:18:59,970
Go on.

427
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,066
What's all the yelling?

428
00:19:02,222 --> 00:19:03,488
What's going on, Mr. Gao?

429
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,600
She's accusing us of malicious returns.

430
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,530
Get back to work.

431
00:19:08,577 --> 00:19:09,555
This doesn't concern you.

432
00:19:09,577 --> 00:19:10,730
Go on. I'll handle it.

433
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,210
Madam,

434
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,800
please don't interrupt our work.

435
00:19:13,844 --> 00:19:15,149
Let's move to the meeting room.

436
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,170
- Meeting room.
- Alright.

437
00:19:16,177 --> 00:19:16,777
No!

438
00:19:17,844 --> 00:19:20,177
- Internal info! No pictures allowed!
- No photos!

439
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,040
Give me your phone.

440
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,050
Say that again.

441
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:22,690
Let go!

442
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,600
Say that again!

443
00:19:23,977 --> 00:19:24,400
This is...

444
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,730
I'm keeping this as evidence.

445
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,640
If you dare grab my phone,

446
00:19:28,088 --> 00:19:29,050
I'll call the police.

447
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,177
Yeah, we'll call the police.

448
00:19:30,177 --> 00:19:30,955
Go ahead.

449
00:19:30,955 --> 00:19:31,888
It's a seven-day return.

450
00:19:31,977 --> 00:19:32,880
Why can't I return it?

451
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:33,250
Exactly.

452
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,210
You're Tan Xin, aren't you?

453
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,120
That Hello Kitty
profile picture was you!

454
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,690
You were all sweet-talking me,

455
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,290
acting so kind and polite back then.

456
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,050
You said your company
had an urgent event.

457
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,200
You needed the costumes fast.

458
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,360
You sent me strings of thank-you emojis.

459
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,311
As soon as you used them,
you returned them all?

460
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,022
Did everyone at your company know?

461
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,840
You all did this on purpose.

462
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,290
Madam, now you're being unreasonable.

463
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,120
Wrong.

464
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,290
Truth wins everywhere.

465
00:19:58,444 --> 00:19:59,450
I'll say it right here.

466
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,120
Listen up.

467
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,640
The delivery address is your company.

468
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,010
And I have the company's event photos.

469
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,600
Sure, the receiver used a fake name.

470
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,930
But the phone number is
registered to a real person.

471
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:14,560
That's right.

472
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,450
She must've turned her phone off.

473
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,930
That's fine.

474
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,250
We'll just wait right here.

475
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,690
Let's see if she has the guts
to stay offline forever.

476
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,210
Exactly.

477
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,930
We have nothing but time.

478
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,050
A lie will always be a lie.

479
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,320
Nothing can change that.

480
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,970
But the truth will prevail.

481
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,250
You can't bury it forever!

482
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,970
Ms. Lv, I must raise a toast to you.

483
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,690
No driving after drinking.

484
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,970
Let's toast with water instead.

485
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:43,320
Sure.

486
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,250
That was just so satisfying.

487
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,360
I really didn't expect it.

488
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,290
A whole company
schemed together to scam us.

489
00:21:00,288 --> 00:21:01,600
If it weren't for you today,

490
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,840
I couldn't have handled them.

491
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,930
No.

492
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,640
I was just a supporting role.

493
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,010
The real reason is

494
00:21:10,977 --> 00:21:12,360
evil can't overpower justice.

495
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,290
Truth wins everywhere.

496
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:14,880
Exactly.

497
00:21:16,177 --> 00:21:16,640
Come on.

498
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,450
Cheers.

499
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,290
We have to celebrate.

500
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:18,880
Cheers!

501
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,640
Mr. Shen.

502
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,600
Mr. Shen!

503
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:29,730
Coming!

504
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:32,730
Sun!

505
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,770
Mr. Shen, this is

506
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,160
the roach repellent Ms. Lv bought.

507
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,190
She asked me to bring it.

508
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,360
Roaches again?

509
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:38,640
Alright.

510
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:39,888
Thank you. Much appreciated.

511
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:40,690
No problem at all.

512
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,822
Call me if you need anything.

513
00:21:41,822 --> 00:21:42,222
Got it.

514
00:21:42,222 --> 00:21:42,844
Alright then.

515
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:43,970
Stay hydrated in this heat.

516
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:44,690
Will do.

517
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,320
Roach repellent.

518
00:22:38,955 --> 00:22:39,970
The house is smoking!

519
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,840
Everyone, calm down!

520
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:46,930
Do not panic!

521
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:50,730
Did you hear that?
The firefighters have gone up.

522
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:51,770
It's okay.

523
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,160
It's alright.
The firefighters are on it.

524
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:54,880
No problem.

525
00:22:55,511 --> 00:22:57,050
It's alright.
Please disperse for now.

526
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,010
Safety first.

527
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:58,970
Stay safe.

528
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,930
Isn't that our stairwell?

529
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:03,320
My dad!

530
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,880
Lina, you're finally back!

531
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,690
Mr. Shen is still inside!

532
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,840
- My dad's in there?
- What...

533
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,640
Mr. Shen went out.

534
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,010
He's not picking up his phone.

535
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,600
The firefighter already went up.

536
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,666
They haven't come down.
I don't know what's going on.

537
00:23:14,666 --> 00:23:15,240
Is it serious?

538
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,311
It's been a while
since the firefighter went up.

539
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:20,420
How is it? Is everything okay?

540
00:23:20,444 --> 00:23:20,879
It's fine.

541
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,360
Too much roach repellent was lit.

542
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,530
It caused heavy smoke.

543
00:23:23,577 --> 00:23:24,800
Did you contact the owner?

544
00:23:25,044 --> 00:23:26,333
- Over here!
- We're here!

545
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,210
Yes, that's us.

546
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,490
You shouldn't burn
that much roach repellent at once.

547
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,600
It's way too dangerous.

548
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:33,160
- Sorry.
- Be more careful next time.

549
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,010
I'm sorry. It's on me.

550
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:34,419
So sorry.

551
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,780
- We won't do it again.
- Thanks.

552
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,890
- Can I go in now?
- Quick!

553
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:37,560
Hurry up!

554
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,010
Let's go.

555
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:45,560
Open the windows.

556
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,320
Okay.

557
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,010
That was close.

558
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,080
Lina!

559
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,050
Leave it.

560
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,560
You're allergic.

561
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,640
Let me do it.

562
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,840
Does it hurt?

563
00:24:12,888 --> 00:24:13,911
It's alright.

564
00:24:14,155 --> 00:24:14,730
Hang in there.

565
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,290
I'm okay.

566
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,210
Dad.

567
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:24,160
You're bleeding!

568
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,530
The window fell off.

569
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,690
It would have hit me,

570
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:27,930
but Ms. Lv took the blow for me.

571
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,120
Good thing it was me.

572
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,600
Your delicate skin
wouldn't have handled it.

573
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,560
No, this won't do.

574
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:33,930
The wound must be treated.

575
00:24:34,511 --> 00:24:35,930
You're bleeding from that big wound.

576
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,177
We must get you to the hospital.

577
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,600
Ms. Lv Yuan, let's go.

578
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,450
- Let's go.
- No need for that.

579
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,400
It's just a scratch. I'm fine.

580
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,050
I mean it.

581
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,730
You'll need a tetanus shot for this.

582
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,880
Exactly, this is serious.

583
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:47,250
Right.

584
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:48,250
It's serious. Let's go.

585
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:49,530
Better go to the hospital, Ms. Lv.

586
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:49,770
Go.

587
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:50,800
Do I really have to?

588
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,355
Yes!

589
00:24:51,377 --> 00:24:51,933
Definitely.

590
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:52,560
Alright.

591
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,010
There's a medical card in my bag.

592
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:55,730
Grab it for me.

593
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:56,290
Dad.

594
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,210
Can you get Ms. Lv's bag?

595
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:58,800
Sure.

596
00:24:59,022 --> 00:24:59,880
Hurry, get ready.

597
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,730
How did that window fall down?

598
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,210
That was too close.

599
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,050
Exactly.

600
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,690
Tomorrow, we have to find someone

601
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,560
to get the glass replaced.

602
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:17,530
Yeah.

603
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,350
Alright, don't take off your shoes.

604
00:25:20,777 --> 00:25:22,290
- Come on.
- Keep the shoes on.

605
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:23,840
Keep the shoes on. Let's go.

606
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,490
Head inside.

607
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:26,450
Ms. Lv!

608
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:26,930
Liu!

609
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,050
Ms. Lv, you're back!

610
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:29,250
Yes, I'm back. Look at this.

611
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,840
You really went through a lot.

612
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,490
Let me see it.

613
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:31,800
Liu.

614
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,266
I'm fine.

615
00:25:32,266 --> 00:25:32,930
That was rough.

616
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:33,640
Come on, hurry in.

617
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,800
Sit down.

618
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,880
You've all been worried because of me.

619
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,930
A little cut like this
didn't need a hospital trip.

620
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,120
No way. You had to go.

621
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,730
Sit down.

622
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:42,160
No.

623
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,490
You have to go, absolutely.

624
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:44,010
Exactly.

625
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:44,840
This is serious.

626
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:46,730
Those aluminum alloy windows are heavy.

627
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,080
Right.

628
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,930
It's nothing.

629
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,120
The window is made of aluminum alloy.

630
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,600
But I'm made of steel.

631
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:52,530
Metal VS. metal.

632
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,210
I win.

633
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,160
Alright, Ms. Lv Yuan.

634
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,160
You're injured
and still shouting slogans?

635
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,210
What a day.

636
00:26:02,622 --> 00:26:03,080
Exactly.

637
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,530
The window is broken now.

638
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,450
Where will you sleep tonight?

639
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:07,880
I'm fine.

640
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:10,770
I'll just sleep on the sofa.

641
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,560
What? You can't sleep on the sofa.

642
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,050
Go sleep in the bedroom.

643
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,010
I'll take the sofa.

644
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,690
You're injured. You need proper rest.

645
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:19,010
This injury is nothing to me.

646
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,600
No, you really need to rest well.

647
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:23,120
That cut's pretty serious.

648
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,360
You bled quite a bit.

649
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,400
Yeah, you need to recover properly.

650
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,120
Ms. Lv.

651
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,120
Listen to us.

652
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,210
I've already measured the size.

653
00:26:36,311 --> 00:26:37,450
Tomorrow I'll find someone

654
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,210
to get the glass replaced.

655
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,360
Alright.

656
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:42,080
Okay.

657
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,670
Let's head out.

658
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,450
Sorry to trouble you.

659
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,010
We're leaving.

660
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,080
Thank you for everything.

661
00:26:45,266 --> 00:26:46,530
No need to thank me, Ms. Lv.

662
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,360
Sorry to trouble you.

663
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,044
Don't mention it.

664
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:48,400
Alright.

665
00:26:48,422 --> 00:26:49,190
Thank you so much.

666
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,770
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

667
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,600
Alright, bye now.

668
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:52,360
Thanks again.

669
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,120
Goodbye.

670
00:26:53,155 --> 00:26:53,880
I'll walk you out.

671
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,120
No. Let me walk you out.

672
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,250
Let me see you off.

673
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,400
Really, it's nothing.

674
00:26:59,400 --> 00:26:59,880
Let's go.

675
00:26:59,933 --> 00:27:00,688
We'll head out now.

676
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,080
- I'll walk you out.
- Take care.

677
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,970
You don't have to.

678
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,880
Your dad and I can just take the bus.

679
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,110
- It's really convenient.
- Yes.

680
00:27:06,111 --> 00:27:06,755
The bus?

681
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,490
Yeah, it's super convenient.

682
00:27:08,533 --> 00:27:09,290
Alright, enough.

683
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:09,640
Bye.

684
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,360
Take care.

685
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:10,970
Goodbye.

686
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:11,840
Bye.

687
00:27:12,222 --> 00:27:12,600
Alright.

688
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,310
Dad, be careful.

689
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,360
Okay.

690
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,080
Bye, Liu.

691
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:17,911
Take it slow. Goodbye.

692
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,800
Alright, you go rest too.

693
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,690
Okay, Dad.

694
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,970
You get some rest too.

695
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,600
Alright.

696
00:27:34,911 --> 00:27:36,644
What are you doing?
We talked about this.

697
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,120
Stop sleeping on the couch.

698
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,160
Go sleep in the room.

699
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,050
I'll take the sofa.

700
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:40,840
Listen.

701
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,290
That sofa's way too narrow.
You won't sleep well.

702
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,730
The doctor told me

703
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,160
I couldn't put pressure on my wound
and sleep sideways.

704
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,050
So

705
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:49,450
I'm good here.

706
00:27:49,911 --> 00:27:51,210
I'm perfectly fine on the couch.

707
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,600
You have to listen.

708
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,210
Good advice is worth taking.

709
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:55,730
Always take good advice?

710
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,120
Just listen to me
and go to sleep in the room.

711
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,840
No, don't worry.

712
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:00,690
You know what?

713
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,880
I've been sent to the countryside.

714
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,010
I've stayed in the ICU.

715
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,690
I've even slept on army beds.

716
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,930
I'm really good at adapting.

717
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:09,400
This sofa's super soft.

718
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,360
I'll be just fine.

719
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:11,730
Don't worry.

720
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:12,450
I'll be here.

721
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:16,400
Ms. Lv Yuan.

722
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,010
- I shouldn't have...
- Enough.

723
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,770
Stop babbling.

724
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,250
Alright, hand me your phone.

725
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:22,930
Show me.

726
00:28:23,155 --> 00:28:24,577
Did you hit ten thousand steps?

727
00:28:26,155 --> 00:28:27,490
Pretty sure I passed that.

728
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:32,730
How many?

729
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:33,490
Awesome.

730
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:34,311
I passed it, right?

731
00:28:34,311 --> 00:28:35,490
Over ten thousand.

732
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,490
A total of 10,219 steps.

733
00:28:37,822 --> 00:28:39,250
That's amazing. Totally amazing.

734
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,160
Nice.

735
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,490
Alright, off you go.

736
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,250
Lights out and go to sleep.

737
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,290
Go on.

738
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,290
But you...

739
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,450
Be good.

740
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:54,360
Well...

741
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,050
You still look down on me?

742
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,840
Didn't I just get the payment back?

743
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,730
If I'd followed your procedure,

744
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:35,930
who knows when the money

745
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:36,800
would have come back.

746
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,320
You guys are way too soft.

747
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:41,400
When it matters,
it's us working women who step up.

748
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,770
Alright, you're tough.

749
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,320
You know,

750
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,880
Ms. Lv is a real heroine.

751
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47,320
The way she shielded me
from that glass panel was so cool!

752
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,644
I almost felt like marrying her.

753
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,360
Would you have

754
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,320
done the same for me?

755
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,840
Could you take the hit?

756
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,160
Life is not about "if".

757
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,560
I was just testing you.

758
00:29:59,177 --> 00:30:00,755
I'm too soft. I couldn't shield you.

759
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:01,600
Nope.

760
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:16,930
I'm going out.

761
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,560
Go ahead.

762
00:30:30,688 --> 00:30:31,730
What is this called?

763
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,450
The Blue Enchantress.

764
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,320
- Blue Enchantress?
- Try it.

765
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:39,880
How is it?

766
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,770
Bai, you should've seen

767
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:46,490
how we handled

768
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:49,080
those cursed buyers today.

769
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,450
It felt so satisfying.

770
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,730
She even dared to block me.

771
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:56,080
She used a fake ID to cover her tracks.

772
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,730
Seriously?

773
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,530
We countered every move she made.

774
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:00,160
She was utterly cornered.

775
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,600
That's so awesome!

776
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,600
You are honestly born for business.

777
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,930
Smart and fearless.

778
00:31:09,066 --> 00:31:09,600
Cheers.

779
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:10,690
That's right.

780
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,360
You'll definitely land
that school uniform deal.

781
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:20,450
I believe in you.

782
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:22,640
Alright.

783
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,120
If I go public one day,

784
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,050
you'll be my CFO.

785
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,320
Really?

786
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:29,490
It's a deal.

787
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:31,600
Deal. Pinky swear.

788
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,355
Pinky swear.

789
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:37,730
Pinky swear, hang it high,
and never go back on it for 100 years.

790
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:40,120
Break it and you hang...

791
00:32:02,711 --> 00:32:03,450
It's getting late.

792
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:04,560
I should go.

793
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,160
Yeah.

794
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:07,880
Right.

795
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,800
Ms. Liu, safe travels.

796
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:12,560
Thanks.

797
00:32:12,733 --> 00:32:13,933
Take care on the road.

798
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,600
(Ten things Shen Qing promises
to do for Liu Lina)

799
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:00,160
Whatever Liu Lina does,
Shen Qing supports her.

800
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,490
And vice versa.

801
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,410
Money is pointless.

802
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,200
Fighting over money is not worth it.

803
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,240
Eight hundred grand, here you go.

804
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,760
Dear, whatever you do, I support you.

805
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:15,600
Lina.

806
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,120
Dear.

807
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,970
When you have the energy,
remember to praise me.

808
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:23,450
I can't help it.

809
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,200
I'm just someone who craves recognition.

810
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:41,240
You get back to work.

811
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,410
I'm going to sleep.

812
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,050
Morning.

813
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:16,370
Morning.

814
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:19,760
I'm really sorry.

815
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,810
I should explain it.

816
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,330
Yesterday, it's just that...

817
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:26,120
The doctor told me

818
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,280
not to put pressure on the wound.

819
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,080
But I fell asleep.

820
00:38:30,355 --> 00:38:31,050
I turned over...

821
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,640
and the sofa collapsed.

822
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,370
I really had no choice.

823
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,240
So I came to your room.

824
00:38:40,533 --> 00:38:41,560
Held it in all night.

825
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:42,850
Was it too cramped?

826
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:44,850
No, not at all.

827
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:46,240
You...

828
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:48,370
You slept pretty well.

829
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:49,850
You were out like a light.

830
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,810
Didn't wake up once all night.

831
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:53,890
Yeah.

832
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,010
I really didn't wake up once.

833
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,050
How's your wound?

834
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,160
Is it better?

835
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,640
It's okay.

836
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,810
It really hurt last night.

837
00:39:15,044 --> 00:39:16,890
Around midnight,
the pain was unbearable.

838
00:39:17,133 --> 00:39:17,930
I couldn't take it.

839
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:19,560
It's a bit better now.

840
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:21,160
Good.

841
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,050
The meds are outside, right?

842
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:27,640
Let me

843
00:39:27,911 --> 00:39:28,850
put on more for you.

844
00:39:41,022 --> 00:39:42,120
It looks much better inside.

845
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:43,850
Alright.

846
00:39:43,933 --> 00:39:45,000
There's still a spot here.

847
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:47,160
Let me disinfect it for you.

848
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:52,810
Ouch.

849
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,120
Phase Ⅲ clinical trials

850
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:29,280
have been extended from 16 to 24 weeks.

851
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,010
Yes, progress is behind schedule.

852
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,560
Please take a look at this.

853
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,160
This is our company's
fundraising status.

854
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:42,240
Which means

855
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,600
everyone has pitched in
their own money.

856
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,050
We just want to show you

857
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,810
we're determined to make this work.

858
00:40:55,285 --> 00:40:58,740
(Names: An Ruifeng, Shen Qing)

859
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:04,560
I can see it.

860
00:41:05,266 --> 00:41:06,200
RF Pharmaceuticals

861
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:08,720
is truly a team to get it done.

862
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,240
But, are your families

863
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,050
not against this decision?

864
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,680
The signed money will be transferred.

865
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,370
So

866
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:24,200
please continue to trust us.

867
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,970
We will make M701 happen.

868
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:38,890
Ms. Liu.

869
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:40,370
Bai.

870
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:43,640
Coffee.

871
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:44,970
Thanks.

872
00:41:46,911 --> 00:41:48,050
Alcohol causes errors.

873
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:49,160
From now on,

874
00:41:49,422 --> 00:41:50,240
we stick to coffee.

875
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:50,970
We stay sober.

876
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,050
Coffee to keep us sharp,

877
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,280
and alcohol to keep us blurred.

878
00:41:55,311 --> 00:41:55,970
We can do both.

879
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,810
Alright. As you wish.

880
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,120
This way.

881
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:00,410
Okay, let's go.

882
00:42:01,844 --> 00:42:03,560
Headmaster Zhang, here's your latte.

883
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,120
Bai, you're too kind.

884
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:05,640
Thank you.

885
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,160
Ms. Liu, this is Headmaster Zhang.

886
00:42:08,155 --> 00:42:09,200
Hello, Headmaster Zhang.

887
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:09,760
Hello.

888
00:42:09,955 --> 00:42:11,560
We've worked with the school for years.

889
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,330
He's nice.

890
00:42:13,488 --> 00:42:14,050
Have a seat.

891
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:15,890
Thank you.

892
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:18,810
The school's huge and beautiful.

893
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:19,970
Right?

894
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,160
It's all been built bit by bit.

895
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:23,600
Right now,

896
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,490
we're having custom uniforms made

897
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,050
for our faculty and staff.

898
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,280
Prices outside are ridiculously high.

899
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:30,370
Exactly.

900
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,240
Bai recommended you to me.

901
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:33,560
He says your company

902
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:34,450
is reliable.

903
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,760
Thanks, Bai.

904
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:38,760
Lina is honestly super capable.

905
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:40,050
I can see that.

906
00:42:41,444 --> 00:42:42,330
Headmaster Zhang,

907
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,560
my company is newly established,

908
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,280
so I handle everything myself.

909
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,080
Rest assured.

910
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,810
I'll give you our best service.

911
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:50,850
Thank you so much.

912
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:53,330
If this goes well,

913
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:54,930
we'll have you

914
00:42:54,977 --> 00:42:56,280
handle our school uniforms too.

915
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,640
You know,

916
00:42:58,866 --> 00:43:00,280
our school has over 3,000 students.

917
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:03,120
