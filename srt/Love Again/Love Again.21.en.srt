00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,040
=Love Again=

2
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,140
=Episode 21=

3
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:39,800
Shen Qing,

4
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,750
it's like we've got a real
Lei Feng in our house.

5
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,200
What are you saying?

6
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,050
Ms. Lv.

7
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,190
- Please come in.
- I've cleaned the stairwell.

8
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,960
Let me clean your house as well.

9
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,460
You have
too much stuff in the house.

10
00:01:55,511 --> 00:01:58,059
Listen. You have to clean the nooks
and crannies with a cloth.

11
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,170
Yeah. I clean them every day.

12
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,130
Ms. Lv, have a seat.

13
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:00,960
You...

14
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,890
Sit down!

15
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,360
Mind your waist. Sit down.

16
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,640
My waist is much better now.

17
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,800
Just rest. Listen to me.

18
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:06,755
Yes, Ms. Lv.

19
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,920
I'll do it in the future.

20
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,200
I'll take care

21
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,800
of Shen.

22
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,520
As for you guys,

23
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,933
you guys are liberated.

24
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,680
I'm here to liberate you guys

25
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,850
so that you guys have the energy
to serve the society.

26
00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:20,450
Lina, what was your previous occupation?

27
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,680
I was an accountant.

28
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,450
Accountant? That's great.

29
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,800
All companies require accountants.

30
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:26,290
Yeah.

31
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,640
I was quite competent in the past.

32
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,850
I was great at my job.

33
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,360
But after Duole was born, I...

34
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,080
I think our
logistics department is hiring.

35
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:38,044
I'll make an inquiry for you.

36
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,450
Sorry for the trouble, then.

37
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,800
Not at all.

38
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,240
Listen.

39
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,050
If you're young, you have to work.

40
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,733
You shouldn't live like
a posh mistress at home.

41
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,650
Just look at him.

42
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,170
Look at Shen Qing.

43
00:02:53,333 --> 00:02:54,955
He's still working
even though he's sick.

44
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,680
He's very hardworking and committed.

45
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:57,800
- Great job, boy.
- Ms. Lv.

46
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,560
- I'm like this because...
- I know.

47
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,970
I understand.

48
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,610
- You quit because of your family.
- Yeah.

49
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,210
I understand.

50
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,440
But why are you still at home now?

51
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,770
We have to create value for our society,

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,440
you know?

53
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:13,650
Alright.

54
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,610
I'll take care
of the housework from now.

55
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:16,911
I'll head back now.

56
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:18,730
Ms. Lv, remember to have the fruits.

57
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,440
Alright. Thank you.

58
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,000
Ms. Lv, thank you.

59
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:22,920
Don't mention it.

60
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:30,266
Is there a posh mistress

61
00:03:30,288 --> 00:03:32,022
like me who doesn't wear
any gold or silver?

62
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,970
Ms. Lv was just saying.

63
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,200
Did you take it to heart?

64
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
Ms. Lv

65
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,560
is a nice person.

66
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,555
It's just that she's a busybody.

67
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,000
She butts in at everyone's affairs.

68
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,133
I knew even if she didn't tell me.

69
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:44,240
Once women have a career,

70
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,650
they stand out in a different way.

71
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,000
Ice, the girl from your company.

72
00:03:48,244 --> 00:03:49,120
She's very classy.

73
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,240
Why are you talking about her?

74
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:57,200
And Lin Fengyun as well.

75
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,240
She is my classmate.

76
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,311
When I stand beside her,
it's like I'm her aunt.

77
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,530
That's not true.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,240
Her photos were photoshopped.

79
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,320
She looks older than you
when she stands beside you.

80
00:04:07,466 --> 00:04:08,440
She looks older than me?

81
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,240
That's right.

82
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:10,360
Really?

83
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,880
You look much younger than her.

84
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:19,290
I have to clean the nooks and crannies.

85
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,088
We have so much stuff at home.

86
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:25,377
When that's the case,
dust starts to gather.

87
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,111
Are you serious about looking for a job?

88
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,440
What do you mean?

89
00:04:35,377 --> 00:04:37,610
What? You can wear
revealing outfits in your forties

90
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,480
while I can't even find a job?

91
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,120
Can you not be that mean?

92
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,650
I mean,

93
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,000
at our age,

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,066
we should provide
job opportunities to other people.

95
00:04:48,111 --> 00:04:50,200
How could we steal jobs
from the younger generations?

96
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,850
Provide job opportunities?

97
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:53,800
You mean starting a business?

98
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,410
That's fine.

99
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,120
Even if you just invest in something
like a Hainiao Post Station,

100
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,533
the ROI is pretty good, you know?

101
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,560
No way.

102
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,977
I'll worry about it to no end.

103
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,800
I just want to find a job

104
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,090
that's easy

105
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,311
and close to my house.

106
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,880
I don't care about the wage.

107
00:05:08,311 --> 00:05:10,355
I just don't want
to be disconnected from society.

108
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,880
If so,

109
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,090
you can work at the after-school
care center near your house.

110
00:05:15,288 --> 00:05:17,290
You can teach the kids
how to do their homework.

111
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,290
That's your expertise.

112
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,730
But at that time,

113
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,440
I have to go home and cook for Duole.

114
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,170
If so...

115
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,320
Steven's mother

116
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,200
operates a steakhouse.

117
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,530
She needs an accountant.

118
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,480
That's what you studied.

119
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,200
- That sounds good.
- Yeah, right?

120
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:34,850
Where is their steakhouse located?

121
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:36,190
Near the Olympic Sports Center.

122
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,560
You must be kidding me.

123
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,000
Our house is located in the east

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,790
while hers is located in the west.
There's a huge distance between them.

125
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,511
That won't do.

126
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,120
You should work as a volunteer
at Jiming Temple.

127
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,050
You can go there

128
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,000
whenever you like.

129
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,730
It's near, and you can
contribute something.

130
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:50,900
Buddha is merciful. Amitabha.

131
00:05:51,222 --> 00:05:52,320
What do you mean by that?

132
00:05:53,866 --> 00:05:56,880
It depends on the weather
whether I can head there or not, okay?

133
00:05:57,133 --> 00:05:59,022
You're the one
disconnected from society here.

134
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,210
Should I find a job or not?

135
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,050
No.

136
00:06:04,955 --> 00:06:06,200
You won't be able to find any.

137
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:09,880
(Bo'ai Building)
Alright. Everyone, take a break.

138
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,320
Have some water. Take a break.

139
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,360
We should inform Shen.

140
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,090
Shen.

141
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,920
Ding went to borrow some light bulbs.

142
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,044
And, he hasn't returned yet.

143
00:06:18,088 --> 00:06:19,750
Call him and ask him
what he's doing, then.

144
00:06:19,777 --> 00:06:21,066
I did. He didn't answer my calls.

145
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:21,560
He didn't?

146
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,210
Listen.

147
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:29,111
Ever since Ms. Nie got into trouble
after she didn't answer my calls,

148
00:06:29,177 --> 00:06:31,511
I panic when I hear
that people don't answer phone calls.

149
00:06:31,577 --> 00:06:33,090
Why don't I go and look for him?

150
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:33,730
Let's go.

151
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,530
Gou, join him.

152
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:34,880
Alright.

153
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,800
- Stay here.
- I'll stay.

154
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,920
- Let's go.
- Don't worry.

155
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:38,888
Call me if anything happens.

156
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,000
Take care.

157
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,480
What's wrong?

158
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,120
Wait. Don't panic.

159
00:06:49,244 --> 00:06:49,880
What's going on?

160
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:51,466
What's going on?

161
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,800
Who's that?

162
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,560
What happened?

163
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:54,850
Look!

164
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,360
Someone's standing on top.

165
00:06:58,733 --> 00:06:59,933
He's too bold for his own good.

166
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:01,560
My goodness!

167
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,130
Guys, make way.

168
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,911
- Should we switch the lights off?
- Excuse me.

169
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:05,600
That's dangerous.

170
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,059
Someone's getting to the switches.

171
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,711
That's fine.

172
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,370
You!

173
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,170
Ding!

174
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,440
What are you doing?

175
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,822
I'm borrowing a light bulb from them.

176
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,170
Even so, you shouldn't do it like this!

177
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,720
Go and find a pair of pliers for me.

178
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:21,800
Without this,

179
00:07:21,911 --> 00:07:22,800
my daughter, Shujing,

180
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,010
cannot do her homework.

181
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,960
Call Shujing.

182
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,410
Shujing,

183
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,410
hurry and come to the school.

184
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,770
Ding, you should stop.

185
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,010
The power is out.

186
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,600
Don't listen to Shen and Gou.

187
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,200
This is ridiculous.

188
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,509
Why should I go for a checkup?

189
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:46,960
You should.

190
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,170
I...

191
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,190
This is the place, right?

192
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,370
My goodness. You...

193
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:55,488
According to
the patient's clinical performance,

194
00:07:55,555 --> 00:07:57,577
cognition assessment,

195
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,410
and the result

196
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,050
of his MRI scan,

197
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,600
we can basically deduce

198
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,250
that he has Alzheimer's disease.

199
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,711
Doctor, is there anything
we can do about it?

200
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:09,080
Currently, there's no cure.

201
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,080
I can only give you some prescriptions

202
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,050
to improve his cognition

203
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,440
and delay the progression.

204
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,080
Impossible!

205
00:08:27,066 --> 00:08:28,010
This is impossible!

206
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,400
You don't believe me, huh?

207
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:35,200
Fine.

208
00:08:35,955 --> 00:08:36,866
Ding Shujing,

209
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,170
you're good at Math.

210
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:39,844
Let me ask you this.

211
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,840
How many digits of Pi
can you memorize

212
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,050
after the decimal point?

213
00:08:47,244 --> 00:08:48,050
Let's have a contest

214
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,410
to see who has a better memory.

215
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,355
Alright. I'll start first.

216
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,770
3.1415926

217
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,320
5358979

218
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:02,440
3288462

219
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,800
5433826

220
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:08,370
9...

221
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,010
97...

222
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:12,890
79...

223
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:15,800
What's wrong with me?

224
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:18,600
Calm down.

225
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,840
Usually, I can recite 100 digits
behind the decimal point.

226
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,560
Yeah.

227
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,410
141.1415926...

228
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:25,840
Shujing,

229
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,720
give me the prescription paper.

230
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,170
I'll retrieve the medicine for you.

231
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,190
You can send your father back
with Mr. Gou first.

232
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:31,890
Go now.

233
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:32,840
Take care.

234
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,800
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

235
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,370
I'm fine.

236
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,440
Why did you take me to the hospital?

237
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,320
It's hard enough to rent the hall.

238
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:41,066
You guys should cherish the opportunity

239
00:09:41,111 --> 00:09:42,200
and use it to practice.

240
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,560
Yeah.

241
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,530
Yeah.

242
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,200
What a mess.

243
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,960
Doctor, excuse me.

244
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:54,219
These Donepezil Hydrochloride tablets
make people drowsy, right?

245
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,320
Medications have side effects.
But it depends on the individual.

246
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,450
Isn't it stated in the prescription?
You can just read it at home.

247
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,260
It's just an inquiry.

248
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,290
Yeah. Look at the queue.

249
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,250
Why isn't it my turn yet?

250
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,790
I'll be done in a second. I'll be quick.

251
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:04,960
And...

252
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,410
Doctor,

253
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,800
I have this at home. Please refund...

254
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,650
My thing is urgent.
My child still has a fever.

255
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,410
Calm down. Take turns.

256
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,490
What's wrong with you?

257
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,749
Why are you cutting the queue?

258
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,440
He's not done yet.
Why are you so impatient?

259
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,170
Who are you?

260
00:10:16,355 --> 00:10:17,200
None of your business.

261
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,820
When the road is uneven,
someone levels it.

262
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,344
When something is unfair,
I serve justice.

263
00:10:20,344 --> 00:10:21,840
Guys, do everyone a favor.

264
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,250
Queue up and take your turns.

265
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,170
Are you done?

266
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,644
- There's one more question.
- Okay.

267
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,010
This medicine should be taken
before bed, right?

268
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:29,600
That's right.

269
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:30,333
Okay. Thank you.

270
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:30,800
Thank you.

271
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:31,490
I'm done.

272
00:10:33,488 --> 00:10:34,410
What are you doing here?

273
00:10:34,555 --> 00:10:36,955
I was worried about you,
so I came here to check on you.

274
00:10:38,088 --> 00:10:38,440
Okay.

275
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,650
Thank you.

276
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,080
I didn't know

277
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,170
why I climbed

278
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,890
to the top either.

279
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,530
I just remembered that I wanted

280
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,050
to borrow a light bulb.

281
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,720
You said Shujing

282
00:10:57,555 --> 00:10:59,890
needed the light bulb
so that she could do her homework.

283
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,290
I don't remember at all.

284
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:07,370
You see,

285
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,010
the older one gets,

286
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,650
the poorer their memory is.

287
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:11,490
I'm the same.

288
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:12,600
It's fine.

289
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,222
Remember to take your medicine

290
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,577
and recite the digits of Pi.

291
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:18,622
You should take your medicine.

292
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,560
I inquired about them
when I retrieved the medicine.

293
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,777
The doctor explained it to me.

294
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,170
The method of intake

295
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,560
is written on top of the box.

296
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,320
Look at this.

297
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,250
This.

298
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,080
To treat

299
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,080
Alzheimer's disease.

300
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,840
Alzheimer's disease?

301
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,440
You must be kidding me.

302
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,050
Once per day.

303
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,440
One tablet per session.

304
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,170
For four weeks.

305
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,170
Alzheimer's disease?

306
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,320
You must be kidding me.

307
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:04,560
Alzheimer's disease?

308
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,170
Fine, then.

309
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,680
Let me take a good look
at you guys, then.

310
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:11,839
If not, I might not recognize you all

311
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,370
when I wake up.

312
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,960
I'll forget everyone

313
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,890
and everything.

314
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,170
This must be a joke.

315
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:21,440
Shujing.

316
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,720
One day, I'll forget about you.

317
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,080
That won't be.

318
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,311
You'll recover
after taking your medicine.

319
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,200
Trust me.

320
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,200
Alzheimer's disease.

321
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,770
Shen, it's fine.

322
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,560
At our age,

323
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:47,111
we know fully well
what's going to happen.

324
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:48,960
We'll be struck by

325
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,440
all kinds of diseases.

326
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:54,010
Illness and death
will come for us eventually.

327
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:56,770
But...

328
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,170
But I didn't expect it
to be this sudden.

329
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,290
Ding was a capable person.

330
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,490
And now, he has this disease.

331
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,050
Imagine the fact that he might not
recognize his friends and family,

332
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,600
the way home,

333
00:14:12,244 --> 00:14:14,844
and the fact that he can't even
look after himself after this...

334
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,680
That breaks my heart.

335
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,960
Stop imagining things.

336
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,490
I think you're starting
to be pessimistic again.

337
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,440
Different situations
call for different actions.

338
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,680
We could even conquer cancer.

339
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,920
Dementia is nothing.

340
00:14:39,155 --> 00:14:40,977
The medical field
is constantly developing.

341
00:14:42,044 --> 00:14:43,440
I'm sure there's a way to cure it.

342
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,410
Alzheimer's disease.

343
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:49,190
That means his brain
can't function normally, right?

344
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,010
As his friend,

345
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,250
you mustn't grieve too much.

346
00:14:55,488 --> 00:14:57,010
You have to help him out proactively.

347
00:14:57,377 --> 00:14:58,370
Make him use his brain

348
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,490
more often.

349
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:05,920
Lv Yuan.

350
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,370
You're pretty optimistic.

351
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,266
It's good to have you here.

352
00:15:11,688 --> 00:15:13,080
I'm here to save you, you know?

353
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,440
You see, we shouldn't be pessimistic.

354
00:15:17,844 --> 00:15:19,288
It'll cause cancer cells to develop.

355
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,200
We have to stay positive.

356
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:23,010
If so, we can definitely
figure out a way.

357
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:23,770
Don't you agree?

358
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,650
Yes, I do.

359
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,250
We have to stay positive.

360
00:15:28,266 --> 00:15:29,840
We have to persist during tough times.

361
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:40,490
Here.

362
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,730
Have some hot tea.

363
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,320
Shen.

364
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,400
Why don't I make you guys

365
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,210
some chives pockets this weekend?

366
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,640
That sounds great.

367
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,320
Be happy,

368
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,290
okay?

369
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,080
Let's be happy.

370
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,000
Fresh chives pockets are here.

371
00:16:09,022 --> 00:16:09,755
It's so delicious.

372
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,560
I'm so full.

373
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,590
I want to order ten more.

374
00:16:11,644 --> 00:16:12,600
I'll make them for you.

375
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:14,530
Ms. Lv,

376
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,250
please teach me
how to make this next time.

377
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,400
There's a knack to it.

378
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,840
After drying the chives,
beat an egg into it.

379
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,530
Add some dried shrimp and black fungus.

380
00:16:24,688 --> 00:16:26,170
After that, put in some sesame oil.

381
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,800
Fry them.

382
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:29,880
They'll smell delicious.

383
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,044
So, there are dried shrimp inside.

384
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:33,530
No wonder it has an umami taste to it.

385
00:16:33,533 --> 00:16:34,020
That's right.

386
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,400
I've made these in the past as well.

387
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,750
It's just that the crust was too thick.
It was hard to chew.

388
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,822
That's because you didn't
knead the dough properly.

389
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,977
You have to use warm water
to knead your dough.

390
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,010
Keep kneading it while you add water.

391
00:16:44,355 --> 00:16:44,840
Like this.

392
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,160
Ms. Lv, you're amazing indeed.

393
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,930
Of course.

394
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,490
Besides chives pockets,

395
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:51,750
I can make flower rolls,

396
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:52,700
pan-fried dumplings,

397
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,120
and even noodles.

398
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,050
We're so lucky.

399
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:56,730
Yeah.

400
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,640
If you want to learn the recipes,

401
00:16:58,770 --> 00:16:59,970
I'll teach you in the future.

402
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:00,930
That's good.

403
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,600
Alright.

404
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,360
I'm so full. I have
to head to the company.

405
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,290
I can't eat anymore.

406
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,160
I'm too full.

407
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,466
Then the food will go to waste.

408
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,050
Fine. I won't let them go to waste.

409
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:09,940
I'll take them with me.

410
00:17:10,244 --> 00:17:11,577
Are you working overtime again?

411
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,600
See you. Thank you, Ms. Lv.

412
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:13,880
Dad.

413
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,360
Take care.

414
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,980
Bring me a paper cutter
when you come back.

415
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,640
- For our modeling competition.
- Okay.

416
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,210
Thank you, Dad.

417
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,320
What competition?

418
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:19,690
Slowly.

419
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:21,250
It's not a martial arts school.

420
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,733
Why do you need a weapon like that?

421
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:23,930
Ms. Lv,

422
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,530
that's not it.

423
00:17:25,755 --> 00:17:27,133
They're making models for building.

424
00:17:27,355 --> 00:17:28,577
A modeling competition.

425
00:17:28,622 --> 00:17:31,311
International schools like theirs
have plenty of similar events.

426
00:17:31,377 --> 00:17:33,711
Why did Duole enroll
in an international school?

427
00:17:34,111 --> 00:17:35,222
You can ask him that.

428
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,050
My grades are terrible.

429
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,880
If so, you should take tuition classes.

430
00:17:40,222 --> 00:17:41,777
You can't just escape from reality.

431
00:17:41,822 --> 00:17:43,222
You mustn't be afraid of the NCEE.

432
00:17:43,244 --> 00:17:45,733
I would've been gone
had I feared cancer, you know?

433
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:46,770
I wasn't.

434
00:17:46,822 --> 00:17:48,422
Therefore, I was granted
a second chance.

435
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:49,155
Don't you agree?

436
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,450
Duole, you must
learn from your grandfather.

437
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:54,290
He got into a university
even when it was tough back then.

438
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,250
You're living in a blissful era.

439
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,622
Why can't you do the same?

440
00:17:58,666 --> 00:17:59,377
You're right.

441
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,844
I need to learn from Grandpa.

442
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,970
I'll go and study now.

443
00:18:02,022 --> 00:18:03,111
- I'm full.
- Right now?

444
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,840
Just look at them.

445
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,050
Your semester test is nearing.
Show us some good grades.

446
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:06,360
Got it.

447
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,080
Even foreign universities
prioritize grades, you know?

448
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,640
There are plenty
of great local universities.

449
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,050
Why must he get into
a foreign university?

450
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:16,690
Lina,

451
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,770
as parents,

452
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,010
we must ensure
the well-being of our children.

453
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,800
I suggest you watch the news broadcast

454
00:18:23,822 --> 00:18:25,290
and read People's Daily more often.

455
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,111
You have to know about the country's
policy and development direction.

456
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,970
The times when foreign countries
are better than ours

457
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,160
are long gone.

458
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,160
She has a point.

459
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,600
Yeah.

460
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:38,640
Lina!

461
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,970
- Lina!
- It's Mom.

462
00:18:42,911 --> 00:18:44,190
- Lina's mother is here.
- Mom.

463
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:45,690
Lina.

464
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:46,360
Mom.

465
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,800
- My mother is here.
- He's here.

466
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:48,640
Come in.

467
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,010
In-law.

468
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,050
Yes.

469
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,490
Give it to me.

470
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,250
I have to introduce them.

471
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:54,822
This is?

472
00:18:54,844 --> 00:18:55,730
She's Lina's mother.

473
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,309
This is her father. They're my in-laws.

474
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:57,770
Yes.

475
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,800
This is Lv Yuan.

476
00:18:59,244 --> 00:19:00,355
- She's my friend.
- Hello.

477
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:01,770
I'm Sun Baoqin.

478
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:02,530
Nice to meet you.

479
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,450
Nice to meet you.

480
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,080
This is...

481
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:05,690
A fish?

482
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:06,690
My goodness.

483
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,290
This is a huge fish!

484
00:19:08,777 --> 00:19:09,970
- It's still alive.
- Yeah.

485
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,600
Liu just caught it not long ago.

486
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:15,320
With this skill,
you can definitely make a living.

487
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,120
Please give it to me.

488
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,290
It's just my hobby.

489
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,080
A hobby.

490
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,880
What are you guys having?

491
00:19:20,555 --> 00:19:21,490
Great timing. Come here.

492
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,490
You guys are lucky.

493
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,050
Come.

494
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:23,530
Come inside.

495
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,210
Come and join us.

496
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,490
- Hurry.
- Hurry.

497
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,490
Come.

498
00:19:26,577 --> 00:19:27,080
Have a seat.

499
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:28,160
Lina.

500
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,050
- Get us some bowls and chopsticks.
- That's right.

501
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:30,640
Okay.

502
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:31,880
Here, have a seat.

503
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,210
Get them some sauce plates.

504
00:19:34,555 --> 00:19:36,377
- Put them here.
- Here are the chopsticks.

505
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:36,730
Alright.

506
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:37,730
Mom.

507
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:38,800
Try my cooking.

508
00:19:39,822 --> 00:19:40,222
Alright.

509
00:19:40,288 --> 00:19:41,160
Try this.

510
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,010
This is fresh from the pan.

511
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:43,600
Yeah. It's hot.

512
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,250
It's delicious.

513
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,120
It looks extraordinary.

514
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:45,690
Listen.

515
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,111
I can tell that it's extraordinary.

516
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:47,700
That's right.

517
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,080
It smells great.

518
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:49,690
Yeah.

519
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,050
Try it.

520
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:52,450
- It smells great.
- Dad, try it.

521
00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:54,111
It's delicious.

522
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,360
This is so delicious.

523
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,770
If you guys like it,

524
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,800
I'll make more.

525
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,970
I don't want to waste food.

526
00:19:59,355 --> 00:20:00,666
Since there are two more people,

527
00:20:00,688 --> 00:20:02,320
I'll go and knead some dough.

528
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,511
- Yeah.
- Enjoy your meal.

529
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:05,120
Eat up, okay?

530
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,400
I'll assist her.

531
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,160
You must try the fresh ones.
They're even more delicious.

532
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,210
Dad, I should go.

533
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:12,530
No. Keep your parents company.

534
00:20:12,688 --> 00:20:13,160
Sit down.

535
00:20:13,666 --> 00:20:14,266
This is...

536
00:20:14,511 --> 00:20:15,050
This is...

537
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,560
Isn't it delicious?

538
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,450
That woman,

539
00:20:21,177 --> 00:20:22,533
is she just an ordinary friend?

540
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,080
She was when she first came here.

541
00:20:25,177 --> 00:20:27,250
I don't know
if that'll be the case in the future.

542
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,010
Listen.

543
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,050
This madam is amazing.

544
00:20:31,511 --> 00:20:32,320
She's very capable.

545
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,770
The thing is, she's working as well.

546
00:20:35,644 --> 00:20:36,688
You're something else.

547
00:20:37,488 --> 00:20:39,022
What's wrong with your father-in-law?

548
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,250
Is he playing with shuttlecocks now?

549
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,360
Ms. Lv

550
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,050
forces him to do it every day.

551
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,080
Really?

552
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,360
That's good.

553
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:48,640
Shen!

554
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,360
Where are you going?

555
00:20:50,422 --> 00:20:51,080
I'll keep quiet.

556
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:51,640
Shen!

557
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:52,990
Just leave this to us.

558
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,840
- Where is she going?
- Stay out of this. Just finish your food.

559
00:20:55,844 --> 00:20:57,190
- Go back to your seat.
- Alright.

560
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,320
I'll gladly oblige.

561
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,160
I'll be leaving, then.

562
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,770
Okay.

563
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:02,600
My goodness.

564
00:21:02,688 --> 00:21:03,660
Just take a look at this.

565
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,800
How's the taste?

566
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,450
It's delicious.

567
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,450
It's so delicious.

568
00:21:07,488 --> 00:21:09,377
I've never tried something
this delicious before.

569
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,222
Yeah, right?

570
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:10,880
Lina.

571
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,133
Get your father some drinks.

572
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,120
You're right.

573
00:21:15,177 --> 00:21:16,333
You guys should take a sip.

574
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,010
Just a sip.

575
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,530
I don't think this is appropriate.

576
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,250
Why not?

577
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,844
You can drink when you're in my house.

578
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:22,560
Madam.

579
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,530
Do you play shuttlecocks?

580
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,120
Yeah.

581
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
I play shuttlecocks
at Nanhu Park every day.

582
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,450
Really?

583
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:32,690
You see,

584
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,290
I dance at Hanzhong Gate Square

585
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:35,640
every day.

586
00:21:35,866 --> 00:21:37,160
What kind of dance are you into?

587
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,530
Fan dance.

588
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:40,530
That's great.

589
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,888
You're promoting traditional culture.

590
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,160
I hate ballroom dancing.

591
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,530
They look so indecent.

592
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:50,840
They do this.

593
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,222
I don't do that.

594
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,044
That's right.

595
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,640
We have to draw the line.

596
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,600
That's right.

597
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:57,770
Madam, I...

598
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,210
Let me clean this first.

599
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,010
Okay.

600
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:00,770
Okay.

601
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:01,290
Alright?

602
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,010
Wait.

603
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,640
Madam,

604
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:11,690
you see,

605
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,360
I'm collecting water

606
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,490
to flush the toilet.

607
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,880
Water is expensive nowadays.

608
00:22:19,155 --> 00:22:20,050
We have to be frugal

609
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,450
in our daily lives.

610
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,600
We're the same.

611
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:25,088
We come from poor backgrounds.

612
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,530
I understand.

613
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,490
Yeah, you understand me.

614
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,490
This is great.

615
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,970
We're the same!

616
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,050
It's the best!

617
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,450
I'll call you Madam, okay?

618
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:36,250
Sure.

619
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,730
This is great.

620
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,120
This is great.

621
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,080
Why is it leaking?

622
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,933
The faucet is leaking.

623
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:42,730
Liu Debao!

624
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:44,600
Come and check it out.

625
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:45,970
The faucet is leaking.

626
00:22:46,844 --> 00:22:47,400
My goodness.

627
00:22:47,777 --> 00:22:48,880
I can't even eat in peace.

628
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,730
Hurry. The faucet is leaking.

629
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:54,840
Is it nice?

630
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,120
It's great.

631
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,800
Drink it slowly.

632
00:22:57,555 --> 00:22:58,600
Pour him another cup.

633
00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:59,377
What's wrong?

634
00:22:59,377 --> 00:22:59,730
One more?

635
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:00,600
The faucet is leaking.

636
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,720
- Look.
- What's going on?

637
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,010
The faucet is leaking.

638
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,250
- Is it?
- Yeah.

639
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:05,800
It's such a waste.

640
00:23:06,955 --> 00:23:07,450
Take a look.

641
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,360
The hose is loose.

642
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:13,930
Just tighten it. Look.

643
00:23:16,466 --> 00:23:17,222
It stopped leaking.

644
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,400
Lina's father,

645
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,730
you're so skillful.

646
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:23,800
I'm impressed.

647
00:23:23,844 --> 00:23:24,600
No. Don't say that.

648
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,290
Listen.

649
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,010
Liu is an expert when it comes to

650
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:27,930
such situations.

651
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,560
I belong to the working class.
I know how to fix things.

652
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,530
If so, we're the same.

653
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,560
I work in a steel factory.

654
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,970
We both are from the blower factory.

655
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:38,577
That's right.

656
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,400
The sockets from your factory

657
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:41,600
back in the day

658
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,690
were supplied by our factory.

659
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,320
I remember now!

660
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,080
Yeah.

661
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,640
Their factory

662
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,866
has a giant speaker as well.

663
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,360
They played

664
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,330
the same song every day
until work hours were over.

665
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:55,133
How did it go again?

666
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:58,970
♪Power in our workers♪

667
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,210

674
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:21,010
I'm so happy to get to know you.

675
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:21,880
Me too.

676
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,730
- Really?
- Yeah.

677
00:24:23,711 --> 00:24:24,600
You guys should finish

678
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,133
the chives pockets as soon as possible.

679
00:24:26,355 --> 00:24:27,690
Tell me when you guys finish them.

680
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:28,977
I'll make them for you again.

681
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
Madam, look.

682
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,770
You're giving us so much.

683
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,730
I feel embarrassed.

684
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,600
We're a family, you know?

685
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,170
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

686
00:24:36,177 --> 00:24:36,844
Sun!

687
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,730
Straighten your back.

688
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,930
Behave like a man.

689
00:24:40,822 --> 00:24:41,640
Hello, sir, madam.

690
00:24:43,466 --> 00:24:44,290
Sun, that's great.

691
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,490
Goodbye, sir, madam.

692
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,640
Goodbye.

693
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,690
That was great.

694
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,640
Your voice was so powerful.

695
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,840
Madam, you're amazing.

696
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,640
I used to work in
the security department.

697
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,970
I was the leader.

698
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,530
- Really?
- No wonder.

699
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,880
Women are not inferior to men indeed.

700
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,560
That's right.

701
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,080
Madam,

702
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,640
listen.

703
00:25:05,911 --> 00:25:08,177
You should be the female head
of the Shen family.

704
00:25:08,422 --> 00:25:09,488
Don't you agree?

705
00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:10,866
That's right.

706
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,210
I agree.

707
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,160
So,

708
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,050
Madam,

709
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,800
regarding my in-law, Shen,

710
00:25:14,844 --> 00:25:16,266
what do you think about him?

711
00:25:16,577 --> 00:25:17,444
He's good.

712
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,080
He's an excellent man.

713
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,210
It's good when it's good.

714
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,250
It's bad when it's bad.

715
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,490
I never hide my opinions.

716
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:25,730
I see.

717
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,160
This is good.

718
00:25:28,955 --> 00:25:30,160
Do you miss your grandmother?

719
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,010
I do.

720
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,730
If so, tell Grandma

721
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,160
you miss her, okay?

722
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:34,970
Okay.

723
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:36,490
Good girl.

724
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:43,840
Coming.

725
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,400
Hello.

726
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:47,880
Hello.

727
00:25:47,911 --> 00:25:49,066
Who are you looking for?

728
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,930
Is this Professor Shen's house?

729
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,490
Dad, someone's looking for you.

730
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,490
Hello, Mr. Shen.

731
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,930
I'm Lv Yuan's daughter.

732
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,160
You're Xinghuo, right?

733
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,040
- Yes. My daughter.
- She's Ms. Lv's daughter.

734
00:26:01,044 --> 00:26:02,266
We talked on the phone before.

735
00:26:02,266 --> 00:26:03,250
Come inside.

736
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,160
Is this Taotao?

737
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,555
Taotao, let me take a look at you.

738
00:26:06,555 --> 00:26:07,222
Greet Mr. Shen.

739
00:26:07,222 --> 00:26:08,320
Call him Grandpa.

740
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:08,800
Grandpa.

741
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:10,880
Come. Have a seat inside.

742
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,800
Please come inside.

743
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,950
Your mother went out just now.
She'll be back in a second.

744
00:26:13,955 --> 00:26:14,688
Come inside.

745
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,770
Here. Have a seat.

746
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,210
Taotao.

747
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,730
Have a seat.

748
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,160
Mr. Shen,

749
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,210
I heard that you liked calligraphy.

750
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,020
I bought you a set
of calligraphy brushes.

751
00:26:25,022 --> 00:26:26,155
I hope you like them.

752
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,080
Look at you. You didn't need to.

753
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,530
You...

754
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,210
She's so thoughtful.

755
00:26:30,244 --> 00:26:31,290
- Yeah.
- I appreciate it.

756
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:31,970
Thank you.

757
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,400
Have some water.

758
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:33,930
Alright.

759
00:26:35,688 --> 00:26:36,690
Do you want some water?

760
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,010
I have to thank you,

761
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,730
Mr. Shen.

762
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:41,010
Thank you for looking after my mother.

763
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,210
She still has
my contact blocked as of now.

764
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,320
Listen.

765
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,490
If I must say,

766
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:49,160
we should thank your mother instead.

767
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:51,120
This afternoon,

768
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,690
she even made us some chives pockets.

769
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,730
Yeah. We were fighting for them.

770
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,690
Really?

771
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,490
Yeah.

772
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:00,320
Seems like she's having fun
with your family.

773
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,360
I thought
that she would be appeased by now.

774
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,070
That's why I came here
to fetch her back.

775
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,080
She's appeased.

776
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,600
Mothers and daughters
never have any overnight grudges.

777
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,800
She's appeased long ago.

778
00:27:12,822 --> 00:27:14,177
My mother and I do the same thing.

779
00:27:14,222 --> 00:27:15,750
We always argue when we see each other.

780
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,080
You see,

781
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,800
my mother is...

782
00:27:22,088 --> 00:27:23,050
Ms. Lv, you're back.

783
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:23,880
She's back.

784
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,050
Look who's here.

785
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:28,640
Mom.

786
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,800
What are you guys doing here?

787
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,840
Taotao and I are here to pick you up.

788
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,560
Taotao, say something.

789
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,290
Didn't you say you missed Grandma?

790
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,250
Hurry and say something.

791
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,690
Look at this child.

792
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:56,640
Lina.

793
00:27:56,777 --> 00:27:58,600
Bring the child
and let her play over there.

794
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,730
- Play with toys.
- Yes.

795
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,730
Let's go to my room.

796
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,490
My son has bought some building blocks.

797
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,333
Yes. Go and play with them. Go now.

798
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:04,970
Go now.

799
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,880
Let's go and play.

800
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:09,600
You...

801
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,800
I suppose you two haven't
met for a long time, right?

802
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:16,490
Have a chat.

803
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,066
Sit here and have a chat.

804
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,450
Mom.

805
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:38,970
I'm sorry.

806
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:41,320
Please come home with me.

807
00:28:41,866 --> 00:28:43,022
Our family cannot function

808
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,010
without you.

809
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,970
No one is doing the laundry for you.

810
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,600
No one is cooking for you.

811
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,320
Now, you're suffering.

812
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,400
Your days are tough.

813
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,160
Only now,
you're reflecting upon your actions.

814
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,290
Only now, you're practicing
self-criticism, huh?

815
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,930
That's not enough.

816
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,770
Changes above the surface
are superficial.

817
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,080
One will only change
when hardship penetrates the soul.

818
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,290
Mom, I know my fault now.

819
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,600
I'll work hard in the future.

820
00:29:18,155 --> 00:29:19,770
I'll do my best to raise my daughter.

821
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,250
Lv Xinghuo.

822
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,320
Don't make it as if

823
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,450
I'm a traditional-minded person.

824
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,010
I'll support you if you want to remarry.

825
00:29:31,555 --> 00:29:32,930
However, you need to find someone

826
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,250
like Mr. Shen.

827
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,770
He's a decent man

828
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:37,840
with no shady history.

829
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:42,320
We got to know each other
while playing shuttlecocks in the park.

830
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,244
He has a sunny personality.

831
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,010
He strives for improvement too.

832
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,690
But the man you knew?

833
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,970
He wanted to meet you in a bar
right after knowing you.

834
00:29:54,844 --> 00:29:56,080
How could he be a decent man?

835
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,160
An artist is even more unreliable.

836
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:02,490
Back then, your father

837
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,160
got in trouble after playing saxophone

838
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:07,600
on the road on his way back

839
00:30:08,177 --> 00:30:09,777
after purchasing cotton for the factory.

840
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,210
Your ex-husband

841
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,970
cheated on you
because of his dance hobby, right?

842
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,360
There are so many real-life examples

843
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,160
in front of you.

844
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,210
Why aren't you
learning from your lesson?

845
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,160
You were never a good girl

846
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,490
since young.

847
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,250
That's why you ended up like this.

848
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,730
You saw it yourself.

849
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,730
Mr. Shen's entire family,

850
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,577
from the eldest
to the youngest individual,

851
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,010
all heeded my will.

852
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,250
It's easy to lead them.

853
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,640
I'm going to stay here
and help them out.

854
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,066
You should go back.

855
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:52,880
I won't go back.

856
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,800
Just leave.

857
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,730
Did you hear me?

858
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,970
Just leave.

859
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,160
Taotao.

860
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,450
Have an apple.

861
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:23,010
Okay.

862
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:24,450
That's wrong.

863
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,010
You have to take that down.

864
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,840
Taotao is so intelligent.

865
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,000
She could build the blocks
after the design plan.

866
00:31:30,844 --> 00:31:31,977
Right after Taotao was born,

867
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,800
her father cheated on me.

868
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,290
After I got divorced,

869
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,730
I returned to my family

870
00:31:39,866 --> 00:31:40,955
with my child.

871
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,290
Now, my child has grown up.

872
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,640
I've gotten over
my past relationship too.

873
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,880
I wanted to find another partner.

874
00:31:49,177 --> 00:31:51,466
I told my classmates
to recommend some candidates to me.

875
00:31:51,733 --> 00:31:52,930
When my mother found out,

876
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,530
she insisted on asking me
to invite the person to our house

877
00:31:56,888 --> 00:31:58,777
so that she could
keep an eye out for me.

878
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,600
I thought it was inappropriate.

879
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:01,970
But she got angry at me.

880
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:03,840
She kept scolding me.

881
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:05,290
I...

882
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:06,840
I...

883
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,288
I couldn't take it anymore.

884
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,770
I wanted to live outside with Taotao.

885
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,080
My mother said

886
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,970
she would leave instead.

887
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:14,930
And, she did leave.

888
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:18,600
So that's the case.

889
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,730
Every family has its own issues, huh?

890
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:25,730
Actually,

891
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,800
I feel sorry for her too.

892
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,640
When I lived at home,

893
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,880
she was the one taking care of us.

894
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,330
Don't worry.

895
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,720
Xinghuo, don't worry.

896
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,330
Just let your mother live with us

897
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,490
for a few more days.

898
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:44,810
We'll look after her.

899
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,010
How could I?

900
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:49,160
I've been troubling
you guys for so long.

901
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:50,720
Not at all.

902
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,160
Actually, it's because we love

903
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,760
Ms. Lv's chives pockets.

904
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,010
We don't want Ms. Lv to leave.

905
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:57,680
Lina.

906
00:32:59,555 --> 00:33:00,760
Your mother plays shuttlecocks

907
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,600
at Nanhu Park often.

908
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,450
If you and Taotao miss her,

909
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:05,760
you guys can meet her there.

910
00:33:07,022 --> 00:33:07,760
Am I right, Dad?

911
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:09,970
Back then, you and Ms. Lv

912
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:11,977
met each other by coincidence
at Nanhu Park.

913
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:12,760
You see?

914
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,600
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

915
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,370
You guys are too nice to us.

916
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,810
I don't know what to do with my mother.

917
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,810
Don't worry.

918
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:24,330
We'll talk some senses into her.

919
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,160
Lina.

920
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,370
You're speaking like

921
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,720
Ms. Lv now.

922
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:31,850
Yeah.

923
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,240
Goodbye.

924
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:49,720
Take care.

925
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:17,640
Are you still angry at her?

926
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:19,760
I'm not.

927
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,160
Why should I be angry at her?

928
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,490
Did you see that?

929
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,050
Xinghuo

930
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,330
brought us something.

931
00:34:29,355 --> 00:34:31,590
She said she bought
a set of calligraphy brushes for me.

932
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:34,850
Look.

933
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:36,850
These are excellent wolf-hair brushes.

934
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,160
I like them.

935
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,930
She's so sensible.

936
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:42,760
She is.

937
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:49,370
So,

938
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:53,810
you can live here with peace of mind
for the time being.

939
00:34:55,888 --> 00:34:57,933
If there's a conflict
between you and your child,

940
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,266
you can't blame your child
for everything.

941
00:35:00,688 --> 00:35:03,133
You have to reflect upon
your actions as well.

942
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:14,970
Mr. Shen.

943
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:18,288
Mr. An wants to hold a teambuilding
activity with Shide Capital.

944
00:35:18,355 --> 00:35:19,330
It's a bonding activity.

945
00:35:19,377 --> 00:35:21,022
He wanted you to give us some ideas.

946
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,050
Is the due diligence on Ice almost over?

947
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,466
She should be returning soon, right?

948
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:28,970
We need her opinion.

949
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:32,330
Mr. Shen,

950
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,680
the acquisition of Maoli
is already underway.

951
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,410
Why don't we invite Aiden as well?

952
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,930
I don't think

953
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,330
it's appropriate.

954
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,280
The acquisition is in progress.

955
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,511
It hasn't been completed.

956
00:35:45,688 --> 00:35:46,490
Don't invite him.

957
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:49,810
I suggest hiking.

958
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:51,930
If we hike and sweat together,

959
00:35:51,977 --> 00:35:53,490
we can cooperate better in the future.

960
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,050
What about the weak

961
00:35:56,577 --> 00:35:57,890
and the sick of the company?

962
00:35:58,844 --> 00:36:00,530
Are there people like that
in our company?

963
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,410
I'm the only injured one, right?

964
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,330
My waist is better now.

965
00:36:04,555 --> 00:36:05,911
Who are you trying to insult here?

966
00:36:05,911 --> 00:36:07,044
Can you actually hike now?

967
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,890
I can't do it
if the hills are too steep.

968
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,370
I can at least do it
if the hills aren't steep.

969
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:13,970
Alright. We'll organize a hike
for our teambuilding activity.

970
00:36:14,288 --> 00:36:15,222
I'll arrange for it now.

971
00:36:17,711 --> 00:36:19,550
Inquire about Ice's opinion
before proceeding.

972
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:20,490
Alright.

973
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,010
Lv Yuan.

974
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,810
Have some fish.

975
00:36:37,844 --> 00:36:38,240
Yes.

976
00:36:38,266 --> 00:36:38,970
I'll serve myself.

977
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:40,640
Eat up.

978
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:41,850
Have some vinegar.

979
00:36:42,155 --> 00:36:43,488
It softens the blood vessels.

980
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,466
We're out of vinegar.

981
00:36:46,933 --> 00:36:47,530
I'll refill it.

982
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:48,010
I'll do it.

983
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,530
Don't. Both of you, sit down.

984
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,050
I'll do it.

985
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,080
Ms. Lv,

986
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,370
try this Lu's roasted duck
near Shuixi Gate.

987
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,890
It's always packed over there.

988
00:36:59,711 --> 00:37:00,720
Did you waste your time

989
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,010
queuing just to buy a roasted duck?

990
00:37:03,733 --> 00:37:05,311
Don't you have any sense of crisis?

991
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,370
I'm only being honest with you

992
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,280
because we're a family.

993
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,050
Lina, I'm truly anxious on your behalf.

994
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:18,930
You see,

995
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:22,560
my daughter and I
are real-life examples.

996
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:24,530
Betrayal is right around the corner.

997
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,080
It'll come without notice.

998
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,200
You're always busy with your family.

999
00:37:30,822 --> 00:37:33,022
How many national affairs
are you even aware of?

1000
00:37:33,622 --> 00:37:35,080
Do you read the international news?

1001
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,560
Shen Qing is improving

1002
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,010
while you're remaining stagnant.

1003
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,280
Something will crop up eventually.

1004
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,160
What should I do, then?

1005
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,010
I'll tend to the family.

1006
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,533
You should go out and work.

1007
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:04,640
Thank you.

1008
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:05,720
Here.

1009
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:07,080
Sit down and watch some TV.

1010
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,120
Shen.

1011
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,050
So, after spending some time with me,

1012
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:14,720
do you have any opinions on me?

1013
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,450
Opinions?

1014
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,600
I don't have any.

1015
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,080
If so, what's your review of me?

1016
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,120
Am I outstanding,
excellent, or ordinary?

1017
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:34,930
Outstanding,

1018
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:36,280
excellent,

1019
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:37,930
or ordinary?

1020
00:38:40,488 --> 00:38:41,970
I suppose you're outstanding, then.

1021
00:38:42,288 --> 00:38:42,890
Outstanding.

1022
00:38:43,177 --> 00:38:44,155
I'm glad to hear that.

1023
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,600
May we have a pleasant cooperation.

1024
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:27,930
Taotao,

1025
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,120
let's give this bunny

1026
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,120
to Grandma later, okay?

1027
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:31,850
Okay.

1028
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,200
Tell her that we're bringing her home.

1029
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,600
Mom, but why?

1030
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,370
It's because

1031
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,050
Grandma is my mother.

1032
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,890
Mom, Grandma is happy

1033
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,111
when she's not at home.

1034
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:44,330
We're happy too.

1035
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,240
But,

1036
00:39:47,355 --> 00:39:49,810
Grandma can't just live with
Grandpa Shen all the time,

1037
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:50,640
right?

1038
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:52,240
Taotao.

1039
00:39:52,355 --> 00:39:53,300
Greet your grandmother.

1040
00:39:53,888 --> 00:39:54,200
Go now.

1041
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,850
Mom, you should go too.

1042
00:39:55,955 --> 00:39:56,760
You should go first.

1043
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,640
I'll go there later.

1044
00:39:57,777 --> 00:39:58,666
You should go first.

1045
00:39:58,688 --> 00:39:59,810
Mom, come with me.

1046
00:39:59,977 --> 00:40:01,666
What are you guys doing here?

1047
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,010
Grandma, this is the bunny I made.

1048
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,240
Taotao.

1049
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,240
You're still young.

1050
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,844
How could you put on
your mother's nail polish in secret?

1051
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:19,970
Who said you could do that?

1052
00:40:19,977 --> 00:40:21,177
Mom did it for me.

1053
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,200
Even so, that's unacceptable.

1054
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:25,890
How are you a mother?

1055
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,600
You'll lead your child astray.

1056
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,640
It's dangerous for you to do this.

1057
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,955
Those below follow the example
set by those above!

1058
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:36,970
What's wrong?

1059
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:38,490
Mr. Shen.

1060
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:41,080
Taotao.

1061
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,600
Why are you guys arguing

1062
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:46,410
during the encounter?

1063
00:40:46,733 --> 00:40:48,400
You shouldn't do it
in front of the child.

1064
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,160
Taotao.

1065
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,450
Greet me.

1066
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,410
Grandpa Shen.

1067
00:40:52,622 --> 00:40:53,720
Do you want some ice cream?

1068
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,755
They sell ice cream there.

1069
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,970
Let's buy some ice cream.

1070
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,490
Let's go.

1071
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,720
What if you have a stomachache?

1072
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:03,050
Mom, it's hot today.

1073
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,970
It's fine for her
to have ice cream occasionally.

1074
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:06,890
Okay.

1075
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:07,930
If so,

1076
00:41:08,311 --> 00:41:09,530
you can have a tiny one, okay?

1077
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:12,120
Grandma, you're the best.

1078
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:13,890
Look at how sensible she is.

1079
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:22,200
Mom,

1080
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:24,760
I'm here to bring you home.

1081
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:26,050
Bring me home?

1082
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,370
I'll never go back.

1083
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:30,200
At home,

1084
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,890
you guys played along on the surface,
but never followed my orders.

1085
00:41:34,088 --> 00:41:35,050
But in their family,

1086
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:36,890
every family member

1087
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:38,688
waits for me to make their arrangements.

1088
00:41:38,711 --> 00:41:39,844
They're united.

1089
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,177
Do you know something?

1090
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,240
Mr. Shen's evaluation of me

1091
00:41:47,866 --> 00:41:49,311
is that I'm outstanding.

1092
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:50,970
Taotao,

1093
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,640
do you want chocolate ice cream?

1094
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,133
Or do you want strawberry ice cream?

1095
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,600
I want matcha ice cream.

1096
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,450
You're so smart.

1097
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:00,555
I didn't even know
that there's a flavor like that.

1098
00:42:00,555 --> 00:42:01,930
Grandpa Shen, you must learn from me.

1099
00:42:01,933 --> 00:42:02,930
Okay.

1100
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,240
I'll learn from you.

1101
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:08,240
You're so smart.

1102
00:42:11,502 --> 00:42:15,860
(Product Manager, Financial Auditing)

1103
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,530
What's with the weird expression?

1104
00:42:32,822 --> 00:42:34,355
Let me check your phone.

1105
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:36,810
Give it to me.

1106
00:42:55,377 --> 00:42:55,970
Have it back.

1107
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,720
I'll do a spot-check at any time.
