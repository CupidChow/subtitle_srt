00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,040
=Love Again=

2
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,110
=Episode 9=

3
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,110
Su Shi spent his life wandering
without a stable home.

4
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,300
But what's so special about him

5
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,370
that's worth learning from?

6
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,300
Take things as they come,

7
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,020
guys.

8
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,533
Right.

9
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,300
He drank or wrote poems

10
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,980
whenever he felt like it.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,490
He never let anything
hold him back.

12
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,790
Professor Shen is so talented.

13
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:02,020
He has a fascinating soul.

14
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,910
If he were a little younger,

15
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,533
I'd have a crush on him.

16
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,350
You can't be serious.

17
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,190
Young people love...

18
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,980
I'm serious.

19
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,950
"Tune: Prelude to Water."

20
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,070
Right?

21
00:02:13,555 --> 00:02:15,177
You all are familiar with it, right?

22
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,790
Yes.

23
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,580
"How long will the full moon appear?

24
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,820
Wine cup in hand, I ask the sky.

25
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,110
I do not know in the celestial sphere,

26
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,260
what name this festive night goes by?"

27
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:29,860
Excellent.

28
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:35,510
What does that mean?

29
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,260
It means that you all appreciate Su Shi.

30
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:39,910
Young people

31
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,070
have broad minds

32
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,950
and their own unique perspectives.

33
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,790
I have a young friend,

34
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,740
Lian Jin.

35
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,710
He once

36
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:49,670
told me

37
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,670
that Su Shi

38
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,670
was the poet who understood life best.

39
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,270
He explored life as he lived it

40
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,420
and found joy

41
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,540
along the way.

42
00:03:02,822 --> 00:03:04,110
Su Shi traveled to ninety cities

43
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,060
throughout his life.

44
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:09,150
The trace of the path he took

45
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,420
can literarily form

46
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,910
the character "Zhong".

47
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:16,350
As in the name of China.

48
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,620
He spent his life

49
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,420
on the road,

50
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:24,420
optimistic and free-spirited.

51
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,030
I suppose you all know this.

52
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,300
"Better than saddle horse
I like sandals and cane.

53
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,030
Oh, I would fain.

54
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,270
In a straw cloak,
spend my life in mist and rain."

55
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,230
Thank you.

56
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,030
Thank you.

57
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,150
Mr. Shen, can you sign this for me?

58
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,230
Slowly.

59
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:55,860
One at a time.

60
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,977
Mr. Shen, can we take a photo together?

61
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,200
Can we take a photo, Mr. Shen?

62
00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:00,030
All right.

63
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:00,830
Come.

64
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,466
Professor Shen, let's take one together.

65
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,230
Look how popular Mr. Shen is.

66
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:04,670
Right.

67
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,110
Yilian.

68
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:06,940
Lian Jin.

69
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,540
Come.

70
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,200
Let's take a photo together.

71
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,110
Come on.

72
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:12,910
Sure.

73
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,180
Let's all be in it.

74
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:14,830
Can we join?

75
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,710
Of course. Come on.

76
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,711
Let's take one together.

77
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,670
Come.

78
00:04:17,844 --> 00:04:19,230
You should stand in the middle.

79
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:19,710
No.

80
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,180
Come.

81
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,620
Everyone, look here.

82
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,590
Three, two, one, snap.

83
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:29,350
Lian Jin,

84
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,380
I have a few books on Su Shi

85
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,710
on my shelf.

86
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,300
Really?

87
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:35,300
I'll find them for you.

88
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:36,110
You can read them.

89
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:36,710
Sure.

90
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,270
Come.

91
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,590
You'll wear this
at the birthday banquet, okay?

92
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,180
You're so capable.

93
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,910
You really

94
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,740
impressed me.

95
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,670
Scholars like you
really have a knack for words.

96
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,860
Tired?

97
00:05:24,044 --> 00:05:25,180
Let me give you a massage.

98
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,590
I wasn't feeling tired before,

99
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,710
but now you're massaging me,

100
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,470
I feel exhausted.

101
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,300
Stop it.

102
00:05:46,355 --> 00:05:47,266
By the way,

103
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,333
I spoke to a few friends

104
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:50,640
in the editorial department.

105
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,150
Once Lian Jin recovers,

106
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,470
he can intern there.

107
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,940
He'll start with some light work,

108
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,500
like editing and proofreading.

109
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,420
Once he earns money,

110
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:03,066
it'll boost his confidence.

111
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:04,910
I...

112
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,500
I was worrying about this.

113
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,888
You already thought of it for me.

114
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,500
Mothers always focus on

115
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,180
the child's health.

116
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:13,444
Let me tell you this.

117
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:14,470
Boys

118
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,740
need to face the real world.

119
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,620
They need to make friends.

120
00:06:18,844 --> 00:06:19,911
When they have friends,

121
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:20,980
they gain confidence

122
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,350
and become happy.

123
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,311
And when they're happy,

124
00:06:23,311 --> 00:06:24,222
they become healthy.

125
00:06:24,244 --> 00:06:25,030
Don't you think so?

126
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,710
No one has treated me
this well before.

127
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,500
You flattered me.

128
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,590
It's because you're also kind to me.

129
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,740
Zhuoran.

130
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,420
Let's get married.

131
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,030
Careful.

132
00:06:59,590 --> 00:06:59,940
Yilian,

133
00:07:01,511 --> 00:07:02,740
it's my greatest blessing

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,533
that you're willing to marry me.

135
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,900
I can't promise much,

136
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,555
but I can promise I'll be good to you

137
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,470
and Lian Jin.

138
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,350
The three of us

139
00:07:11,977 --> 00:07:13,066
will stick together

140
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,911
and move forward.

141
00:07:19,468 --> 00:07:20,780
I finally have a home.

142
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,950
Why are you crying?

143
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,620
I see tears.

144
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,740
Let me wipe your feet.

145
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,260
Look at you.

146
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:30,660
Come.

147
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,550
Come.

148
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,729
I'll do it.

149
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,940
- Give me the clothes.
- Let me.

150
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,110
Alright. Give me that foot.

151
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,380
- I'll dry it.
- No, I'll do it.

152
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,550
I won't know how to do anything anymore
without you.

153
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,430
That's what I plan.

154
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,066
You won't be able to leave me then.

155
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:46,070
Yes, I won't.

156
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,590
Oh, that's cute.

157
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,310
Zhuoran,

158
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,950
let's try on the coat.

159
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,620
Yes.

160
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,266
It fits, right?

161
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,110
That's good.

162
00:08:04,977 --> 00:08:06,288
Take a step back and look.

163
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,288
What do you think?

164
00:08:09,577 --> 00:08:10,860
Does this old guy look dashing?

165
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,500
Yes.

166
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,260
Let me show you

167
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,950
something cooler.

168
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,133
I can't keep a straight face.

169
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,550
You know,

170
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,860
people have introduced me
to many other men before.

171
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,430
But

172
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,860
it's only different when I'm with you.

173
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,500
I feel so secure.

174
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,070
It's great.

175
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,780
Nice.

176
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,380
I'm lucky.

177
00:09:02,177 --> 00:09:04,088
Look, not only do you treat me well,

178
00:09:04,822 --> 00:09:06,350
but you also take care of my son.

179
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,140
You even helped him find a job.

180
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,430
You know he means everything to me,

181
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,190
and you think of everything

182
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,350
while still respecting my dignity.

183
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,550
Don't think I haven't noticed.

184
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,780
I have.

185
00:09:21,133 --> 00:09:21,860
It's nothing.

186
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,620
Thank you.

187
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,288
Thank you so much.

188
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,110
Once we get married,

189
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:34,950
and from then on,

190
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,380
I'll take care of you.

191
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,500
I'll take great care of you for life.

192
00:09:43,955 --> 00:09:45,111
That deserves recognition.

193
00:09:48,777 --> 00:09:50,430
Once we get married, we're family.

194
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,110
We're one.

195
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:56,911
We won't leave each other.

196
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,110
You know what?

197
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:06,620
Actually,

198
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,350
there's one thing
I haven't dared to tell you.

199
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:12,900
Tell me.

200
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:14,980
I don't want you to overthink it.

201
00:10:15,777 --> 00:10:16,800
What's it about?

202
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,133
I was wondering

203
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,155
if you could transfer this house

204
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,500
to Lian Jin's name.

205
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,550
Lian Jin?

206
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,830
Transfer to his name?

207
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:44,500
Please hear me out.

208
00:10:47,111 --> 00:10:48,980
As you know,
I don't owe anything to anyone

209
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,020
except for Lian Jin.

210
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:55,070
I've taken care of many patients
at work,

211
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,740
but I haven't taken care of my own son.

212
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,500
I always think...

213
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,430
I always think

214
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,620
that if something ever happens to me

215
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,830
and he doesn't have a place to stay,

216
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,430
how could I be at peace?

217
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,620
Yes, I understand.

218
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:13,020
I do.

219
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,260
But

220
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,830
he...

221
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:20,430
Since we're getting married,

222
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,590
adding your name to the deed

223
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,310
is reasonable.

224
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,310
But if we're putting it in Lian Jin's,

225
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,620
can we discuss it first?

226
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,430
Wait. Let me put it this way.

227
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:39,950
I'm saying

228
00:11:41,444 --> 00:11:43,470
that this house is a joint property

229
00:11:43,977 --> 00:11:45,070
between Jingmin and me.

230
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,350
After she's gone,

231
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,020
the children inherit half of it.

232
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,780
If we put Lian Jin's name

233
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,350
on the deed,

234
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,070
I have to talk to them about it first.

235
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:00,780
Right?

236
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:01,590
Right.

237
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,230
Yes.

238
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,860
I know.

239
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:11,980
Actually,

240
00:12:12,911 --> 00:12:14,177
I didn't dare to bring this up

241
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,860
because I was worried about it.

242
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,500
I didn't know

243
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,740
how to say it properly

244
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,550
or if I even should.

245
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:29,140
Well...

246
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,020
He...

247
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,020
Dad.

248
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,470
Where are you going? Off to work?

249
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:27,780
Yes.

250
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,310
- You...
- Dad.

251
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,260
Please hold on.

252
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,900
I have something to tell you.

253
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,660
Is it urgent?
If it's not, we can talk tonight.

254
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,380
Of course, it is.

255
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,500
That's why I came here.

256
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,230
Come.

257
00:13:38,377 --> 00:13:39,230
Sit down, both of you.

258
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,110
Here's the thing.

259
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,740
What's it?

260
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,430
What's it?

261
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,980
Ms. Lian says

262
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,777
she wants to marry me.

263
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,350
That's good news.

264
00:13:58,511 --> 00:13:59,500
We're okay with that.

265
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,260
Ms. Lian

266
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,780
also asked

267
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,380
if I could transfer the property deed

268
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,780
to Lian Jin's name.

269
00:14:16,244 --> 00:14:17,177
What?

270
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:26,830
Dad.

271
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:29,350
Well...

272
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,980
If you and Ms. Lian get married

273
00:14:31,822 --> 00:14:32,590
and add her name

274
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,980
to the deed,

275
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:34,590
we all

276
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,140
can understand that.

277
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,430
Yes.

278
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:41,660
But

279
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,430
if it's Lian Jin,

280
00:14:44,977 --> 00:14:46,555
I don't think it's a good idea.

281
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,980
After all, Mom left this house.

282
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,260
We should

283
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,430
ask Shen Dai's opinion.

284
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,230
Dad,

285
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,740
if the house is transferred to Lian Jin,

286
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,980
that means you'll be staying
at their place.

287
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:03,955
You need to think this through.

288
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,070
Yes.

289
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,310
When she brought this up last night,

290
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:12,980
I was

291
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,740
taken aback.

292
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,950
I never thought she'd ask for that.

293
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,500
I thought everything would go smoothly.

294
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,140
Turns out

295
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,430
there's a huge gap between us.

296
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:39,900
Dad,

297
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,110
about this,

298
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:43,110
our opinions won't change anything.

299
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,550
It's all

300
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,110
up to you.

301
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,830
No rush.

302
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,800
Give it some thought.

303
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,030
Don't make a hasty decision.

304
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,900
I'll discuss it with Shen Dai.

305
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,420
But in the end, it's your decision.

306
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,620
Ms. Lian cares about you,

307
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,550
so maybe it's negotiable.

308
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,750
Dad, think it through.

309
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:18,420
I will.

310
00:16:28,111 --> 00:16:28,800
All right.

311
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,550
I'm heading out.

312
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,620
No need.

313
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:34,590
Sit.

314
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:39,700
Dad,

315
00:16:39,888 --> 00:16:41,420
you really need to think this through.

316
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,420
Right?

317
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,420
What is it?

318
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,750
My mom was right.

319
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,830
Adding her name was already a big deal.

320
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,940
And now, she wants to transfer
the house to her son.

321
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,220
You said my mom was being petty.

322
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,310
She saw this coming.

323
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,690
Ms. Lian has been taking care
of everything in the house.

324
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,790
She helps your dad
with his meals, laundry,

325
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,420
medications, and foot baths.

326
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,600
She must be after something.

327
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,070
She's not a saint.

328
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,510
What did you say?

329
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,700
You mean

330
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,110
they want to change the ownership
of your father-in-law's deed

331
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,110
to her son's name?

332
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,070
There you go.

333
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,700
She's finally showing her true colors.

334
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,420
Lina,

335
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:37,333
wait for me at the Hanzhong Gate Square.

336
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,244
I'll be right there.

337
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:41,140
My goodness.
You're not coming back for dinner?

338
00:17:41,955 --> 00:17:44,355
I'm going to fight the villain.
Dinner isn't important now.

339
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,180
What a scheme she's planned.

340
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,990
One trap

341
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,180
leads to another,

342
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,270
completely tying Mr. Shen down.

343
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,420
A decent woman, huh?

344
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:58,790
Mom,

345
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,860
it was Professor Shen
who invited her home.

346
00:18:02,822 --> 00:18:04,310
Besides, she didn't ask for the house

347
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,830
at first.

348
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,590
Of course.

349
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,070
If she had,

350
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,750
none of this would've happened.

351
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,030
She acted all caring

352
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,110
and loving.

353
00:18:19,244 --> 00:18:20,177
What do we do now?

354
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,711
How do you plan to deal with this?

355
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,420
We tried so hard to avoid trouble,

356
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:28,830
didn't we?

357
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,510
But in the end,

358
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,030
that vixen hit the jackpot.

359
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,140
Now's the time.

360
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:38,510
Liu Lina,

361
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,900
listen carefully.

362
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,270
You're a mother too.

363
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,990
Have some backbone.

364
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,550
Besides, the Shen family
needs to stick together

365
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,420
and protect the house.

366
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,750
The house is meant for Duole.

367
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,990
Of course.

368
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,180
He's the only grandson.

369
00:18:58,222 --> 00:18:59,444
There's no doubt about it.

370
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,750
There's no way
someone else's son gets the house.

371
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,220
Tell Mr. Shen

372
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,288
that he absolutely

373
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:07,830
can't agree to this.

374
00:19:07,977 --> 00:19:10,090
Even if they get married,
he can't give her the house.

375
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,860
He shouldn't even marry her.

376
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:12,790
You...

377
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:25,622
(Listening to the rain under the eaves,
a hint of tomorrow's apricot blossoms.)

378
00:19:25,786 --> 00:19:29,160
(Your lonely shadow whispers
memories of old age.)

379
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,140
Ms. Lian,

380
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,180
you're still here.

381
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:34,900
I'm leaving.

382
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,590
Right away.

383
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,420
Bye.

384
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,350
Take care.

385
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,620
Actually, Ms. Lian has been good to us.

386
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,620
But if the house is in her son's name,

387
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,070
what about us?

388
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,700
What about me?

389
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,830
Right.

390
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,310
But we can't ignore Dad's happiness.

391
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,830
I've figured out

392
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,590
a solution.

393
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,310
Let me know if that's okay.

394
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,180
Go on.

395
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,070
Sell this house

396
00:20:27,088 --> 00:20:28,755
and buy two smaller apartments.

397
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:29,900
One

398
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,110
for Ms. Lian,

399
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,310
and one for you.

400
00:20:33,777 --> 00:20:35,866
So you can have a place to stay
when you come back.

401
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,790
What about Duole?

402
00:20:40,444 --> 00:20:42,270
Duole won't have trouble
finding a house.

403
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,220
What about Dad?

404
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,460
They will still live there.

405
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,070
But after they get married,

406
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,830
they can add Ms. Lian's name
to the deed.

407
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,180
My solution is
for after Dad passes away.

408
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,420
No.

409
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,140
No way.

410
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,350
I think this works.

411
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,830
Qing, impressive.

412
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,590
You always stay silent,

413
00:21:03,644 --> 00:21:05,555
but when you speak up,
you actually help.

414
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:05,955
No way.

415
00:21:05,955 --> 00:21:07,070
This solution is reasonable

416
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,310
and considers everyone.

417
00:21:09,511 --> 00:21:10,600
I give you a thumbs-up.

418
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,140
Qing,

419
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,110
actually, I don't need a house.

420
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,350
Just put Duole's name on the deed.

421
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,420
When I come back,

422
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,550
just make sure

423
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,940
I have a room to stay in.

424
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,310
You're being petty.

425
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,350
Me petty,

426
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,990
and the Shen family are saints?

427
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,140
You might as well

428
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,510
give Ms. Lian the entire house.

429
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:34,550
Lina,

430
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,420
what are you two talking about?

431
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,110
Tell her.

432
00:21:41,355 --> 00:21:42,350
Fine, I'll tell her.

433
00:21:42,422 --> 00:21:43,466
I play the bad cop.

434
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,140
Shen Dai,

435
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,620
Dad's apartment is perfect.

436
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:50,140
Plus, Duole grew up here,

437
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,180
and Mom spent her last days here.

438
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,590
Can you really sell it?

439
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:58,990
Of course not.

440
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,110
Do you have a better solution?

441
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,270
Right, do you?

442
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:04,550
No.

443
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,510
Someone has to make a sacrifice.

444
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,110
There's no perfect solution.

445
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:11,860
Qing is right.

446
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,990
We all have to move forward.

447
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,420
Well, that's settled.

448
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,660
I'll talk to Dad.

449
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,350
Shen Qing.

450
00:22:22,555 --> 00:22:24,222
So you had this idea in your head

451
00:22:24,222 --> 00:22:26,350
from the moment you walked in
until you finished eating,

452
00:22:26,355 --> 00:22:27,620
and you weren't going to tell me?

453
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,180
Half for Ms. Lian

454
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,510
and the other half for Shen Dai?

455
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,070
Do you think Shen Duole

456
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,700
is a burden I brought into this family?

457
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,940
You didn't discuss it with me.

458
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,750
Luckily, Shen Dai has a clear head.

459
00:22:39,311 --> 00:22:40,700
Is it any use discussing it with you?

460
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,900
Do you have a solution?

461
00:22:42,155 --> 00:22:44,130
Whether it is useful is one thing.

462
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,860
But discussing it with me is another.

463
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,977
You didn't respect me.

464
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,550
I... I didn't think it through.

465
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,550
Sorry. I apologize.

466
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,510
Dad's house is right across from us now.

467
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,270
That's a perfect location.

468
00:22:57,955 --> 00:23:00,660
You wouldn't be able to buy one
even if you had the money, you know?

469
00:23:01,244 --> 00:23:02,510
When Duole has kids in the future,

470
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:04,480
it'll be convenient for us
to look after his kids

471
00:23:04,488 --> 00:23:05,266
if he lives near us.

472
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:08,350
The policy allows three kids now.

473
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,830
You won't be sure
where Duole will end up.

474
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,777
Young people travel around
for their ambitions.

475
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,860
You shouldn't tie him to the house
near us.

476
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,940
No way. I like having people around.

477
00:23:17,377 --> 00:23:18,860
It's fine if he goes abroad to study.

478
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:20,688
But if he never comes back,
I can't accept that.

479
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,310
Young people travel around
for their ambitions?

480
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,830
What about their parents?

481
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,270
Living alone

482
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,180
in the house?

483
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,180
You're young and in your prime.

484
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,270
Why are you

485
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,900
worrying about that?

486
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,180
People always

487
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,140
have worries.

488
00:23:37,577 --> 00:23:38,940
How about we have another kid?

489
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,830
We're not young anymore.

490
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,220
Can you still do that?

491
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,460
It's out of your depth now.

492
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:43,860
I...

493
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,030
Look, the boy is here.

494
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,070
Don't talk nonsense.

495
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:47,900
Duole,

496
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,140
tell me.

497
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,830
If we had another child,

498
00:23:51,844 --> 00:23:53,066
would you be fine with that?

499
00:23:53,511 --> 00:23:54,460
Hurry up and have one.

500
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,460
Then you'd stop nagging me.

501
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:57,860
Also,

502
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,590
I don't want that house.

503
00:24:00,644 --> 00:24:02,320
Grandpa can do whatever
he wants with it.

504
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,555
I'm going abroad, anyway.

505
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,070
He's far-sighted.

506
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,140
Shen Duole,

507
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,460
living abroad isn't comfortable.

508
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,750
Food over there is bad.

509
00:24:10,844 --> 00:24:11,733
Look at your Aunt Dai.

510
00:24:11,777 --> 00:24:12,577
She eats leaves

511
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,140
like a goat every day.

512
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:16,860
Listen.

513
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,070
You can study abroad,

514
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:19,990
but you must come back

515
00:24:20,422 --> 00:24:21,380
and live next door.

516
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,420
You have your own space

517
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,660
and are also close to us.

518
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:25,480
That's wonderful.

519
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,620
When you call

520
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:27,270
"Mom",

521
00:24:27,355 --> 00:24:29,000
I'd scan my fingerprint to open the door

522
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:30,180
and cook for you.

523
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,590
What if I marry a foreign girl,
and she cooks for me?

524
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,422
Don't you dare!

525
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,620
Mom, I'm just joking.

526
00:24:36,688 --> 00:24:38,310
Go find one if you want to piss me off.

527
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:38,660
Mom,

528
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:39,860
don't be mad.

529
00:24:40,533 --> 00:24:41,700
Even if I don't come back,

530
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,860
I'll take you overseas.

531
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,700
Take me overseas?

532
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,110
You care about your mom,

533
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,510
but what about mine?

534
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,110
Duole is just saying that.

535
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,790
No matter where he ends up,

536
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,888
you won't be living with him.

537
00:24:53,977 --> 00:24:55,660
You'll be with me.

538
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:58,940
Shen Duole,

539
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:01,700
the five continents, the four oceans...

540
00:25:01,977 --> 00:25:02,940
It's seven continents.

541
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,133
Anyway, where your future wife is from,

542
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,220
the baby must be with your dad and me.

543
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,750
Got it.

544
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,860
It'd be fun
to have a mixed-race grandchild.

545
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,310
Your plan

546
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,110
is pretty good.

547
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,590
You studied finance, after all.

548
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,550
You always think things through

549
00:25:43,177 --> 00:25:44,155
so thoroughly.

550
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,270
Dad,

551
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,900
you discuss it with Ms. Lian

552
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,380
when she's back.

553
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:50,860
If necessary,

554
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,940
we can get a lawyer
to draft an agreement.

555
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:54,590
Yeah, right.

556
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,140
We'd need a lawyer.

557
00:25:59,177 --> 00:26:00,180
Let's get one, then.

558
00:26:00,755 --> 00:26:01,460
Let's get one.

559
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,660
Look at you.

560
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,700
Your apron is dirty.

561
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,180
Say,

562
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,420
this one.

563
00:26:12,888 --> 00:26:16,120
(Jinling Resort for Mr. Shen's birthday)
Take a look at tomorrow's menu.

564
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,940
I'm not wearing my glasses.

565
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,620
No need to check.

566
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,030
You all

567
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,990
decide.

568
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:22,940
I'll listen to you.

569
00:26:24,977 --> 00:26:26,355
I go with whatever you decide.

570
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:27,990
Dad,

571
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,550
a 70-year-old birthday
is a big celebration,

572
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,140
and so is getting married.

573
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,777
Don't have too many concerns.

574
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:36,350
Dai and I just want you to be happy.

575
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,110
Thank you, Qing.

576
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,830
Thank you both.

577
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,030
You're back.

578
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,990
I have something to show you.

579
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:55,550
Look.

580
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,420
Put your things down first.

581
00:26:57,666 --> 00:26:58,333
Put them down.

582
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,844
Come over and look at this.

583
00:27:02,444 --> 00:27:03,270
Walk over here.

584
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:04,180
Keep walking.

585
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:04,660
Go on.

586
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:05,590
Walk on.

587
00:27:08,155 --> 00:27:09,270
It lights up on its own.

588
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,550
I bought it online.

589
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,270
That way,

590
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,270
Lian Jin wouldn't be afraid

591
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,310
if he woke up at night.

592
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,900
You always think of him.

593
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,700
Thank you, Professor Shen.

594
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,700
Put your things down.

595
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:24,750
It's nothing.

596
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,180
What's that smell?

597
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:38,888
- It smells like herbs.
- I prepared it for you.

598
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,990
It's for the foot bath.

599
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,790
This is mugwort.

600
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:43,590
It helps with blood circulation.

601
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,420
I bought it at the pharmacy.

602
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,550
Let's try it now.

603
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,070
No.

604
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,110
No rush.

605
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,355
I have something to tell you.

606
00:27:50,022 --> 00:27:50,660
Sit down first.

607
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:53,860
Come.

608
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,140
Please sit.

609
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,660
Shen Qing came by just now.

610
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,420
It was about

611
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,700
Lian Jin.

612
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,460
Dai and he talked on the phone.

613
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,590
Let me take this first.

614
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,750
It's Ding.

615
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,310
Ding.

616
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,830
Okay. I'm coming down now.

617
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,270
Ding's here,

618
00:28:37,644 --> 00:28:39,140
but security won't let him park.

619
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,700
I'll go talk to them.

620
00:28:41,622 --> 00:28:42,510
It's cold outside.

621
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,620
Put on a coat.

622
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,830
Okay.

623
00:28:46,866 --> 00:28:48,310
I change my shoes at the door.

624
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,070
Okay.

625
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,270
Ding.

626
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:09,990
You're here, Shen.

627
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,420
Why did you come here at this hour?

628
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:12,990
Look at this.

629
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,220
What is this?

630
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,180
Mulberry silk duvet.

631
00:29:20,866 --> 00:29:21,660
Here's the thing.

632
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,380
My wife heard
that you're going to get married,

633
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,350
so she prepared a special gift for you.

634
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,460
Here you go.

635
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:32,220
Oh, right.

636
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,510
Your names are embroidered on it.

637
00:29:36,145 --> 00:29:37,550
(Shen Zhuoran, Lian Yilian)

638
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:40,070
Shen Zhuoran, Lian Yilian.

639
00:29:42,288 --> 00:29:42,990
Nice, right?

640
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,070
Yes, I really appreciate this.

641
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,180
My wife wanted me

642
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,830
to carry this to your banquet tomorrow.

643
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,070
Oh, my.

644
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,140
That's embarrassing.

645
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,220
Right.

646
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,460
So I sent it over to you

647
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,140
tonight.

648
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:58,940
Yes.

649
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,180
This is better.

650
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,830
I'm sure Yilian

651
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,220
will be very happy

652
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,990
when I show her this later.

653
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,750
That'd be great.

654
00:30:08,733 --> 00:30:09,270
By the way,

655
00:30:09,311 --> 00:30:10,355
something happened

656
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,550
between us

657
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,350
these past few days.

658
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,310
What happened?

659
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,510
It's about the house.

660
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:24,380
I saw duck tongues in the cafeteria,
so I packed some.

661
00:30:24,933 --> 00:30:25,900
I bought two servings.

662
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:26,750
Let me try.

663
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,350
Mom,

664
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,180
Mr. Shen's son came by earlier today.

665
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:33,940
Really?

666
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,900
They talked for a long time.

667
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,350
What did they talk about?

668
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:43,860
I don't know.

669
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,460
Anyway,

670
00:30:46,866 --> 00:30:48,111
they seemed pretty happy.

671
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:49,790
Did they?

672
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:51,550
Who was happy?

673
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,900
Mr. Shen

674
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,660
or

675
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,350
both of them?

676
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,070
I think both.

677
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,700
That's nice.

678
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,288
It's good to be happy.

679
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,380
We all should be happy.

680
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,510
Mom, eat this.

681
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,460
Okay.

682
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:13,750
I already ate.

683
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,380
Vitamins are good for you.

684
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:20,488
What do you think of my plan,

685
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,990
Ding?

686
00:31:23,088 --> 00:31:23,900
Isn't it thoughtful?

687
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,180
Wait, no.

688
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,140
Wait, Shen.

689
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,030
That means

690
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,350
after you pass away,

691
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,420
this house will be split
into two properties?

692
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:38,110
Yes.

693
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:42,460
So basically, if you die,
her son gets the house.

694
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,140
That's the idea.

695
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:44,750
Right?

696
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,590
Wait, Shen.

697
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:53,750
So, are they hoping you go sooner

698
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:54,790
or

699
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,460
later?

700
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:02,830
Uh...

701
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,070
I hadn't thought of it that way.

702
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,350
Well, Shen,

703
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,460
you may not like what I'm going to say.

704
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,750
Tough but fair.

705
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:14,700
This...

706
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,790
This isn't the way to handle it.

707
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,550
If you bring this plan up
to Lian Yilian,

708
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,270
and she actually agrees,

709
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,310
your countdown starts right away.

710
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,700
You're right.

711
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,110
What am I supposed to do?

712
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,180
No rush. Be patient.

713
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,220
There's got to be a better way.

714
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,950
Why haven't you left yet?

715
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,510
I'm leaving.

716
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,440
- Hurry up.
- Right away.

717
00:32:47,444 --> 00:32:48,133
He's leaving now.

718
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,220
Sorry about that.

719
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,110
Well,

720
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:53,260
Shen.

721
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,820
Tomorrow is your birthday banquet.

722
00:32:54,911 --> 00:32:55,780
Don't overthink it.

723
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,140
Go to bed early tonight.

724
00:32:57,355 --> 00:32:58,300
As the saying goes,

725
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,950
"Be patient, and things will work out."

726
00:33:02,555 --> 00:33:03,870
Bring the duvet back with you.

727
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,140
I'm leaving.

728
00:33:05,977 --> 00:33:06,844
See you tomorrow.

729
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,030
Bye.

730
00:33:23,108 --> 00:33:24,468
Tough but fair.

731
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:46,620
Mom,

732
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:47,740
about the house,

733
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,430
Shen Qing is talking to his dad.

734
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:50,660
Don't worry.

735
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,910
My father-in-law
didn't agree immediately.

736
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,260
They're figuring things out.

737
00:34:56,622 --> 00:34:58,300
When you see him tomorrow
at the banquet,

738
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,190
you and Dad just act
like you don't know anything.

739
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,430
Do not bring up the house.

740
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,820
All right.

741
00:35:03,822 --> 00:35:05,810
Make sure your father-in-law
doesn't drink too much

742
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,430
and turns it into a wedding banquet.

743
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,220
Got it.

744
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,533
It can only be a birthday banquet.

745
00:35:10,288 --> 00:35:11,088
I'm hanging up.

746
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,030
Who are you on the phone with
this late?

747
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:15,780
Your mother-in-law.

748
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,700
I told me to dress up
beautifully tomorrow

749
00:35:17,755 --> 00:35:19,844
so that your stepmother
can't outshine her.

750
00:35:46,743 --> 00:35:53,150
(Shen Zhuoran, Lian Yilian)

751
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:33,780
Lian Jin.

752
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,430
Mom.

753
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,430
Order a cab now.

754
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,180
I'm ready.

755
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:37,990
It's almost time.

756
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,950
Jinling Resort.

757
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:41,955
Don't get it wrong.

758
00:37:42,488 --> 00:37:44,030
Mom, the car's almost here. Let's go.

759
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:44,990
Okay.

760
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:45,990
I'll go get Mr. Shen.

761
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:46,590
Okay.

762
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,140
Professor Shen.

763
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,510
Coming.

764
00:37:53,177 --> 00:37:54,030
You look sharp.

765
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,260
Let's go.

766
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:56,990
Let's go.

767
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:57,660
Hurry up.

768
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,377
Let's move.

769
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,177
- Okay.
- This foot.

770
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,030
Done.

771
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:11,133
Let's get going.

772
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:11,550
Come.

773
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:12,550
Come.

774
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,340
Some people never want to graduate.

775
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,000
The time they spend in the school
is as long as the school's history.

776
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:22,260
With the aging population growing,

777
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:25,390
the demand for senior education
is rising.

778
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,430
Elderly people are eager to learn.

779
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:30,300
Enrollment in senior colleges
sells out in seconds.

780
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,333
The elderly are charging forward,

781
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:34,888
while young people remain stagnant.

782
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,340
Is the duvet from Ding?

783
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:42,780
Yes.

784
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,070
It looks festive.

785
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,390
Our names are on it.

786
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,180
Right.

787
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,430
He and his wife

788
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,110
are always so thoughtful.

789
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,070
Didn't sleep well last night?

790
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:55,990
You look a bit tired.

791
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,550
I'm fine.

792
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,300
A 68-year-old professor

793
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,180
proposed to a caretaker
making 7,000 a month.

794
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,180
She turned him down.

795
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,340
It's not a good deal.

796
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,300
She's just become free labor.

797
00:39:15,222 --> 00:39:17,590
Some say the professor didn't want
to pay for her service.

798
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,660
The old professor tries
to take advantage of her.

799
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:20,780
No dice.

800
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,340
Others say the caretaker
just wants to be a professor's wife.

801
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,400
Not marrying...

802
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:39,550
Go this way.

803
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,110
Come.

804
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:41,590
Lian Jin, come.

805
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,070
Look, this place is nice.

806
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,140
Lian Jin, come.

807
00:39:47,155 --> 00:39:47,822
Mom.

808
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,910
We must thank Mr. Shen.

809
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,990
He's giving us the house.

810
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,700
Now we have a home.

811
00:39:54,711 --> 00:39:55,688
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

812
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,140
No need.

813
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:58,550
Yilian.

814
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,990
I have something to tell you.

815
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,550
About the house,

816
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,070
Shen Qing and I

817
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,700
discussed it.

818
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:06,950
Go on.

819
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,510
After I pass away,

820
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:12,300
we can sell the house

821
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,070
and buy two small apartments.

822
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:14,910
One is

823
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:16,220
for Shen Dai,

824
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:18,620
and the other one goes to Lian Jin.

825
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,140
What do you think about this?

826
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,470
Shen Dai is overseas.

827
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,070
Shen Qing has a house.

828
00:40:26,155 --> 00:40:27,870
Le will probably go abroad
in the future.

829
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,820
They're doing well.

830
00:40:29,866 --> 00:40:31,260
You don't have to worry about them.

831
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:34,470
But as you can see, Lian Jin is weak.

832
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,870
How could I be at ease

833
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,740
in the future?

834
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,260
Right?

835
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:40,550
Yes, I understand.

836
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,430
Shen Qing said

837
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,180
if you're worried,

838
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,660
we can hire a lawyer

839
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,820
and get it notarized.

840
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:50,140
Lian Jin will have the house
after I pass.

841
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,780
But why do we have to wait until then?

842
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,550
If we transfer it now,

843
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,990
I won't have any burden then.

844
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,110
How could a mother pursue
her own happiness

845
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,820
before securing a future for her child?

846
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:08,888
So

847
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,740
our love is conditional?

848
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:21,180
Have I not done enough for you?

849
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:26,666
I'm taking care of you now,

850
00:41:27,311 --> 00:41:29,070
and in the future,
I'll be sending you off.

851
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:31,950
You're twenty years older than me.

852
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,620
I just want some security.

853
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,030
Can you really bear to see me and my son

854
00:41:37,066 --> 00:41:38,733
have nothing to rely on in the future?

855
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,700
Or do you just not care?

856
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:45,550
But...

857
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,910
If I don't transfer the house

858
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:53,140
to Lian Jin now,

859
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,391
can we continue?

860
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,340
For a woman,

861
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,800
the only concern she can't let go

862
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,470
is her child.

863
00:42:17,311 --> 00:42:18,110
Did you forget

864
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,590
what I asked for from the start?

865
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,870
Just one thing.

866
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,700
I need a home of my own.

867
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:30,430
Yes,

868
00:42:31,044 --> 00:42:31,780
you did say that.

869
00:42:36,266 --> 00:42:37,510
How could I have forgotten it?

870
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:40,430
I...

871
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:43,510
So our relationship

872
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:48,550
comes with the price of a house?

873
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:51,955
Fine.
