00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,960
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,919
It's late. Why haven't you slept yet?

4
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,399
I can't sleep.

5
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,600
Something doesn't make sense to me.

6
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,839
What's it about?

7
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:01,359
I wonder why

8
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:03,279
some people

9
00:02:03,622 --> 00:02:05,311
can sleep so peacefully and comfortably

10
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,880
in someone else's house

11
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,679
while others

12
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,280
don't even

13
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:13,799
have the freedom to light a candle

14
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,040
in the home they grew up in.

15
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,720
I just want to ask.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,519
Where is familial love?
Isn't this ridiculous?

17
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,239
I didn't blow out the candle

18
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:25,919
on purpose.

19
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,040
Ms. Lian has been coughing all night.

20
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,919
She's allergic to this scent.

21
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,199
I'm allergic to the smell
of disinfectant,

22
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,644
but did I complain about anything?

23
00:02:36,644 --> 00:02:38,400
She has turned the house
into a hospital.

24
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:39,280
Is this my home

25
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,479
or her workplace?

26
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,479
Dai.

27
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:53,088
Stop arguing over trivial things.

28
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,120
Dad, I didn't.

29
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,560
I went back shortly after Mom's funeral.

30
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,959
I just want to pay her respect properly.

31
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,320
Your mom is gone.

32
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,120
But I don't feel like she's gone.

33
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,479
She toiled her whole life

34
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,000
for this family.

35
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,679
I don't want you to forget her
so quickly.

36
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,639
I was living with her
for over forty years.

37
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,400
I haven't forgotten her.

38
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:21,600
I know

39
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:24,280
it's hard for you to accept

40
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:26,400
Ms. Lian and me right now.

41
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,639
Tell me.

42
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,239
How am I supposed to live my life
in a way that makes you happy?

43
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,720
I don't know.

44
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:07,600
Good morning.

45
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:10,533
I'll take my blood pressure meds first.

46
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,679
Hold on.

47
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,760
The water is cold.

48
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,359
I boiled some for you.

49
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,960
Here. Mix it in.

50
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:19,679
Come.

51
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:23,400
Here.

52
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,520
Why did you blow out the candle again?

53
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,160
I told you I'm fine.

54
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,119
I didn't.

55
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,799
It went out last night.

56
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,040
I lit it again this morning.

57
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:41,919
You did?

58
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,080
Well,

59
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:45,470
it probably went out on its own.

60
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,720
Don't worry.

61
00:05:55,244 --> 00:05:56,990
You didn't sleep well last night,
did you?

62
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,640
You were up too early
to prepare breakfast.

63
00:05:59,977 --> 00:06:00,670
It's nothing.

64
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:01,479
Listen.

65
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,080
Take the morning off.

66
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,040
I'll prepare breakfast.

67
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,919
No. You don't know how to cook.

68
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,520
You know what?

69
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:10,350
I've been secretly learning

70
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:12,679
these past few days.

71
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:15,400
All right, then.

72
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,511
- Wait for it.
- If so,

73
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,520
I'll give you a chance.

74
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,200
Fix the apron.

75
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:31,239
Come.

76
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,799
You were wearing a mask
all night.

77
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,479
You must be uncomfortable.

78
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,319
It's nothing.

79
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,239
I wear a mask at work
all the time, anyway.

80
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,119
Here's something.

81
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:54,559
I've been thinking

82
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,350
maybe I should go home
for a couple of days.

83
00:06:58,119 --> 00:06:59,679
That way, Dai could have some space

84
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,160
and feel more comfortable at home.

85
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:05,160
I don't agree.

86
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:08,239
Dai is a grown-up.

87
00:07:08,688 --> 00:07:10,555
If someone has to leave, it's her.

88
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,400
This is my house.

89
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:13,960
I call the shots.

90
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:15,439
Really?

91
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,040
Mom,

92
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,999
you own

93
00:07:19,377 --> 00:07:20,520
part of this house too.

94
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,720
Do you agree

95
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,799
with Dad's decision?

96
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:28,720
Dad,

97
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,760
don't bother explaining.

98
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,080
I've been

99
00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:33,840
compromising.

100
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:35,520
Also,

101
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,160
stop taking advantage of Mom
just because she can't argue back.

102
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,479
What are you talking about?

103
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:41,879
You're over thirty.

104
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:43,720
Can you be more sensible?

105
00:07:46,688 --> 00:07:48,688
How much more sensible do I need to be?

106
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:51,840
You...

107
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,160
Calm down.

108
00:07:54,244 --> 00:07:54,960
Don't get upset.

109
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,239
I... I'm not leaving.

110
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,640
Don't get upset.

111
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:03,622
Are you really not leaving?

112
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:05,559
No.

113
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:09,870
Oh, the pot is boiling over.

114
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:10,600
Gosh.

115
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:11,919
I'm staying.

116
00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:13,110
All right. I'm staying.

117
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,640
Dad,

118
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:18,790
what are you doing?

119
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,960
You'll see it later.

120
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:22,200
Lina, you're here.

121
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:23,319
Ms. Lian.

122
00:08:23,911 --> 00:08:25,755
I did so much laundry
after Duole's sports day,

123
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,330
and I don't have enough space
to hang them.

124
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:28,355
Can I dry some of it here?

125
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,319
Of course.

126
00:08:29,355 --> 00:08:30,080
Give me a second.

127
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,999
I'll move my clothes.

128
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:31,840
I got it.

129
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:32,640
No need.

130
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,559
I separate my innerwear and outerwear.

131
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,266
It won't take long.

132
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,959
There you go.

133
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,559
Yilian.

134
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,000
The noodles are ready.

135
00:08:45,355 --> 00:08:46,360
I'll go get chopsticks.

136
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,520
Are these

137
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:50,160
prawns and an egg?

138
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,160
Come on and eat.

139
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,480
Okay.

140
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,439
Go hang your clothes. The rack is clean.

141
00:08:55,599 --> 00:08:56,319
Here, eat.

142
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:58,799
Dad has never made noodles
for anyone before.

143
00:08:58,919 --> 00:08:59,760
Oh, Lina.

144
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:02,040
I'll cook for everyone once I know how.

145
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,880
So beautiful.

146
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,719
Right?

147
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:07,799
Five broccoli florets,

148
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,079
two prawns, and one round egg.

149
00:09:10,177 --> 00:09:12,040
Five-two-zero.
[*A homophone for "I Love You"]

150
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:16,360
A warm stove crackling with sparks,

151
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,719
a bowl of comforting noodles.

152
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,480
How nice. I can't bear to eat it.
It's beautiful.

153
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:26,040
Yilian,

154
00:09:27,022 --> 00:09:28,310
as long as we stick together,

155
00:09:30,022 --> 00:09:31,310
we'll get through everything.

156
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:34,400
Dig in.

157
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:36,520
Actually,

158
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:38,959
I'm not mad

159
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:41,199
at Dai.

160
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,079
My mom passed away early.

161
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:45,590
I know she just misses her mom.

162
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,959
I understand.

163
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,222
All right.

164
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,559
I forgot to turn off the stove.

165
00:09:57,319 --> 00:09:57,839
Come.

166
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,710
When I wake up, the food is ready.

167
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,880
Don't eat yet.

168
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,439
Look at it.

169
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:07,959
Do you get it?

170
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,040
Get what? It's just a bowl of noodles.

171
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:11,160
Hold on.

172
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:11,919
Look.

173
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,480
Five broccoli florets,

174
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,240
two prawns, and one round egg.

175
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,599
Five-two-zero.

176
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,679
Your dad came up with this love noodles.

177
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,799
My dad can cook?

178
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,439
Shen Qing, you're denser

179
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,760
than a seventy-year-old man.

180
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,559
Your dad listens
to every word Ms. Lian says

181
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,079
and treats her gently.

182
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,559
Why can't you learn from him?

183
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,799
Do you need

184
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,000
someone younger

185
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,599
to motivate you?

186
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,977
How exactly should I learn?

187
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,719
Should I make you
a "Forever Love Noodles",

188
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,949
quit my job,

189
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,120
do anything you want me to do,

190
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,444
and listen to everything you say?

191
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,000
You think this is a soap opera?

192
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:53,360
Go get some vinegar. Quick.

193
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:56,079
Yes, Mr. Shen.

194
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:46,360
Shen Dai.

195
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,559
It's you.

196
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,719
Liang.

197
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,439
I heard you were back.

198
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,160
I wanted to call you.

199
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:01,400
I didn't expect

200
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,710
to run into you here.

201
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,040
Right.

202
00:12:06,555 --> 00:12:07,600
What a coincidence.

203
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,070
How have you been?

204
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,240
I'm good.

205
00:12:12,622 --> 00:12:13,822
What about you?

206
00:12:16,555 --> 00:12:17,577
I got divorced.

207
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:19,400
She moved to Australia with the kid.

208
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,800
That's good.

209
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,079
You're free now.

210
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:33,959
Dai.

211
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,400
I've always

212
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,120
owed you an apology...

213
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,199
Sorry, Liang.

214
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,959
I have plans later.

215
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,319
The past is the past.

216
00:12:43,488 --> 00:12:44,400
Let's not bring it up.

217
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,360
My number hasn't changed.

218
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:49,733
We can keep in touch on WeChat.

219
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,520
You're sick.

220
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:26,199
I made you some carp soup.

221
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:28,559
I was going to leave it with security.

222
00:13:28,977 --> 00:13:30,355
Why did you come down yourself?

223
00:13:31,599 --> 00:13:32,559
I wanted to see you.

224
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:35,400
Take it.

225
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:52,919
Wait.

226
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,190
Do you really think Liang
falls head over heels for you?

227
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,559
He's crouching at home like a coward.

228
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm telling you,

229
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,240
we have loads of chicken soup
and shark fin at home.

230
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,400
We don't need your fish soup.

231
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,679
Take it back.

232
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,040
A professor's daughter, huh?

233
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:09,280
Let me tell you.

234
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:10,280
From now on,

235
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:11,880
behave yourself.

236
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:48,799
Hurry up.

237
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,777
Give me a hand.

238
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,000
This is huge.

239
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:53,160
A big fish.

240
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,430
You're really something, Liu.

241
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:55,919
Well done.

242
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:57,880
Pass me the bag.

243
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,910
Put it in the bag.

244
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,280
Very good.

245
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,050
This is a big fish.

246
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,679
It's not easy.

247
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:03,410
You've got skills.

248
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:07,120
Baoqin,

249
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:09,760
I caught a huge grass carp.

250
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:11,360
That's perfect.

251
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,360
Take it

252
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,040
to our in-law.

253
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:16,000
Since Dai is back,

254
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,799
it's a nice gesture from Lina.

255
00:15:18,719 --> 00:15:19,120
All right.

256
00:15:27,755 --> 00:15:30,160
"Watching people fishing is more fun
than fishing itself.

257
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,760
Growing plants brings more joy
than simply admiring them."

258
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:36,640
This is a couplet

259
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,280
in Sir Ye Shengtao's home.

260
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,719
It's interesting,

261
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,240
so I wrote it.

262
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:44,199
You're knowledgeable.

263
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,719
I guess Sir Ye must be amazing.

264
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:47,520
Of course.

265
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:50,360
He was a great scholar.

266
00:15:52,222 --> 00:15:53,070
Don't you know him?

267
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,040
I'm not that well-educated.

268
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:56,480
It's kind of embarrassing.

269
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,439
Don't say that.

270
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,919
There are all kinds of experts
in every field.

271
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,959
I just read a lot of literature.

272
00:16:05,155 --> 00:16:05,950
But you have read

273
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:08,480
way more medical books than I have.

274
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,844
I just know how to give jabs
and prescribe medicine.

275
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:13,288
That's already enough

276
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:14,919
to take great care of me.

277
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,480
Jiang,

278
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,199
I went to the exhibition

279
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,160
you mentioned.

280
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:27,559
But I didn't see

281
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,599
Calder's artwork.

282
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,360
Most of the exhibits there
were just filler.

283
00:16:31,755 --> 00:16:32,866
Are you trying to fool me?

284
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,199
And another thing.

285
00:16:34,422 --> 00:16:35,777
Did you recommend this exhibition

286
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,360
to a bunch of other companies

287
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,240
before coming to me?

288
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:39,790
What do you take me for?

289
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,559
A garbage collector?

290
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,959
Let me tell you this.

291
00:16:44,022 --> 00:16:46,710
My principle is I'd rather have nothing
than settle for mediocrity.

292
00:16:46,888 --> 00:16:48,240
If it's not good enough, I quit.

293
00:17:02,377 --> 00:17:03,511
Someone's at the door.

294
00:17:03,599 --> 00:17:04,399
Go open it.

295
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:04,960
Okay.

296
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,799
Who's it?

297
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:11,920
It's Lina's dad.

298
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,599
Ms. Lian.

299
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:13,839
Come on in.

300
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,440
Do you have a big basin?

301
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,680
What kind do you need?

302
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:18,319
Hold on.

303
00:17:18,511 --> 00:17:19,400
Lina should have it.

304
00:17:19,879 --> 00:17:20,440
Lina.

305
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,240
She has one.

306
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:22,159
Lina.

307
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,760
Come.

308
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,240
Dad,

309
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:26,480
what are you doing here?

310
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,311
Bring me a big basin.

311
00:17:27,622 --> 00:17:28,200
A big basin.

312
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,680
Come on in.

313
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,200
To put a fish?

314
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,440
Okay.

315
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,000
It's fine. Take off your boots inside.

316
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,890
No, I'll do it outside.

317
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:32,830
It's dirty.

318
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,520
Professor Shen,

319
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:36,159
Lina's dad is here.

320
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:37,480
He brought us a fish.

321
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,280
You're here, Mr. Liu.

322
00:17:40,511 --> 00:17:41,920
Come in. Please come to my study.

323
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:42,879
Look at this.

324
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,359
A big grass carp.

325
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,960
Three kilograms.

326
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,040
It's wild.

327
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:49,119
Lina's mom said

328
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,559
Shen Dai is back

329
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:53,280
and thought it'd be good for her health.

330
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:54,960
You can't

331
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,879
get this kind of big grass carp
anywhere else.

332
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,280
- Thank you, Mr. Liu.
- This is nice.

333
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:00,177
I don't eat fish.

334
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,240
Fish soup with tofu

335
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,480
is delicious and fresh.

336
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,960
Look at this fish. It's big.

337
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,159
Water is splashing everywhere.

338
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:10,280
Don't touch it.

339
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,720
I'll do it.

340
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,680
Hands off.

341
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,440
The fins are sharp.

342
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,920
You might cut yourself.

343
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,480
I'll do it.

344
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,440
Careful.

345
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,839
Ms. Lian, wild fish

346
00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:19,559
sure are strong.

347
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:20,879
Dai,

348
00:18:20,955 --> 00:18:21,790
you should eat this.

349
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,359
It's not easy to catch
a grass carp this big.

350
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,280
I told you I don't eat fish,

351
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,720
especially not wild fish.

352
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,960
Dad, Shen Dai doesn't eat fish.

353
00:18:34,088 --> 00:18:35,890
You shouldn't have sent it here.
Take it back.

354
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,680
If she doesn't eat fish, you eat it.

355
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:39,799
Right, we'll eat it.

356
00:18:39,822 --> 00:18:41,266
- I'll cook it up.
- Give it to me.

357
00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:43,920
Mr. Liu,

358
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,000
please have a seat.

359
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,399
Sorry about the mess on the floor.

360
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,319
It's fine. Just a quick mop will do.

361
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,079
Please have a seat.

362
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:52,480
You're amazing.

363
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,000
It's hard to find

364
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,200
a big fish like this at the market.

365
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:57,760
Exactly.

366
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,920
You caught it yourself.

367
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:01,520
I may not be good at much,

368
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,079
but I'm an expert at fishing.

369
00:19:03,622 --> 00:19:06,390
Check the sky when you head out.
Observe the water when you fish.

370
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,733
But you don't observe how people react
when you give the fish.

371
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,559
Uh...

372
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:12,720
I didn't know

373
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,599
fishing was so technical.

374
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:16,599
Right.

375
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,359
I can tell what kind of fish is

376
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,399
in different waters

377
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:20,760
with just a glance.

378
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,799
Not many people know that.

379
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:24,559
They stare at the bobber all day.

380
00:19:24,644 --> 00:19:27,190
When they turn away for a sip of water,
the fish takes the bait.

381
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,760
I drink or space out
when I feel like it,

382
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:31,639
and the fish still bite.

383
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,599
That's great. Fresh air and healthy.

384
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:37,280
Take Professor Shen with you
when you go fishing next time.

385
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:37,799
Okay?

386
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:38,559
Professor Shen,

387
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,599
right?

388
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,440
What's it?

389
00:19:41,111 --> 00:19:42,630
She's saying we can go fishing together

390
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:43,839
next time.

391
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,079
Oh, yes.

392
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,760
Let me know

393
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,720
the time and place.

394
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,799
Let's go together.

395
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,760
That's a deal.

396
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,559
Deal.

397
00:19:53,711 --> 00:19:55,111
Let's add each other on WeChat.

398
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,760
WeChat?

399
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:56,119
Yes.

400
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:59,159
Let me know when you want to fish.

401
00:19:59,159 --> 00:19:59,639
All right.

402
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:01,040
Okay, this one.

403
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,480
All right.

404
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:04,639
Good.

405
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:05,960
Old Fisherman, right?

406
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,879
Yes, that's me.

407
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,119
Ms. Lian really puts up with a lot.

408
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,520
She's a head nurse,

409
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,688
yet she's mistreated here.

410
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:15,440
I know, right?

411
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:17,799
Shen Dai acts like she swallows a bomb.

412
00:20:17,955 --> 00:20:19,720
She's been giving Ms. Lian a hard time.

413
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:22,200
Dad, you shouldn't have
brought the fish here.

414
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,359
Shen Dai hates fish.

415
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,440
You know that.

416
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,359
Well, now I do.

417
00:20:25,977 --> 00:20:27,480
Forget it. What's done is done.

418
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,511
If she won't eat, we will.

419
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,720
By the way, Dad, take this money.

420
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:32,040
Don't let Mom know.

421
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:33,960
Why are you giving me money?

422
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,790
You need it yourself.

423
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,559
No, I don't.

424
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,599
It's not much.

425
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:39,720
Didn't you want to meet up
with your fishing buddies?

426
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,000
Your mom won't let me.

427
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:41,680
Why not?

428
00:20:42,222 --> 00:20:43,969
If I go, I'll have to treat them
to a meal.

429
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:44,520
If I don't go,

430
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:45,830
I don't have to pay for anything.

431
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,319
Just ignore her.

432
00:20:48,466 --> 00:20:50,720
She spends all day with those
square-dancing ladies,

433
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,399
going on farm trips and day trips.

434
00:20:52,444 --> 00:20:54,355
And you're the one
who can't spend money.

435
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,720
The tour package is
from a wellness company.

436
00:20:57,159 --> 00:20:59,359
99 yuan for a two-day trip to Yangzhou.

437
00:21:01,377 --> 00:21:02,920
I got to go. Bye.

438
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,399
No need to see me off.

439
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:06,960
Don't squeeze onto a bus.

440
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
The bus is crowded today.

441
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,920
I'll call a cab for you.

442
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:09,839
Don't do that.

443
00:21:09,844 --> 00:21:11,422
It's a waste of money. Don't do that.

444
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,110
Go back.

445
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:13,920
I'm off.

446
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,799
Dad, take care.

447
00:21:48,244 --> 00:21:50,044
Shen Qing, is your sister
out of her mind?

448
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,960
What again?

449
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,520
My dad is old.

450
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,300
He traveled all the way
and took multiple buses

451
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,288
just to bring her a fish.

452
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:58,399
She gave him the cold shoulder.

453
00:21:58,799 --> 00:21:59,960
What an educated family.

454
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,159
She's disrespectful.

455
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,159
Ms. Lian was helping a lot.

456
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:07,319
She went overboard.

457
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,720
If she doesn't want it, I will.

458
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,444
Thank you for your dad.

459
00:22:11,822 --> 00:22:12,390
Oh, right.

460
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,599
His fishing rod

461
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:16,520
is worn out, right?

462
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:18,159
Let's get him a new one,

463
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,200
okay?

464
00:22:20,044 --> 00:22:22,319
I'm in the middle of a meeting.
We'll talk when I get home.

465
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:23,960
Bye.

466
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,399
Mr. Shen.

467
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,680
My dad goes fishing too.

468
00:22:29,822 --> 00:22:31,422
I'll recommend a store for you.

469
00:22:31,844 --> 00:22:33,666
Were you eavesdropping on my phone call?

470
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:35,960
Send me the link.

471
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,280
Okay.

472
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:37,799
Where were we?

473
00:22:38,288 --> 00:22:40,177
Mr. Shen, I've compared
the data with Shide.

474
00:22:40,177 --> 00:22:40,960
Everything is fine.

475
00:22:41,755 --> 00:22:42,680
Oh, one more thing.

476
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,559
Aida from Shide Capital,
who's been working with us,

477
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:46,240
is leaving.

478
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,639
The new project manager is Ashley.

479
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,309
Aida is leaving?

480
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,030
Should we take her out
for a farewell meal?

481
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:52,839
Of course.

482
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:55,119
She's helped us a lot. Arrange it.

483
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:55,599
Okay.

484
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,870
I'll make sure it's a good meal.

485
00:23:00,644 --> 00:23:01,888
Duole, have another bowl.

486
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:05,920
How is it?

487
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:08,240
It's fresh.

488
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,760
This fish soup is so fresh.

489
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,359
Your cooking is amazing, Ms. Lian.

490
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,680
Your grandfather caught a great fish.

491
00:23:17,244 --> 00:23:20,040
The fish is great, but it needs
the right chef to bring out its flavor.

492
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,119
It's delicious.

493
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,960
Have more if you like it.

494
00:23:23,044 --> 00:23:24,044
Duole, have another bowl.

495
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,040
Ms. Lian,

496
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,359
handling a fish this big

497
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:29,240
is not easy.

498
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:31,399
It takes me forever.

499
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:34,200
But you fixed it up in no time.

500
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:34,960
Impressive.

501
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,480
I'm a professional cook.

502
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:37,680
Right.

503
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,559
A pro at giving jabs.

504
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,119
Aunt Dai, won't you try some?

505
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,720
It's a shame to miss this delicacy.

506
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,720
A fish lost its life

507
00:23:50,088 --> 00:23:51,070
just for fish soup.

508
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:53,440
No desire

509
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:54,920
will bring no harm.

510
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:55,960
Aunt Dai,

511
00:23:56,222 --> 00:23:57,550
you're eating Gailan, aren't you?

512
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:58,559
It has life too.

513
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:00,520
You know nothing.

514
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:02,680
Did the fish pass a safety inspection?

515
00:24:02,911 --> 00:24:04,800
What if it has heavy
metal contamination?

516
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:07,760
Metal contamination? Funny.

517
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:08,799
Dai,

518
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:10,159
Lina's dad

519
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,119
traveled all the way to bring this fish.

520
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,319
It's a nice gesture from him.

521
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:14,799
Why not try some?

522
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,520
Why should I?

523
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,839
Besides,

524
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,680
my attitude is my stance.

525
00:24:20,844 --> 00:24:22,140
If I pretend to enjoy it and say,

526
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,079
"This fish soup is tasty and fresh."

527
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,319
Then, he'll keep fishing
and bringing me more.

528
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,559
That makes things worse.

529
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,399
Okay?

530
00:24:28,639 --> 00:24:30,040
Fine, eat your leaves.

531
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,079
Lina.

532
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,960
Lina, don't mind her.

533
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,789
Ms. Lian isn't mad, but I am.

534
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,466
Your sister is really something else.

535
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,159
You're her sister-in-law.
Show some patience.

536
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:43,559
Is this a charity home?

537
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,920
Why must I be patient here?

538
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,639
That's enough.

539
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,079
Fine, I'll go.

540
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,799
You're generous and forgetful.

541
00:24:49,844 --> 00:24:51,444
Stay here and eat your fish soup.

542
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,680
Also, enjoy the laughter
of the newcomer.

543
00:24:55,639 --> 00:24:56,559
She's at it again.

544
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,119
What's gotten into you?

545
00:24:58,879 --> 00:25:01,000
Shen Qing, this family is so dramatic.

546
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:07,079
Why? Did you bump into the door?

547
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:16,630
So another drama now?

548
00:25:16,639 --> 00:25:17,720
Aunt Dai is mad again.

549
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,319
Come and sit down.

550
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:21,720
Calm down.

551
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,599
Eat some heavy metals.

552
00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:24,159
Here.

553
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,639
I need some of that, Dad.

554
00:25:26,639 --> 00:25:28,680
I feel like something's off with Dai.

555
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,760
Of course, she is.

556
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,800
She wouldn't say things like that
if she were fine.

557
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,440
Shen Dai.

558
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:36,200
What's wrong with her?

559
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,799
Why is she calling you?

560
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:38,480
Hello?

561
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:39,760
What now?

562
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,159
Stomachache?

563
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,960
She's moaning.

564
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,755
I noticed she wasn't well...

565
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:48,589
Shen Dai.

566
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,740
- Does she need to go to the bathroom?
- Are you okay?

567
00:25:50,755 --> 00:25:51,244
Shen Dai.

568
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,280
Answer me.

569
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,319
Open the door.

570
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:55,879
Shen Dai, what's the passcode?

571
00:25:56,377 --> 00:25:57,711
She's not responding.

572
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,240
Hey, Shen Dai!

573
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,240
Try her birthday.

574
00:26:01,319 --> 00:26:02,599
0806.

575
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:04,720
It's wrong.

576
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,311
- Try Grandma's birthday.
- Right.

577
00:26:06,879 --> 00:26:07,319
08...

578
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:09,399
Still wrong.

579
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:10,480
Professor Shen's birthday.

580
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:13,920
That worked.

581
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:14,520
Quick.

582
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,000
Shen Dai, what's wrong?

583
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Shen Qing, check on her.

584
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,755
Are you okay, Dai?

585
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,399
Quick. I think
we need to call an ambulance.

586
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,639
Give me the phone.

587
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:21,960
Lina,

588
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:24,040
pack some things for the hospital.

589
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:24,680
Okay.

590
00:26:24,888 --> 00:26:25,200
Got it.

591
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:25,760
Dai.

592
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,830
Shen Dai, hang in there.

593
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:28,200
Tell me, what's wrong?

594
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,040
Can you talk?

595
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,022
Is this the ambulance?

596
00:26:30,044 --> 00:26:30,955
Tell me what's wrong.

597
00:26:30,977 --> 00:26:31,955
We have a patient here.

598
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,488
Is it here?

599
00:26:32,555 --> 00:26:33,520
She has a stomach ache.

600
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:33,839
Where?

601
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:34,688
She's in great pain.

602
00:26:34,711 --> 00:26:35,177
Here.

603
00:26:35,879 --> 00:26:36,839
- Don't worry.
- Quick.

604
00:26:36,879 --> 00:26:37,879
What's going on?

605
00:26:37,879 --> 00:26:38,440
Stay calm.

606
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,520
Bring the Speedy
Heart-Saving Pills along.

607
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,000
Let's go to the hospital later, okay?

608
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:42,920
Okay.

609
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,920
Head downstairs to meet the ambulance.

610
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:46,533
They might have trouble finding us.

611
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:48,070
Tell them to bring the stretcher up.

612
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:48,960
Okay.

613
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,550
Let me talk to them.

614
00:26:50,555 --> 00:26:51,111
Go ahead.

615
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,359
Hello.

616
00:26:53,222 --> 00:26:54,390
The patient is conscious.

617
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,600
Her lower abdomen is in pain.

618
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,088
Yes. No hard lumps were detected.

619
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,399
Bring the stretcher up.

620
00:26:58,399 --> 00:26:59,079
We live upstairs.

621
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,560
(Drum Tower Hospital)

622
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:05,319
Does it hurt here?

623
00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:07,839
Did the pain come suddenly?

624
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:11,159
Did you eat anything

625
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:12,040
unclean?

626
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:13,920
No.

627
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:17,079
Vegetable salad.

628
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,079
Raw.

629
00:27:18,822 --> 00:27:20,070
Could it be pesticide residue?

630
00:27:24,488 --> 00:27:26,040
Have you ever had an abortion?

631
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:30,960
Sir,

632
00:27:31,288 --> 00:27:33,190
does that have anything to do
with her condition?

633
00:27:33,639 --> 00:27:35,359
Maybe we should wait outside.

634
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,520
She's uncomfortable

635
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,839
if we crowd around her.

636
00:27:39,088 --> 00:27:40,177
There's a doctor here.

637
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,319
Don't worry.

638
00:27:43,422 --> 00:27:44,311
Don't press on it.

639
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:46,370
Do you feel better after the IV drip?

640
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,440
Please take care of her.

641
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:47,977
No problem.

642
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,280
Let me see.

643
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,559
Don't worry.

644
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:55,559
(Emergency Room)

645
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:56,720
I noticed

646
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,159
she had lower abdominal pain.

647
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,879
It could be gynecological

648
00:27:59,879 --> 00:28:01,559
or intestinal issues.

649
00:28:01,733 --> 00:28:03,311
Let's wait for the doctor's diagnosis.

650
00:28:03,577 --> 00:28:05,088
It's nothing serious. Don't worry.

651
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,839
Could it be a complication
from a miscarriage?

652
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,240
How would I know?

653
00:28:15,639 --> 00:28:16,079
Ms. Lian,

654
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:18,159
the results are out.

655
00:28:18,733 --> 00:28:20,550
The patient has
a ruptured chocolate cyst

656
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,040
and a sudden drop in potassium,

657
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,920
which caused abdominal pain
and fainting.

658
00:28:24,879 --> 00:28:25,480
No wonder.

659
00:28:26,119 --> 00:28:27,159
How serious is it?

660
00:28:27,266 --> 00:28:29,190
We need to perform
a minimally invasive surgery.

661
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,760
Due to her ruptured cyst,

662
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:33,040
fluid has spread into
the abdominopelvic cavity,

663
00:28:33,066 --> 00:28:34,311
triggering acute abdominal pain.

664
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,200
Her condition could also

665
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,559
lead to endometriosis.

666
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:40,920
But don't worry too much.

667
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,879
It's not a severe case.

668
00:28:43,577 --> 00:28:45,310
You can proceed
with the hospital admission.

669
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,319
All right. Thank you.

670
00:28:47,666 --> 00:28:48,520
Don't be so courteous.

671
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,711
Let me know if you have any problems.
I have to go now.

672
00:28:50,711 --> 00:28:51,777
Sorry for the trouble.

673
00:28:51,777 --> 00:28:52,310
Thank you.

674
00:28:52,422 --> 00:28:53,000
You're welcome.

675
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:54,639
Go take care of the admission.

676
00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:55,520
Okay.

677
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,066
Over there.

678
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:56,399
Okay.

679
00:28:56,879 --> 00:28:57,359
Turn left.

680
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,079
All right.

681
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,720
Keep this.

682
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:02,599
First, it was your dad,

683
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:03,399
now your sister.

684
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:05,280
Your family could film
"The Story in ER".

685
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,520
If that's the case,
you must be the heroine.

686
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,680
I don't deserve that.

687
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,359
Ms. Lian is the lead.

688
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,390
I think hospitals have a strange power
to make people enlighten.

689
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,520
When your dad was hospitalized,
he suddenly came around

690
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,159
and started seeing the head nurse.

691
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:22,480
Ms. Lian helped a lot this time.

692
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,040
Will your sister call a truce?

693
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,159
Hope so.

694
00:29:28,111 --> 00:29:29,200
The paperwork is done.

695
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:29,755
Very good.

696
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:30,720
It's done?

697
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,159
Yes.

698
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:31,440
Dad.

699
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:32,520
Dai,

700
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,266
do you feel better after the medication?

701
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:35,311
Much better.

702
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:36,799
The pain isn't as bad.

703
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,000
You scared us all.

704
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:40,466
The doctor says it's not serious.

705
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:46,520
You feel better, right?

706
00:29:50,933 --> 00:29:52,200
Mind your own business.

707
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,319
You...

708
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,960
You're a thankless wretch.

709
00:29:58,839 --> 00:29:59,879
I'm a thankless wretch?

710
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,520
Then what are you?

711
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,866
How can you talk to Dad like that?

712
00:30:02,911 --> 00:30:03,444
Look at her.

713
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,520
Behave.

714
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,559
Dad.

715
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,079
Lie down.

716
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,599
I'm an ingrate to you.

717
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:10,359
Right?

718
00:30:10,533 --> 00:30:11,920
I'm the dad of a thankless wretch.

719
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,240
You said it yourself.

720
00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:14,280
Dai, stop it.

721
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,599
Listen to what she's saying.

722
00:30:15,622 --> 00:30:16,600
She's not feeling well.

723
00:30:16,639 --> 00:30:17,680
Listen to her.

724
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,319
Dad!

725
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:19,440
That's enough.

726
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:20,920
Don't move.

727
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,079
You have a ruptured cyst.

728
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:23,839
Don't yell.

729
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,480
Go.

730
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:25,879
(Emergency Room)
How could you be rude to Dad?

731
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,644
This is a hospital.

732
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:27,960
Shen Dai.

733
00:30:28,311 --> 00:30:29,070
Don't be nervous.

734
00:30:29,311 --> 00:30:30,960
This is a fully anesthetized procedure.

735
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,760
You won't feel anything

736
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,000
during the whole process.

737
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,399
Let's begin.

738
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:39,040
Relax.

739
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,359
The bleeding is heavier.

740
00:30:44,088 --> 00:30:45,488
Let me know if anything's wrong.

741
00:30:47,244 --> 00:30:48,688
Tell her family about her condition.

742
00:30:48,688 --> 00:30:49,150
All right.

743
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,799
Are you feeling nauseous?

744
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,079
No.

745
00:30:56,533 --> 00:30:57,550
I didn't see her family.

746
00:31:03,879 --> 00:31:04,359
Shen Dai,

747
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,399
your endometriosis

748
00:31:06,888 --> 00:31:08,760
is likely related
to your past miscarriage.

749
00:31:08,955 --> 00:31:10,520
You didn't take proper care, did you?

750
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:47,480
Dad, she's out.

751
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,359
Dai.

752
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,310
- Dad.
- Does it hurt?

753
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,555
- Does it hurt, dear?
- Dad.

754
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,280
Yes, I'm here.

755
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,240
Qing.

756
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,559
Don't talk.

757
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,520
Your only job right now is to rest.

758
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:01,960
Lina is right.

759
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:03,520
Let's go back to the ward.

760
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,155
All right?

761
00:32:05,422 --> 00:32:06,630
Let's go back to the ward.

762
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:08,440
Shen Qing,

763
00:32:09,022 --> 00:32:10,310
I need to tell you something.

764
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:12,920
It's short on beds right now.

765
00:32:13,088 --> 00:32:14,870
There aren't any private rooms
available,

766
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:16,520
so they arranged a four-person ward.

767
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,866
Dai will have to make do.

768
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,399
Ms. Lian,

769
00:32:25,288 --> 00:32:26,688
it's already amazing

770
00:32:26,733 --> 00:32:28,390
that you found a bed,
given the urgency.

771
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:30,159
If Dai complains, I'll scold her.

772
00:32:30,444 --> 00:32:31,280
Please don't do that.

773
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:32,399
She's sick now.

774
00:32:32,755 --> 00:32:33,310
Let's go.

775
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:35,760
I'm so sorry about this.

776
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,280
Don't be.

777
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,079
You tore it again.

778
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:40,119
Look at this.

779
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,280
Just patch it up.

780
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,680
Look, you stuffed a vest here again.

781
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,622
What's wrong with you?

782
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:47,789
Don't wash it.

783
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,920
- Don't wash it.
- Why?

784
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,440
What's wrong?

785
00:32:49,466 --> 00:32:50,070
It's not dirty.

786
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,000
It is.

787
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,599
Covered in greased.

788
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:53,760
The whole room

789
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,799
reeks of fish.

790
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,639
It's filthy!

791
00:32:56,639 --> 00:32:57,639
Why can't I wash it?

792
00:32:57,711 --> 00:32:59,070
Is there anything in the pockets?

793
00:33:00,777 --> 00:33:01,720
There's a fish hook.

794
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:02,680
I'll take it out.

795
00:33:02,711 --> 00:33:03,644
You might get picked.

796
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:04,222
Stand there.

797
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,119
Why is there a fish hook in there?

798
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,240
Are you trying to hurt me?

799
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,720
No, I just put it there.

800
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,559
Go there.

801
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:11,960
Stay away from me.

802
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,280
Let me see this fish hook.

803
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,960
What's it?

804
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,520
What a big fish hook.

805
00:33:27,777 --> 00:33:28,666
Where did you get it?

806
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,319
I don't know.

807
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,533
Where did it come from?

808
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,119
Even if you got it
from the Tang Dynasty,

809
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,159
I'm confiscating it.

810
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,079
Did you give money to your dad again?

811
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:51,200
Mom, why do you want to control
every single dime?

812
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,079
Dad has his own friends.

813
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,559
He'll have to chip it for meals.

814
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,119
He needs to carry some money.

815
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:00,839
Don't I already give him
400 yuan every month?

816
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:03,040
That's not enough.

817
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:04,119
You think

818
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,119
400 yuan is too little?

819
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,559
Is your dad planning something?

820
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,000
If he is

821
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,279
and has spare money,

822
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,679
he'll make trouble.

823
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,559
Don't you see that?

824
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,480
Wait.

825
00:34:18,422 --> 00:34:19,110
Hold on, I...

826
00:34:19,759 --> 00:34:20,559
Where are you?

827
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,639
Why do I hear sirens?

828
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,199
I'm at the hospital.

829
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,239
Shen Dai has a chocolate cyst.

830
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,422
She needs a minor surgery.

831
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,239
My goodness.

832
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,000
Dai is sick too?

833
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,840
Oh, my, this family.

834
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,759
All right, then.

835
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:35,520
Well,

836
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,355
I'll make some fish soup
and bring it over.

837
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,239
Mom,

838
00:34:38,422 --> 00:34:39,911
stay as far away as you can.

839
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,079
Let me put it this way.

840
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:42,279
Aside from Shen Duole,

841
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,159
she's blocked every Shen family member.

842
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,119
Really?

843
00:34:45,155 --> 00:34:46,200
That's why I'm telling you

844
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:48,279
not to get involved
in Shen's family affairs.

845
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:49,955
I just can't stay out of it.

846
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,119
All right, I get it.

847
00:34:55,288 --> 00:34:56,600
What are you looking for?

848
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,440
Phone charger.

849
00:34:59,844 --> 00:35:02,133
You're still worried about charging
your phone even now.

850
00:35:03,279 --> 00:35:04,440
Can't you just rest?

851
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,377
She has things to take care of.

852
00:35:06,422 --> 00:35:07,266
Charge it for her.

853
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,320
Which matters more, work or your life?

854
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:13,119
Dai,

855
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,000
Ms. Lian talked to the doctor.

856
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,480
Your surgery was very successful.

857
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,520
So don't worry.

858
00:35:19,844 --> 00:35:21,920
Your blood pressure and temperature
are normal.

859
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,759
You all should go home.

860
00:35:25,911 --> 00:35:27,440
It's the first day after her surgery.

861
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,400
I'll take care of her.
I'm a professional.

862
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:31,880
No.

863
00:35:33,066 --> 00:35:34,190
I don't want her here.

864
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:39,840
I'll stay.

865
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,360
Shen Dai is a handful.

866
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:46,279
I'll handle her.

867
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,679
Ms. Lian, thank you so much for today.

868
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,639
You should head home.

869
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,920
Dad's been busy these days.

870
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:58,599
Stay with him,

871
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:59,755
so we don't have to worry.

872
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,533
All right. Call me if you need anything.

873
00:36:01,733 --> 00:36:03,480
You sleep as well.
Don't wear yourself out.

874
00:36:03,488 --> 00:36:04,044
Okay.

875
00:36:04,088 --> 00:36:05,155
I'll make her some soup.

876
00:36:05,644 --> 00:36:06,800
It'll be tiring for you.

877
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,030
- Let's go, Dad.
- Not at all.

878
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,920
Throw tantrums all you want,

879
00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:16,355
but don't take it out on your health.

880
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:20,866
Let's go.

881
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,400
(Drum Tower Hospital)

882
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:37,920
Does it hurt?

883
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:39,360
Be gentle.

884
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:39,960
All right.

885
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:42,520
You're her sister?

886
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,920
I'm her sister-in-law.

887
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:46,679
You're a good sister-in-law.

888
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,559
Right.

889
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,119
You won't notice that

890
00:36:49,279 --> 00:36:50,320
until you lie in bed sick.

891
00:36:50,444 --> 00:36:51,920
This is when one's true nature shows.

892
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,239
Shen Dai, did you hear the public voice?

893
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,679
Yeah, I did.

894
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,400
Excuse me.

895
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,360
What are you here for?

896
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:03,920
I have fibroids.

897
00:37:04,279 --> 00:37:06,159
I have an ovarian cyst.

898
00:37:06,444 --> 00:37:07,480
I have cervical cancer.

899
00:37:08,679 --> 00:37:10,000
My entire uterus is removed.

900
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,559
No biggie.

901
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:16,119
I'm not having kids

902
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,239
at this age anyway.

903
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,199
It's useless to keep it.

904
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,079
That's not true.

905
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:27,040
A uterus isn't just for having

906
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,079
kids...

907
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,520
Give it a rest.

908
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,000
Even surgery won't stop you
from arguing with others.

909
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,639
She's wrong, though.

910
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:36,159
Listen.

911
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:38,000
The uterus is for having kids.

912
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,719
Its downside is

913
00:37:39,777 --> 00:37:40,630
that it grows tumors

914
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,159
and causes adhesions.

915
00:37:42,533 --> 00:37:43,230
As for this lady,

916
00:37:43,577 --> 00:37:44,590
her intrauterine device

917
00:37:44,759 --> 00:37:46,440
got embedded in the tissue.

918
00:37:48,279 --> 00:37:50,520
Women really have it tough.

919
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:54,119
It hurts whether it's childbirth or not.

920
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,880
Pregnancy and contraception both hurt.

921
00:37:57,719 --> 00:37:58,679
Precisely.

922
00:37:59,759 --> 00:38:01,520
You two look about the same age.

923
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,719
Pushing fifty?

924
00:38:04,759 --> 00:38:06,320
Where do you see that we look fifty?

925
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:08,480
You three look seventy.

926
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,488
You guys keep chatting.

927
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:10,400
I'll wipe her down.

928
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,400
Shen Dai,

929
00:38:12,888 --> 00:38:14,111
I'm going to clean you up.

930
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:15,520
Quick. Undo the buttons.

931
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,000
You're covered in cold sweat. You smell.

932
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,070
Can you not say that loud?

933
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:20,880
Can you undo your button on your own?

934
00:38:21,088 --> 00:38:22,880
Can you lower your voice
when you say that?

935
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,679
Hurry up.

936
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,119
Fine.

937
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,320
Shen Dai,

938
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,320
you're weak because you lack nutrients.

939
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,920
You see, we drink fish soup every day,

940
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:34,360
and you just eat raw leaves.

941
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:36,880
That's why you're sick.

942
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:39,960
Also,

943
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,159
my dad brought you fish soup
out of kindness.

944
00:38:43,222 --> 00:38:45,000
Yet you talked
about metal contamination.

945
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,960
Don't you feel bad?

946
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,533
Turn around.

947
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,580
I need to wipe your back.

948
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,360
Quick.

949
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,320
You think I want to do this?

950
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:58,960
Pee.

951
00:38:59,559 --> 00:38:59,960
Pee?

952
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:03,710
The urine bag is full.

953
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,520
Nurse!

954
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:06,920
Nurse!

955
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:09,679
Shen Dai in Bed 47's urine bag is full.

956
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:10,440
What do I do?

957
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,840
Liu Lina,

958
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,960
keep your voice down.

959
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,520
Her sister-in-law is clueless.

960
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:17,759
Right.

961
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:19,559
She nearly let that woman

962
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:21,639
get blocked up with urine.

963
00:39:24,822 --> 00:39:26,960
This young lady probably
doesn't have a husband.

964
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,440
No one to stay overnight with her.

965
00:39:28,759 --> 00:39:30,079
Don't talk nonsense.

966
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,040
I'm serious.

967
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,360
She looks like it.

968
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,239
Right?

969
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,800
You guys are nosy.

970
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,320
You're nosy as well.

971
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,822
Right. You even went over to check.

972
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,977
You're the most exciting one.

973
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:45,119
Ouch.

974
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,119
What's wrong?

975
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:47,719
Ouch.

976
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:48,639
It hurts?

977
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,159
Let's turn to the other side.

978
00:39:52,279 --> 00:39:52,520
Jeez.

979
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,719
It's already late.

980
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:54,840
Put your arm in.

981
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,511
Can you keep it down?
You're making noise.

982
00:39:56,577 --> 00:39:57,800
Please bear with us.

983
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,189
She just had surgery.

984
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,190
She's in pain because the anesthesia
is wearing off.

985
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,360
Who isn't in pain?

986
00:40:04,466 --> 00:40:05,770
Only dead people don't feel pain.

987
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,199
Don't be so harsh.

988
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:11,719
Everyone comes here
because they don't want to die.

989
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:13,599
If any of you

990
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:14,960
want peace,

991
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,109
go to the cemetery.

992
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,444
That's a quiet place, you know?

993
00:40:17,444 --> 00:40:19,070
Shen Dai, shut it.

994
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,670
You're talking about death
to a cancer patient.

995
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:24,400
Are you cursing me?

996
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,790
We're all patients here
and should support each other.

997
00:40:26,822 --> 00:40:27,955
But look what happened now.

998
00:40:27,977 --> 00:40:29,755
You had to compete over who was sicker.

999
00:40:29,755 --> 00:40:30,500
Serves you right.

1000
00:40:30,533 --> 00:40:32,520
Acting all delicate at your age.

1001
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,040
Stop pretending.

1002
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,639
If you keep arguing,
move to the morgue.

1003
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,360
We'll all go together.

1004
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,119
Lie down.

1005
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:42,920
Are you trying to cause trouble?

1006
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:44,520
Listen.

1007
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,239
My family is big.

1008
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,400
I'm here with her today.

1009
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,040
Her brother will come tomorrow,

1010
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,400
and the day after, her nephew.

1011
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:52,840
We'll rotate every day.

1012
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,520
If you want to fight, fine.

1013
00:40:54,644 --> 00:40:56,644
We have plenty of people
to keep you company.

1014
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,960
Who wants to argue with you?

1015
00:40:59,444 --> 00:41:01,488
Having more people
makes you special, huh?

1016
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:02,920
Exactly.

1017
00:41:03,644 --> 00:41:04,333
Go to sleep.

1018
00:41:05,266 --> 00:41:06,110
Everyone, sleep now.

1019
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,400
Lina.

1020
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:26,840
Now what?

1021
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,119
What are you doing?

1022
00:42:00,133 --> 00:42:01,190
I want to drink water.

1023
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,840
Lie down.

1024
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,759
You could've asked me.

1025
00:42:07,822 --> 00:42:09,844
I was trying to let you sleep
a little longer.

1026
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,719
I'm flattered.

1027
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:17,840
You actually care about me.

1028
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,199
Lina,

1029
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:20,759
you know what?

1030
00:42:20,759 --> 00:42:21,880
Your problem is

1031
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,520
that you're more bark than bite.

1032
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:24,960
If I'm a smooth talker,

1033
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,822
you wouldn't even

1034
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:27,320
survive long.

1035
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:29,199
Doctor.

1036
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:30,000
Shen Dai,

1037
00:42:30,577 --> 00:42:31,822
how are you feeling?

1038
00:42:31,888 --> 00:42:33,311
Is your wound healing well?

1039
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,440
Yes.

1040
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:35,960
Good.

1041
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:37,622
Be careful.

1042
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:39,320
Don't let the wound get wet.

1043
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:40,960
Okay. Thank you.

1044
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,199
Thank you, doctor.

1045
00:42:44,577 --> 00:42:45,230
What's wrong?

1046
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,733
Did you catch a cold?

1047
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,199
These are patients.

1048
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,733
They have weak immune systems.

1049
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:52,279
Don't you have any other family members?

1050
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,159
Yes, they do.

1051
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,199
They have a big family.

1052
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,040
Not bigger than your mouth.

1053
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,133
It's better to find someone else
to take care of her.
