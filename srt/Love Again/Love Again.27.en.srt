=Episode 27=

3
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,260
Dad,

4
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,420
as the saying goes,
the clothes make the man.

5
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:44,980
The fish will fall for
the bait immediately

6
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,490
after seeing you in this new outfit.

7
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,020
Mainly, I'm good at fishing.

8
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,260
It has nothing to do with my outfit.

9
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,540
All of the fish pursue your father

10
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,420
ever since he wore
that foreign clothing.

11
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:58,820
Lina,

12
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,450
why did you come back at this time?

13
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,100
Dad caught some fish.
He told me to take some.

14
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:03,930
That's right.

15
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,330
Shen Dai doesn't eat fish, right?

16
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,300
That's right.

17
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,490
Doesn't she have a grudge against fish?

18
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,610
The Shen family

19
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,020
has invited Le Shuishan to join them
for dinner during Mid-Autumn Festival.

20
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,050
Shen Dai said

21
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,330
Le Shuishan loves fish.

22
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,420
Le Shuishan?

23
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,170
You mean the woman

24
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,770
who resembles your late mother-in-law?

25
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,170
That's right.

26
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,890
The Shen family is excited about it.

27
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,770
Shen Dai came back from abroad
just for this event.

28
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,730
She came back from abroad for this?

29
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,770
My goodness.

30
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,890
This is nonsense!

31
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,930
Look. They're just like the fish.
They must've lost their minds.

32
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,490
Liu Lina, you have to be careful.

33
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:44,610
You mustn't allow
the tragedy of Lian Yilian

34
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,450
to happen again.

35
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,090
What am I supposed to do about it?

36
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,850
You can't just let an unknown woman

37
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,820
become your next mother-in-law.

38
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,090
It's not like I can stop them.

39
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:52,410
You!

00:02:52,883 --> 00:02:58,650

That was great.

53
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:03,450
Yeah.

54
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,260
That was excellent.

Shen Qing?

00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:18,770
Shen Qing?

58
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,210
Lina.

59
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,380
Mom,

60
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,060
I'm sorry.

61
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,500
Please bear with it.

62
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,850
Lina, Mom won't blame you for this.

63
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,620
We're here.

64
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,290
Come.

65
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,570
This is my son's house.

66
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,050
This is my house.

67
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,380
Qing, Lina, hurry. They're here.

68
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,530
They're here. Hurry up.

69
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,380
- This is my son's...
- Dad.

70
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,140
- Look. He's here.
- Ms. Le.

71
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,140
Ms. Le.

72
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,050
Alright. Let me
introduce her to you guys.

73
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:28,770
This is Ms. Le.

74
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,380
Hi, Ms. Le.

75
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,100
This is

76
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,740
- my...
- I'm Shen Qing.

77
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,460
I'm his eldest son.

78
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:35,290
Do you live here?

79
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,170
Yeah. I live there.

80
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:36,620
That's right.

81
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,050
I'm Liu Lina.

82
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,290
- I...
- She's my wife.

83
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:39,860
That's right.

84
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:40,620
Nice to meet you.

85
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,380
I'm Shen Duole.

86
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,460
He's my grandfather.

87
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,650
Grandfather, huh? You two do look alike.

88
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,740
Yeah.

89
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,650
This is...

90
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,100
I'm Shen Dai.

91
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,170
You can call me Dai.

92
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,890
Hello, Dai.

93
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:52,740
She's my daughter.

94
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,860
She's the one
who subscribed to your channel.

95
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,380
That's right.

96
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,500
That's me.

97
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,690
Sorry for the embarrassment.

98
00:07:58,930 --> 00:07:59,570
Ms. Le,

99
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,860
thank you for spending
your Mid-Autumn Festival with us.

100
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,410
Thank you all for inviting me.

101
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,890
Let's not stand outside. Ms. Le, please.

102
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,650
That's right. Hurry. Please come inside.

103
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,500
Come inside.

104
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,290
- We've been standing here for some time.
- Please come in.

105
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,340
The floor is clean. Let me
change into a pair of slippers.

106
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,930
It's fine. You can have a seat first.

107
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,020
We've been outside for some time.

108
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,100
You can sit down
and then change into them.

109
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:19,770
Let's go.

110
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,140
- Sit here.
- She does resemble her.

111
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,570
This house truly has a scholarly vibe.

112
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,810
I was a teacher all my life.
That's why there are plenty of books.

113
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,530
Here, have a seat.

114
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,460
Please have a seat.

115
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:32,980
Ms. Le,

116
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,100
please change into these slippers.

117
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,100
Okay. Thank you.

118
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,100
It's the perfect size.

119
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,100
Let me take your shoes.

120
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:45,740
Okay.

121
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,100
Here.

122
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:49,690
This is your favorite drink.

123
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,340
It's jasmine tea.

124
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,770
Jasmine tea is my favorite indeed.

125
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,290
How did you know?

126
00:08:59,500 --> 00:08:59,980
Ms. Le,

127
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,770
I heard from Aunt
that you loved taking pictures.

128
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,050
I prepared a small gift for you,
which is a selfie stick.

129
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,170
Look.

130
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,650
This is just what I need.

131
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,170
But I didn't prepare any gifts for you.

132
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,170
Ms. Le, it's fine.

133
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,050
Please accept it.

134
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,140
Okay. I'll accept it.

135
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:15,860
Thank you.

136
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,170
Ms. Le,

137
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,860
I'm sure you love

138
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,100
cherries as well.

139
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,930
My favorite fruit is cherry.

140
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,380
Not only does she resemble her,
but she also

141
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,260
has the same preferences as her.

142
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:29,890
Try these dates.

143
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,380
It's super sweet.

144
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,500
Dates are my favorite fruit now.

145
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,890
It's good for women.

146
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,500
My hands are super warm right now.

147
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:38,500
Try and touch them.

148
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,570
You're right.
Your hands aren't cold at all.

149
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,050
Yeah, right?

150
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,340
Mom,

151
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,620
don't worry.

152
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,570
I'm doing great right now.

153
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,500
You look like
you dabble in the art industry.

154
00:09:58,980 --> 00:09:59,380
Am I right?

155
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,740
Yes, I'm in charge
of exhibition planning.

156
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:02,810
You plan exhibitions, huh?

157
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,890
Enough already.

158
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,690
Stop grabbing her hands.

159
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,020
Have a seat.

160
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,460
You guys shouldn't just stand there.

161
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,740
Sit down and have some tea.

162
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,220
I haven't finished my dish yet.

163
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:11,620
Yeah.

164
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,140
We have something to do in the kitchen.

165
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:13,570
Yeah.

166
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,980
Hurry and serve the dishes, then.

167
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,140
Have some fruits.

168
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,890
Here are
the freshly cooked egg dumplings.

169
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,290
They're piping hot.

170
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,500
Shen Qing made

171
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,860
the egg dumplings personally.

172
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:23,890
He didn't buy them from the market.

173
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,220
Shen Qing, you're so capable.

174
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:30,530
Shen Qing was
a great elder brother since young.

175
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,810
Don't serve me first.

176
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,140
You should serve Ms. Le first.

177
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,460
Dad, please serve me.

178
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,260
Mind your manners.
We should serve our guest first.

179
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,460
That's right.
We should serve Ms. Le first.

180
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:39,890
Here.

181
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,860
It's fine.

182
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,740
Here, you can have this.

183
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:42,980
Use this bowl. It's clean.

184
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,650
Ms. Le, here you go.

185
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,290
I don't have any children.

186
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:46,890
I'm truly envious

187
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,340
when I see a family

188
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,690
as lively as yours.

189
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,650
Dad, try it and
see if it's the taste you remember.

190
00:10:58,770 --> 00:10:59,170
Excellent.

191
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:00,570
It's the taste I remember.

192
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,410
Please try it.

193
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,460
You're amazing.

194
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:06,170
I know it's troublesome
to make egg dumplings.

195
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,020
Ms. Le.

196
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,500
You flatter me. Mainly,

197
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,770
I was craving them too.

198
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,340
Dad, is it the taste you remember?

199
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:13,980
It is.

200
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,620
Ms. Le,

201
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,500
it's been ten years since Shen Qing
had used the cleaver.

202
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:18,690
He made the fillings

203
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,100
himself today.

204
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:21,770
Look.

205
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,410
Ms. Le, you see,

206
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,397
this is the secret Shen family recipe

207
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:26,770
that has been passed down
for generations.

208
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,460
You won't be able to get it elsewhere.

209
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,930
It'll blow your mind.

210
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,930
If so, I have to give it a try.

211
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:32,260
That's right.

212
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,020
Give it a try.

213
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,050
Alright. I'll give it a try.

214
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:34,620
Alright.

215
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,770
It's so delicious.

216
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,410
Yeah, right?

217
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,500
Seems like Qing isn't rusty yet.

218
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:47,740
Is that how you compliment him?

219
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,740
It's his first time making it.

220
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,860
He's just been laying low.
Now, he's making himself known.

221
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,570
Precisely. Dad is right.

222
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,260
Grandpa.

223
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,890
How could you praise
your own son like that?

224
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,100
Isn't he your father?

225
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,380
Of course he can.

226
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,290
He's merely stating facts.

227
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,170
Come. Today's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

228
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,410
It's a good occasion. I hope
we can celebrate this every year.

229
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,650
Let's have a toast.

230
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,340
Let's have a drink, okay?

231
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:12,050
Cheers.

232
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,170
Cheers.

233
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,140
- Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.
- Cheers.

234
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:14,770
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

235
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,140
Ms. Le, Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

236
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,770
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

237
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,380
Happy Mid-Autumn Festival.

238
00:12:28,035 --> 00:12:30,170
(Bao: Where are you?)

239
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,220
If you guys are drinking,

240
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:31,990
(Bao: There's a full moon today.)
I'll enjoy the meat.

241
00:12:31,991 --> 00:12:32,570
(If only I were by your side.)
I'll enjoy the meat.

242
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,770
Eat more of the egg dumplings I've made.

243
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,930
(Bao, add to Blacklist, Delete)
You're still growing up.

244
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,007
(Bao, add to Blacklist, Confirm)
You have to eat the fish

245
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:37,930
(Bao, add to Blacklist, Confirm)
your grandpa had caught too.

246
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,380
This is delicious.

247
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,170
Ms. Le,

248
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,260
I'm so happy today.

249
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,410
Me too.

250
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,050
I'm serious. It's been so long
since I was this happy.

251
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,690
I've decided today

252
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:53,930
that I'll drop my diet.

253
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,020
That's right.

254
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,380
You can go on a diet after this meal.

255
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,020
Precisely.

256
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,650
Ms. Le, you look prettier
when you're plump.

257
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,500
There are plenty of outfits

258
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,220
which require extra size
to make them look good.

259
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,340
My goodness.

260
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:04,570
Precisely.

261
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,410
Let's have a toast.

262
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,290
Slowly.

263
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,530
Ms. Le, for example,

264
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,100
I'm sure you look good

265
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,050
in this red dress.

266
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:17,930
The fabric used

267
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,740
is top-notch indeed.

268
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,260
It does look great.

269
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,410
The design is great too.

270
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,290
It has a retro feel to it.

271
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,770
I like it a lot.

272
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:26,860
Do you like it?

273
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,500
I like the color.

274
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,620
Ms. Le, if you like it,

275
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,860
I'll give it to you.

276
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:31,690
-Take it.
- Dai.

277
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,140
Don't do that.

278
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,380
You're scaring Ms. Le.

279
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,380
You see,

280
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,810
Dai is straightforward.

281
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,500
But she's kind-hearted.

282
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,290
She has a great personality.

283
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,930
Ms. Le, why don't you try it on?

284
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,340
I...

285
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:46,530
I...

286
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:48,170
Yeah.

287
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,140
Ms. Le, why don't you try it on?

288
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,460
- Okay?
- It'll look great.

289
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,460
Give it a try.

290
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,050
I'll give it a try.

291
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:53,380
Give it a try.

292
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:53,810
Alright, then.

293
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,100
Give it a try. Here.

294
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,020
Okay.

295
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:56,890
Come. Let me help you put it on.

296
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:58,810
Just put it on.

297
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,260
The color does look nice.

298
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,620
Let me handle your hair.

299
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,260
It looks great.

300
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:04,890
Here.

301
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,170
The color is vibrant.

302
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,140
I don't wear this often.

303
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,100
But the color is...

304
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,220
Let me handle your hair.

305
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,570
I'll help you tidy up.

306
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:14,860
Let me see.

307
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:24,620
This color...

308
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,140
Does it look nice on me?

309
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,140
Yes, it does.

310
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:33,980
It looks great on you.

311
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,460
Put it on. Give it a try.

312
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,020
You're wasting your money on me again.

313
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,020
It's not a waste
when I'm buying it for you.

314
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:45,770
Let me see.

315
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,380
Let me tidy it up for you.

316
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,930
Do I look nice?

317
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:51,620
You look great.

318
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:55,860
Dad.

319
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,020
Qing, I think I might be a little drunk.

320
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,170
I need to use the restroom.

321
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:01,890
Is she okay?

322
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,500
She drank too much.

323
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,570
She finished the liquor in one go.

324
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,340
She's a little drunk.

325
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:05,740
Don't.

326
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,380
Ms. Le.

327
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,340
You look great in that coat.

328
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,410
Today's the Mid-Autumn Festival.

329
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,810
Why don't we take a group photo?

330
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:25,860
I'll take the photo.

331
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,500
Let's take a group photo.

332
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,570
Okay. Let's take a group photo.

333
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,460
I'll call for Dai.

334
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:29,740
Okay. I hope she's alright.

335
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,290
Come.

336
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,620
Okay. Let's take a group photo.

337
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,170
Let's take one.

338
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,690
Will she take the photo
with the coat on?

339
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,420
Coming.

340
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,020
Coming.

341
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,180
Coming.

342
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:48,940
It looks good on you.

343
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,740
The color looks great.

344
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,500
Yeah.

345
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:50,850
Yeah, right?

346
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,220
Come.

347
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:52,980
Come.

348
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,900
Le, how is it? Are you ready?

349
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,180
Come.

350
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,180
Coming.

351
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,020
He's putting it to use.

352
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,980
He has the same one.

353
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,460
The selfie stick.

354
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:02,900
He's putting it to use.

355
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:06,610
Come.

356
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,900
Look at the camera.

357
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,370
Three, two, one.

358
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,610
- Okay?
- Is that okay?

359
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,610
- We're not in the frame.
- Are you done?

360
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,220
No. You have to take another photo.

361
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,180
Your face looks gigantic.

362
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:17,810
You should come backward.

363
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,420
That's right.

364
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,290
- Come backward.
- We'll do the same.

365
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:19,980
We weren't in the frame.

366
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,660
Duole, take a few more photos.

367
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,050
Got it.

368
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:23,530
Take a few more of it.

369
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,610
Mom, you should go backward as well.

370
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,610
Go backward.

371
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:26,940
Let me take a look.

372
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,090
Mom, you should go backward.

373
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,260
Go backward.

374
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,090
Le.

375
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,500
I'm sorry.

376
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,940
We did misbehave.

377
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,770
Let me apologize to you
on everyone's behalf.

378
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:49,900
It's fine.

379
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,980
Why don't you tell me off?

380
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,370
If not, I'll feel guilty.

381
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,810
You want me to tell you off
so that you won't feel guilty?

382
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,090
That's right.

383
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,610
I'm too selfish.

384
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,180
Alright.

385
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,740
I accept your apology.

386
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,530
Mr. Shen, you should go back.

387
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,020
No. It's too late.

388
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:07,500
You should let me send you home.

389
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,290
No need for that.

390
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:11,700
I'm just your wife's substitute.

391
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,370
You don't need to worry about my danger.

392
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,770
Can you please listen to me?

393
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,290
Of course, it's fine
even if you don't want to.

394
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:25,740
Go ahead.

395
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,660
Jingmin is my legal wife.

396
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,700
All these years,
I've been busy with my work

397
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,420
and career.

398
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,900
I remained active even after retirement.

399
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,810
I gave lectures at all kinds of venues.

400
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,090
I thought society needed me.

401
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,130
I felt pretty good about it.

402
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,530
Until Jingmin fell sick.

403
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,020
Only then I realize

404
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,460
that the person who needed you the most

405
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,330
was by your side all the time.

406
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,260
However,

407
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,940
she didn't have much time left.

408
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,850
Thank you for listening to me.

409
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,130
All these years,

410
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,050
I've never prepared a meal for Jingmin.

411
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,330
I never took a decent photo
for her as well.

412
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,050
When Jingmin passed away,

413
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,610
I felt as if there were too many regrets

414
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,610
that I couldn't make up for.

415
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,090
The children thought the same.

416
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,570
Thus, in order

417
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,020
to satisfy our own emotional needs,

418
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,050
I invited you here to celebrate
the Mid-Autumn Festival with us.

419
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,530
I do resemble Jingmin.

420
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,290
You resemble her a lot.

421
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,460
That's why the children

422
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,220
wanted you to take their mother's seat

423
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,260
and pretend
that the family was complete.

424
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,290
They wanted to pretend

425
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,770
that all of their regrets
were made up for.

426
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:28,900
But in the end,

427
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,530
they hurt you instead.

428
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:36,700
I'm sorry.

429
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,610
(Until Jingmin fell sick.)

430
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:02,660
(Only then I realized)

431
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,220
(that the person
who needed you the most)

432
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,090
(was by your side all the time.)

433
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,220
(However,)

434
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,460
(she didn't have much time left.)

435
00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:19,820
(Bao, Add to Blacklist)

436
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,770
We have choir practice tomorrow.

437
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,570
Are you picking me up after that?

438
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,420
You guys made Le Shuishan

439
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,090
wear your mother-in-law's coat
and her slippers, huh?

440
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,900
That's terrifying.

441
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,810
You guys went overboard.

442
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,020
Do you know the definition
of a cenotaph?

443
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,700
If I were Le Shuishan,

444
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,660
I would've fallen out with you guys.

445
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:21,980
Yeah.

446
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,980
After that, my father-in-law
went after her.

447
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,980
He apologized to her.

448
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,370
Maybe she has moved on.

449
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,900
Did she move on?

450
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,700
Or did she forgive you guys?

451
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,020
Aren't they the same?

452
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,940
How could they be the same?

453
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,500
Forget it.

454
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,530
She's lazy to press charges
against you guys.

455
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,500
She'll stay away
from you guys in the future.

456
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:42,900
If she has forgiven you guys,

457
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,050
that means she has gotten over it.

458
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,330
You guys will still mingle
in the future.

459
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,370
Anyway, my father-in-law
was in a good mood

460
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,290
when he came back last night.

461
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,180
That means

462
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,420
she has forgiven you guys.

463
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:55,460
I guess so.

464
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,330
Mom, you're quite capable, huh?

465
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,530
You're something else.

466
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,130
You always manage
to grasp the key points.

467
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:01,980
Of course.

468
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,660
I'm your mother, you know?

469
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,610
There's no one else. Let's go.

470
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:07,530
It's almost 1 P.M.

471
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:08,740
Hurry up.

472
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,420
622.

473
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,090
Alright.

474
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,460
Fine. I won't sneak a peek.

475
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,330
I'll enter the password now.

476
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,113
It's not like
I want to steal your password.

477
00:22:34,582 --> 00:22:35,100
(Processing. Please wait.)

478
00:22:35,148 --> 00:22:36,090
(Account balance, 4,200 yuan)

479
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:36,940
Alright.

480
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,370
Look at the account balance.

481
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,020
I won't.

482
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,290
Take a look.

483
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,330
I won't!

484
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:42,610
Just take a look.

485
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:43,290
Fine.

486
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,330
(Account balance, 4,200 yuan)
Look at the balance.

487
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,500
This was the amount I saw last week.

488
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,420
Now, it's still the same.

489
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,180
Although your father

490
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,610
took the cash card,

491
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,610
he didn't use it.

492
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,900
All men prioritize dignity.

493
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,740
Even if you give him money,

494
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:59,260
he won't know how to spend it.

495
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,810
Mom, I spent half a day here
just to wait for you.

496
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,850
I thought you had
something important to handle.

497
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,260
In the end, you were just
checking my father's bank account.

498
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,130
Isn't that important?

499
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:09,460
You're still too young.

500
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,940
This is an important matter.

501
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,370
Your father thinks
that he has risen in status

502
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,980
after taking money from me.

503
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,850
He thinks
he's the head of the family now.

504
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,940
Listen.

505
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,050
I know your father inside out.

506
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,700
My dear rod.

507
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,130
Mister.

508
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,500
This fishing rod
costs over 1,000 yuan, huh?

509
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,770
My goodness. What will you use this for?

510
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,290
Are you using this
to fish the Dragon King?

511
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,570
Shen Qing bought it for me.

512
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,050
I said no, but he insisted on
buying it for me.

513
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,460
Yeah.

514
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,460
You're enjoying

515
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,370
your days, huh?

516
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,570
It's not too bad.

517
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,460
Mainly,

518
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,610
I don't take things too seriously.

519
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,900
What's with all the smoke at home?

520
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,370
Aunt.

521
00:23:59,020 --> 00:23:59,700
Liu Dong?

522
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:00,290
You're back.

523
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,700
You're a rare guest.

524
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,050
Usually, I don't let people

525
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,700
smoke in the house.

526
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,130
It's because I have bronchitis.

527
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:10,770
You know?

528
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,260
But you can go ahead.

529
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,020
I'll stop.

530
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,850
Smoking is bad for health.

531
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:19,850
That's right.

532
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:20,530
Have some water.

533
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,660
We'll stop smoking. Have some water.

534
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:23,940
Aunt,

535
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,130
it's like this.

536
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,770
I came back to Nanjing

537
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,290
to get some prescriptions
for my grandfather.

538
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,330
Now,

539
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,610
his health

540
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,420
is deteriorating day by day.

541
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:40,570
My father said

542
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:43,500
that

543
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,770
he might not last until
the end of the year.

544
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,660
He's over 90 years old.

545
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,570
He has lived a long life.

546
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:54,090
Indeed.

547
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:55,660
That's good.

548
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,770
In the Liu family,

549
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,530
Grandfather

550
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,900
is the only elder left.

551
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,020
He talks about

552
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,980
building the ancestral hall

553
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,810
every day.

554
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,770
The uncles in our hometown think

555
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,180
that

556
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,500
each family should fork out 20,000 yuan.

557
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,290
That's not a huge sum.

558
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,050
After that,
we'll build our ancestral hall.

559
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,700
This way, the Liu family's spirit

560
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,420
can thrive and grow.

561
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:29,020
Uncle,

562
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,370
this is about
cultural inheritance after all.

563
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:37,570
Okay.

564
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,460
I'll discuss it with your aunt.

565
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:41,980
No problem.

566
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,740
Liu Dong, have a seat.

567
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,980
I'll prepare some oranges

568
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:48,940
for you.

569
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,220
Aunt, it's fine.

570
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,290
It's fine.

571
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,020
You guys can go ahead.

572
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:02,570
Uncle.

573
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:04,980
If you think

574
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,050
it's too difficult,

575
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,050
you can drop the thought.

576
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,370
How is it difficult?

577
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,530
Not at all.

578
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,130
I'll transfer the money to you later.

579
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,050
Alright, then.

580
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,090
It's like this.

581
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,130
Once the ancestral hall is built,

582
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,740
the entire Liu family

583
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,290
has to hold a gathering.

584
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,940
By then, you can bring Aunt,

585
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,770
Lina, and the rest of your family.

586
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,460
Your family must join us.

587
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,610
That's a given.

588
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:33,740
I'm glad to hear that.

589
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,050
Of course.

590
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:35,610
Alright.

591
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:36,660
Uncle,

592
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,090
I'll make a move first.

593
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:38,940
Are you leaving?

594
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:39,500
Yeah.

595
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,220
You...

596
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,770
I have to go.

597
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,570
I truly have to go.

598
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,370
Aunt.

599
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,130
I'll be leaving now.

600
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,260
You should go after dinner.

601
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:47,940
No thanks.

602
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,260
Grandpa is waiting for his medicine.

603
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,020
I've already cut the oranges for you.

604
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,700
You can take them with you.

605
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,460
- No need for that.
- You can take them with you.

606
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,260
Have them on the road.

607
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,090
Aunt, it's fine.

608
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,460
Take care, okay?

609
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:57,770
Uncle,

610
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,330
notify me once you've transferred

611
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:00,290
the money.

612
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:02,180
No problem.

613
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:03,180
Aunt, I'll be going now.

614
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,330
Okay. Go ahead.

615
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,130
Take care.

616
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:05,660
I'll make a move first.

617
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:07,260
Go now.

618
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,050
I knew it.

619
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:30,260
Your family members

620
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,700
never visit us

621
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,330
without an ulterior motive.

622
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,090
You guys are just ordinary folks.

623
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,220
For eight generations,

624
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:43,020
not one of our ancestors
ever made a name for themselves.

625
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,180
Why are you guys
trying to build an ancestral hall?

626
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:45,420
Building an ancestral hall?

627
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,740
My goodness.

628
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:48,740
That's the rule we have back home.

629
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:51,530
We're doing it to bring prosperity
to our future generations.

630
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,900
It's just 20,000 yuan.

631
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,220
Didn't you hear him?
It's about cultural heritage.

632
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:57,900
Fine.

633
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,700
I won't object to the proposal.

634
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:01,530
You guys can build it as you like.

635
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,330
However, the Liu family

636
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,260
should fork out the money themselves.

637
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,610
My surname is Sun.

638
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:08,660
I'm not a part of your family.

639
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:35,090
Alright.

640
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:36,460
Let us

641
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,130
practice

642
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:39,940
once again.

643
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,260
Let's get the second row more compact.

644
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,980
Le.

645
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,050
You're new to the choir.

646
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,740
Don't be impatient. Take your time.

647
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:16,700
♪The midnight garden is silent♪

648
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:22,740
♪Only the breeze is singing♪

649
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,660
- Le Shuishan.
- ♪The night view is splendid♪

650
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,460
I'm here to pick you up
on my father's behalf.

651
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,420
Sorry about this.

652
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,460
Sorry about this.

653
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,290
It's her family affair.

654
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,770
Go ahead. I'll wait for you.

655
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:45,610
What's wrong?
Can't I be the one to pick you up?

656
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,130
Must my father be the one
to pick you up?

657
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,530
Li Xibei,

658
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:50,610
you're going overboard here.

659
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,090
I'm going overboard?

660
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,220
I'm almost giving birth, you know?

661
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,130
I was hoping that my father
could look after me

662
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,260
since he was living nearby.

663
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:00,180
But you always ask him to send you around
as if he's your chauffeur.

664
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,290
I already tolerated that.

665
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,220
Why did you make him sell his house

666
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,330
and move to your neighborhood

667
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,810
when you two were dating?

668
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:07,420
Do you know something?

669
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,090
I grew up in that house.

670
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,900
It's also a school district house
my future child will use.

671
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,740
To me, it's more than just a house.

672
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,660
It's almost my home.

673
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,330
What gives you the right
to sell it away?

674
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:18,370
Who do you think you are?

675
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:20,180
Miss.

676
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:21,460
Miss,

677
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,660
we have choir practice today.

678
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,850
Please calm down.

679
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,500
Stay outside for a moment.

680
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,570
You can talk to her
once the practice is over.

681
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,460
Let's go and practice.

682
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,460
I've already explained things
to your father.

683
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,660
You explained things to him?

684
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:35,370
Why did you text him

685
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,500
and ask him to pick you up, then?

686
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,610
You're an adult yourself.
Don't tell me you can't live without him.

687
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:43,900
Li Xibei,

688
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,290
I can tell you this clearly.

689
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,220
People our age

690
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,020
can live by ourselves just fine.

691
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,940
This is Mr. Shen.

692
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:01,500
I mean, Professor Shen.

693
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,330
I look just like

694
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,050
his late wife.

695
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,330
That's what you call true affinity.

696
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:12,980
That's right.

697
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:18,940
Dad.

698
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:33,050
What's going on?

699
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,020
Who is he?

700
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,130
Le,

701
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,050
this is?

702
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,850
Let me introduce him officially.

703
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,660
This is Li Heibao.

704
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,290
This is his daughter,

705
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,220
Li Xibei.

706
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,500
This is

707
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,130
Professor Shen Zhuoran.

708
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:56,530
This is Professor Shen.

709
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,290
He was a lecturer.

710
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,850
I spent the Mid-Autumn Festival,

711
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,500
together with him

712
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,220
and his family.

713
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,020
We have plenty of common languages.

714
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,530
We get along very well.

715
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,570
We have a warm relationship.

716
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,290
Am I right, Mr. Shen?

717
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:13,770
That's right.

718
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:15,770
We have a warm relationship.

719
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,740
You guys have a warm relationship
right after the Mid-Autumn Festival?

720
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:27,980
That's right.

721
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,420
Shuishan.

722
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:32,530
You see...

723
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,770
Last night,

724
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,660
Professor Shen and I had a deep chat.

725
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,860
I was moved by his words.

726
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,820
I think

727
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,980
fate has led us to each other.

728
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,340
Am I right, Mr. Shen?

729
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,570
Before this,

730
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,570
it was a misunderstanding between us.

731
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,340
Let me apologize for that.

732
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,340
But this is the end

733
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,610
of our relationship.

734
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,570
That's the end of our relationship?

735
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:21,940
I won't agree to that.

736
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:29,780
Girl, be careful!

737
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,300
Girl, what's wrong?

738
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,170
What's wrong with her?

739
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,170
Come and help her out!

740
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:34,500
What's wrong?

741
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:35,530
My tummy hurts.

742
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:36,570
Hurry.

743
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:37,460
We have to send her to the hospital.

744
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:37,860
We mustn't...

745
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,210
- We mustn't do it here.
- That's right. Send her here.

746
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,380
Hurry and send her to the hospital.

747
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:40,980
Is it...

748
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:41,780
Will you guys be okay?

749
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:42,820
Be careful.

750
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:43,380
Will you guys be okay?

751
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,130
Be careful.

752
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:53,690
Thank you.

753
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,570
Before this, Li Heibao

754
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,050
was a canoe athlete.

755
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:12,380
He became a coach after retirement.

756
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,050
He spends his day at Xuanwu Lake.

757
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,730
Our cheongsam team

758
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,730
often practice
our catwalk there as well.

759
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:21,900
Therefore,

760
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,860
we became acquaintances

761
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:24,980
since we met all the time.

762
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,250
He knew that I had suffered
a lot before this.

763
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,050
That's why

764
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,860
he took great care of me.

765
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,170
Oftentimes, he would drive
for more than an hour

766
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,780
just to deliver breakfast to me.

767
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,210
After that, I told him this,

768
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,860
"Why don't you sell your house

769
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,610
and move to a place nearer to my house

770
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,090
so that you won't need
to travel back and forth all the time?"

771
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:50,050
I never expect this

772
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,300
to cause a huge conflict between them.

773
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,300
I was inconsiderate.

774
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,210
It wasn't your fault.
You didn't mean it.

775
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,340
You had good intentions.

776
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,460
You can explain it to her

777
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,420
once she's appeased.

778
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,650
If so, the matter will be over.

779
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,250
I don't want to explain myself.

780
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,020
His daughter has strong opinions of me.

781
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,170
It's not just the house.

782
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,820
She'll start a conflict
because of other things as well.

783
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,780
At this age, there's no need
to bother myself with this.

784
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,460
What's the point?

785
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:19,730
You do have a point.

786
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:21,340
It's related to his child.

787
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,050
It'll be troublesome
if you don't handle it properly.

788
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,940
If so, you can deal with it

789
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,980
as you see fit.

790
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:33,460
For the rest of my life,

791
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:35,460
I wish

792
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,210
to lead a simple life.

793
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,500
Mr. Shen, what do you think?

794
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:54,500
(Inpatient)

795
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:55,650
How do you feel?

796
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:57,690
Much better.

797
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:00,380
Here.

798
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:01,900
You must be starving.

799
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,340
Have some congee while it's hot.

800
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:06,500
Dad.

801
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:06,730
Here.

802
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,170
You should have some too.

803
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:10,610
You should eat first.

804
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,340
I'll finish it when you can't.

805
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,250
It's sweet.

806
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,460
Pan called me just now.

807
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,860
I told him that everything was normal.

808
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,090
I told him
to focus on his business trip.

809
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,300
Eat up.

810
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:41,340
Okay.

811
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,460
One, two, one.

812
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,650
One, two, one.

813
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,780
One, two, one.

814
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,130
One, two, one.

815
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,380
One, two, three, four.

816
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:58,610
Come on.

817
00:36:59,380 --> 00:36:59,730
What's the matter?

818
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,820
I'm not in the mood.
I don't feel like moving.

819
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:02,980
Ding!

820
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:04,090
Halt!

821
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,130
Turn around!

822
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,090
Good. Come back.

823
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:08,420
Okay.

824
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:09,500
So...

825
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,050
Okay. Halt!

826
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:11,690
Halt.

827
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,250
You...

828
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:14,940
What's wrong with you?

829
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:18,250
That event occurred out of the blue.

830
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,610
That's too sudden.

831
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,900
Yeah.

832
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,420
I never expected Le Shuishan

833
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:26,020
to have a partner.

834
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,820
What am I, then?

835
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,610
Have I become her backburner lover?

836
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,650
That man

837
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,820
looks like a blockhead
with his tracksuit on.

838
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,420
He only has brawn, no brain.

839
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,780
He's no match for you.

840
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,250
He's no match for you.

841
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,570
He has a sturdy build.

842
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:46,820
He's full of muscles.

843
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,940
He's a retired athlete.

844
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,900
So what?

845
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,130
Aren't you a retired lecturer yourself?

846
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,210
Everyone has their own strengths.

847
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:59,610
Shen, let's view
this issue from all angles.

848
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,820
This is called a blessing in disguise.

849
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,130
After the commotion
his daughter had made,

850
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,170
you might turn into

851
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:08,020
her official partner at any time.

852
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:11,860
Why do I have the feeling

853
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,780
that Le Shuishan was
only using me as her shield?

854
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,570
She just wanted that brute
to give up on her.

855
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,530
Give up?

856
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,300
No way.

857
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,530
Shen, oh, Shen.

858
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:25,780
You and Le Shuishan
truly have an affinity with each other.

859
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,020
She's just like Jingmin.

860
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:31,420
You two are a perfect match
in every way.

861
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,250
You two are the perfect couple.

862
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,940
Now, she has finally met you.

863
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:36,210
You mustn't give up just like this.

864
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,460
What's wrong?

865
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,340
Gou,

866
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,860
what's wrong with you?

867
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:44,210
Are you okay?

868
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:46,340
Are you okay?

869
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,690
You get me so worked up that it hurts.

870
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:51,860
Yeah, that's right!

871
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,380
Fine, then.

872
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:53,780
It's fine.

873
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,500
Let's pull ourselves together.

874
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,570
We need to make that brute
feel the same pain.

875
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,980
Come on. Let's pull ourselves together.

876
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,050
Ready, march!

877
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,860
- Forward!
- Come on!

878
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,020
That's the gist of it.

879
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:09,340
Dad,

880
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,300
this must be fate.

881
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,780
I think we have to be cautious.

882
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,380
What's there to be cautious about?

883
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,780
(Le, I'm truly sorry.)
Mr. Shen,

884
00:40:26,781 --> 00:40:28,460
(Le, I'm truly sorry.)
thank you for helping me out today.

885
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,020
I left hastily during
Mid-Autumn Festival.

886
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,340
I didn't manage to add Dai on WeChat.

887
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,250
Can you tell her to add me?

888
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:35,690
I will.

889
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:37,420
I'll add her immediately.

890
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:38,780
Share her profile to me.

891
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,610
Done.

892
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,530
If it does work out,

893
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,460
the wall will have a portrait
of your ex-mother-in-law

894
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:56,380
while your new mother-in-law
will be in the house.

895
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,530
And, they look the same.

896
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,690
Won't you guys be scared?

897
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,340
Mom, stop it.

898
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:03,940
You're scaring me here.

899
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,380
This is Le Shuishan's channel, huh?

900
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:09,730
She's quite pretty.

901
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,650
- She knows how to doll herself up.
- Let me see.

902
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,650
Let me see.

903
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,050
She might not necessarily like Shen.

904
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,650
(The Past Gone With The Wind)
She must be wearing branded goods.

905
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,500
How much is her pension fund?

906
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:21,650
How should I know?

907
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:24,300
She's a makeup artist.
Plenty of people want to hire her.

908
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,380
She does know how to doll herself up.

909
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:28,500
Why are you watching

910
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,250
her videos out of the blue?

911
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,780
It's due to the big data, you know?

912
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:36,820
Her channel was recommended.

913
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:37,900
That's right.

914
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,730
The phone will recommend content to you

915
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,050
based on your preferences.

916
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:04,500
This...

917
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:05,380
This...

918
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,610
Ancestral hall is very important.

919
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,730
When a family has
their own ancestral hall...

920
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:11,650
Dad,

921
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,130
your phone is running out of battery.

922
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,130
I'll charge it for you.

923
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:14,860
Thank you.

924
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:16,170
It's running out of battery.

925
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,860
Aren't you siding
with your father too much?

926
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,250
This is infuriating.

927
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:21,940
Thank you.

928
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:28,340
Thank you for giving me
a chance to meet you.

929
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:29,820
Thank you for tolerating our demeanor.

930
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,900
I knew what we did

931
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:33,500
was quite inappropriate.

932
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:35,900
It's all in the past.

933
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,650
When I saw her portrait,

934
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:40,210
I was dumbfounded as well.

935
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:43,340
We literally looked like each other.

936
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:45,860
No wonder

937
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,500
you guys kept staring at me.

938
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:50,610
You missed your mother.

939
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:51,420
I understand your feelings.

940
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:53,420

943
00:42:58,130 --> 00:42:58,730
