00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,110
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,030
Didn't you touch her hand?

4
00:01:42,111 --> 00:01:43,030
Keep your voice down.

5
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,600
I told you to keep your voice down.

6
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,740
With my body and my age,

7
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,150
forget it.

8
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,740
You think about your age now?

9
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,620
You were 17 when you touched her hand.

10
00:01:55,844 --> 00:01:57,670
Now that you let go,
you are 70 years old.

11
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,310
Don't be such a loser, will you?

12
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,070
Self-awareness is a valuable trait.

13
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,380
Besides, I think...

14
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,980
I think Shen Qing and Lina

15
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,755
aren't particularly supportive of it.

16
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,310
Shen.

17
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,620
Taking good care of yourself

18
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,940
is the best support
you can give your children.

19
00:02:14,177 --> 00:02:15,133
Think about it.

20
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,710
If you take Ms. Lian home,

21
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,500
won't the whole family
welcome her with open arms?

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,500
I'm telling you.

23
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,940
Tomorrow is your last chance.

24
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:24,644
Confess to her.

25
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,660
Let the secret out.

26
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,340
Con...

27
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:29,900
Confess?

28
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,830
Isn't that too fast?

29
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,220
Look at you dawdling.

30
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,180
Do you want to be single forever?

31
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,060
Keep your voice down.

32
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,180
Don't be so mad. Come on.

33
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,660
Sit.

34
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:45,870
How...

35
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,460
How should I confess my feelings?

36
00:02:55,844 --> 00:02:57,622
I think you should sing a song for her.

37
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:58,940
Sing a song?

38
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,430
I can't sing.

39
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,110
Reciting a poem is my forte.

40
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,500
Fine.

41
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,390
Shen, please don't recite a poem.

42
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,440
Have you forgotten
about the Mid-Autumn Festival party?

43
00:03:08,444 --> 00:03:10,760
Didn't you land yourself in the hospital
with your recital?

44
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,590
Fine.

45
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,180
Enough of this.

46
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,150
Let's sing then.

47
00:03:15,444 --> 00:03:17,555
Poems express intent,
while songs perpetuate words.

48
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,500
Let's sing...

49
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,710
What song should I sing?

50
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,060
Why don't you sing the song
when I confessed my love?

51
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,110
"Wildflowers".

52
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,500
Let me tell you.

53
00:03:28,022 --> 00:03:29,310
As soon as I finished singing,

54
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,780
Tianzhen agreed immediately.

55
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,460
Is it that magical?

56
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,220
Wildflowers?

57
00:03:37,955 --> 00:03:38,955
How do you sing it?

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,911
Give me a minute.

59
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,150
Let me show you.

60
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,780
♪For whom
do wildflowers on the mountain♪

61
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,150
♪Bloom and fade?♪

62
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:05,460
♪Waiting quietly to see
if someone will pick them♪

63
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:06,890
The lyrics are quite well written.

64
00:04:06,897 --> 00:04:12,287
♪Just like that flower,
I wait for his arrival♪

65
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,860
Mom, I think Lian Yilian is quite good.

66
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,070
She's friendly.

67
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,980
She's even the head nurse.

68
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,390
A hospital remains unchanging,

69
00:04:22,444 --> 00:04:23,950
but patients come and go frequently.

70
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,711
Right? There are many people
who are better and younger

71
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,830
than your father-in-law.

72
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,420
A head nurse?

73
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,540
Why is she still single?

74
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,860
I heard it was because
she had to take care of her son.

75
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,030
Son?

76
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,340
Her son wasn't in good health.

77
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,070
Her son.

78
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,220
A son with poor health is scarier
than one who lives off his parents.

79
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,100
Right? She...

80
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,460
- I'll leave.
- Go.

81
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,955
- Go play for a while.
- I'll leave.

82
00:04:55,022 --> 00:04:55,822
Go play for a while.

83
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,390
I'm telling you.

84
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,830
She must have other intentions.

85
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,950
Mom, you're doing it again.

86
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,070
Is there now truth, goodness, and beauty
in the world?

87
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,270
Goodness and beauty.

88
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,155
I'm leaving then.

89
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:08,844
I'm telling you.

90
00:05:08,844 --> 00:05:11,400
Let me know when your father-in-law
is discharged from the hospital.

91
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,150
We'll get prepared, handle it swiftly,

92
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,980
and cut off all possibilities.

93
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:18,830
Mom.

94
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:20,400
I left an exercise book at school.

95
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,529
I have to go back and get it.

96
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,880
Why didn't you stay at school?

97
00:05:22,888 --> 00:05:24,155
I need to rush home to cook.

98
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,900
Didn't you take me away?

99
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:27,911
I'll take the subway and be back soon.

100
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,270
Be careful.

101
00:05:29,355 --> 00:05:30,888
- Got it.
- Watch out for the cars!

102
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,390
Lian, bed two has finished the IV drip.

103
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:36,780
Okay.

104
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,710
Lian, have you read the apology letter
from the family member who made a scene?

105
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,980
We've gotten justice.

106
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:41,860
Yay.

107
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:44,750
Lin.

108
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,300
Well...

109
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,950
I have something to do on Tuesday.

110
00:05:49,355 --> 00:05:50,622
Can I switch shifts with you?

111
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,660
Sure.

112
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:52,950
Thanks.

113
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,822
Professor Shen
is getting discharged on Tuesday.

114
00:05:56,888 --> 00:05:58,666
Are you
not going to bid goodbye to him?

115
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,420
No need.

116
00:06:06,761 --> 00:06:12,557
♪For whom do wildflowers on the mountain

118
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,150

119
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,390
Why are you here?

120
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,220
I'm here to see you, Grandpa.

121
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,950
Will you be discharged
the day after tomorrow?

122
00:06:23,955 --> 00:06:25,111
Yes, sit down.

123
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,300
Grandpa.

124
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,270
Is Ms. Lian your girlfriend now?

125
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,220
No.

126
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:37,488
Don't talk nonsense.

127
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,340
No.

128
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,070
You...

129
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,100
You haven't confessed?

130
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:43,750
No.

131
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,300
Grandpa.

132
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,340
Didn't you tell me

133
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,540
that courage is the greatest quality
of a human being?

134
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,150
You got to be brave.

135
00:06:56,422 --> 00:06:58,311
I was going to give this
to someone else.

136
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,644
I'll let you use it first.

137
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,390
Take it.

138
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:09,860
Who is it for?

139
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:11,540
Don't ask.

140
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,190
I won't tell you even if you ask me.

141
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:15,590
Grandpa.

142
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,270
I'll tell you when you succeed.

143
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,340
You have secrets now.

144
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:27,780
Grandpa.

145
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,030
Grandma appeared in my dream.

146
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,630
She told me

147
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,540
she came into this world with nothing

148
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,510
and took a lot of love with her
when she left.

149
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,300
She's satisfied.

150
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,780
She wants to thank you,

151
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,420
but she's shy.

152
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,860
Because we Chinese always say

153
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,200
that family members
don't need to be formal with each other.

154
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,390
Yes.

155
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,780
But she still has to say it.

156
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,150
Otherwise,

157
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,340
how will you know
she gave you a five-star rating?

158
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,300
Really?

159
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,190
Of course.

160
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,220
Tell me

161
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,390
what else did Grandma say?

162
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,590
Grandma also asked you

163
00:08:16,688 --> 00:08:19,488
to love the sunshine on sunny days
and love the rain on rainy days.

164
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:24,780
Grandpa.

165
00:08:27,377 --> 00:08:28,630
Grandma wants you to be happy.

166
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,900
You're quite a smooth talker.

167
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,750
Lide Pharmaceutical has a patent

168
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,390
called NPI.

169
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,940
Dr. Qin suggested that we bring it in.

170
00:08:49,973 --> 00:08:51,380
(Shen Dai)

171
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,820
Go on.

172
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,780
This is a tumor blood vessel disruptor.

173
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,180
It's effective

174
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,300
for our M701 and M703 targeted drugs.

175
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,180
If the introduction is successful,

176
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,870
it will greatly accelerate
our research and development.

177
00:09:06,266 --> 00:09:07,470
It's almost time to start work.

178
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,230
I'll ask Jin to send an email
to inquire about the price.

179
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,990
Because there are many companies

180
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,030
eyeing this patent.

181
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,540
So we must hurry up.

182
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,350
If you have any specialized inquiries,

183
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,870
consult Dr. Qin.

184
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:21,470
If you have any questions, just ask me.

185
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:23,150
I'll go work on my experiment first.

186
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:23,820
Okay, thank you.

187
00:09:23,844 --> 00:09:25,400
- Dr. Qin, thank you.
- It's okay.

188
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:31,350
I was embarrassed to say
when the scientist was here.

189
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,510
About the price...

190
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,660
Don't worry.

191
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,780
I'll ask the finance team

192
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,350
to calculate the cost-effectiveness.

193
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:40,059
It's a good thing
that I recruited you from the Big Four.

194
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,090
Otherwise, what would I do?

195
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,400
Stop making random confessions.

196
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,780
Alright, go home. It's getting late.

197
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,230
Go home?

198
00:09:46,288 --> 00:09:47,800
My dad will be discharged.

199
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:49,470
I have a lot of work to do.

200
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,933
I'll go back to work.

201
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:52,133
Don't exhaust yourself.

202
00:09:52,177 --> 00:09:53,180
You should hurry home.

203
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,540
I have plans tonight.

204
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,666
Take good care of yourself.

205

I got to go.

213
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:26,630
Okay.

214
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:39,750

I'm old

218
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,750
and in poor health.

219
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,110
God arranged for me

220
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,900
to be hospitalized here
so that I could meet you.

221
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,870
I can't let God down.

222
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,700
I...

223
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,940
I wrote an acrostic poem for you.

224
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,470
Listen to the rain under the roof.

225
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,420
You're as beautiful
as tomorrow's flower.

226

Lone figure on a spring night.

227
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,900
I want to confess to you my secret.

228
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,180
I now change "My secret"
to "Until we grow old together".

229
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,630
I want to confess to you
until we grow old together.

230
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,820
I want to be with you.

231
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,580
Let's be together as long as we can.

232
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,150
Chocolates from my grandson.

233
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,350
There are even chocolates.

234
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,900
I'll apply some glue

235
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,270
on this handrail.

236
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,700
Your father can use it

237
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,333
when he comes home tomorrow.

238
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,300
Shen Qing.

239
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,300
Shen Qing.

240
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:48,750
Look.

241
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,060
Set an alarm on my phone.

242
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,270
The doctor said

243
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,750
your father has several medicines
that he has to take on time.

244
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,300
What time should I set?

245
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,700
Two are before dinner.

246
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,660
Two are after dinner.

247
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,110
Here?

248
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:00,940
Yes.

249
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,110

00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,420
Weren't you going home on Tuesday?

253
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,230
That's right, Dad.

254
00:13:12,288 --> 00:13:13,750
I'll get discharged when I recover.

255
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,460
What difference
does Monday or Tuesday make?

256
00:13:15,466 --> 00:13:16,640
It's not a good place, right?

257
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,180
Shen Duole, what's going on?

258
00:13:24,577 --> 00:13:25,750
What's that supposed to mean?

259
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,870
What gestures are those?

260
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,150
Fine.

261
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,630
I'll explain.

262
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,230
In-laws.

263
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,110
Ever since Jingmin died,

264
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,780
I've been depressed.

265
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,700
Today, I took the first step

266
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,660
to express my feelings to Ms. Lian.

267
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,900
Duole said it well.

268
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:46,780
Duole told me

269
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,230
to love the sunshine on sunny days

270
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:49,844
and love the rain on rainy days.

271
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,350
What was I like in the past?

272
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,660
I was afraid of the sun on sunny days

273
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:55,644
and scared of getting wet on rainy days.

274
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,630
I want to change
my attitude toward life.

275
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,700
I get it now.

276
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,030
If I live my life well,

277
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,510
it will be the greatest support
for my children.

278
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:07,660

280
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,870
I remember the shoes.

281
00:14:10,177 --> 00:14:11,911
You don't need Shen Qin to buy them now.

282
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:13,150
I know how to order online now.

283
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,270
Just wait for delivery.

284
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,420
By the way,
I would like to solemnly say this.

285
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,750
During my time in hospital,

286
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,580
you all have been busy running around

287
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,300
and worried.

288
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,060

Yes.

300
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,180
No longer
listening to "Butterfly Lovers"?

301

Not bad.

302
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:09,940
Dad has cheered up.

303
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,270

Hospitals

305
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,117
are good schools.

306

307
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,510

naturally become clear to them.

311
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,820
Why do I feel like
you mean something else?

312
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,990
Are you hiding something from me?

313
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,060
No.

314
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,300
Really.

315
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,350
Why close the door then?

316
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,288
Just say what you want to say.

317
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,820
You made me say it.

318
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,230
I just think

319
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,540
love is really nourishing.

320
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,900
Shen Dai, why don't you find a partner?

321
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,030
Liu Lina.

322
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,150
Do women like matchmaking

323
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,700

00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:00,940
Shen Dai.

325
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,133
Alright, I'll stop talking.

326
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,180
I'm busy. Bye.

327
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,150
Shen Qing.

328
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,750
How can your sister
be so unappreciative?

329
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,180
What did she do?

330
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,420
I just asked her to find a partner,

331
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,150
and she got angry with me.

332
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:18,060
She even asked,

333
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,350
"Do women like matchmaking
when they get older?"

334
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,660
I sincerely thank your whole family.

335
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,700
Calling me old?

336
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:25,900
I got older
from doing chores for your family.

337
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,300
She's been hurt in relationships before.

338
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,350
You know that.

339
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,110
That scumbag
had her wrapped around his finger,

340
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,510
and she endured it in silence.

341
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,580
No need to bring up irrelevant history.

342
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,660
If I don't talk about it,
no one in your family will.

343
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,230
Shen Dai is still living abroad
at an old age.

344
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,820
She's all alone.

345
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,533
What should she do when she gets old?

346
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:46,580
Besides,

347
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,355
when are you going to tell your sister

348
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,540
about your dad and Ms. Lian?

349
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,180
Don't bother.

350
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,111
I'll find a chance to tell her.

351
00:17:02,577 --> 00:17:04,340
(WeChat: Shen Dai)
She's complaining about me.

352
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,860
Qing, control your wife.

353
00:17:06,977 --> 00:17:08,540
Can she have some sense of boundaries?

354
00:17:08,644 --> 00:17:10,380
She keeps persuading me to get married.

355
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,820
Is her own marriage successful?

356
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:14,580
Don't I know what it's like

357
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,580
when you two argue?

358
00:17:15,888 --> 00:17:17,444
What's that supposed to mean?

359
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,430
How would your sister know

360
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,380
when we argue?

361
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,300
How do I know how she knew?

362
00:17:22,511 --> 00:17:24,333
You don't want this marriage anymore,
do you?

363
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,380
You even told your sister.

364
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,230
Don't over interpret it. Well...

365
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,780
Come on. Let's review it.

366
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,710
Why do we always argue?

367
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,470
Are you kidding me?

368
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,710
Reviewing
when we've been married for years?

369
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,780
This...

370
00:17:38,644 --> 00:17:39,750
How could I have forgotten?

371
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,470
An Ruifeng asked me to go
to the company for a meeting today.

372
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,710
How could I forget?

373
00:17:44,577 --> 00:17:46,140
You only have one day off every week.

374
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,140
Yet you still can't rest?

375
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,430
We're a startup company.

376
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,690
Just wait until we get listed.

377
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,780
Listed? Listed for what?

378
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,670
I'm leaving.

379
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,380
Will you be back for lunch?

380
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:56,844
I'll order takeout.
Don't bother.

381
00:17:56,844 --> 00:17:58,488
I've already bought the ingredients.

382
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:00,710
Shen Duole.

383
00:18:00,777 --> 00:18:01,839
Where are you going?

384
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,600
I'm going to the library
with my classmates

385
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,177
to study for excellence.

386
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:19,540
Yilian.

387
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,750
What are you doing?

388
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,780
I just bought some food.

389
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,711
I'm going back to work
after I finish eating.

390
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,990
Where are you?

391
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,860
I'm about to go to the library.

392
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,510
Look.

393
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:31,470
Behind me.

394
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,620
Did you see?

395
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,820
There are many lively elderly.

396
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,300
I still think you're the healthiest.

397
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:40,733
I still have to work hard.

398
00:18:41,044 --> 00:18:42,059
I need to work hard.

399
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,790
Have you taken
your blood pressure medicine?

400
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:46,470
Not yet.

401
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,710
How worrying.

402
00:18:50,777 --> 00:18:52,755
You have to take
antihypertensive drugs regularly.

403
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,620
Otherwise, it will harm your health.

404
00:18:56,466 --> 00:18:58,270
I've taken my medicine.
I'm just kidding you.

405
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,540
But

406
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,950
I feel like I can't live

407
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,710
without you.

408
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,670
Alright, I'll stop talking.

409
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:07,950
I have to go back to work.

410
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,840
I'm entering the building now.
The signal is bad.

411
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:10,955
Let's talk later.

412
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,190
Okay.

413
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,300
Yilian.

414
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,950
Don't work too hard.

415
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,466
I'll be waiting for your call
at anytime and anywhere.

416
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:19,950
Alright.

417
00:19:32,977 --> 00:19:33,933
Okay, it's lunchtime.

418
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:34,610
Hello, Ms. Lian.

419
00:19:38,817 --> 00:19:41,530
(Ms. Yilian, I really need you.)

420
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,100
Dad.

421
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,510
Duole and Shen Qing aren't home,

422
00:20:01,622 --> 00:20:02,910
so let's have rice with toppings.

423
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,670
Today...

424
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,688
Where did the food come from?

425
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:08,580
Coming.

426
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:09,860
All done.

427
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,300
Hello.

428
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:12,950
Ms. Lian.

429
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,140
Professor Shen happens to like
snails stuffed with meat.

430
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,222
I know how to make it.

431
00:20:17,288 --> 00:20:18,140
It smells really good.

432
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,300
Yilian.

433
00:20:19,555 --> 00:20:21,955
I'll ask my children
to call you Aunt Lian from now on.

434
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,270
Sure.

435
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,140
I think it's a good idea.

436
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,380
Aunt Lian? Will it make you sound old?

437
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,380
No, I think it's pretty good.

438
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,866
Just do whatever Professor Shen says.

439
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,266
Get her a set

440
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,820
- of bowl and chopsticks.
- Okay.

441
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,060
I'll get them myself.

442
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,710
Just sit down.

443
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,470
Just eat the ready-made food today.

444
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,340
Sit down.

445
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,100
Sure.

446
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,950
I'll eat this then.

447
00:20:43,622 --> 00:20:45,266
Don't just eat the rice with toppings.

448
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,030
You can eat whatever you want.

449
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,340
Here.

450
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,750
Try Aunt Lian's cooking.

451
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,270
When eating shrimp,

452
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,380
you must remove
the black vein in the middle.

453
00:20:56,977 --> 00:20:58,577
Although it's a bit troublesome,

454
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,140
it doesn't bother me.

455
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:00,950
Look.

456
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,430
Professor Shen,
you have such skillful hands.

457
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:07,910
Look.

458
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:08,860
It's out now.

459
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,780
It's true.

460
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,710
It doesn't bother me.

461
00:21:12,377 --> 00:21:13,270
Why aren't you eating?

462
00:21:14,377 --> 00:21:15,911
Here, dig in. Dip it in vinegar.

463
00:21:17,866 --> 00:21:18,300
Come on.

464
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:18,780
Dig in.

465
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,430
Dig in.

466
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:19,950
Okay.

467
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,100
I'm going to eat this snail.

468
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,950
Dad, you guys eat.

469
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,100
I'll go home to put away the clothes.

470
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:30,060
I'll go back and eat.

471
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:30,780
Sure.

472
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,100
Let me add more food for you.

473
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,820
Okay, sure.

474
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,380
It's enough.

475
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,400
Let me give you some more.

476
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,030
No need.

477
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,688
You guys eat.

478
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,750
Lina.

479
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,060
Recently,

480
00:21:40,444 --> 00:21:41,977
I keep forgetting to take my medicine.

481
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,510
It's dangerous if I don't take
the high blood pressure medicine.

482
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,380
I asked Aunt Lian to supervise me.

483
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,910
Tell Shen Qing

484
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,620
that Aunt Lian will move in next week.

485
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,510
Here.

486
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:02,540
This one.

487
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:04,780
Don't work so hard
that you end up not eating.

488
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,340
Okay.

489
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,710
Fragrance.

490
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:17,710
Shen Qing.

491
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,910
Your stepmother is coming.

492
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,190
Stepmother?

493
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,622
What nonsense are you talking about?

494
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,950
Ms. Lian is moving in.

495
00:22:26,222 --> 00:22:27,270
They're moving in together.

496
00:22:28,733 --> 00:22:31,060
It's going to rain,
and your dad is going to get married.

497
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,100
This isn't
a simple romantic relationship.

498
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,750
Shen Qing.

499
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,888
Your stepmother
is only a few years older than you.

500
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:37,950
How do you feel?

501
00:22:38,177 --> 00:22:40,100
It's not even settled yet.
Don't talk nonsense.

502
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,510
"High blood pressure is dangerous,"

503
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,190
"so I've asked Aunt Lian
to supervise me."

504
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,820
Am I not a human being?
Can't I supervise him?

505
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,620
I've already set the alarm on my phone

506
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,820
to ring three times a day.

507
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:54,820
No, they're moving in together?

508
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,780
Isn't it too fast?

509
00:22:57,177 --> 00:22:59,400
Shen Dai doesn't even know
about their relationship yet.

510
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,140
Now great.

511
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,030
She'll explode.

512
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,340
Don't tell Dai.

513
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:04,190
It's already chaotic enough.

514
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,733
She'll make a scene if she finds out.

515
00:23:05,733 --> 00:23:07,000
Are we not going to say anything?

516
00:23:07,288 --> 00:23:09,000
Are we keeping it a secret forever?

517
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,540
Now,

518
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,230
this new lung cancer-targeted drug,
M701,

519
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,270
has entered
the first phase of clinical trials.

520
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,470
Your company's patented NPI

521
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,580
will greatly advance
the research and development.

522
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,030
Once M701 is successfully launched,

523
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,860
the tumor remission rate
for terminal lung cancer

524
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:30,380
will reach 62.9%.

525
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:32,470
It's amazing.

526
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,950
What you have here is truly amazing.

527
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,030
My mother had primary lung cancer.

528
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,750
Five years later,
it metastasized to the breast

529
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,060
chest, and head.

530
00:23:43,377 --> 00:23:44,911
In the end, her illness was beyond cure.

531
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,580
So M701 holds extraordinary significance

532
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,430
for me.

533
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,510
During business negotiation,

534
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:55,340
we shouldn't
talk about our private affairs,

535
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,060
but why did we bring it up?

536
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,510
It's because we want to express

537
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,990
that this matter is closely related

538
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,990
to all of us.

539
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,510
It's also to express our sincerity
in purchasing.

540
00:24:06,288 --> 00:24:08,510
We also know that any patent's
research and development

541
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,470
is very difficult.

542
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,430
The effort and cost invested

543
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,190
can't be measured in money,

544
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:13,670
but

545
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,100
given our company's current strength,

546
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,780
the highest price

547
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,380
we can offer

548
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,030
is 6.8 million US dollars.

549
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,060
Mr. An, Mr. Shen.

550
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,710
We will be honored if we can contribute

551
00:24:42,777 --> 00:24:44,377
to the Chinese pharmaceutical industry.

552
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,860
We also recognize

553
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,300
that China is a huge market.

554
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,430
So

555
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,860
we also hope to achieve

556
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,820
a deep and close cooperation
with your company.

557
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,140
We accept

558
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:56,620
this price.

559
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,100
Great.

560
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,300
Thank you.

561
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,510
Thank you.

562
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:02,340
Thank you.

563
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:02,950
Thank you.

564
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:04,340
Thank you.

565
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,510
Let me tell you, Peng Yulan.

566
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,230
There are many outstanding females,

567
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,750
but I highly recommend you.

568
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,710
Just rest for a while in the hospital.

569
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,470
Look at the old man.

570
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:21,270
It's been more than half a month
since he was discharged.

571
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,820
There's no movement at all.

572
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,670
The head nurse is young,

573
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,580
so she has a lot of options.

574
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,030
Right?

575
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,430
You should have confidence.

576
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,769
- You can't...
- I'll do it myself.

577
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,459
You have a chance.

578
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,060
No.

579
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:31,540
Let's go.

580
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,600
Why did you take that?

581
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:33,820
No problem.

582
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:34,540
Can you do it?

583
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,488
- Yes.
- Oh my God.

584
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:39,780
Oh no.

585
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,860
It's a big deal this time.

586
00:25:42,155 --> 00:25:42,860
It's a big deal.

587
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,030
No, I'll stop talking.

588
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:45,750
I'll stop talking.

589
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,711
I'll hang up first.

590
00:25:54,711 --> 00:25:55,910
- Shen Qing is back.
- This...

591
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,710
You came back just in time.

592
00:25:58,533 --> 00:26:00,022
- This is...
- We're moving.

593
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,860
Hurry up.

594
00:26:01,044 --> 00:26:02,030
No need to bother him.

595
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,140
Hurry. Here.

596
00:26:04,266 --> 00:26:05,190
Don't just stand there.

597
00:26:05,555 --> 00:26:06,340
- Move.
- Sorry.

598
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,088
Move it upstairs.

599
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,910
Why are there so many things?

600
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,060
What's going on?

601
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,910
Mom, you came.

602
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:13,950
No.

603
00:26:14,066 --> 00:26:14,910
Let me introduce you.

604
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,470
This is...

605
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,060
Ms. Lian. My father's...

606
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:20,860
We've met.

607
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,600
Yes, they've met.

608
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,820
We've met in the hospital.

609
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,230
Shen Qing.

610
00:26:24,422 --> 00:26:26,644
You can't move these things
with these clothes on.

611
00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:28,666
Why are you moving items
wearing branded clothes?

612
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,822
- Well...
- Forget it...

613
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,100
I'm telling you, Ms. Lian.

614
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,820
Shen Qing has a successful career.

615
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,190
Yet you asked him to carry things.

616
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:34,620
Give me.

617
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,430
No, why let him carry so many things?

618
00:26:36,644 --> 00:26:39,155
I raise my son for so long
but only use him for a moment.

619
00:26:39,155 --> 00:26:40,088
What's wrong with that?

620
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,470
Go.

621
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,140
You're really careful
with how you use your son.

622
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,470
He still needs to make money.

623
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,230
Alright.

624
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,990
Let me formally introduce you.

625
00:26:48,355 --> 00:26:50,000
Because I just got discharged,

626
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,190
I need Lian to take care of me.

627
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,060
So she moved here.

628
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,860
This is Lina's mother.

629
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,670
My in-law, Sun Baoqin.

630
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,270
Sun Baoqin.

631
00:27:00,866 --> 00:27:02,422
Let's officially get to know each other.

632
00:27:02,444 --> 00:27:04,711
- I'm Lian Yilian.
- Yes. You two should get to know each other.

633
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,300
Great.

634
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,380
Sorry to bother you, Ms. Lian.

635
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,340
The old cadre...

636
00:27:09,555 --> 00:27:11,620
The old cadre's hospital ward
has been moved home.

637
00:27:11,622 --> 00:27:14,222
We don't have to go to the hospital
when we're sick from now on.

638
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,380
We'll just find you.

639
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:15,860
Sure.

640
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,570
- No...
- Just tell me if you need anything.

641
00:27:17,577 --> 00:27:19,860
Find me for these things.

642
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,340
I'll do these things.

643
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,230
No.

644
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,990
Let me tell you. When I was young...

645
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,149
You're not that young anymore.

646
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:25,910
It doesn't matter.

647
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,820
Back in our factory,
I carried the blower...

648
00:27:27,822 --> 00:27:28,910
How could I let you help me?

649
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:29,950
No, give them to me.

650
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:30,977
You have a small physique.

651
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,270
You can do the injections

652
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:33,270
and give out medicine.

653
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,860
Let me do the work
of the laboring people.

654
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,270
Don't snatch it from me.

655
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:37,820
You two should stop arguing.

656
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,340
Press the elevator button for her.

657
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,580
Okay.

658
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,750
Let me take this.

659
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,270
Alright, go.

660
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,620
- I'll press...
- Press the button.

661
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:45,466
Go and press it.

662
00:27:45,555 --> 00:27:46,670
Hurry. Don't worry about this.

663
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:52,580
You're back.

664
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,140
What happened?

665
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,780
Didn't you go to negotiate?

666
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,910
How come you're so tired?

667
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:02,644
What else can it be?

668
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,270
Downstairs.

669
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,950
My dad caught me

670
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:06,950
to help him move things.

671
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,911
Whose stuff are you moving?

672
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,950
Whose stuffs do you think they are?

673
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:11,910
Ms. Lian?

674
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,580
Is she already moving in?

675
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,230
By the way, your mom is downstairs too.

676
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,140
Let me see.

677
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:18,540
It's okay.

678
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:19,270
Are you tired?

679
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,190
- It's okay.
- Mom.

680
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,750
Put it down.

681
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,888
Let me get you some water.

682
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,190
It's quite heavy.

683
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,340
I'm born to work.

684
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,340
Look.

685
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:27,950
Thank you.

686
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,219
- It's okay.
- You're sweating.

687
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:29,990
Give her some water.

688
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,044
If it weren't for your mother,

689
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,990
who knows when this pile of stuff

690
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,510
will be moved up here.

691
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:36,140
Alright.

692
00:28:36,555 --> 00:28:37,030
It's okay.

693
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,733
Don't move any more things.
Let me do it.

694
00:28:38,866 --> 00:28:39,430
By the way,

695
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:40,950
Lina's mom,

696
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,430
I bought you the shoes.

697
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,780
Give it to your mom.

698
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,190
Thank you, Dad.

699
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,600
I'm telling you.

700
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:49,140
I spent a day searching online
to find this.

701
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,580
It suits your mom's temperament.

702
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,140
Is that so?

703
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,030
Try them on now.

704
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,580
Thank you, Zhuoran.

705
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,270
Thank you.

706
00:28:56,977 --> 00:28:57,780
Do you like them?

707
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,300
Yes.

708
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,430
They suit me very well.

709
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:00,710
Good.

710
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,990
Very good. They look like
they suit me at first glance.

711
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,540
I don't need...

712
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:08,670
Alright, let's get to work.

713
00:29:08,733 --> 00:29:09,670
What are you doing here?

714
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,300
Get to work.

715
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,230
Don't just stand there.

716
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,270
Let me do these.

717
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:13,288
Let me put it there.

718
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:22,860
Alright.

719
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,620
- I...
- Leave it here for now.

720
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:25,540
Ms. Lian.

721
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,620
Are your clothes

722
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,710
supposed to go

723
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,030
in that room?

724
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:30,430
Let me.

725
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,030
Don't bother.

726
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,866
Let me do it.

727
00:29:32,866 --> 00:29:33,380
It's heavy.

728
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,190
It's okay.

729
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,030
It's not heavy.

730
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:35,860
Ms. Lian.

731
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,030
Are these

732
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,190
osmanthus?

733
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:39,100
Yes.

734
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:00,950
Lina.

735
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,620
I think we should move this easel

736
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,950
to Shen Dai's room.

737
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,100
Isn't it just fine to put it here?

738
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,580
Mom, don't be bossy.

739
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,820
Ms. Lian has many things.

740
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,340
You need to make room for her.

741
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,270
Alright.

742
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,780
Let's do it together.

743
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,780
I can do it alone.

744
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,340
How about...

745
00:30:20,355 --> 00:30:20,910
Let me help...

746
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:21,710
I'll do it later.

747
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,340
No.

748
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,300
Don't worry about it.

749
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,060
Be careful.

750
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,030
Be careful. Don't break it. Be careful.

751
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:27,511
Well...

752
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,060
You even close the door?

753
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,540
What did I say?

754
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,950
What did I say?

755
00:30:39,066 --> 00:30:39,780
What did you say?

756
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:41,380
Men

757
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,140
can't live without women,
no matter how old they are.

758
00:30:44,533 --> 00:30:45,580
Look at your father-in-law.

759
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,140
He's so fast.

760
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,710
The spaceship has entered the house.

761
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,340
Mom, think positively.

762
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,430
Someone is taking care of Dad.

763
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,860
And she's a professional.

764
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,470
Anyway, it's done.

765
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,910
We can only let them be.

766
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,140
Right?

767
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,030
But

768
00:31:06,444 --> 00:31:08,100
it's not bad that your father-in-law

769
00:31:08,422 --> 00:31:09,380
found someone younger.

770
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,470
You don't need to serve him.

771
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:12,580
But

772
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,270
keep an eye

773
00:31:14,377 --> 00:31:15,780
on your father-in-law's salary card

774
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,860
and property deed.

775
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,100
Those are for Duole.

776
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,620
You can't let down your guard.

777
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,620
How could I even see his salary card?

778
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,990
How could you be so useless?

779
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,030
Look, you have to be tough.

780
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:29,190
Do you know?

781
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:31,511
Other things aside,
let's just talk about Duole.

782
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,540
He's clever.

783
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,510
His athletic ability is well-developed.

784
00:31:35,577 --> 00:31:36,444
Who shall we thank?

785
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:38,270
It's our family's genetics.

786
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,270
The Shen family

787
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:43,580
are all blockheads.

788
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,230
So you have to be tough.

789
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,540
Be confident.

790
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:47,860
Look.

791
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,100
The outsider has moved in.

792
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,100
Mom, do you think you're singing?
Soften your voice.

793
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,230
The outsider has moved in.

794
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,244
You need to improve...

795
00:31:57,333 --> 00:31:58,190
Okay, I got it.

796
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,470
Stop talking and go out.

797
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,340
Okay.

798
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,540
Ms. Lian, there...

799
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,270
There are so many clothes.

800
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,470
Do you want to move all of them
into the room?

801
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,820
Put the shoes in first.

802
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:11,860
Gosh.

803
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,910
Mom, these shoes...

804
00:32:13,111 --> 00:32:13,820
Put them in there.

805
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,270
These shoes are beautiful.

806
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:18,620
I think you should buy a pair like this.

807
00:32:19,066 --> 00:32:22,044
They're pretty, but I can't wear
something with diamonds like this.

808
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,580
Ms. Lian can wear it.

809
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,510
Why can't you wear it? Right?

810
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:28,060
Women should shine
when they need to shine.

811
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,540
Ms. Lian, don't you think so?

812
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,430
Yes.

813
00:32:31,066 --> 00:32:32,950
Leave them there.
I'll sort them out later.

814
00:32:33,044 --> 00:32:34,333
Alright, stop sitting there.

815
00:32:34,422 --> 00:32:35,510
Hurry up and work.

816
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,670
Don't worry about me. This is fine.

817
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,580
Let's go.

818
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,860
It's okay.

819
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:48,990
A four-piece set?

820
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,470
How elegant.

821
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,580
It's good.

822
00:32:52,088 --> 00:32:53,311
What are you using them on?

823
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,030
I'll do it myself.

824
00:32:56,155 --> 00:32:57,511
You two can do something else.

825
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,340
You have to wash them first.

826
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,300
You have to wash them.

827
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,300
I've washed them.

828
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:06,710
Okay.

829
00:33:07,311 --> 00:33:08,888
Let's change all the sheets.

830
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,355
Ms. Lian, to tell the truth.

831
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,620
I really admire you.

832
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,340
You're really adaptable.

833
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,190
I can't do it. Really.

834
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:21,400
If I sleep in a new bed,
I won't be able to fall asleep.

835
00:33:21,622 --> 00:33:22,860
We always work the night shift.

836
00:33:24,155 --> 00:33:25,580
The bed doesn't bother us anymore.

837
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,540
We'll take a nap in the lounge
whenever we can.

838
00:33:30,822 --> 00:33:32,820
My mother-in-law
loved this coarse bed sheet

839
00:33:32,822 --> 00:33:34,190
before she passed away.

840
00:33:34,822 --> 00:33:36,100
I have to keep it for her.

841
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:36,750
Sure.

842
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:45,540
Let's go.

843
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:46,470
Okay.

844
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,400
There's one more here.

845
00:33:47,422 --> 00:33:48,000
Thank you.

846
00:33:48,022 --> 00:33:48,866
Don't mention it.

847
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:49,470
Thank you.

848
00:33:53,688 --> 00:33:54,679
Where are you going?

849
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,509
To help with moving.

850
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,470
No need.
My mom has moved everything upstairs.

851
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,100
No.

852
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,710
Mom isn't young.
What if she exhausts herself?

853
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,340
The Liu family

854
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,140
is committed to serving the Shen family.

855
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,430
But Ms. Lian also caused my mom

856
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:10,350
to exert herself.

857
00:34:11,822 --> 00:34:12,580
I'll talk to Dad.

858
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,030
He can order me around,

859
00:34:14,155 --> 00:34:16,266
but it's inappropriate
to order Mom around like this.

860
00:34:16,266 --> 00:34:16,933
Don't go.

861
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,044
You'll get mad after you go.

862
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:19,700
What's wrong?

863
00:34:20,244 --> 00:34:22,688
The female head of the household
is being replaced.

864
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,933
A big change is happening.

865
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,866
Even the bed sheet has been removed.

866
00:34:28,288 --> 00:34:29,790
Love the sunshine on sunny days.

867
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,470
This is too fast.

868
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,430
This is too much.

869
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:40,950
My mom is right.

870
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,740
Once a man decides to move on,

871
00:34:43,088 --> 00:34:44,350
he'll take action decisively.

872
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,350
These are Mom's favorite coarse cloth.

873
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:50,830
I took them back as a keepsake.

874
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,470
This is too fast.

875
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:08,220
Dear.

876
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,830
Let's treasure them.

877
00:35:39,311 --> 00:35:40,177
What's wrong?

878
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,100
I'll take it away.

879
00:35:47,066 --> 00:35:48,430
How did Jingmin's slippers

880
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:49,740
get here?

881
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:16,580
You...

882
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,580
Sleep here.

883
00:36:20,288 --> 00:36:21,800
I'm afraid that it's chilly over there.

884
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,620
Do you think

885
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,870
I'm a bit too hasty

886
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,430
in moving here?

887
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,140
No.

888
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,430
You're not hasty at all.

889
00:36:45,711 --> 00:36:47,711
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

890
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,030
Duole.

891
00:38:07,422 --> 00:38:09,244
Stop studying. Go brush your teeth.

892
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,510
Dear, why are you washing it now?

893
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,830
Just let me do it.

894
00:38:12,844 --> 00:38:14,100
I washed it while I was at it.

895
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,910
There's no sunshine.

896
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:17,660
Duole.

897
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,910
Where are you doing?

898
00:38:19,022 --> 00:38:21,222
I want to ask Grandpa
about a Chinese language question.

899
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:22,422
You're not allowed to go.

900
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,430
You're not allowed to go tonight.

901
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,310
Grandpa is asleep.

902
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,180
Which color should I use?

903
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:43,700
Use green.

904
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,688
Green is refreshing and healthy.

905
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,180
How about this?

906
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:50,140
Use orange for these three
to make them more obvious.

907
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:50,740
Right?

908
00:38:51,777 --> 00:38:52,990
Let's do whatever you say.

909
00:38:53,822 --> 00:38:55,022
Let's do whatever you say.

910
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:58,950
Dad.

911
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:01,580
Aunt Lian.

912
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,620
I washed the sheets.

913
00:39:03,644 --> 00:39:05,030
I'll leave them in Shen Dai's room.

914
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,220
Okay, thank you.

915
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,430
Thank you.

916
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:12,790
Right?

917
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,580
How about you write down

918
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,060
saffron

919
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,990
and goji berries?

920
00:39:19,911 --> 00:39:22,220
How do I write
the Chinese character for "Saffron"?

921
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,140
I suddenly forgot.

922
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:26,259
That's because
you keep playing with your phone.

923
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,310
Here, get a piece of paper.

924
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,890
- I'll tell you how to write it.
- Okay.

925
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,220
Grass radical.

926
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:31,950
Grass radical.

927
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,700
Write the stroke correctly,

928
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,740
and you'll be able to remember
the character easily.

929
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:40,540
Right?

930
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,180
You write it nicer.

931
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:45,430
Lina.

932
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:46,100
Dad.

933
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,790
What are you writing?

934
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,390
I... Well...

935
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,100
Ms. Lian made me

936
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,030
a clock-in form for taking medicine.

937
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,950
She said it'll be easier to remember.

938
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,260
I won't forget what I eat.

939
00:39:58,830 --> 00:39:59,700
How professional.

940
00:39:59,977 --> 00:40:01,000
It's clear at a glance.

941
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:01,688
Come on.

942
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,060
This will do.

943
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,470
Let's change to another color.

944
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,022
What color do you want to change to?

945
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,510
This yellow one then.

946
00:40:09,155 --> 00:40:11,177
Look at this.
Which one do you think is better?

947
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:12,830
Okay.

948
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,100
My grandson sent me something.

949
00:40:23,733 --> 00:40:24,470
What did he send?

950
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,430
I want to be

951
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:29,740
with you.

952
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,555
Let's be together as long as we can.

953
00:40:33,711 --> 00:40:35,220
The combined age of these two people

954
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,660
goes back to the Qing Dynasty,

955
00:40:36,866 --> 00:40:37,870
yet they're doing this.

956
00:40:55,345 --> 00:40:59,640
(May Your Wish Come True)

957
00:41:08,511 --> 00:41:09,470
What are you doing?

958
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:11,030
Didn't you ask me

959
00:41:11,266 --> 00:41:12,577
to like everything you post?

960
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,510
You can't like this one.

961
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:15,740
You can't like this one.

962
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,030
Alright.

963
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,510
I'll delete it.

964
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,140
I'll repost.

965
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:20,990
I can't like it?

966
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,350
I'm telling you.

967
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:29,430
I'll delete this and repost it.
Don't like it.

968
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,660
I won't.

969
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:43,990
I want to be

970
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,310
with you.

971
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,950
Let's be together as long as we can.

972
00:41:59,140 --> 00:41:59,790
Keep quiet.

973
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,100
Dai.

974
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,470
Dai's WeChat.

975
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,100
Hello?

976
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:09,540
Dai.

977
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,470
Hello.

978
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:11,430
Aunt.

979
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,510
Can you talk now?

980
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,755
I have something to ask you.

981
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:15,950
I can talk.

982
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:16,870
Go ahead.

983
00:42:17,311 --> 00:42:18,580
Is my dad in a relationship?

984
00:42:19,666 --> 00:42:20,910
Is your dad in a relationship?

985
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:22,510
Well...

986
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,350
Dai, why did you think of asking this?

987
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,140
Darn it.

988
00:42:30,444 --> 00:42:32,310
You saw what I posted on Moments,
didn't you?

989
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:35,100
I forgot about it.

990
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:36,180
Aunt.

991
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:37,990
What happened?

992
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:39,660
Dai.

993
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,100
If I tell you,

994
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,510
don't tell anyone

995
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:45,180
I told you. Okay?

996
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:47,180
Look.

997
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:50,030
Shen Qing
doesn't want to tell you either, right?

998
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,180
Your dad...

999
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,220
Your dad is not only in a relationship,

1000
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,470
but Ms. Lian has also moved in.

1001
00:42:58,533 --> 00:43:00,140
She even changed your mother's bedsheets

1002
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,620
to hers.

1003
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:02,870
