00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:38,150
=Episode 8=

3
00:01:38,153 --> 00:01:38,829
Come on.

4
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:39,933
- Raise...
- I've noticed

5
00:01:40,022 --> 00:01:42,230
you have become a good drinker now.

6
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:43,112
Take a look at me.

7
00:01:43,112 --> 00:01:45,353
If you're healthy, you can drink.

8
00:01:45,353 --> 00:01:46,472
I can't hold my liquor well.

9
00:01:50,312 --> 00:01:51,873
Have you told her about getting married?

10
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:53,793
No.

11
00:01:55,392 --> 00:01:57,112
Why are you hesitating?

12
00:01:58,155 --> 00:01:59,070
I'm not hesitating.

13
00:01:59,073 --> 00:02:01,593
Marriage needs the right timing.

14
00:02:01,593 --> 00:02:03,312
She's getting food for you. Quick.

15
00:02:04,993 --> 00:02:05,272
Come.

16
00:02:05,672 --> 00:02:07,832
You always let others take care of you.

17
00:02:07,832 --> 00:02:08,313
No.

18
00:02:08,513 --> 00:02:09,392
Look.

19
00:02:09,592 --> 00:02:10,429
He's scolding me.

20
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,288
Don't worry about me.

21
00:02:11,313 --> 00:02:11,913
Eat your food.

22
00:02:12,552 --> 00:02:13,992
The fish is really good.

23
00:02:13,992 --> 00:02:14,552
Okay.

24
00:02:14,672 --> 00:02:15,829
Why aren't you eating prawns?

25
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,777
Let me peel one for you.

26
00:02:17,155 --> 00:02:18,592
No need to take care of me. I got it.

27
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,488
What's wrong?

28
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:24,270
Look at you.

29
00:02:24,272 --> 00:02:25,552
You pricked yourself.

30
00:02:25,753 --> 00:02:26,953
It's nothing. Just a small cut.

31
00:02:28,392 --> 00:02:28,872
I'm good.

32
00:02:29,953 --> 00:02:31,033
Stay still. Look at this.

33
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:32,992
Don't be stubborn.

34
00:02:33,432 --> 00:02:34,152
You're bleeding.

35
00:02:37,913 --> 00:02:39,152
All right.

36
00:02:41,353 --> 00:02:43,913
We used to suck out the blood.

37
00:02:44,313 --> 00:02:45,992
It's okay.

38
00:02:45,992 --> 00:02:46,793
Just a minor cut.

39
00:02:47,592 --> 00:02:48,033
Excuse me.

40
00:02:48,272 --> 00:02:49,432
Do you have

41
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:51,353
band-aids and alcohol?

42
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,490
I'll take you to get some.

43
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,150
- OK.
- No need.

44
00:02:53,152 --> 00:02:54,112
Let's go. Come with me.

45
00:02:54,432 --> 00:02:55,672
You keep eating.

46
00:02:55,688 --> 00:02:56,830
I'll go take care of her wound.

47
00:02:56,832 --> 00:02:57,513
It's bleeding.

48
00:02:58,152 --> 00:02:58,712
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:58,913 --> 00:02:59,633
It's fine.

50
00:03:02,112 --> 00:03:03,112
He cares about her.

51
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:04,233
Look at them.

52
00:03:04,672 --> 00:03:05,872
"Don't be stubborn."

53
00:03:06,473 --> 00:03:08,033
"Look, you're bleeding."

54
00:03:09,872 --> 00:03:10,592
So cheesy.

55
00:03:11,112 --> 00:03:12,152
They're acting silly.

56
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,313
Are you jealous?

57
00:03:13,992 --> 00:03:15,992
Shen is a happy man.

58
00:03:16,672 --> 00:03:17,552
Happy man.

59
00:03:17,872 --> 00:03:18,872
Come on. Let's toast.

60
00:03:18,872 --> 00:03:19,793
Come on.

61
00:03:19,953 --> 00:03:20,473
Cheers.

62
00:03:20,953 --> 00:03:22,193
Given our age,

63
00:03:22,444 --> 00:03:23,990
we're frequent visitors to the hospital.

64
00:03:24,592 --> 00:03:25,633
So gatherings like this

65
00:03:25,712 --> 00:03:27,193
should become the norm.

66
00:03:28,272 --> 00:03:29,432
The older we get,

67
00:03:29,913 --> 00:03:31,313
the fewer chances we get to meet.

68
00:03:31,592 --> 00:03:33,793
We need to get together
more often, don't you think?

69
00:03:33,793 --> 00:03:34,353
Yes.

70
00:03:35,073 --> 00:03:35,712
Come on.

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,311
You need to drink as a penalty.

72
00:03:38,311 --> 00:03:38,750
Drink.

73
00:03:38,753 --> 00:03:39,592
I'll drink.

74
00:03:39,913 --> 00:03:40,552
All right.

75
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:41,950
You're drinking again?

76
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:43,592
You must drink, Shen.

77
00:03:43,832 --> 00:03:44,592
One full glass.

78
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:45,392
Drink.

79
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,633
I'll drink.

80
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:47,592
I'll drink by myself.

81
00:03:48,872 --> 00:03:49,672
Good.

82
00:03:49,777 --> 00:03:50,350
Excellent.

83
00:03:50,992 --> 00:03:51,513
Bravo.

84
00:03:54,592 --> 00:03:56,432
I heard what you said.

85
00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:58,490
You want us to meet up more often.

86
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:58,992
Exactly.

87
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll make it happen.

88
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:01,193
Good.

89
00:04:01,313 --> 00:04:01,872
Listen.

90
00:04:02,753 --> 00:04:03,473
Next month

91
00:04:04,832 --> 00:04:05,473
is my

92
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:06,953
70th birthday.

93
00:04:09,193 --> 00:04:11,033
My children insisted on
throwing a party,

94
00:04:11,193 --> 00:04:12,513
so I agreed.

95
00:04:12,577 --> 00:04:13,150
That's great.

96
00:04:13,672 --> 00:04:14,473
When the time comes,

97
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:16,352
every single one of you here

98
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:17,832
has to be there.

99
00:04:19,113 --> 00:04:20,673
Good. You must be there.

100
00:04:20,953 --> 00:04:21,472
Of course.

101
00:04:22,311 --> 00:04:23,550
Welcome to my birthday banquet.

102
00:04:24,352 --> 00:04:25,753
A 70th birthday banquet.

103
00:04:25,955 --> 00:04:27,222
Who hasn't been to one before?

104
00:04:29,673 --> 00:04:33,513
But as for a 70th birthday banquet
combined with a wedding,

105
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:34,993
we've never been to before.

106
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,313
Right, a wedding.

107
00:04:38,673 --> 00:04:39,832
Yeah.

108
00:04:40,352 --> 00:04:40,832
Right?

109
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,750
A wedding should be held
on the same day.

110
00:04:42,753 --> 00:04:45,633
Everyone, get your red packets ready.

111
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:47,753
Get it ready.

112
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,433
Okay.

113
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:53,272
Did you propose to her just now?

114
00:04:54,513 --> 00:04:54,792
No.

115
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:55,753
I was helping her

116
00:04:56,073 --> 00:04:57,592
with her wound.

117
00:04:59,873 --> 00:05:00,352
Listen.

118
00:05:00,352 --> 00:05:01,712
Today's a great opportunity.

119
00:05:02,272 --> 00:05:03,553
Make this class reunion

120
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,553
more exciting.

121
00:05:04,673 --> 00:05:05,673
Propose to her

122
00:05:06,352 --> 00:05:07,272
in front of everyone.

123
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:11,673
I'm not ready yet.

124
00:05:11,673 --> 00:05:12,912
That's settled.

125
00:05:13,592 --> 00:05:14,272
Wait, you...

126
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:14,873
Hurry.

127
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,822
Everyone, take your seats.

128
00:05:24,352 --> 00:05:25,832
Shen has something to say.

129
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:27,313
Come on.

130
00:05:29,232 --> 00:05:30,272
Let me take a drink first.

131
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:36,177
Don't worry.

132
00:05:37,513 --> 00:05:38,993
An important announcement?

133
00:05:44,032 --> 00:05:44,912
Yes, pretty important.

134
00:05:49,832 --> 00:05:50,873
He's giving a speech.

135
00:05:50,873 --> 00:05:51,712
Let's all quiet down.

136
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:52,633
Yilian.

137
00:06:01,232 --> 00:06:01,792
Yilian.

138
00:06:06,553 --> 00:06:07,073
I...

139
00:06:16,472 --> 00:06:18,152
I packed some osmanthus cake.

140
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,644
Make sure to bring it back to Lian Jin.

141
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:24,993
All right.

142
00:06:24,993 --> 00:06:26,032
He's thoughtful.

143
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,444
Such a gentleman.

144
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:28,073
Come.

145
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,673
Let's drink.

146
00:06:29,832 --> 00:06:30,472
Come on.

147
00:06:32,032 --> 00:06:32,313
Cheers.

148
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:39,392
Don't hit me.

149
00:06:39,392 --> 00:06:40,513
Come on.

150
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,088
I think Lian Jin's still up.

151
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,553
I'll get you some hot water
for a foot bath.

152
00:06:55,953 --> 00:06:56,673
All right.

153
00:06:57,313 --> 00:06:57,633
Go on.

154
00:06:57,912 --> 00:06:58,472
Lian Jin.

155
00:06:59,313 --> 00:06:59,592
Mom.

156
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:02,070
Look at this.

157
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,622
What's it?

158
00:07:03,032 --> 00:07:05,152
Mr. Shen packed this for you.

159
00:07:05,832 --> 00:07:06,633
It's still warm.

160
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,311
Osmanthus cake.

161
00:07:08,313 --> 00:07:09,232
Your favorite.

162
00:07:09,792 --> 00:07:10,792
Two whole boxes. Look.

163
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,044
Eat it while it's fresh.

164
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:20,272
Is he trying to bribe me

165
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:23,193
so that he can take my dear mom away?

166
00:07:26,592 --> 00:07:28,073
What are you talking about?

167
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:33,589
Mr. Shen really cares about you.

168
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,422
You can't always assume the worst.

169
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,377
He must be after something.

170
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:39,433
Everyone does.

171
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:41,392
Don't you?

172
00:07:41,553 --> 00:07:41,832
I...

173
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,111
I'm not after something?

174
00:07:43,352 --> 00:07:44,472
I just want you to be healthy

175
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:45,712
and happy, is that okay?

176
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,066
- Is this the furniture repair service?
- My son...

177
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,555
I want to fix a bed.

178
00:07:56,472 --> 00:07:58,269
Yes. We bought one from you.

179
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,777
My kid isn't sleeping well on it.

180
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:01,266
You can come over?

181
00:08:01,352 --> 00:08:02,229
Thank you so much.

182
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,977
Look at that.

183
00:08:03,673 --> 00:08:04,433
Look at Mr. Shen.

184
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,577
He's thoughtful.

185
00:08:07,032 --> 00:08:08,792
We had already finished

186
00:08:10,912 --> 00:08:11,953
eating everything.

187
00:08:12,352 --> 00:08:14,592
But Mr. Shen still ordered this for you.

188
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,032
He ordered two boxes.
He said you like this.

189
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,555
You're not grateful about it?

190
00:08:21,073 --> 00:08:21,753
That's not right.

191
00:08:22,266 --> 00:08:23,510
If you don't want to eat it now,

192
00:08:23,513 --> 00:08:24,272
have it later.

193
00:08:28,673 --> 00:08:29,912
Stop overthinking.

194
00:08:39,992 --> 00:08:41,112
We all love you.

195
00:08:41,872 --> 00:08:42,592
Understand?

196
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,177
All right.

197
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:55,288
Get out of the bed and move a little
after reading books.

198
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,770
I'll leave the osmanthus cakes here.

199
00:08:56,822 --> 00:08:58,155
Don't wait until it gets cold.

200
00:08:58,512 --> 00:08:59,273
All right, Mom.

201
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:03,933
Don't touch it.

202
00:09:03,953 --> 00:09:04,512
I'll do it.

203
00:09:20,752 --> 00:09:22,033
Rub it like this.

204
00:09:22,955 --> 00:09:23,688
Is this okay?

205
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,273
Did Lian Jin

206
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,155
like the osmanthus cakes?

207
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:31,112
Yes, he loves it.

208
00:09:31,673 --> 00:09:32,793
He told me to thank you.

209
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:35,673
I like this boy.

210
00:09:37,073 --> 00:09:38,273
He's quiet.

211
00:09:40,712 --> 00:09:41,832
Tell him

212
00:09:42,313 --> 00:09:44,232
to think of this place as home.

213
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,512
Don't always coop himself up
in his room.

214
00:09:46,793 --> 00:09:47,752
He should come out more.

215
00:09:49,112 --> 00:09:50,153
That's how he is.

216
00:09:50,752 --> 00:09:52,393
He's reticent.

217
00:09:53,752 --> 00:09:55,112
Honestly, I'm to blame.

218
00:09:56,913 --> 00:09:58,273
I was too busy back then

219
00:09:58,311 --> 00:09:59,466
that I had neglected him.

220
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,310
I worked day and night shifts
back to back,

221
00:10:01,313 --> 00:10:02,433
leaving him alone at home.

222
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:04,673
Even when he wasn't feeling well,

223
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,111
he wouldn't say anything.
He just endured it.

224
00:10:07,155 --> 00:10:08,244
He didn't want to bother me.

225
00:10:08,752 --> 00:10:09,832
That's how his nephritis

226
00:10:09,832 --> 00:10:11,352
missed the best time for treatment.

227
00:10:14,752 --> 00:10:15,472
I've stayed single

228
00:10:16,313 --> 00:10:17,632
all these years

229
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:20,153
because I was afraid he'd be mistreated.

230
00:10:21,953 --> 00:10:23,953
But later, I looked for support

231
00:10:23,953 --> 00:10:25,153
because I thought

232
00:10:25,644 --> 00:10:27,533
I couldn't take care of him
on my own.

233
00:10:27,673 --> 00:10:28,472
I'm really scared.

234
00:10:29,632 --> 00:10:31,712
Scared that if his condition worsens,

235
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:34,377
it'll turn into kidney failure,
and things will become more difficult.

236
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:37,673
Sit.

237
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,533
Don't always squat.

238
00:10:43,953 --> 00:10:44,592
Listen to me.

239
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:47,592
From now on,

240
00:10:48,352 --> 00:10:50,712
we'll take care of him together
as his parents.

241
00:10:52,112 --> 00:10:53,232
The boy is still young.

242
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,622
We should find the right doctor
and the right hospital for him.

243
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,832
Don't worry about the money.

244
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,073
I've taken on plenty of lectures.

245
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,155
They'll pay me.

246
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:06,433
He's young.

247
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,433
He'll recover well.

248
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,088
Definitely.

249

Yilian, listen to me.

251
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,266
We've been together

252
00:11:32,913 --> 00:11:34,712
for quite some time, right?

253
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:39,992
Can we take the next step

254
00:11:41,953 --> 00:11:43,193
and register our marriage?

255
00:11:47,232 --> 00:11:48,073
I'd love to.

256
00:11:48,512 --> 00:11:49,193
That's good.

257
00:11:49,712 --> 00:11:50,153
But...

258
00:11:51,472 --> 00:11:51,913
But

259
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,869
as you see, Lian Jin

260
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,430
takes time to get familiar with people.

261
00:12:01,112 --> 00:12:02,193
I want him to have more time

262
00:12:03,313 --> 00:12:04,352
to adjust first.

263
00:12:08,872 --> 00:12:09,433
So,

264
00:12:10,632 --> 00:12:11,273
can we

265
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,333
wait a little longer?

266
00:12:13,953 --> 00:12:14,273
Yes.

267
00:12:15,393 --> 00:12:15,992
Of course.

268
00:12:16,273 --> 00:12:17,352
I understand.

269
00:12:18,712 --> 00:12:18,992
Well.

270
00:12:19,273 --> 00:12:20,352
We'll wait.

271
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:21,933
It's okay.

272
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,844

Who's that in those photos?

278
00:12:35,913 --> 00:12:36,313
Look.

279
00:12:36,632 --> 00:12:37,913
When were these taken?

280
00:12:38,433 --> 00:12:39,953
During our gathering. Look.

281
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,110
So many pictures.

282
00:12:41,273 --> 00:12:42,472

to use a photo retouching app.

287

a single picture of me?

00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:31,832
Okay?

382
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:54,673
What's he doing?

383
00:16:54,673 --> 00:16:55,112
No idea.

384
00:17:24,555 --> 00:17:25,270
Plum blossoms?

385
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:26,873
Yeah, it's plum blossoms.

386
00:17:46,673 --> 00:17:47,472
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

387
00:17:47,488 --> 00:17:48,270
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

(RF Pharmaceuticals & Lide Pharmaceuticals)

389
00:17:57,992 --> 00:17:58,712
Hello, Sophia.

390
00:17:58,712 --> 00:17:59,072
Hello.

391
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:00,189
Hello, William.

392
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,022
Nice to meet you.

393
00:18:01,032 --> 00:18:01,633
Welcome.

394
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,577
Let me introduce you.

395
00:18:03,752 --> 00:18:04,833
This is Dr. Qin.

396
00:18:04,953 --> 00:18:05,953
The M701 project

397
00:18:05,992 --> 00:18:07,153
is under his charge.

398
00:18:08,032 --> 00:18:08,593
My pleasure.

399
00:18:10,472 --> 00:18:11,232
Hello.

400
00:18:13,953 --> 00:18:14,673
So beautiful.

401
00:18:15,633 --> 00:18:15,992
You see.

402
00:18:16,153 --> 00:18:17,312
As the Chinese saying goes,

403
00:18:17,488 --> 00:18:19,666
"Plum blossoms bloom with fragrance
through biting cold."

404
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:21,000
We drew these,

405
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,222
hoping that Lide's patent

406
00:18:22,288 --> 00:18:24,190
would help M701 bloom
as quickly as possible.

407
00:18:25,433 --> 00:18:28,552
I see. You've been putting
a lot of effort into this.

408
00:18:29,032 --> 00:18:30,593
That's so nicely put.

409
00:18:31,113 --> 00:18:33,232
Much appreciated. Wouldn't you agree?

410
00:18:33,232 --> 00:18:33,953
Thank you.

411
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:35,353
Please step inside.

412
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:36,232
Okay. Let's go.

413
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:43,353
Ice Li.

414
00:18:44,032 --> 00:18:44,433
Mr. Shi.

415
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,190
Sorry, I wanted to come down
to greet you.

416
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:46,712
It's okay.

417
00:18:47,472 --> 00:18:47,913
Mr. Shen.

418
00:18:48,272 --> 00:18:48,712
Mr. Shen.

419
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:51,555
Please help me host them.

420
00:18:53,552 --> 00:18:55,833
Mr. Shen, this is Ice Li
from Shide Capital.

421
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:57,792
Ice, this is Mr. Shen.

422
00:18:58,232 --> 00:18:59,393
Please help me host them.

423
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,353
Hello, Mr. Shen. I'm Ice Li.

424
00:19:02,232 --> 00:19:03,433
Hello, I'm Shen Qing.

425
00:19:04,032 --> 00:19:04,752
I'm sorry.

426
00:19:04,752 --> 00:19:06,792
I thought you were from Lide.

427
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:07,792
It's fine.

428
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:10,472
Nice drawing.

429
00:19:17,752 --> 00:19:19,792
(We should face all hardships
hand in hand.)

430
00:19:20,312 --> 00:19:22,353
(Let's endure the ups and downs)

431
00:19:22,752 --> 00:19:24,109
(and support each other.)

432
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:26,044
(But if you work hard
while your partner doesn't,)

433
00:19:26,072 --> 00:19:28,833
(it can be frustrating.)

434
00:19:29,113 --> 00:19:30,792
(It's kind of disappointing.)

435
00:19:31,393 --> 00:19:33,593
(I think if the guy is like
what's being described.)

436
00:19:33,593 --> 00:19:34,433
(If it were me,)

437
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,433
(I'd be willing,)

438
00:19:37,113 --> 00:19:38,193
(no matter who he is.)

439
00:19:38,673 --> 00:19:41,913
(The more she pushes me
and makes demands,)

440
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,355
(the more determined I become.)

441
00:19:43,673 --> 00:19:44,593
(If she softens up,)

442
00:19:45,032 --> 00:19:45,833
(give it a try)

443
00:19:46,072 --> 00:19:46,712
(sometimes.)

444
00:19:46,953 --> 00:19:48,552
(But I think if it really...)

445
00:20:07,393 --> 00:20:07,953
Dad.

446
00:20:10,193 --> 00:20:10,792
Dad.

447
00:20:13,113 --> 00:20:13,593
Dad.

448
00:20:17,353 --> 00:20:17,953
Dad.

449
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:28,622
Excuse me.

450
00:20:29,032 --> 00:20:29,593
Sun.

451
00:20:29,992 --> 00:20:30,393
Sun.

452
00:20:30,422 --> 00:20:30,990
What's wrong?

453
00:20:30,992 --> 00:20:32,552
Can I borrow your phone?

454
00:20:32,552 --> 00:20:33,032
Phone?

455
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,193
I locked myself out.

456
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:35,433
The stove is on.

457
00:20:35,433 --> 00:20:36,032
All right.

458
00:20:36,032 --> 00:20:36,552
Well,

459
00:20:36,888 --> 00:20:37,950
no password. Just use it.

460
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:38,433
Okay.

461
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,880
(NPI Patent Transfer Signing Ceremony)

462
00:21:21,272 --> 00:21:23,673
Well, I hope your new drug is developed

463
00:21:24,113 --> 00:21:26,833
and shared with many patients
as soon as possible.

464
00:21:27,113 --> 00:21:27,712
Absolutely.

465
00:21:28,022 --> 00:21:29,800
Looking forward
to our collaboration.

466
00:21:33,644 --> 00:21:34,333
Did he answer?

467
00:21:36,393 --> 00:21:37,552
No.

468
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:39,752
Maybe he doesn't answer
the unknown number.

469
00:21:39,752 --> 00:21:40,509
Keep calling

470
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,250
so he doesn't think
it's from some stranger.

471
00:21:42,266 --> 00:21:42,733
Okay.

472
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:09,312
Forget it.

473
00:22:10,032 --> 00:22:11,153
I'll go to find him.

474
00:22:11,466 --> 00:22:11,990
All right.

475
00:22:12,044 --> 00:22:13,777
He's not coming back
to bring me the keys.

476
00:22:13,822 --> 00:22:14,070
Okay.

477
00:22:14,353 --> 00:22:16,032
Lend me your motorbike.

478
00:22:16,593 --> 00:22:16,833
Wait.

479
00:22:17,232 --> 00:22:18,472
This thing is fast.

480
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,190
- Got it. No problem.
- Super fast.

481
00:22:26,193 --> 00:22:27,512
Be careful.

482
00:22:27,673 --> 00:22:28,792
The brakes don't work well.

483
00:22:29,153 --> 00:22:29,673
No problem.

484
00:22:32,512 --> 00:22:34,873
The new drug M701 I developed

485
00:22:34,873 --> 00:22:36,552
is designed for the general public.

486
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:37,593
Sophia.

487
00:22:38,193 --> 00:22:38,633
Mr. Shen,

488
00:22:38,873 --> 00:22:40,873
we value our collaboration very much.

489
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,472
We hope to work on

490
00:22:42,555 --> 00:22:44,288
more strategic plans in the future.

491
00:22:44,512 --> 00:22:45,113
That's great.

492
00:22:45,393 --> 00:22:47,752
Drop me an email.
We can discuss the details.

493
00:22:48,232 --> 00:22:50,752
No need. We use WeChat.

494
00:22:51,072 --> 00:22:51,953
WeChat, right?

495
00:22:52,752 --> 00:22:53,953
You're using that?

496
00:22:53,953 --> 00:22:54,353
Right.

497
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,933
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

498
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:56,733
All right.

499
00:23:03,153 --> 00:23:04,673
Ice, let's add each other on WeChat.

500
00:23:04,913 --> 00:23:05,193
Okay.

501
00:23:05,393 --> 00:23:05,673
Here.

502
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:08,633
Here.

503
00:23:16,888 --> 00:23:18,630
You're the one
on my marriage certificate.

504
00:23:19,153 --> 00:23:20,792
You're the one on my property deed.

505
00:23:21,232 --> 00:23:22,833
You're the one on my domicile register.

506
00:23:23,272 --> 00:23:24,913
You're the one who shares my tombstone.

507
00:23:25,232 --> 00:23:27,272
The woman I can never leave
in this life.

508
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:28,353
Good night.

509
00:23:29,552 --> 00:23:31,272
Mr. Shen, is this your wife?

510
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,552
Stunning.

511
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,032
Is she a dancer?

512
00:23:37,355 --> 00:23:38,622
She just loves to dance.

513
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,977
We went to the same college.

514
00:23:40,222 --> 00:23:41,533
She also studied accounting.

515
00:23:42,433 --> 00:23:43,633
Oh, college romance.

516
00:23:44,032 --> 00:23:45,113
That's so enviable.

517
00:23:45,992 --> 00:23:46,472
Yeah.

518
00:23:46,472 --> 00:23:47,272
Thank you.

519
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,844
I'm looking for Shen Qing.

520
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:54,953
Mrs. Shen.

521
00:23:55,244 --> 00:23:56,230
What brings you here?

522
00:23:56,953 --> 00:23:58,593
Jin, I'm looking for Shen Qing.

523
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:00,472
Shen Qing.

524
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:03,933
Please excuse me.

525
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:09,622
Why are you here?

526
00:24:09,673 --> 00:24:10,512
Well,

527
00:24:10,953 --> 00:24:12,232
the stove is on,

528
00:24:12,312 --> 00:24:13,272
and the door shut.

529
00:24:13,272 --> 00:24:13,873
So?

530
00:24:14,032 --> 00:24:15,312
I didn't bring my keys.

531
00:24:15,552 --> 00:24:16,593
Give me yours.

532
00:24:18,232 --> 00:24:18,673
A second.

533
00:24:21,552 --> 00:24:21,953
Mrs. Shen,

534
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:23,913
have some champagne.

535
00:24:24,022 --> 00:24:24,510
No, thanks.

536
00:24:24,555 --> 00:24:25,590
Come and meet some people.

537
00:24:25,752 --> 00:24:26,992
Come on.

538
00:24:27,312 --> 00:24:28,272
Well.

539
00:24:29,673 --> 00:24:31,232
This is Dr. William and Sophia.

540
00:24:34,792 --> 00:24:35,673
Hi, Mrs. Shen.

541
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:37,272
We were just talking about you.

542
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:38,512
Me?

543
00:24:38,953 --> 00:24:39,433
Yes.

544
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:41,393
We were saying

545
00:24:42,032 --> 00:24:43,593
how beautiful Mr. Shen's wife is.

546
00:24:44,552 --> 00:24:45,269
I'm flattered.

547
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:45,977
Have some snacks.

548
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,430
Have some.

549
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:47,272
No, thanks.

550
00:24:47,393 --> 00:24:48,272
- Just a bite.
- No.

551
00:24:51,393 --> 00:24:52,593
The soup is about to burn dry.

552
00:24:56,353 --> 00:24:57,032
I need to go.

553
00:24:57,111 --> 00:24:58,010
Sorry to interrupt you.

554
00:24:58,088 --> 00:24:58,933
Hurry up and go back.

555
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,393
- Go slow.
- Sorry about that.

556
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:07,312
It's okay.

557
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:08,593
It's okay. Go on.

558
00:25:25,552 --> 00:25:26,072
Sorry.

559
00:25:26,312 --> 00:25:28,472
We got held up by the chicken soup.

560
00:25:30,193 --> 00:25:31,913
Mr. Shen, your wife

561
00:25:32,353 --> 00:25:33,633
is so pretty and virtuous.

562
00:25:33,673 --> 00:25:33,992
Exactly.

563
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:34,673
You're so lucky.

564
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:36,072
Thank you.

565
00:25:36,072 --> 00:25:36,673
Cheers.

566
00:25:42,472 --> 00:25:43,712
His wife is a very nice person.

567
00:25:44,032 --> 00:25:45,472
She loves setting people up.

568
00:25:47,866 --> 00:25:48,990
Do you have a boyfriend?

569
00:25:51,153 --> 00:25:51,673
I did.

570
00:25:54,992 --> 00:25:57,552
Come. Let's drink to the past.

571
00:26:08,992 --> 00:26:09,552
Lina.

572
00:26:10,913 --> 00:26:11,472
Lina.

573
00:26:12,913 --> 00:26:13,312
Lina.

574
00:26:22,272 --> 00:26:22,792
Dad.

575
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:24,353
You're back.

576
00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:28,153
Luckily, I got home early
from my lecture.

577
00:26:28,232 --> 00:26:30,113
Otherwise, the house
could've burned down.

578
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:32,272
You left the stove on.

579
00:26:32,272 --> 00:26:33,312
How could you forget?

580
00:26:34,072 --> 00:26:34,433
I...

581
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,022
What has happened?

582
00:26:38,312 --> 00:26:40,113
I stepped out to take out the trash,

583
00:26:40,113 --> 00:26:41,712
and the wind slammed the door shut.

584
00:26:42,072 --> 00:26:43,113
I didn't bring my phone,

585
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,953
so I borrowed the security's motorbike

586
00:26:44,953 --> 00:26:47,153
to go to Shen Qing's office
for the keys.

587
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:49,032
I fell on the way back.

588
00:26:49,633 --> 00:26:50,792
Haste makes waste.

589
00:26:51,953 --> 00:26:52,833
The spare keys

590
00:26:52,888 --> 00:26:54,266
are hanging right behind the door.

591
00:26:54,777 --> 00:26:56,550
Why did you have to go through
all the trouble?

592
00:26:56,552 --> 00:26:58,193
Lian Jin was home.

593
00:27:00,232 --> 00:27:01,512
Someone was home?

594
00:27:02,193 --> 00:27:03,752
I was banging on the door,

595
00:27:03,752 --> 00:27:04,913
and no one answered.

596
00:27:05,393 --> 00:27:06,913
Gosh, this boy.

597
00:27:07,312 --> 00:27:08,032
I'm so sorry.

598
00:27:08,312 --> 00:27:09,752
Maybe he's just too shy

599
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:10,953
to open the door.

600
00:27:10,953 --> 00:27:12,393
People upstairs heard me.

601
00:27:12,393 --> 00:27:13,512
Did he ignore me on purpose?

602
00:27:14,673 --> 00:27:15,193
You...

603
00:27:15,512 --> 00:27:17,113
Why would he do that?

604
00:27:17,272 --> 00:27:19,673
Maybe he was out at the time, right?

605
00:27:21,913 --> 00:27:22,873
You can't blame him.

606
00:27:22,873 --> 00:27:24,873
You need to think ahead.

607
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,590
If you had taken the keys,
would this have happened?

608
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,800
I just went to throw the trash.

609
00:27:28,866 --> 00:27:31,155
It's your mistake. Don't blame others.

610
00:27:31,913 --> 00:27:32,153
I...

611
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:36,353
Fine, it's my problem.

612
00:27:36,433 --> 00:27:36,953
Fine.

613
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,600
- My problem.
- I'm truly sorry.

614
00:27:38,644 --> 00:27:39,549
Are you okay?

615
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,377
Are you hurt?

616
00:27:42,633 --> 00:27:43,433
Does it hurt...?

617
00:27:48,618 --> 00:27:49,312
Lina.

618
00:27:51,752 --> 00:27:52,153
Coming.

619
00:27:54,913 --> 00:27:55,312
Dad.

620
00:27:56,113 --> 00:27:56,953
Dinner is ready.

621
00:27:57,032 --> 00:27:59,393
Call Shen Qing and Duole over.

622
00:27:59,913 --> 00:28:01,149
Duole has a study hall.

623
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,288
I'll pick him up after I eat.

624
00:28:02,355 --> 00:28:03,488
Shen Qing's still at work.

625
00:28:03,577 --> 00:28:04,466
Come over then.

626
00:28:04,488 --> 00:28:05,933
The dishes are ready.

627
00:28:06,422 --> 00:28:07,622
Eat them while they're hot.

628
00:28:08,992 --> 00:28:09,512
Come, Lina.

629
00:28:10,032 --> 00:28:10,913
This is fresh.

630
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:12,088
Thank you, Ms. Lian.

631
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:19,272
Come.

632
00:28:22,752 --> 00:28:23,312
Here, Lina.

633
00:28:23,866 --> 00:28:24,790
Thank you, Ms. Lian.

634
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:25,593
Very fresh.

635
00:28:34,433 --> 00:28:34,833
Lian Jin,

636
00:28:36,873 --> 00:28:38,072
sit here.

637
00:28:38,953 --> 00:28:40,393
You can eat more.

638
00:28:44,992 --> 00:28:45,712
Don't mind him.

639
00:28:47,913 --> 00:28:48,673
He's like this.

640
00:28:49,712 --> 00:28:50,913
He has a habit

641
00:28:51,593 --> 00:28:53,353
of eating while reading.

642
00:28:53,472 --> 00:28:54,193
I spoiled him.

643
00:28:55,977 --> 00:28:57,111
He's got many bad habits.

644
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:02,272
You're home.

645
00:29:02,873 --> 00:29:03,593
Dad, Ms. Lian.

646
00:29:03,888 --> 00:29:05,250
- You're back.
- Sit down and eat.

647
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:06,430
I'll get you a bowl of rice.

648
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,488
No need, I'll get it myself.

649
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,755
- Sit.
- Let Ms. Lian do it.

650
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,555
Sit down and eat.

651
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:11,022
You've been working all day.

652
00:29:27,312 --> 00:29:30,272
I... I bought a non-stick spoon.

653
00:29:30,472 --> 00:29:31,752
I'll get you that.

654
00:29:32,232 --> 00:29:32,512
Come.

655
00:29:33,153 --> 00:29:34,072
I've put it here.

656
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,866
How did the signing event go?

657
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,066
What's wrong with you?

658
00:29:45,032 --> 00:29:46,353
Do you have no sense?

659
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:48,552
Couldn't you give me a heads-up
before coming?

660
00:29:49,113 --> 00:29:50,232
I called you,

661
00:29:50,393 --> 00:29:51,953
but you didn't answer.

662
00:29:52,633 --> 00:29:53,709
If I didn't answer,

663
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,400
you thought it was okay to barge in?

664
00:29:57,072 --> 00:29:58,113
Didn't I tell you that?

665
00:29:58,153 --> 00:29:59,673
I was cooking chicken soup.

666
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:00,833
I was anxious.

667
00:30:01,688 --> 00:30:03,044
Also, you told me not to call you

668
00:30:03,066 --> 00:30:04,288
if nothing serious happened.

669
00:30:04,311 --> 00:30:05,533
Even if you had answered,

670
00:30:05,577 --> 00:30:07,222
would you have brought me the keys?

671
00:30:08,593 --> 00:30:09,673
You messed up the event.

672
00:30:09,673 --> 00:30:10,792
Didn't I tell you

673
00:30:10,792 --> 00:30:12,232
this event was important?

674
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,913
I prepared for it for a long time.

675
00:30:14,032 --> 00:30:15,353
Yet you just barged in.

676
00:30:17,113 --> 00:30:18,552
How was I supposed to know that?

677
00:30:19,393 --> 00:30:20,752
You don't tell me anything anymore.

678
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:21,950
You didn't answer my calls.

679
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,155
How was I supposed to know
what you were busy with?

680
00:30:24,288 --> 00:30:26,644
Besides, I've had that lock for so long.

681
00:30:26,644 --> 00:30:27,710
I told you to install it.

682
00:30:27,712 --> 00:30:29,593
You keep pushing it off.

683
00:30:29,733 --> 00:30:31,050
Do you really care about our home?

684
00:30:31,153 --> 00:30:32,552
Didn't I say I'd do it this weekend?

685
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,355
It's not like
I've been slouching around.

686
00:30:34,377 --> 00:30:36,000
Can't you do it yourself?

687
00:30:36,155 --> 00:30:38,022
If I knew how,
I would've done it already.

688
00:30:38,153 --> 00:30:39,032
Then learn!

689
00:30:39,032 --> 00:30:40,272
Never stop learning.

690
00:30:41,353 --> 00:30:42,752
You're not working, though.

691
00:30:42,752 --> 00:30:43,953
Can't you use your brain

692
00:30:43,953 --> 00:30:45,512
and figure something out?

693
00:30:46,393 --> 00:30:47,512
Unbothered.

694
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,752
I'm not working?

695
00:30:48,873 --> 00:30:50,913
Having arguments is
a kind of communication.

696
00:30:51,193 --> 00:30:53,272
Your mom was sick, and Duole
had to go to school.

697
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:56,472
I had to take care of both of them.

698
00:30:56,992 --> 00:30:58,312
You go on business trips

699
00:30:58,512 --> 00:30:59,873
or stay out whenever you want.

700
00:31:00,312 --> 00:31:02,312
I had to handle everything on my own.

701
00:31:02,377 --> 00:31:03,880
Do you remember
what you said back then?

702
00:31:03,888 --> 00:31:06,709
You were grateful I sacrificed my career
to support this family.

703
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,222
And now you're saying I don't work

704
00:31:08,244 --> 00:31:08,870
and do nothing?

705
00:31:08,873 --> 00:31:09,552
When did I...

706
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,288
Shen Qing, you can't do this to me.

707
00:31:12,673 --> 00:31:13,749
"Never stop learning"?

708
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,288
Oh, I can learn a bunch of things.

709
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,955
I can learn to change locks. What else?

710
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,844
Learn acupuncture skills, foot baths,

711
00:31:18,953 --> 00:31:20,272
and CPR like Ms. Lian does?

712
00:31:21,353 --> 00:31:22,593
This is getting out of hand.

713
00:31:23,593 --> 00:31:23,913
Right.

714
00:31:23,992 --> 00:31:25,072
She's talking out of turn.

715
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:27,244
Liu Lina, you're going too far.

716
00:31:27,866 --> 00:31:28,750
I'm going too far?

717
00:31:28,844 --> 00:31:31,177
The one who didn't open the door for me
went way too far.

718
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:33,712
What?

719
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,666
Who didn't open the door for you?

720
00:31:36,552 --> 00:31:36,913
Him!

721
00:31:37,488 --> 00:31:38,990
He was home but didn't let me in.

722
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,422
I yelled so loud. There's no way
he didn't hear me.

723
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:43,873
I almost broke the door.

724
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:47,673
Well,

725
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:49,312
Shen Qing.

726
00:31:50,266 --> 00:31:51,111
Here's the rice.

727
00:31:53,752 --> 00:31:54,312
Let's eat.

728
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,470
This is how things are at home.

729
00:31:58,393 --> 00:31:58,873
Well.

730
00:32:00,232 --> 00:32:00,992
Lina

731
00:32:01,177 --> 00:32:02,470
takes care of the whole family.

732
00:32:02,472 --> 00:32:04,272
She's also helping us.

733
00:32:04,512 --> 00:32:05,913
We all see that.

734
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:09,153
Shen Qing,

735
00:32:10,193 --> 00:32:11,433
you need to be fair.

736
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,232
You're working outside

737
00:32:13,992 --> 00:32:15,472
to provide for the family.

738
00:32:16,873 --> 00:32:18,633
Lina is doing the same thing.

739
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,866
She's also contributing to the family.

740
00:32:21,593 --> 00:32:22,833
A family works that way.

741
00:32:23,193 --> 00:32:24,633
You both have different roles,

742
00:32:25,312 --> 00:32:25,712
right?

743
00:32:26,433 --> 00:32:27,673
It's not necessary

744
00:32:28,552 --> 00:32:30,633
to fight over a lock.

745
00:32:31,193 --> 00:32:33,153
Just change it.

746
00:32:33,312 --> 00:32:35,312
Smart locks are pretty convenient.

747
00:32:35,673 --> 00:32:37,232
Dad, ask him.

748
00:32:37,232 --> 00:32:39,312
How many times have I told him?

749
00:32:39,633 --> 00:32:41,353
Your door has been replaced,

750
00:32:41,353 --> 00:32:43,353
but my smart lock is still sitting
in its box.

751
00:32:43,353 --> 00:32:44,109
Enough.

752
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,266
If the lock had been changed,

753
00:32:45,311 --> 00:32:46,733
none of this would've happened.

754
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:48,433
Can you show some respect?

755
00:32:55,512 --> 00:32:55,792
Mom,

756
00:32:56,353 --> 00:32:57,113
I miss you.

757
00:32:57,666 --> 00:32:58,310
Since you left,

758
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,333
there's no one in this family
to keep things fair.

759
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:01,953
Lina, calm down.

760
00:33:01,953 --> 00:33:02,953
- Wait, no.
- Dad.

761
00:33:02,992 --> 00:33:04,869
Why is she talking
about your mother now?

762
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:05,511
It's not that.

763
00:33:05,712 --> 00:33:05,992
No...

764
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:08,593
She's mad at me.

765
00:33:10,633 --> 00:33:11,953
This is getting complicated.

766
00:33:13,022 --> 00:33:13,910
She's just mad at me.

767
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,022
Unbelievable.

768
00:33:33,272 --> 00:33:35,193
Dad, can you really do this?

769
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:37,873
Do you want to do it then?

770
00:33:38,232 --> 00:33:40,113
You can practice your handyman skills.

771
00:33:40,673 --> 00:33:41,272
Shen Duole,

772
00:33:41,488 --> 00:33:43,111
do you want me to take you there?

773
00:33:43,472 --> 00:33:44,312
Dad, good luck.

774
00:33:44,312 --> 00:33:45,433
I'm off. Bye.

775
00:33:57,792 --> 00:33:58,113
Dad.

776
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,088
You're working on it.

777
00:33:59,992 --> 00:34:01,712
That's the right attitude.

778
00:34:05,222 --> 00:34:06,600
Are you sure you can handle this?

779
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:07,472
If not,

780
00:34:07,472 --> 00:34:09,072
I can ask the guy who set up my bed

781
00:34:09,072 --> 00:34:09,672
to come over.

782
00:34:09,711 --> 00:34:11,222
He said he knows how to install locks.

783
00:34:11,233 --> 00:34:12,072
No need. It's simple.

784
00:34:12,072 --> 00:34:13,032
There's a manual here.

785
00:34:13,032 --> 00:34:13,873
I'll follow it.

786
00:34:13,873 --> 00:34:14,552
Right.

787
00:34:14,622 --> 00:34:16,190
Are you going for a walk with Ms. Lian?

788
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:17,533
We're heading out to buy groceries.

789
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:18,177
Be careful.

790
00:34:18,866 --> 00:34:19,550
No need to help?

791
00:34:19,552 --> 00:34:20,353
Don't worry.

792
00:34:20,873 --> 00:34:21,512
I'm leaving.

793
00:34:21,873 --> 00:34:22,713
Be careful, Dad.

794
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,200
Take care, Ms. Lian.

795
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,911
Yes, Mr. Wei?

796
00:34:43,353 --> 00:34:43,992
All right.

797
00:34:44,192 --> 00:34:45,949
Two hours.

798
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,244
I'll send it to you in two hours.

799
00:35:09,753 --> 00:35:10,313
Jin,

800
00:35:10,873 --> 00:35:13,632
did you find someone to fix

801
00:35:13,632 --> 00:35:15,353
the broken lock on the office door?

802
00:35:16,552 --> 00:35:18,672
Can you call that guy again

803
00:35:18,672 --> 00:35:20,793
to install a biometric lock for me?

804
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,555
The sooner, the better.

805
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:26,192
Okay.

806
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:34,393
It's good that you're back.

807
00:35:37,433 --> 00:35:38,433
Your husband went out.

808
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,088
Come record your fingerprint.

809
00:35:46,632 --> 00:35:47,793
Do you know who I am

810
00:35:47,793 --> 00:35:48,913
before asking that?

811
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:50,112
What if I'm the mistress?

812
00:35:50,472 --> 00:35:51,192
No way.

813
00:35:51,592 --> 00:35:52,833
No mistress looks like you.

814
00:35:56,152 --> 00:35:56,753
What do I do?

815
00:35:57,032 --> 00:35:57,393
Here.

816
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,666
Press your thumb here.

817
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:03,072
Wait.

818
00:36:03,672 --> 00:36:05,233
This isn't the lock I bought.

819
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:07,672
Your husband bought it at my shop.

820
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,688
Installation is included.

821
00:36:11,072 --> 00:36:12,072
What's going on?

822
00:36:24,592 --> 00:36:25,592
How much is this?

823
00:36:26,733 --> 00:36:27,350
Not expensive.

824
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,333
I gave him a discount.

825
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,152
3,880 yuan.

826
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:32,512
3,880 yuan?

827
00:36:33,873 --> 00:36:34,913
Can I return it?

828
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:36,152
No.

829
00:36:36,433 --> 00:36:37,472
It's already installed.

830
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:41,953
Ma'am,

831
00:36:41,953 --> 00:36:43,592
are you not happy with my service?

832
00:36:46,353 --> 00:36:46,992
No, it's fine.

833
00:36:47,913 --> 00:36:48,713
You can go now.

834
00:36:48,844 --> 00:36:49,350
All right.

835
00:37:07,672 --> 00:37:08,672
One moment.

836
00:37:15,393 --> 00:37:15,873
See?

837
00:37:16,273 --> 00:37:17,152
It's done.

838
00:37:19,873 --> 00:37:22,152
Shen Qing gets things done fast.

839
00:37:22,793 --> 00:37:23,512
Just like you.

840
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,733
I love that compliment.

841
00:37:31,112 --> 00:37:32,112
Mr. Li, playing chess?

842
00:37:32,433 --> 00:37:33,233
You're back, Lina.

843
00:37:33,233 --> 00:37:34,152
Who's winning?

844
00:37:34,632 --> 00:37:35,072
Mister.

845
00:37:35,072 --> 00:37:36,552
It's Li. He won.

846
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:37,112
Good.

847
00:37:37,511 --> 00:37:38,310
You're back, Lina.

848
00:37:48,273 --> 00:37:49,592
Is it salty?

849
00:37:49,873 --> 00:37:50,313
No.

850
00:37:50,822 --> 00:37:52,400
It's not comfortable sitting like this.

851
00:37:52,422 --> 00:37:52,952
Come.

852
00:37:52,953 --> 00:37:54,713
Get up.

853
00:37:54,713 --> 00:37:56,152
Lean on this.

854
00:37:56,753 --> 00:37:57,233
Lie down.

855
00:37:58,433 --> 00:37:58,833
Done.

856
00:37:59,533 --> 00:38:01,190
When daughters go back to their parents,

857
00:38:01,192 --> 00:38:02,353
they

858
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:04,032
bring a check in the left hand

859
00:38:04,244 --> 00:38:05,470
and a duck in the right hand.

860
00:38:05,753 --> 00:38:06,472
But you?

861
00:38:06,873 --> 00:38:08,233
You brought back a stupid lock.

862
00:38:08,992 --> 00:38:10,592
You think we're a junkyard

863
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,793
for useless trash from your house?

864
00:38:13,512 --> 00:38:14,552
I told you

865
00:38:14,552 --> 00:38:15,592
we bought two locks.

866
00:38:16,433 --> 00:38:17,472
It's not a stupid lock.

867
00:38:17,632 --> 00:38:18,672
It's over 2,000 yuan.

868
00:38:22,753 --> 00:38:24,273
Look around.

869
00:38:24,273 --> 00:38:24,953
Look closer.

870
00:38:25,793 --> 00:38:27,472
What here is worth 2,000 yuan?

871
00:38:29,313 --> 00:38:29,953
You see.

872
00:38:30,632 --> 00:38:31,032
Done?

873
00:38:31,152 --> 00:38:32,873
Smart locks are convenient.

874
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:35,072
Of course. It costs 2,000, after all.

875
00:38:35,353 --> 00:38:36,313
It better be.

876
00:38:36,672 --> 00:38:37,233
Let me see.

877
00:38:43,233 --> 00:38:44,632
If you pay me 2,000 yuan,

878
00:38:45,592 --> 00:38:47,273
I'll sit by the door all day

879
00:38:47,632 --> 00:38:49,233
and open and close it

880
00:38:49,233 --> 00:38:50,112
for you.

881
00:38:50,552 --> 00:38:51,753
I can even sing.

882
00:38:51,873 --> 00:38:52,393
Good idea.

883
00:38:53,032 --> 00:38:54,313
My pension is over around 4,000.

884
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,311
Go ahead and sing.

885
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:58,353
What a beautiful jasmine flower.

886
00:38:58,873 --> 00:38:59,632
Welcome home.

887
00:39:00,433 --> 00:39:02,953
What a beautiful jasmine flower.

888
00:39:03,152 --> 00:39:03,833
Welcome home.

889
00:39:05,233 --> 00:39:06,793
Not bad.

890
00:39:08,592 --> 00:39:09,552
All right.

891
00:39:09,552 --> 00:39:11,192
Stop eating. Get moving.

892
00:39:11,192 --> 00:39:12,152
It's time to go home.

893
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,911
If I go home, I have to open the door.

894
00:39:14,472 --> 00:39:15,552
That makes me mad.

895
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:18,632
Getting mad twice if I go home,

896
00:39:18,992 --> 00:39:19,353
so no.

897
00:39:19,592 --> 00:39:20,672
No?

898
00:39:20,913 --> 00:39:22,273
Isn't Shen Qing eating dinner?

899
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:23,755
Let him starve.

900
00:39:24,288 --> 00:39:26,488
He's a grown man.
If he could starve to death so easily,

901
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:27,355
then leave him be.

902
00:39:46,511 --> 00:39:49,555
(Mr. Shen, this is the investment plan.)

903
00:39:53,444 --> 00:40:00,577
(Okay. Thanks a lot.)

904
00:40:16,552 --> 00:40:18,512
(The city at night is dazzling.)

905
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:20,666
(Go for a run after working overtime)

906
00:40:20,913 --> 00:40:22,393
(and get ready for tomorrow.)

907
00:40:53,112 --> 00:40:54,472
Honestly, when I think about it,

908
00:40:54,472 --> 00:40:55,393
it's Lian Jin's fault.

909
00:40:56,355 --> 00:40:58,430
He was home
but didn't open the door for Lina.

910
00:40:58,552 --> 00:41:00,353
That's why they fought.

911
00:41:01,353 --> 00:41:02,552
Sometimes, his personality

912
00:41:02,552 --> 00:41:04,233
can be really frustrating.

913
00:41:07,672 --> 00:41:09,273
It's been two days.

914
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,233
Haven't you gotten over it yet?

915
00:41:11,433 --> 00:41:12,273
I just think...

916
00:41:12,273 --> 00:41:13,273
No, listen.

917
00:41:13,273 --> 00:41:14,112
Listen.

918
00:41:14,313 --> 00:41:15,672
That's Lina.

919
00:41:16,592 --> 00:41:17,992
She's outspoken.

920
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,355
One good thing about her is

921
00:41:19,355 --> 00:41:20,977
that she doesn't hold grudges.

922
00:41:21,873 --> 00:41:22,672
I know.

923
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:25,488
Also, can you blame others
for a couple's bickering?

924
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:27,150
What couple doesn't argue?

925
00:41:27,793 --> 00:41:28,869
Don't take it to heart.

926
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:29,777
Don't think that way.

927
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,022
If you keep thinking like this,

928
00:41:31,433 --> 00:41:33,112
the boy will feel bad.

929
00:41:35,672 --> 00:41:36,953
You always help him.

930
00:41:38,592 --> 00:41:38,953
Jeez.

931
00:41:43,953 --> 00:41:44,393
Lian Jin.

932
00:41:46,632 --> 00:41:47,713
Heading to shower?

933
00:41:49,032 --> 00:41:51,393
Want me to turn up the water temperature

934
00:41:51,873 --> 00:41:52,552
by two degrees?

935
00:41:53,313 --> 00:41:54,472
Hot water feels better.

936
00:41:56,192 --> 00:41:56,592
No need.

937
00:42:01,112 --> 00:42:01,753
Oh, right.

938
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:02,833
Say,

939
00:42:04,433 --> 00:42:05,472
we ran out of shampoo.

940
00:42:05,666 --> 00:42:07,888
I bought a new bottle
but forgot to put it back.

941
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,133
It's right here.

942
00:42:11,244 --> 00:42:12,088
Here you go.

943
00:42:12,753 --> 00:42:13,192
Use this.

944
00:42:20,152 --> 00:42:21,992
I have a lecture this weekend.

945
00:42:22,433 --> 00:42:23,873
Do you want to join your mom

946
00:42:24,472 --> 00:42:25,472
and cheer me on?

947
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:29,244
- Sure.
