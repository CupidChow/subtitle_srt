1
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,040
=Love Again=

2
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,110
=Episode 2=

3
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,340
"Tombstone."

4
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,070
Let me send you

5
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,070
somewhere far away.

6
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,870
Let me spend every single day

7
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,380
awaiting our reunion.

8
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,790
May the tear-drenched flowers

9
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,540
cover your tombstone.

10
00:02:01,844 --> 00:02:03,900
To entrust my wails
to the sorrowful fall insects

11
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,950
as I go through grieving winters.

12
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,550
On the tombstone,

13
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,430
your name is in black.

14
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,430
While mine is in red.

15
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,740
But from now on,

16
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,500
I will use sobs and tears,

17
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,430
to strike a deal with Death.

18
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,780
And finally ask

19
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,430
when will it be

20
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,550
that I can

21
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,990
meet you.

22
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:34,940
When will the colors

23
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,180
below the horizon

24
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,940
paint my name

25
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,590
on your tombstone?

26
00:02:59,022 --> 00:02:59,740
That was amazing.

27
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,740
Are you crying?

28
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,390
Thank you.

29
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:17,520
(In Operation)

30
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,150
It's taking so long.

31
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,870
Didn't they say it was a minor surgery?

32
00:03:25,377 --> 00:03:26,740
There's no news from them at all.

33
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,660
Don't be impatient.
No news is good news.

34
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,500
It's Shen Dai.

35
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,288
(Shen Dai)

36
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,830
Dai, Dad is still in operation.

37
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,390
It's been so long.

38
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,030
Why isn't he out yet?

39
00:03:43,088 --> 00:03:44,390
Calm down. It's a minor surgery.

40
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,060
How can I calm down?

41
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:46,990
Listen.

42
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:47,940
Did you guys

43
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,870
feed him oily food usually?

44
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:50,940
And Qing,

45
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,500
did you carefully
read the surgery notice?

46
00:03:53,511 --> 00:03:55,377
How should we look after him
after surgery?

47
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,550
Can you tell your wife

48
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,710
to learn how to make healthy meals?

49
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,340
Elderly people should eat lighter meals.

50
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:04,422
Your sister-in-law has already
done more than enough.

51
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:05,940
We're Dad's biological children.

52
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,390
In terms of effort, I should be first,

53
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,466
and you should be second.

54
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:12,310
(In Operation)

55
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:13,340
Alright. Dad is out.

56
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,390
I'll call you again later.

57
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:15,830
Dad.

58
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,150
Dad.

59
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:16,510
Dad.

60
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,100
How was it?

61
00:04:17,288 --> 00:04:18,300
The surgery was a success.

62
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,460
Thank you.

63
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,860
- Be gentle.
- One, two.

64
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,420
Up.

65
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:22,900
Be gentle.

66
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,950
Dad.

67
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:29,950
I'm thirsty.

68
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,590
He's thirsty.

69
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,590
The doctor said he could
only drink after 12 A.M.

70
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,300
What? After 12 A.M.?

71
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,540
Doctor.

72
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,730
The first night after surgery

73
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,555
is very important.

74
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,830
Sir,

75
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,100
did you see his wound?

76
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:42,900
How was it?

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,844
How was it healing?

78
00:04:43,844 --> 00:04:45,840
Did you prescribe us
any anti-inflammatory medicine?

79
00:04:45,844 --> 00:04:47,333
What kind of anti-inflammatory medicine?

80
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,540
My sister is overseas.
She's just nervous.

81
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,133
- Alright.
- Thank you.

82
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:52,030
Sorry for the trouble.

83
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,070
Water.

84
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,460
You're awake.

85
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,100
Ms. Lian.

86
00:05:06,622 --> 00:05:07,510
You didn't sleep, huh?

87
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,150
My wound still hurts.

88
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,590
That's how it is after surgery.

89
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,070
Have you taken the painkillers
prescribed by your doctor?

90
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,540
I don't take any painkillers.

91
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,950
You're so strong.

92
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,270
However,

93
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,220
we invented painkillers

94
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,980
to relieve pain.

95
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,980
There are barely any side effects
after taking painkillers.

96
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,660
Isn't it better to be more comfortable?

97
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,400
Don't you agree?

98
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:41,860
It's fine.

99
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,100
Where are the painkillers?

100
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,070
They're in the drawer.

101
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,300
Let's take the painkillers later.

102
00:05:49,133 --> 00:05:50,666
We can take one tablet at a time.

103
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,220
Slowly.

104
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,540
Don't hold it in.

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,460
I'm working the night shift tonight.

106
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,710
Call me if you need anything.

107
00:06:06,177 --> 00:06:06,630
Thank you.

108
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,830
Rest more and sleep more.

109
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,150
Dad,

110
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,390
you're making me worry.

111
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,170
(Lian Yilian)

112
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,150
Shen Zhuoran.

113
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,950
Yes.

114
00:06:50,955 --> 00:06:52,422
You'll have four packs of IV today.

115
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,460
Is Ms. Lian absent?

116
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,540
Don't just find her all the time.

117
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,630
Everyone's looking for her.

118
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,288
She doesn't even have time
to take a sip.

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,810
You do have a point.

120
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:04,460
I understand.

121
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,390
Ms. Lian is always busy.

122
00:07:06,822 --> 00:07:08,300
Seeking her for a reason is one thing.

123
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,560
Don't just look for her for fun.

124
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,380
Professor Shen,
I'm not criticizing you here.

125
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,590
Many retired officials
like to chat with Ms. Lian.

126
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,355
They may be idle
during their hospital visit,

127
00:07:15,355 --> 00:07:16,480
but Ms. Lian is super busy.

128
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,300
They're so clueless.

129
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,711
That's right.

130
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,220
You have a point.

131
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,630
They're clueless.

132
00:07:22,688 --> 00:07:23,844
Call me if you need anything.

133
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,710
Okay.

134
00:07:35,577 --> 00:07:36,070
Nurse,

135
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,866
my indwelling needle came off.

136
00:07:38,044 --> 00:07:39,644
I want Ms. Lian
to reinsert it for me.

137
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,860
Wait in your ward.

138
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,860
She's the beauty
of the high-ranking cadre ward.

139
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,460
She's very busy.

140
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,733
(Listening to the rain
beneath the eaves,)

141
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:52,730
(I know the sound
of apricot blossoms blooming.)

142
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,660
Hurry up. We're getting late.

143
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,830
Mom, tell Grandpa to rest well.

144
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,750
Alright. Got it.

145
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,190
You better study hard.

146
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:19,830
Dad.

147
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,660
Why don't you have some more water?

148
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,900
My tummy...

149
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,270
Dad,

150
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,630
how are you?

151
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:27,780
Does your tummy hurt?
Or do you feel bloated?

152
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,860
Qing, give Dad a belly rub.

153
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,630
He just finished his surgery.

154
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,110
The stitch is on his tummy.

155
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,940
How can I rub it?

156
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:36,230
What's wrong with Dad?

157
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,390
Dad is having constipation.

158
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,390
He feels uncomfortable.

159
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,110
The doctor said he can only
have a semi-liquid diet.

160
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,088
What did you feed him?

161
00:08:44,244 --> 00:08:45,470
He had his surgery yesterday.

162
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,780
What could I feed him?

163
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,933
How about we use an enema?

164
00:08:49,022 --> 00:08:50,419
We can't let him suffer like this.

165
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,750
The doctor did prescribe it to him.

166
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,090
Can you do it? If not, I'll do it.

167
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,150
Don't.

168
00:08:54,622 --> 00:08:56,059
Give it to me. I'll do it myself.

169
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,630
I can do it.

170
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,630
Dad, let Shen Qing
do it for you. He's your son.

171
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,630
Dad, this is no time to be embarrassed.

172
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,630
Close it.

173
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,390
Shen Qing.

174
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,660
What are you doing? Shift the camera.

175
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,700
I'm giving Dad an enema.

176
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,800
Why do you want to see it?

177
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,900
Why not?

178
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,700
I'm his daughter.

179
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,940
You guys keep telling me
that he's doing great.

180
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,370
But he's sick whenever I call him.

181
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,150
How is that great?

182
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:24,820
Listen.

183
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,420
I mailed plenty of items to him...

184
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,820
I'll hang up if you keep nagging us.

185
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,060
Just hang up.

186
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,510
I'm worried about Dad.

187
00:09:30,711 --> 00:09:32,180
He's not just your father, you know?

188
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,060
Hang up.

189
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,390
Here, Dad.

190
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:39,090
Shen Qing, are you okay?

191
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,110
Of course.

192
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:41,470
Dad.

193
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:44,030
Cover it.

194
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,350
I'll do so.

195
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,270
Have you put it in?

196
00:09:48,177 --> 00:09:49,660
Dad, how is it? Do you feel anything?

197
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,580
No.

198
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:53,990
Why don't we give him one more?

199
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:54,990
One more?

200
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,700
Sure. We'll give him one more.

201
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,700
Shen Qing.

202
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,355
What's wrong?

203
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:00,600
Do you feel something?

204
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,150
Really?

205
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,619
Hurry. We'll take you to the toilet.

206
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:02,990
Let's go.

207
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:03,780
Hurry.

208
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,150
Quickly.

209
00:10:08,044 --> 00:10:08,750
What's that sound?

210
00:10:09,688 --> 00:10:10,390
What is Dad doing?

211
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,230
Is he okay?

212
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,300
He pooped his pants.

213
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,270
Dad, it's fine.

214
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,870
It's good as long as you poop.

215
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:21,955
We need toilet paper.

216
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:22,580
Where?

217
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,488
The toilet paper. Here.

218
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,644
There are toilet papers here.

219
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,555
- Here.
- I'll call a nurse.

220
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,844
Is there a nurse here?

221
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,630
Hurry and shift the camera!

222
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,750
Where is he?

223
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,390
Dad, you...

224
00:10:33,688 --> 00:10:35,822
- We did the same when we were young.
- Hey!

225
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,109
- Shift the camera!
- Dad, everything's fine.

226
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:38,750
Cover it.

227
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,630
Dad!

228
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,660
What's wrong?

229
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,780
He pooped.

230
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,540
He pooped, huh? It's fine.

231
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,110
Don't panic.

232
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,390
Get a set of clean bed sheets.

233
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,180
Also, bring another clean patient gown.

234
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,700
I'll do it.

235
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,710
The toilet paper alone isn't enough.

236
00:10:57,711 --> 00:10:59,350
Is Dad okay or not?

237
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,622
Here. Put this at the bottom.

238
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,150
Professor Shen, it's fine.

239
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,900
Everything's fine.

240
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:05,510
That means you're recovering well.

241
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,711
This is very normal.

242
00:11:06,755 --> 00:11:08,555
It's normal for this
to occur after surgery.

243
00:11:08,577 --> 00:11:12,000
(Inpatient)

244
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,444
(Listening to the rain
beneath the eaves,)

245
00:11:20,466 --> 00:11:22,311
(I know the sound
of apricot blossoms blooming.)

246
00:11:22,311 --> 00:11:24,022
(Pity the lone wild goose
in the fields,)

247
00:11:24,022 --> 00:11:25,930
(expressing its heartfelt thoughts
without proof.)

248
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:39,820
Professor Shen.

249
00:11:40,511 --> 00:11:41,610
Time to take your medicine.

250
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:42,300
Okay.

251
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,960
Your tummy feels
much better today, right?

252
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,060
Yeah.

253
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,470
Sorry for the trouble.

254
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,820
Not at all.

255
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,180
Ms. Lian always says

256
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,990
that our patients are showing us

257
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,200
their most vulnerable sides.

258
00:11:54,244 --> 00:11:55,390
We need to console them

259
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,470
and help them often.

260
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,780
Yeah.

261
00:11:58,155 --> 00:11:59,390
You guys are angels in white.

262
00:12:04,644 --> 00:12:05,955
It's okay. I'll do it myself.

263
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,940
Is Ms. Lian not working today?

264
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:10,350
No.

265
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:12,400
Her son was sick.
She went back to look after him.

266
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,300
What's wrong with his son?

267
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,110
He has been sick for many years.

268
00:12:16,577 --> 00:12:18,030
He needed someone to look after him.

269
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,660
Ms. Lian has a tough life.

270
00:12:19,888 --> 00:12:20,990
Many people have introduced

271
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,150
outstanding partners to her,

272
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,511
but she didn't like any of them.

273
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:28,150
That hurts!

274
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,180
Doctor!

275
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,940
Where's the doctor?

276
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,060
What's with the ruckus again?

277
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,820
Call Ms. Lian here!

278
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,660
Hurry and tell the doctor to come!

279
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,700
What's going on?

280
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,600
- Tell Ms. Lian to come.
- Don't bring it up.

281
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,729
The elderly lady in the next ward
has bile duct cancer

282
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,780
and underwent open surgery.

283
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,270
To prevent deep vein thrombosis,

284
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,333
she needs to move around.

285
00:12:42,622 --> 00:12:44,444
But she complains about
the pain constantly.

286
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,940
Her son criticized us for that,

287
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,488
saying that we tormented his mother.

288
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,510
He tried to get violent.

289
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,390
How are we tormenting her?

290
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:51,900
We're doing this for her own good.

291
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:53,769
Ms. Lian has explained
to them several times.

292
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,755
But they don't understand.

293
00:12:54,888 --> 00:12:56,340
Now, they're causing another ruckus.

294
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,444
I think Ms. Lian has
to rush back again tomorrow.

295
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,311
It's such a dull and stuffy day.

296
00:13:00,577 --> 00:13:01,688
I'll check on them first.

297
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,990
Where's Ms. Lian?

298
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,420
Why isn't she here yet?

299
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,940
I can't take this anymore!

300
00:13:05,955 --> 00:13:07,920
I don't care. I want
to speak with Ms. Lian today.

301
00:13:07,933 --> 00:13:09,888
Tell her to come!
What do you guys mean by this?

302
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:15,630
Ding?

303
00:13:19,911 --> 00:13:21,066
What are you doing?

304
00:13:21,088 --> 00:13:22,511
Are you pretending to be a stranger?

305
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:22,955
No.

306
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,660
We're old, you know?

307
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,510
Can't you just keep a low profile?

308
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,900
Who are you calling old?

309
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,540
You're the old one here.

310
00:13:29,622 --> 00:13:31,780
We revolutionary vanguards
are forever young, you know?

311
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,750
Fine. You're young.

312
00:13:35,311 --> 00:13:36,488
It's been so many years.

313
00:13:36,511 --> 00:13:38,940
You've always been chasing after
the latest trend, even now.

314
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,580
You chased after the latest trend.

315
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,270
You...

316
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,660
Okay. Please.

317
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:44,769
Let's go.

318
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,390
- Absorb my aura.
- Don't put arms on me.

319
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,270
This is so indecent.

320
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,660
Cha cha.

321
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,700
Cha cha.

322
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,180
Cha cha.

323
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:56,700
Ding.

324
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,180
I'm awake.

325
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:57,540
Shen.

326
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,109
I'm awake.

327
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,020
Let me adjust your bed.

328
00:13:59,022 --> 00:13:59,666
Adjust it.

329
00:14:00,577 --> 00:14:01,270
Adjust it for me.

330
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,270
What did I tell you?

331
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,820
At our age, we may die easily.

332
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,300
You have to understand the situation.

333
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,790
You mustn't just wait for your demise.

334
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,660
What the heck are you saying?

335
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:15,133
I've done the thinking for you.

336
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,700
You have to find a second partner.

337
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,510
Happiness comes from hard work.

338
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,900
Do you know how old you are?

339
00:14:23,511 --> 00:14:24,870
You're still as indecent as always.

340
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:25,780
Shen.

341
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,990
I brought you some aged white tea.

342
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,700
Ding, you do know me the best.

343
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,850
- Thanks.
- Time for a shot.

344
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:32,270
Okay.

345
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:32,750
Hurry up.

346
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:33,940
Okay.

347
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:34,820
Here.

348
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,660
Are they your friends?

349
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:39,990
That's Ms. Lian.

350
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:41,990
Hello, Ms. Lian.

351
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,700
- Hello.
- Hello.

352
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:45,060
Let's check your temperature.

353
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:46,420
Seems like you're doing good.

354
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,490
Does your wound still hurt?

355
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,390
Here.

356
00:14:48,533 --> 00:14:49,266
I'll pick it up.

357
00:14:49,266 --> 00:14:49,711
I'll do it.

358
00:14:49,854 --> 00:14:51,650
(Listening to the rain
beneath the eaves...)

359
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,270
I'll do it.

360
00:14:52,822 --> 00:14:53,660
I'll leave it here.

361
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,510
I'll do it.

362
00:14:56,177 --> 00:14:57,700
How is it? Does your wound still hurt?

363
00:14:58,422 --> 00:14:59,350
I feel much better now.

364
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,990
It'll be quite cold.

365
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,630
It's fine.

366
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,350
Okay?

367
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,270
Okay.

368
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,350
Don't spout nonsense.

369
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,940
Gou, what are you
telling Ding in secret?

370
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,688
What are you doing?

371
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,110
Ms. Lian, take care.

372
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:16,820
Okay.

373
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,780
Take care.

374
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,300
Thank you.

375
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,540
Thank you so much.

376
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:23,940
Sit down.

377
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,270
Shen,

378
00:15:26,355 --> 00:15:28,111
look into my eyes and be honest with me.

379
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:30,300
Is there something between you two?

380
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:32,700
I...

381
00:15:33,844 --> 00:15:34,470
Just ignore him.

382
00:15:34,711 --> 00:15:35,750
Do you know how old he is?

383
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,466
How could there
be something between them?

384
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,060
Ding.

385
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,940
I'm sure his wound hurts.

386
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,060
Even so, he was full of smiles.

387
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,350
I...

388
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,180
Can't you behave decently for once?

389
00:15:47,288 --> 00:15:48,780
He's still the same playboy as he was.

390
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,510
Indeed.

391
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,244
Just ignore him.

392
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:50,990
Shen,

393
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,750
I'll make you some tea.

394
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,444
Let's relieve your body heat.

395
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:54,870
Okay.

396
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,200
What are you doing?

397
00:15:57,266 --> 00:15:58,288
I'm confiscating the tea.

398
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,540
Ding.

399
00:15:59,711 --> 00:16:01,170
Why are you relieving his heatiness?

400
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,510
Right now, Shen

401
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,540
needs a huge breeze

402
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,780
to start the passionate fire
in his heart.

403
00:16:07,155 --> 00:16:10,030
I know it's not too late for him
to start a new chapter in his life.

404
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,350
Even so, he has to take it
one step at a time.

405
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:13,300
Am I right?

406
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,170
We have limited time
to accomplish a noble mission.

407
00:16:15,177 --> 00:16:16,030
We have to be quick.

408
00:16:16,244 --> 00:16:18,711
A few elderly people nearing
100 years old are in our college.

409
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,660
Is 70 still considered
in one's prime nowadays?

410
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:21,870
Why don't you do

411
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,444
a kite flip for us when you're 70, then?

412
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:25,110
Why must we do kite flips when we're 70?

413
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,270
Listen, I...

414
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:27,470
- Enough.
- I...

415
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:28,230
You two should...

416
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,030
You two

417
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,820
are a quarrelsome duo, huh?

418
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,900
You guys quarrel all the time,

419
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,180
even at the hospital.

420
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,088
My wound is hurting

421
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:37,511
because of your quarrel, you know?

422
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,390
Sorry about that.

423
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,300
Shen,

424
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,110
you have to express your stand.

425
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,390
Do you want the tea leaves or not?

426
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,780
Gou said he loved this tea as well.

427
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,390
He can have it, then.

428
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:54,150
There's no need for any gifts
this Chinese New Year.

429
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,230
We can quarrel during the occasion.

430
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:58,820
Shen,

431
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,870
you must be senile.

432
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,350
Fine. I'm leaving. Goodbye.

433
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,270
Go ahead. See yourself off.

434
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,710
Ding!

435
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:06,750
Don't be mad.

436
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:07,622
Smooth journey ahead!

437
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,470
Hurry and see Ding off.

438
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,466
Just forget about him.

439
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:15,820
Old man!

440
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,860
The exit is over there.

441
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,100
Come on.

442
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:22,990
Hurry up.

443
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,580
Pick up the pace.

444
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,540
Come on.

445
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:32,300
Are you leaving?

446
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:33,340
Okay.

447
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,750
Mom!

448
00:17:42,866 --> 00:17:43,990
I'll head there for a second.

449
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,910
Why are you only here now?

450
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,430
Why did you insist on calling me here?

451
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,688
I have to look after
my father-in-law in the hospital.

452
00:17:51,711 --> 00:17:52,620
I called you here

453
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,910
because of your father-in-law.

454
00:17:54,555 --> 00:17:54,990
Speak up.

455
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,470
Don't look at me.

456
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,380
Cast your gaze to the crowd.

457
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:00,340
To the crowd?

458
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:00,910
Who?

459
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:02,030
That one.

460
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,780
The person in red.

461
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,100
Three of them are in red.

462
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,710
Which one?

463
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,230
The one at the side.

464
00:18:07,511 --> 00:18:08,140
The petite one.

465
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:08,780
I saw her.

466
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,030
She's been divorced for over a decade.

467
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,511
Her daughter is living abroad.

468
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,300
You know?

469
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:16,670
And,

470
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,860
the one next to her in a flowery jacket.

471
00:18:19,133 --> 00:18:20,670
Her partner passed away not long ago.

472
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,670
She became younger all of a sudden.

473
00:18:24,377 --> 00:18:26,300
Why is she looking for
another partner, then?

474
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,422
It's due to rigid demand.

475
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:29,666
She's trying to free up a house
for her son's wedding.

476
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,860
Look over there.

477
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,710
She's a retired model.

478
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,670
She has always been single.

479
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,300
For some reason,

480
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,620
she wants to find a partner.

481
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,480
She's better than Peng Yulan.

482
00:18:44,488 --> 00:18:46,059
And, there are no grandchildren.

483
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,030
She has an elegant air.

484
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,140
Indeed.

485
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,950
Lina, you're here!

486
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:51,470
Baoqin.

487
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,230
Lina.

488
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,000
What's going on?

489
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:54,300
I have good news for you all.

490
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,750
Look. My daughter is here too.

491
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,710
Hello, madams.

492
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:57,950
She's so pretty.

493
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,510
What's going on?
You're making us anxious.

494
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,060
You're making us flustered here.

495
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,190
Hurry and tell us about it.

496
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,620
Tell us the exact situation.

497
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,270
Where is his house located?

498
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,340
How huge is it?

499
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,230
What's going on?

500
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:12,820
You've been single for over a decade.

501
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,540
Now, you're still being picky?

502
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:16,820
You think everyone is like you?

503
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,710
You're acting like a starving wolf
right after your husband's passing.

504
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,300
Enough already.

505
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,030
We're good friends

506
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,070
who have been doing square dances
for a long time.

507
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:27,990
It's been so many years.

508
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,990
We can't just fight
because of a man, right?

509
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,100
That's right.

510
00:19:31,533 --> 00:19:32,230
Don't you agree?

511
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,600
Alright.

512
00:19:32,622 --> 00:19:34,422
I'll introduce
her father-in-law to you all.

513
00:19:34,444 --> 00:19:35,670
The old mister

514
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,140
is 70 this year.

515
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,030
Before he retired,

516
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,022
he was teaching Mandarin
in Normal University.

517
00:19:41,644 --> 00:19:43,977
- Now, he's living in Clover Garden.
- That's amazing.

518
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,540
At the foot of Mount Zijin.

519
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:47,860
How much is his wage?

520
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,380
Over 10,000 yuan.

521
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,190
His wage is over 10,000 yuan?

522
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:52,510
His daughter is living abroad.

523
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:53,860
His son

524
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,540
is an executive.

525
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,140
They don't live off their parents.

526
00:19:59,377 --> 00:20:00,190
That's pretty good.

527
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,190
Amazing.

528
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,820
That's great.

529
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:02,750
Baoqin,

530
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,910
are you talking about your in-law?

531
00:20:06,577 --> 00:20:07,750
He's your in-law, right?

532
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:09,266
A professor at Normal University

533
00:20:09,311 --> 00:20:10,511
with a son and a daughter.

534
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,190
Lina, was she talking about
your father-in-law?

535
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,990
Lina, come and tell me about it.

536
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,510
Do you think I'm okay?

537
00:20:18,511 --> 00:20:20,644
What do you think about
me as your mother-in-law?

538
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,430
I watched over you as you grew up.

539
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,230
Wait. As for the house...

540
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:25,950
Lina!

541
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:27,340
Mom!

542
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,100
Mom?

543
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,030
Shen.

544
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,230
You old fool.

545
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,270
How could you be this lucky?

546
00:20:49,755 --> 00:20:51,340
What nonsense are you talking about?

547
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,060
I made some inquiries.

548
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,380
You see, Ms. Lian's son

549
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:57,910
is all grown up.

550
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:01,030
Therefore,
she's been looking for a partner.

551
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:03,488
But it's not like she has no criteria.

552
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,670
She's looking for someone
with a private residence.

553
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:07,300
If so...

554
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,580
Look at this.

555
00:21:08,888 --> 00:21:10,910
Just when she was about
to look for a partner,

556
00:21:10,977 --> 00:21:12,488
you were sent here and hospitalized.

557
00:21:12,511 --> 00:21:13,822
Why do you think that happened?

558
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,340
It's all because she's waiting for you.

559
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,190
Shen, it's all thanks
to the affinity between you two.

560
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,030
How would she fall for me?

561
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,430
I'm sickly

562
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,950
and full of white hair.

563
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,430
No one will fall for me.

564
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:29,510
I can't say about the rest,

565
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,030
but your white hair
is easy to deal with.

566
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:31,822
Use "One Dye Black."

567
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,860
Your hair will be black once you use it.

568
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,580
Ms. Lian.

569
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,430
I'll entrust Shen to you.

570
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,060
It's our job.

571
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:50,820
Ms. Lian, you see,

572
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:51,780
Shen

573
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,270
is quite naggy.

574
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,270
But he told me a lot.

575
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,470
He told me

576
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,820
that the medical personnel here
were amazing.

577
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,230
Did you know what he said?

578
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:03,466
He said he couldn't bear
to be discharged.

579
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:06,750
Is that so?

580
00:22:08,155 --> 00:22:08,910
Lina, you're here.

581
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:11,270
Mr. Gou, are you here to visit Dad?

582
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,780
Your father-in-law has a weak body.

583
00:22:15,044 --> 00:22:16,377
That's why I visit him often

584
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:18,190
to share my energy with him.

585
00:22:20,044 --> 00:22:21,190
Here comes the matchmaker.

586
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,620
My mother loves to spout nonsense.

587
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,270
Who said so?

588
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,377
You do have a point.

589
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,060
That's a great suggestion.

590
00:22:29,288 --> 00:22:30,380
I think your father-in-law

591
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,270
should live on optimistically.

592
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,470
You see, the length
of one's life is limited.

593
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,140
However, the width isn't.

594
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:38,639
You know?

595
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,679
- Yes.
- Don't you agree?

596
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,066
Indeed.

597
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:40,990
You're right.

598
00:22:41,866 --> 00:22:42,733
Give me a second.

599
00:22:42,822 --> 00:22:43,777
I have a call to answer.

600
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:44,950
- Mom!
- Hello?

601
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,380
Baby, you...

602
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,670
I'll be there in a second.

603
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:51,622
I'll hang up now. See you later.

604
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,230
Mr. Gou.

605
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:55,950
Your outfit is pretty cool.

606
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,644
It's an Italian style.

607
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,300
Calf leather style.

608
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:06,820
Today's a great day.

609
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,670
Our wish will surely come true.

610
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,710
He can't move when he sees pretty girls.

611
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,860
He runs away

612
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,670
when he sees

613
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,710
members of justice like us.

614
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,670
What a chump!

615
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,100
Mom, that's enough.

616
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,780
He's my father-in-law's best friend.

617
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,540
If you don't like him, just avoid him.

618
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,750
I didn't like what he said just now.

619
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,140
Sharing his energy with him?

620
00:23:28,177 --> 00:23:30,111
We're not concerned
about your father-in-law?

621
00:23:30,155 --> 00:23:31,555
Just look at his current partner.

622
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,300
Her hair was red.

623
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,060
Listen, if you let him
find a partner for your father-in-law,

624
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,910
he'll surely find someone
with rainbow hair.

625
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,155
I suppose that's quite nice.

626
00:23:42,177 --> 00:23:44,710
That's not it. Lina, listen to me.

627
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,710
In situations like this,

628
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,780
you must keep the initiative
in your own hands.

629
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,140
- Yeah.
- For this task,

630
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,190
I'm taking it on.

631
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,430
I'll surely find
someone amazing for him.

632
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,780
Gou, huh? My foot.

633
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,729
Enough. Let's go.
The soup is getting cold.

634
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,030
Did you see how he shook his body?

635
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,540
Such indecency.

636
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:17,310
(Listening to the rain
beneath the eaves...)

637
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,670
Listening to the rain beneath the eaves,

638
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,620
I know the sound of
apricot blossoms blooming.

639
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,933
Pity the lone wild goose in the fields,

640
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,170
expressing its heartfelt thoughts
without proof.

641
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:44,190
(Lian Yilian is great.)

642
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,620
"Lian Yilian is great."

643
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:51,750
You startled me.

644
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:54,000
This is a poem with an implied meaning.

645
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,400
- It's so romantic.
- That's enough.

646
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,155
Who wrote it?

647
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,270
Was it Professor Shen?

648
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,950
I knew it.

649
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,750
Expressing its heartfelt thoughts
without proof.

650
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,620
That was mushy.

651
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,270
Say,

652
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,860
Professor Shen is good in all aspects.

653
00:25:10,422 --> 00:25:11,888
His condition isn't serious either.

654
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,060
It's just that he's old.

655
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,620
Can you just stop it?

656
00:25:17,866 --> 00:25:19,244
It's already frustrating enough.

657
00:25:19,266 --> 00:25:21,533
Do you think youngsters
can write something like this?

658
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,060
I can't take it.

659
00:25:24,177 --> 00:25:26,644
The older one gets,
the higher their sugar level is.

660
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:27,490
You should be careful.

661
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,770
You might get diabetes from this.

662
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:29,710
Return to your work.

663
00:25:29,711 --> 00:25:30,340
Stop chatting.

664
00:25:30,888 --> 00:25:32,030
Ward Ten is calling for help.

665
00:25:32,222 --> 00:25:33,060
Go and check on him.

666
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:38,955
You might get diabetes.

667
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:39,670
Shut up.

668
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:06,750
Dad.

669
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,190
I'll dry your towel under the sun.

670
00:26:09,266 --> 00:26:10,060
It'll sanitize it.

671
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,990
What are you reading?

672
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,190
Gou gave this to me.

673
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:17,230
What is it?

674
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,230
This is...

675
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:20,377
- It's One Dye Black.
- Is it a hair dye?

676
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,540
I'm studying how it works.

677
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,060
Isn't this easy?

678
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,620
It's just like a shoe polish.

679
00:26:25,688 --> 00:26:27,711
Just brush it on your hair
and it'll turn black.

680
00:26:27,733 --> 00:26:28,222
Is that so?

681
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:30,510
Dad,

682
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,910
you didn't want to
dye your hair in the past.

683
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,710
Mr. Gou's words do work wonders.

684
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:35,910
That's not it.

685
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,510
He insisted on giving it to me.

686
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:38,510
I can't just reject him.

687
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:39,866
Come. Let me put it on for you.

688
00:26:39,911 --> 00:26:40,688
Look. Like this.

689
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,270
Okay.

690
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,470
Like this.

691
00:26:44,777 --> 00:26:45,620
Let me tie a knot.

692
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,750
Open your hair roots
and turn them outward.

693
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,380
Dye it by combing it.

694
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,140
Apply them evenly...

695
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,066
What are you doing?

696
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:57,910
You're here.

697
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,620
I'm dyeing Dad's hair.

698
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,266
That's right.

699
00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:01,750
We're at a hospital, you know?

700
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,270
Why are you dyeing his hair?

701
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,950
Even so, he has to look spirited.

702
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:05,620
Indeed.

703
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,140
Qing, how's Dad doing today?

704
00:27:13,222 --> 00:27:14,030
Take a look yourself.

705
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,620
It's black now!

706
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,300
Look!

707
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,100
It did turn black.

708
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:18,620
Dad.

709
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,140
This is magical.

710
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,470
Mom.

711
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:26,755
What soup did you make today?

712
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:27,710
Pork rib soup.

713
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,140
It's black.

714
00:27:37,488 --> 00:27:38,060
It's black.

715
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,140
I mean his hair.

716
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,100
I just dyed it for him.

717
00:27:40,155 --> 00:27:41,300
It looks great on him, right?

718
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,670
He has finally come to his senses!

719
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:47,910
Wait.

720
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,860
He's looking better now.

721
00:27:50,066 --> 00:27:51,777
If your father-in-law
is looking like this,

722
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,860
we should expand our scope.

723
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,030
I'll return to Nanhu Park

724
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,111
and do a thorough search.

725
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,820
Besides the dancing circle,

726
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,950
I think we can also consider

727
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,300
the calligraphy circle.

728
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,380
To put it simply,

729
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:09,230
we should find someone
most suitable for him.

730
00:28:09,533 --> 00:28:10,620
Don't let him hear us.

731
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,100
Alright. Go now.

732
00:28:12,133 --> 00:28:12,750
I'll go inside.

733
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,580
In-law.

734
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:18,620
You're here.

735
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,670
Did you dye your hair?

736
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:20,540
Yeah.

737
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,540
You look 30 years younger
all of a sudden.

738
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,620
My goodness.

739
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:26,710
She was exaggerating it.

740
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:37,511
Did you get off work?

741
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,230
Did you dye your hair?

742
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,750
You look younger now.

743
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:46,780
If so,

744
00:28:47,622 --> 00:28:48,666
I'll make a move first.

745
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,430
Smooth out those crow's feet
for your grandpa a bit.

746
00:29:08,755 --> 00:29:09,620
Make him look younger.

747
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,470
Make it brighter.

748
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:13,270
Roger that.

749
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,670
The patient gown is a no-go.

750
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:18,666
You have to remove it.

751
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:19,380
Got it.

752
00:29:21,266 --> 00:29:21,950
Not bad at all.

753
00:29:25,733 --> 00:29:28,890
(Serious inquiries only, let's share
rest of our lives with deep affection.)

754
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:29,949
This is my gift.

755
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:30,888
This is my profile.

756
00:29:30,955 --> 00:29:31,940
Let me scan the QR code.

757
00:29:31,955 --> 00:29:34,280
Okay. My father-in-law is the one
getting a blind date here.

758
00:29:34,288 --> 00:29:35,600
But the WeChat account is mine.

759
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,430
Dear sisters,

760
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,060
listen to me.

761
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,300
Although Professor Shen

762
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,380
has retired,

763
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,910
he's still very busy.

764
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,910
He often has to write articles.

765
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,600
- So he cannot be here personally.
- Yes.

766
00:29:45,644 --> 00:29:46,466
He entrusted us...

767
00:29:46,488 --> 00:29:47,555
- Yeah.
- He entrusted us.

768
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,066
He entrusted his blind date to us.

769
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:49,860
Mom, say,

770
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,300
why are there so many madams
trying to attend the blind date?

771
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,088
Plenty of them
aren't looking for partners.

772
00:29:54,111 --> 00:29:55,133
They came to their senses.

773
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,300
They went traveling

774
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,580
or had fun overseas.

775
00:29:57,622 --> 00:29:59,860
Unlike us, we always
worry about our children.

776
00:30:00,555 --> 00:30:01,060
All done.

777
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,780
Make a video.

778
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,380
Record a video.

779
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,060
Here.

780
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:04,910
Like this.

781
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,030
Duole, take a look.

782
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,910
All of these are profiles
of your potential future grandma

783
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,230
that I've gathered.

784
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,380
I'm working hard

785
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,600
for the sake of your grandpa.

786
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:15,950
I'm doing my best here.

787
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:20,820
Listen to me.

788
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:22,149
(Nurse Station)
How could you do this?

789
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,330
Everyone, come and take a look!

790
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:24,860
Ms. Lian is just a snob!

791
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,510
What's wrong?

792
00:30:25,555 --> 00:30:27,430
You have no regard
for us commoners, huh?

793
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,780
Angels in white? My foot!

794
00:30:28,888 --> 00:30:30,733
- Mind your words!
- My mother is in pain!

795
00:30:30,755 --> 00:30:32,060
- Are you guys deaf?
- Stop it.

796
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:34,133
How could you guys
treat your patients like this?

797
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,270
Come and take a look!

798
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,822
Are you sure you're saving patients?

799
00:30:36,822 --> 00:30:37,666
You are harming us!

800
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:38,666
You are so snobbish!

801
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,820
You treat us with contempt

802
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,030
- because we're commoners.
- You're biased!

803
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,270
What's with the ruckus?

804
00:30:44,888 --> 00:30:46,270
Everyone is in pain after surgery.

805
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,909
What's wrong with
getting out of bed early?

806
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:50,088
They're trying to help you
recover faster, you know?

807
00:30:50,111 --> 00:30:51,270
Don't you even know that?

808
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,140
Biased?

809
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,620
Who said so?

810
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,950
She already visited your ward thrice.

811
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,190
You guys chased her out, didn't you?

812
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:01,270
You still have the guts

813
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,430
to make her apologize to you?

814
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,100
This is the hospital!

815
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,990
This isn't the place for you
to act like a monkey.

816
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,030
Let's go.

817
00:31:14,755 --> 00:31:16,690
Professor Shen is the only one
who can stop them.

818
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,190
They never listened to us.

819
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:28,720
(Inpatient)

820
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,860
They caused a ruckus

821
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,430
in the hospital's nurse station.

822
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,950
This in itself is
a particularly vile behavior.

823
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,780
The extreme behavior of some patients

824
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,860
needs to be educated and stopped.

825
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,060
You guys mustn't just
let them get their way.

826
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:45,470
Alright.

827
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,580
I believe you can
deal with it appropriately.

828
00:31:48,888 --> 00:31:50,670
I am a patient from
the hepatobiliary ward.

829
00:31:51,355 --> 00:31:52,230
My surname is Shen.

830
00:31:54,044 --> 00:31:54,580
Alright.

831
00:31:54,933 --> 00:31:56,266
I'll wait for your investigation.

832
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,780
Thank you.

833
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,190
You must've suffered.

834
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,750
It's nothing.

835
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,030
So,

836
00:32:07,155 --> 00:32:08,266
let's take your temperature.

837
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:09,750
If so...

838
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,244
- I...
- You can sit down.

839
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,100
You see, the patient

840
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,750
isn't recovering well after surgery.

841
00:32:16,088 --> 00:32:18,044
Her family member was just flustered.

842
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,340
That's why
they vented their anger on me.

843
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,910
Your job scope

844
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,670
doesn't include
taking the brunt of their anger.

845
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,820
It's not included.

846
00:32:27,288 --> 00:32:28,850
It's fine as long as you're used to it.

847
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,780
You may get used to it, but not me.

848
00:32:34,311 --> 00:32:36,311
Let me take a look
at your indwelling needle.

849
00:32:39,933 --> 00:32:40,540
Does it hurt?

850
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:41,510
A little.

851
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,780
I'll remove it for you later.

852
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,380
I need to reinsert it tomorrow.

853
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:49,860
Lian.

854
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:55,430
Lian.

855
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:01,430
Sorry. It was too heavy.

856
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,380
I lost my grip.

857
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,710
Dad,

858
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,990
I brought you something.

859
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:08,670
Okay.

860
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:09,860
I'll keep them in the cabinet.

861
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,100
We were taking my body temperature.

862
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:14,333
- I'll leave now.
- It's fine.

863
00:33:14,355 --> 00:33:15,400
- I'll leave now.
- You...

864
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,780
I'll reinsert
the indwelling needle tomorrow.

865
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:19,300
So,

866
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,190
you see...

867
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:21,380
The thermometer is here.

868
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,060
We can talk after you find it.

869
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,580
I brought all those

870
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,860
blind date profiles to the hospital

871
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,540
so that your father could determine

872
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,580
who was suitable for him.

873
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,270
I almost went blind.

874
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:39,710
I was so awkward

875
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:41,860
that I crawled my way out of the ward.

876
00:33:43,177 --> 00:33:44,866
No wonder Dad wanted to dye his hair.

877
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:48,270
Grandpa found love out of nowhere.

878
00:33:48,888 --> 00:33:49,750
Don't spout nonsense.

879
00:33:52,022 --> 00:33:53,470
Your father shouldn't have done so.

880
00:33:53,577 --> 00:33:55,540
He should've told us
that he found someone.

881
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:57,780
Mom and I had to rush
to the matchmaking corner

882
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,711
even though
the weather was hot, you know?

883
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,060
Duole had to join us as well.

884
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,190
I was happy to do so.

885
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,540
You're just too free.

886
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,510
You play matchmaker

887
00:34:06,622 --> 00:34:08,022
and spread gossip all day long.

888
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,620
Isn't it normal for nurses
to be nice to their patients?

889
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,660
Normal? Listen. They did this.

890
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,140
Like this.

891
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,030
Hello, Mom?

892
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,060
Lina.

893
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,470
Have your father-in-law
reviewed the profiles?

894
00:34:29,888 --> 00:34:31,180
Did he find anyone suitable?

895
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,700
Review the profiles?

896
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,870
He already held
Ms. Lian's hand, you know?

897
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:37,030
Really?

898
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,260
Is that her?

899
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,830
Slowly. Take your time.

900
00:35:18,711 --> 00:35:20,066
What are you staring at?

901
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:26,620
In-law.

902
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:28,870
How are you now?

903
00:35:29,311 --> 00:35:30,220
I feel much better.

904
00:35:31,777 --> 00:35:32,910
You look healthier as well.

905
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,950
The medical personnel here
are very professional.

906
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:37,790
That's right.

907
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,990
Indeed.

908
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,990
Family members like us
can only do so much

909
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,660
when we visit you. I...

910
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:46,790
Indeed.

911
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,990
You had a speedy recovery.

912
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:48,577
I'm serious.

913
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,220
It's all thanks to her meticulous care.

914
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:51,790
You...

915
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,830
You should hurry and recover.

916
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,260
Lina and I

917
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,990
went to the matchmaking corner that day.

918
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,830
The elderly ladies

919
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,660
liked you.

920
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,266
Show your father-in-law their profiles.

921
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,510
Go on.

922
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,390
Stop it.

923
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:05,700
Wait.

924
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,740
Show him their profiles.

925
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,177
He has to see who's suitable for him.

926
00:36:09,177 --> 00:36:10,244
Where are the profiles?

927
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,510
They're in the cabinet.

928
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,390
I'll show them to you.

929
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:15,510
You...

930
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,840
Your blood pressure is rising.

931
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:17,950
I'll measure it again.

932
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,310
Look at them.

933
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:20,740
Look.

934
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,910
Isn't it cute? Look at this.

935
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,060
Look at this.

936
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,310
Enough already.

937
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:27,540
Mrs. Liu,

938
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,140
keep them away. Stop with your nonsense.

939
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:31,580
Look at this.

940
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,060
This.

941
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,030
If we have to pick someone,

942
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,430
we have to pick cultured individuals

943
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,660
who can draw and write poems.

944
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,444
"To One's Kindred Spirit."

945
00:36:42,103 --> 00:36:43,500
(Song of No Anger)

946
00:36:45,444 --> 00:36:46,822
"To One's Kindred Spirit."

947
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:50,870
Kindred spirits are like our limbs.

948
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,180
The road of life is long and vast.

949
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,700
Anyway, you can read the poems later.

950
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,700
Look. She even drew paintings.

951
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,310
Look at her paintings.

952
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,220
It's so vivid. It's great.

953
00:37:03,733 --> 00:37:05,866
- She's a famous painter.
- What are you talking about?

954
00:37:05,866 --> 00:37:07,422
You know? She's famous for her painting.

955
00:37:08,777 --> 00:37:09,470
Enough already.

956
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:11,060
I didn't tell you guys

957
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,430
to be my matchmaker.

958
00:37:13,555 --> 00:37:14,977
You didn't tell me to deliver soup

959
00:37:15,022 --> 00:37:15,700
to you either.

960
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,540
Even so, you still drank it.

961
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,430
Am I right?

962
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,180
But listen.

963
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,580
Once the deed is done,

964
00:37:22,666 --> 00:37:24,777
you have to buy me
a pair of shoes as compensation.

965
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,060
Enough.

966
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,310
Don't worry about me again.

967
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,870
I'll tell Shen Qing
to buy you a pair of shoes.

968
00:37:31,933 --> 00:37:33,190
How could I not worry about you?

969
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,910
The entire family is supporting you.

970
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,310
The key is, even your grandson

971
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,510
took a video of it.

972
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,470
That's right, Dad.

973
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,510
Can you guys stop messing around?

974
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,620
Listen to me.

975
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:46,333
To search or
not to search for a partner,

976
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:47,990
that's my personal affair.

977
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,244
I've already made up my mind.

978
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:50,390
I have my own arrangements.

979
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:55,990
Professor Shen,

980
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,100
you should rest well.

981
00:37:59,422 --> 00:38:00,470
You may press the bell

982
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,350
if you need anything.

983
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,180
Mom.

984
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,060
Mom, where are you going?

985
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,180
Mom!

986
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:18,870
Where are you going?

987
00:38:18,955 --> 00:38:20,733
Stop interfering.
I have something to do.

988
00:38:20,977 --> 00:38:22,777
Don't just come here and cause trouble.

989
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,660
What do you mean by that?

990
00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:26,830
You see, Ms. Lian's stethoscope

991
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:29,060
fell to the ground
upon hearing what I said.

992
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,100
What does that mean?

993
00:38:30,222 --> 00:38:31,790
That means she has a guilty conscience.

994
00:38:31,844 --> 00:38:33,620
There's nothing for her
to be guilty about.

995
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,030
She's that young,

996
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,410
yet she's after your father-in-law.

997
00:38:37,533 --> 00:38:38,888
What do you think she's after?

998
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,060
How would I know?

999
00:38:41,377 --> 00:38:43,977
You're over 40, yet you have no idea
how society works, huh?

1000
00:38:44,111 --> 00:38:45,466
I'll stop wasting my time on you.

1001
00:38:46,644 --> 00:38:47,844
I'll investigate the case.

1002
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,060
Mom!

1003
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,030
(Our in-law is a professor.)

1004
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:12,390
(If we have to pick someone,)

1005
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,000
(we have to pick cultured individuals)

1006
00:39:31,955 --> 00:39:33,133
(Inpatient)
Dad.

1007
00:39:33,155 --> 00:39:33,600
Dad.

1008
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,870
You can be discharged by next week.

1009
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,510
We can finally head home.

1010
00:39:38,511 --> 00:39:40,790
Yeah. Lina has washed
your bed sheets and blanket cover.

1011
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,310
For some reason,

1012
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:44,740
I don't

1013
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,470
really feel comfortable today.

1014
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,740
Why don't we delay

1015
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,030
my discharge?

1016
00:39:57,022 --> 00:39:59,044
I think your father
doesn't want to be discharged.

1017
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,700
I suppose he has fallen for Ms. Lian.

1018
00:40:03,288 --> 00:40:05,000
Son, are you done with your homework?

1019
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:06,390
I finished it long ago.

1020
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,540
You should do your revisions.

1021
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,700
Stop playing with your tablet.

1022
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,660
Let him relax for a while.

1023
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:11,790
Precisely.

1024
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,260
Your son is always relaxed, you know?

1025
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,620
That's good.
That's how a great person acts.

1026
00:40:17,244 --> 00:40:19,390
Only if he passes
all of his exams with flying colors.

1027
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:22,100
If not, it's the opposite.

1028
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:23,870
Mom, look.

1029
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,266
I found a photo of Ms. Lian
on the hospital's official website.

1030
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:28,660
She's quite pretty.

1031
00:40:29,266 --> 00:40:30,940
She has received
plenty of awards as well.

1032
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,660
She does look pretty.

1033
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:35,470
It's just

1034
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,511
that she has a sorrowful face.

1035
00:40:38,088 --> 00:40:39,950
Is there nothing else
you can talk about?

1036
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,470
Duole, don't join your mother
and her nonsense.

1037
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,740
What do you mean by that?

1038
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,430
Grandpa, Ms. Lian is amazing.

1039
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,790
I support you. You can do it.

1040
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,850
Don't send a message like that.
Hurry and recall it.

1041
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:51,830
I've already sent it.

1042
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,910
Recall it.

1043
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,180
Duole!

1044
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:02,510
Lian.

1045
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,660
The hospital said
that I could be discharged soon.

1046
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,555
You know that, right?

1047
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,260
I know.

1048
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:11,870
But sometimes,

1049
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,510
I feel like my wound still hurts.

1050
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:18,060
And, my blood pressure is unstable.

1051
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,790
Isn't it troublesome if I have
to travel back and forth

1052
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,955
after heading home?

1053
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,260
It's common for a patient's
blood pressure to be unstable.

1054
00:41:27,266 --> 00:41:29,219
It mainly depends on
the amount of rest you get.

1055
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,100
Your son and daughter-in-law
are very filial.

1056
00:41:32,244 --> 00:41:34,266
I'm sure they can
take care of you at home.

1057
00:41:34,288 --> 00:41:36,822
But I think it's more convenient
if I remain at the hospital.

1058
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:39,180
I can call you immediately
if I need anything.

1059
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:40,620
Can I

1060
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:41,910
stay here

1061
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,390
for a few more days?

1062
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,870
But we're running out of wards.

1063
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,950
It's getting late as well.

1064
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,740
You should head back and rest.

1065
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:19,510
Once

1066
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:21,260
you've recovered,

1067
00:42:25,755 --> 00:42:28,111
you should find someone
who knows how to care for you

1068
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:31,260
to accompany you in place of your wife.
