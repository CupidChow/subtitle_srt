00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,044
This is a gift from Joy Academy
for our investors.

20
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,170
Whole grains? So practical.

21
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:33,800
It's good.

22
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,290
Bai, that training program
you recommended...

23
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,680
I actually liked it.

24
00:02:38,066 --> 00:02:39,520
I'll transfer the course fee to you.

25
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,760
What?

26
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,920
No need. It's on me.

27
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,480
Oh, you're so generous.

28
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,080
People usually treat
each other to meals,

29
00:02:51,111 --> 00:02:53,888
but I've never heard of treating
someone to a training course.

30
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,050
Tell you what,

31
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:56,170
once I start making money,

32
00:02:56,222 --> 00:02:57,010
I'll give you a cut.

33
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,400
And if you ever have
a money-making opportunity,

34
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,666
don't forget to loop me in too.

35
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,410
Of course I will.

36
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:03,170
Lina,

37
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,890
this project actually has great returns.

38
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,410
Last quarter it shot up over 20%.

39
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,644
You should really think
about investing a little.

40
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:16,088
I'm broke, so I'll just
watch from the sidelines.

41
00:03:16,444 --> 00:03:17,050
That's okay.

42
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,450
Alright then. Thanks!

43
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:20,850
Bye.

44
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,570
Bye.

45
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:44,640
What are you looking for?

46
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,640
A red folder.

47
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,080
It...

48
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,977
It was just here.

49
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,850
I remember leaving it here,
so where did it go?

50
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,570
You mean that one?

51
00:03:54,933 --> 00:03:56,239
How did it end up over there?

52
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,330
I looked there earlier.

53
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,400
I didn't see it at all.

54
00:03:58,644 --> 00:04:01,240
You men always dreaming big,
chasing poetry and faraway places,

55
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,890
and ignoring what's right
in front of you.

56
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,010
That Joy Academy project

57
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,480
is an R5-level financial product.

58
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:07,850
High risk to your principal.

59
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:08,570
Stay out of it.

60
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,200
You're only looking at the risks.

61
00:04:10,222 --> 00:04:11,955
Why don't you take a look
at the returns too?

62
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,240
You should stay away from Bai.

63
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,120
Why are you talking about him like that?

64
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,970
He's a legit graduate
from a top-tier university.

65
00:04:18,977 --> 00:04:19,777
He knows his stuff.

66
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,800
No legit financial adviser

67
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,990
goes around handing out gifts
to clients for no reason.

68
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,290
So you did see me earlier.

69
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,120
You didn't even say hi.

70
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,000
How polite of you.

71
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,320
I was in a rush to grab the folder.

72
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,290
So, you just pretended I was invisible?

73
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,090
You may not think much of me,

74
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,050
but plenty of other people do.

75
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,680
Don't assume your standards

76
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,240
are like official certifications,

77
00:04:39,266 --> 00:04:41,340
that without your stamp of approval,
I don't count.

78
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,770
I'm not saying you're wrong.

79
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,120
I'm just saying,
be careful with your investments.

80
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,210
I majored in accounting too, okay?

81
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:47,800
Besides,

82
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,480
you've lost all our money.

83
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:51,210
What can I even invest with?

84
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:52,650
Right.

85
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,120
I lost our money.

86
00:04:54,155 --> 00:04:55,822
And I'm doing my best to earn it back.

87
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,610
Shen Qing, over here.

88
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,050
Sorry.

89
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:08,780
I set the meeting, yet I showed up late.

90
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:09,530
It's fine.

91
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:11,000
Gave me a chance to take a break.

92
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,360
What are you reading?

93
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,530
Just brushing up on the past
to learn something new.

94
00:05:14,955 --> 00:05:15,880
It's from the café.

95
00:05:15,888 --> 00:05:17,088
Figured I'd flip through it.

96
00:05:17,688 --> 00:05:19,290
I feel like a chameleon these days.

97
00:05:20,177 --> 00:05:22,844
Constantly reading people's expressions,
and adjusting my words.

98
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,244
Always bending with the wind.

99
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,880
So what color are you today?

100
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,244
My true colors.

101
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,440
Actually,

102
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,155
I came here today
to lay everything on the table.

103
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,680
This is last month's financial report.

104
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,240
Admin salaries have been cut.

105
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,360
R&D salaries were delayed.

106
00:06:01,822 --> 00:06:03,680
Here's the Phase 3
clinical trial report.

107
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,210
This is the company's loan agreement.

108
00:06:14,466 --> 00:06:17,488
And this is a record of every
executive's personal contributions.

109
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,780
(RF Pharmaceuticals -
Internal Fundraising Record)

110
00:06:23,644 --> 00:06:25,600
RF Pharmaceuticals
is in serious trouble.

111
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,480
We've got a loan due tomorrow,

112
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,410
and we're out of cash.

113
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,666
If the next round of funding
doesn't come through,

114
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,120
we're done for.

115
00:06:38,577 --> 00:06:40,170
Showing these confidential documents

116
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,320
to investors

117
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,290
is humiliating.

118
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,170
But in times like this,

119
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:49,977
we don't have the luxury of saving face.

120
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:53,530
Ice, I know you've done a lot to help.

121
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:56,500
And it's perfectly reasonable for a fund

122
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,210
to be cautious about risk.

123
00:06:59,290 --> 00:06:59,680
But...

124
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,610
As an investor,

125
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:04,333
we should have the guts
to take risks with the project.

126
00:07:05,888 --> 00:07:08,222
I'll go back and renegotiate
with the company.

127
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,000
Shen Qing,

128
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,000
please give me

00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,800

136

stall him, and keep him busy.

Mr. Shen.

143
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:05,850
Yes?

144
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:07,290
Can you help us take some pictures?

145
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,050
Sure.

146
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:08,680
Come again!

147
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,120
Let's go!

148
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,680
Let's go.

149
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,610
Hello there.

150
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,170
Bye.

151
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,480
Do you like singing too?

152
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,050
No,

153
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,440
I don't.

154
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,360
I'm tone-deaf.

155
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,050
Look,

156
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,050
don't be shy now.

157
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,770
Tone-deaf is not a problem.

158
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,240
Let's go then.

159
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,240
I bet

160
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,680
when you were younger,

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,610
you probably didn't dare

162
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,600
to sing out loud.

163
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,370
And now you just assume
you're tone-deaf.

164
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,600
You know what,

165
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,960
we've got a piano here.

166
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:40,333
You could try some sight-singing
and ear training.

167
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:40,840
I think

168
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,680
- you'd do just fine.
- I've tried it.

169
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,770
I've tried. Doesn't work.

170
00:08:44,177 --> 00:08:44,560
What...

171
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,440
Really?

172
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,840
Don't go!

173
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:50,920
Li Heibao is here.

174
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:54,444
Does that make you feel confused?

175
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,010
A little.

176
00:08:56,644 --> 00:08:58,010
Actually, not confused,

177
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,370
just kind of unsettled.

178
00:08:59,955 --> 00:09:02,050
I mean, we were together
for almost three years.

179
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,320
If it hadn't been for his daughter...

180
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,050
Back then,

181
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,200
he promised he'd win me a gold medal.

182
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:11,080
And look, he got it.

183
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,410
But now we're not together anymore.

184
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,600
Don't worry.
I'll appreciate the present.

185
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,010
Mr. Shen!

186
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,840
Finally caught up with you two.

187
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,200
Let's take this path.

188
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,080
The other one is a bit tricky to walk.

189
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,200
Yes, too many steps over there.

190
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,770
Let's stick to the flat road.

191
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,560
Hello, Mr. Shen!

192
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,050
Don't fall behind. Keep up!

193
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:35,840
Come on.

194
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,490
Let's go.

195
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:37,080
Let's go.

196
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,130
Keep going.

197
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,720
Shen just sent a message.

198
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,410
They went down that path.

199
00:09:45,444 --> 00:09:47,190
He said we should take
this one to catch up.

200
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:47,680
Excuse me.

201
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,200
Ah, it's you two.

202
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,680
Could you tell me which way

203
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,170
did Le Shuishan go?

204
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:02,960
Thank you.

205
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:09,720
Ding,

206
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,200
look at you.

207
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,800
You're sharper than I thought!

208
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,840
Guai guai long di dong.

209
00:10:16,177 --> 00:10:17,680
Chives stir-fried with green onions.

210
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,320
He's in such great shape.

211
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,600
I'd better call Shen now.

212
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:24,890
Shen,

213
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,650
Li Heibao's catching up.

214
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:27,920
The guy's in great shape.

215
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,650
He runs like the wind.

216
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,170
Ding pointed him down the wrong path.

217
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,720
You'd better be ready.

218
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,770
Knowledge is power,

219
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,530
but physical strength is power too.

220
00:10:37,977 --> 00:10:39,622
This is as much as we can do to help.

221
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,560
Good luck!

222
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,170
Alright.

223
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,490
Alright.

224
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,440
Alright, ladies,

225
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,650
strike those beautiful poses!

226
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,200
Give me a little more energy!

227
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,250
Say one, two, three.

228
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,130
Yes, yes.

229
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,010
One,

230
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:07,650
two,

231
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,720
three.

232
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,650
Perfect, looks great!

233
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:28,909
We need one from higher up too.

234
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:31,400
A top-down shot so we can
get the city in the background, right?

235
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:31,844
Yes.

236
00:11:31,844 --> 00:11:33,840
Okay. You guys get into position.
I'm heading up.

237
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,170
Okay.

238
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,650
Where should I stand?

239
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,250
Stand here.

240
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,050
Here.

241
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Mr. Shen, are you okay?

242
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,890
Are you okay?

243
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,050
What's wrong?

244
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,080
I'm fine.

245
00:11:46,266 --> 00:11:47,790
I'm going to climb up a little higher.

246
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,000
Think about your poses.

247
00:11:49,022 --> 00:11:50,088
I'll take a bunch of shots.

248
00:11:50,088 --> 00:11:51,600
Mr. Shen is so thoughtful.

249
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,560
So?

250
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,130
He's such a sweetheart.

251
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,560
Mr. Shen is just the best.

252
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,490
I think that's high enough!

253
00:11:57,511 --> 00:11:58,490
He can a few extra shots.

254
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,130
Yes.

255
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,200
Got the perfect spot!

256
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:02,290
Here we go.

257
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,650
Okay.

258
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,290
Okay.

259
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:03,720
Ready?

260
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,600
Ladies,

261
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,410
one, two, three.

262
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:07,370
Okay!

263
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,490
Check the photos.

264
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:09,960
Look.

265
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:10,720
Here.

266
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,200
We look so nice.

267
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,050
This turned out great.

268
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,530
Look. You can even see the
whole background from here.

269
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,170
Yes.

270
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,770
It's all thanks

271
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,720
to my keen eye for details.

272
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,010
Look,

273
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,840
I captured your best smile

274
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:26,770
in the shot.

275
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,080
Geez,

276
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,050
those ladies aren't cool.

277
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,530
They didn't even wait for us.

278
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,200
Mr. Shen, are you okay?

279
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,130
I'm fine.

280
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,050
Did you hurt your back?

281
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:47,410
No.

282
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,050
Let me carry you.

283
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:49,720
It's fine.

284
00:12:49,777 --> 00:12:50,600
No, I have to try.

285
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,130
Please don't.

286
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,822
- I'm too heavy for you.
- Let me try.

287
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,840
Hold onto my shoulders.

288
00:12:58,933 --> 00:12:59,800
You really are heavy.

289
00:12:59,888 --> 00:13:00,440
Oh, heavens.

290
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,010
Are you hurt?

291
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,050
No.

292
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:03,680
My ankle...

293
00:13:03,688 --> 00:13:04,288
Are you hurt?

294
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:04,733
No.

295
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,080
Are you okay?

296
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,888
Is your foot okay?

297
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,530
Yes.

298
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:08,960
I'm fine.

299
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,850
Don't worry about me.

300
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:10,800
Help me get up.

301
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,840
- I'm sorry.
- Let me help you up first.

302
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:13,920
I'm sorry.

303
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,410
Easy, easy.

304
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,920
I'm sorry for troubling you.

305
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,410
Are you sure this is okay?

306
00:13:20,955 --> 00:13:22,290
Can you still use your strength?

307
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,600
Let's walk slowly.

308
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,050
Oh, my God.

309
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,370
This is...

310
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:30,600
Oh...

311
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,720
Oh, my God.

312
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,720
Mr. Shen,

313
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,410
I think your sprain looks serious.

314
00:13:37,288 --> 00:13:38,688
I don't think this is working.

315
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:40,720
What's that sound?

316
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,920
It's not a wolf, is it?

317
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,770
No.

318
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,770
There won't be any big animals
on this mountain.

319
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:48,490
Shuishan?

320
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,320
Is that you?

321
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,170
Heibao?

322
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:57,440
We need help.

323
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,133
What's wrong?

324
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,680
Bad knee.

325
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:01,410
It's okay.

326
00:14:01,777 --> 00:14:02,688
I'll carry you down.

327
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:08,890
Not me.

328
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,080
It's Mr. Shen.

329
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:10,840
Put me down.

330
00:14:15,466 --> 00:14:16,022
You...

331
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,890
Help him.

332
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,130
You're a man.

333
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,680
Do you really want me
to carry you in my arms?

334
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,290
No.

335
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,720
Stand up then.

336
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,200
Mr. Shen,

337
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,440
easy there.

338
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,920
Easy.

339
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,290
Bend.

340
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:55,720
Stay still.

341
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,490
You're a bit flabby.

342
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,410
Heibao...

343
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,250
You...

344
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,050
Wait for her.

345
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,050
Shut up.

346
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,080
Zhou Jing.

347
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,050
Zhou Jing.

348
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,890
You look stunning.

349
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:18,890
That waistline...

350
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,560
If I were a guy, I'd be totally smitten.

351
00:15:21,622 --> 00:15:23,170
It's not every day I go to a concert.

352
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,290
Of course I had to dress up.

353
00:15:25,355 --> 00:15:25,800
Very nice.

354
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,920
Let's take a picture together.

355
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,410
Yes.

356
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,250
Let me get a solo shot of you.

357
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:36,960
Your goal tonight

358
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,600
is to make Shen Qing jealous, right?

359
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,050
Let him see

360
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,170
this gorgeous woman

361
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,720
and wonder,
"Who's she out with tonight?"

362
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,680
No matter who I'm out with,

363
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,050
he wouldn't care.

364
00:15:49,355 --> 00:15:50,920
How do you know if you don't even try?

365
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:51,955
Okay, look this way.

366
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,200
Yes, perfect!

367
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,320
So elegant.

368
00:15:58,933 --> 00:16:00,010
We're posting this one.

369
00:16:00,022 --> 00:16:01,088
Get it up on your Moments.

370
00:16:01,177 --> 00:16:02,400
Let's drive Shen Qing crazy.

371
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,530
He won't react.

372
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,960
Men are indifferent to their own wives.

373
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,200
That's only when the wife's at home.

374
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,770
Men's eyes are like this,

375
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:13,170
straight ahead.

376
00:16:13,355 --> 00:16:14,822
But when the wife's not around?

377
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:15,490
They start

378
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,720
looking all over for her. You'll see.

379
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:18,440
Lina!

380
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,080
Hi, Bai.

381
00:16:20,822 --> 00:16:21,666
Have some water.

382
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:22,800
Thank you.

383
00:16:22,888 --> 00:16:23,370
Thank you.

384
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:23,680
Lina,

385
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,960
you look gorgeous today.

386
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:27,650
Really?

387
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,250
I just threw on a little makeup.

388
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:31,490
You look amazing.

389
00:16:32,022 --> 00:16:32,960
Let me introduce you,

390
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,010
this is my startup partner, Bai.

391
00:16:36,355 --> 00:16:38,355
And this is my longtime bestie,
Zhou Jing.

392
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,911
Nice to meet you, Jing.

393
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:41,080
Nice to meet you too, Bai.

394
00:16:42,355 --> 00:16:43,622
I'll head over there first.

395
00:16:43,622 --> 00:16:45,377
- Just call me if you need anything.
- Okay.

396
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:45,866
Okay.

397
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,010
Not bad at all.

398
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,022
Check out that figure.

399
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,840
He used to be a swimmer.

400
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,130
Shen Qing's not just going
to be jealous,

401
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,490
he will be drowning in it!

402
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,440
Oh, stop it.

403
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,960
It's just a purely
professional partnership.

404
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,560
We just get along well, that's all.

405
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,050
Really?

406
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,160
Stop it.

407
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:31,266
Did Shen Qing like your post?

408
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,560
No.

409
00:17:36,066 --> 00:17:37,880
The more they care,
the less they hit "like."

410
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,933
Men are all like that.

411
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,530
Mr. Lu,

412
00:18:08,777 --> 00:18:11,120
RF Pharmaceuticals' payment
process is complete online.

413
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:12,560
Mr. Qiao has signed off too.

414
00:18:12,688 --> 00:18:13,800
Why did you call it off?

415
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,466
Have a seat.

416
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,210
Sit down. We'll talk this through.

417
00:18:29,177 --> 00:18:30,977
I got word from an inside source

418
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,120
that there's an issue with their trial.

419
00:18:33,555 --> 00:18:35,622
I have a responsibility
to protect our company.

420
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,450
The lab under RF Pharmaceuticals

421
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,050
is one our company acquired.

422
00:18:41,222 --> 00:18:42,160
I've looked into it.

423
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,970
Their trial data is extremely rigorous.

424
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:45,640
This project

425
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:47,530
is at a critical tipping
point right now.

426
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:48,600
Ice,

427
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,770
your problem is
that you act too impulsively.

428
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,490
Look, we both want

429
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:56,360
what's best.

430
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,450
We're just coming from different angles,

431
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,160
right?

432
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,400
But...

433
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,360
when it comes to money,

434
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,160
especially at a moment like this,

435
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,800
it never hurts to be cautious.

436
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,250
Timing is everything in investing.

437
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,210
Sometimes,

438
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,733
being "cautious"
is just another word for delay.

439
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,290
Are you questioning me?

440
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:18,930
All I'm saying is

441
00:19:18,955 --> 00:19:21,488
we need to take responsibility
for the project we chose

442
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:22,250
together.

443
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,290
Zhou.

444
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:30,400
Zhou.

445
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:32,840
The payment process for RF is complete.

446
00:19:32,844 --> 00:19:34,133
We're clear to release the funds.

447
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,210
Now?

448
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,010
Yes.

449
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:38,320
Now.

450
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,640
Ruifeng! Ruifeng!

451
00:19:46,177 --> 00:19:48,400
The investment funds from Shide
just came through!

452
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,250
Don't mess with me.

453
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:52,140
They wouldn't send money
this late in the day.

454
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,619
They usually transfer in the morning.

455
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,970
When nothing showed up in the afternoon,
I thought it was over.

456
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:57,850
But guess what?
Just now, they sent it through!

457
00:20:01,644 --> 00:20:03,290
We're back from the dead, aren't we?

458
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,010
We are!

459
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,690
Quick! Call Ice.

460
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,490
I'm calling.

461
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,160
Shen Qing.

462
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,640
Ice, the funds came through!

463
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,010
Thank you!

464
00:20:26,422 --> 00:20:27,311
You're welcome.

465
00:20:27,555 --> 00:20:29,777
I hope it helps get you
through this critical moment,

466
00:20:30,088 --> 00:20:31,555
just in time for tomorrow.

467
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,640
Thank you.

468
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,400
I'm here with Mr. An.

469
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,320
No words can describe our feelings now.

470
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,530
Just thank you! Thank you so much!

471
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,490
You're welcome.

472
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,930
Let's work together

473
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,600
and make M701 a success.

474
00:20:44,222 --> 00:20:45,955
We'll give it everything we've got.

475
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:47,320
Okay.

476
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:48,930
Goodbye.

477
00:20:48,955 --> 00:20:49,955
Thank you for coming.

478
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:50,600
Bye.

479
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:52,250
Bai.

480
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,050
Lina.

481
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,560
Thank you for today.

482
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,690
Don't mention it.

483
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:00,400
This is Lv.

484
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,320
Hi.

485
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,730
Lina, let me give you a ride home.

486
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,320
It's getting late.

487
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,600
I want to go to bed early.

488
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:13,120
It's fine.

489
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,010
Yes.

490
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:14,770
It's fine.

491
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,360
You kids should go home early.

492
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,970
Our husbands are coming to pick us up.

493
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,120
This lady is right.

494
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,080
Bai,

495
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,450
let's go.

496
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,360
I'm leaving then.

497
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,160
Stay safe.

498
00:21:27,422 --> 00:21:28,010
Bye bye.

499
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,450
Bye bye.

500
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:29,640
Bye bye.

501
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:30,880
Let's go.

502
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:34,450
Let's go.

503
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,010
Bai might be handsome,

504
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,222
but you've got many love rivals.

505
00:21:43,244 --> 00:21:43,955
He's not for you.

506
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,080
Who's for me then?

507
00:21:45,244 --> 00:21:47,222
Your Shen Qing, of course.
He's perfect for you.

508
00:21:47,422 --> 00:21:49,320
And next time, wear something
with sleeves.

509
00:21:49,355 --> 00:21:50,930
Frozen shoulder isn't easy
to deal with.

510
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,511
- Can't you wish me well...
- Jing.

511
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,850
Honey! Didn't I tell you to wait for me
in the parking lot?

512
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:55,770
Why'd you come over?

513
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:57,511
I was worried about you.
It's getting late.

514
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,800
Wang can give you a ride home.

515
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,450
It's fine. I've asked Shen Qing
to come pick me up.

516
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,930
You got in touch with him?

517
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:05,560
Alright then.

518
00:22:05,777 --> 00:22:07,022
We're leaving first then.

519
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:07,770
Take care.

520
00:22:08,222 --> 00:22:08,777
Bye bye.

521
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,160
- Call when you get home.
- Bye.

522
00:22:11,555 --> 00:22:12,355
Did you enjoy it?

523
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:12,911
It was okay.

524
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:15,133
- Where is the car?
- Over there. They wouldn't let me in.

525
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,600
Ninghai Road, please.

526
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:41,320
Okay.

527
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:53,380
(Zhou Jing)

528
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:00,600
Hello.

529
00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:02,311
Has Shen Qing come to pick you up?

530
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,080
Yes.

531
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:05,400
He's next to me.

532
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,600
Husbands have to be useful, right?

533
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:44,400
Don't stop here.

534
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,880
Move forward. Forward.

535
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:46,400
Really?

536
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:53,490
Stop here.

537
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,320
I just got home.

538
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,730
He took me home.

539
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,490
We had a great time.

540
00:25:59,050 --> 00:25:59,930
I'm telling you.

541
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,010
We've even scheduled

542
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,290
our next date.

543
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,360
This time,

544
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,560
I'm ready for a good relationship.

545
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,450
Dad!

546
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,010
Dad, you're home!

547
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:16,490
Dad...

548
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,080
What happened?

549
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,010
Dad?

550
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:20,800
He hurt himself...

551
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,560
Dad, what happened?

552
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,210
He injured his knee on the trail.

553
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,120
Can't walk anymore.

554
00:26:24,911 --> 00:26:25,822
Where should I put you?

555
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,250
The couch.

556
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:27,560
I...

557
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:28,600
The couch.

558
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:29,640
Qing!

559
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,640
What's wrong?

560
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:43,050
My stomach...

561
00:26:47,533 --> 00:26:48,770
How can I help you, Mr. Shen?

562
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:49,690
Can you...

563
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,120
Here.

564
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,320
Lean back.

565
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,450
Can you lean back?

566
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,080
I finally get it now.

567
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,880
The reason why

568
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,930
everyone in his family loves you.

569
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,450
Why?

570
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,640
What does that mean?

571
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:53,290
Shuishan,

572
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:56,770
to me, you're a princess.

573
00:27:58,730 --> 00:27:59,600
But to them,

574
00:28:00,444 --> 00:28:01,755
you're just a replacement.

575
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,080
Stop the car.

576
00:28:07,377 --> 00:28:08,488
We're not there yet.

577
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,800
Pull over. I want you to stop the car.

578
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:22,088
Unlock the door.

579
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,400
Unlock it!

580
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:34,080
Shuishan,

581
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,290
wait!

582
00:28:35,866 --> 00:28:37,244
I shouldn't have said that!

583
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:43,690
Dad,

584
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,490
who was that scruffy-looking guy
just now?

585
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,490
He looked like someone
with serious training.

586
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,090
That was Le Shuishan's ex-boyfriend.

587
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,320
Come on, don't overdo it just for love.

588
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,690
Even if I tried, I couldn't beat him.

589
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,450
The guy used to do kayaking.

590
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,160
So what if he's tough?

591
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,490
He's retired now.

592
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,210
Besides, Dad,

593
00:29:07,644 --> 00:29:08,600
relationships aren't

594
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,250
about physical strength, right?

595
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,210
It's about being in sync, soul to soul.

596
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,730
Having the same wavelength.

597
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,160
Yes.

598
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,250
He's an ex for a reason.

599
00:29:19,777 --> 00:29:21,320
Clearly, they drifted apart over time,

600
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,080
because they were no longer aligned.

601
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,210
Done.

602
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:28,560
Okay.

603
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,120
Hi, Shuishan!

604
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,400
Do you like it?

605
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,290
I love it!

606
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:43,880
It's beautiful!

607
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,730
The ladies in the choir said

608
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:48,360
you got hurt because you
were taking pictures for us,

609
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,866
so we should take responsibility.

610
00:29:49,933 --> 00:29:53,490
So, they sent me to look after you.

611
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,080
Oh, so you're here
on behalf of everyone?

612
00:29:56,577 --> 00:29:58,844
And here I thought you came
because you wanted to.

613
00:29:58,866 --> 00:30:00,600
I came because I wanted to, of course.

614
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,880
Now that makes me happy!

615
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:03,400
Come on.

616
00:30:03,577 --> 00:30:04,210
Have a seat.

617
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,533
Is your leg feeling any better?

618
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,530
Much better than yesterday.

619
00:30:08,244 --> 00:30:09,560
Still, don't push it too fast.

620
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:11,010
Got it. Come on, sit here.

621
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,400
Yesterday,

622
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,120
when Heibao left, I forgot to thank him.

623
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,450
Li Heibao

624
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:31,250
is really built,

625
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,120
and super helpful,

626
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,730
just not much of a talker.

627
00:30:36,022 --> 00:30:38,644
I tried making conversation on the way,
but he didn't say a word.

628
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,250
That's just how he is.

629
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:44,010
Yesterday should've been
something really touching.

630
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,530
I really was grateful to him.

631
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:45,970
But then

632
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,530
he said something that really upset me.

633
00:30:49,711 --> 00:30:50,490
What did he say?

634
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,640
He said that I'm just a replacement

635
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,250
to your family.

636
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:02,880
Oh, Heibao...

637
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,530
Am I?

638
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,080
Shuishan,

639
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,530
you do look a lot like Jingmin.

640
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,120
So at first,

641
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,600
the kids and I

642
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,120
naturally felt a closeness to you.

643
00:31:21,044 --> 00:31:22,066
But over time,

644
00:31:22,066 --> 00:31:23,160
as we got to know you,

645
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,266
we came to understand,

646
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,160
that you're you.

647
00:31:27,044 --> 00:31:27,977
You're not her.

648
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,880
So, I'm not a replacement

649
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,970
to you?

650
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,360
Of course not.

651
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,450
I should pour you a cup of tea.

652
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,640
Don't get up.

653
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,600
Let me make tea for you.

654
00:31:46,533 --> 00:31:48,511
You ended up having to make it yourself.

655
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,360
Take a look.

656
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,160
Is this Smiling Tiger?

657
00:32:02,244 --> 00:32:03,120
I just ran into him.

658
00:32:06,555 --> 00:32:07,360
Everything okay?

659
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,490
I... I have to go.

660
00:32:11,155 --> 00:32:12,244
I'll be right back.

661
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,160
Try to stay calm!

662
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,120
Le Shuishan!

663
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:28,640
What do you want?

664
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:29,530
Smiling Tiger,

665
00:32:29,733 --> 00:32:31,770
my husband beat you up
because you harassed me.

666
00:32:32,044 --> 00:32:34,733
You got back at him by transferring
him to the Gobi Desert.

667
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,880
Now he's dead.

668
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,160
They can't even find his body.

669
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,360
Le Shuishan,

670
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:42,970
Zhang Yali was transferred

671
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,930
because we received a formal complaint.

672
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,880
He was accused of harassing our doctor

673
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,360
when his wife was pregnant.

674
00:32:48,422 --> 00:32:51,000
If we don't transfer him away soon,
there will be serious trouble.

675
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,690
That's a blatant lie!

676
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,160
He's dead,

677
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,690
and you're still slandering him?

678
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,290
Slander?

679
00:32:58,450 --> 00:32:59,840
Now you know what that word means?

680
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,640
When you accused me of harassment,

681
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,930
why didn't you call that slander?

682
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:05,050
You're disgusting!

683
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,290
I'm going to kill you!

684
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:07,730
Shuishan!

685
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,600
Get her out of here!

686
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:10,600
I'm getting even for my husband!

687
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:11,970
Stop her!

688
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,120
Shuishan!

689
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:13,970
Calm down!

690
00:33:14,111 --> 00:33:14,640
Calm down!

691
00:33:16,088 --> 00:33:17,000
You're bleeding!

692
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,600
It's blood.

693
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:18,770
Calm down!

694
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,640
I'm sorry, Yali.

695
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:50,840
Our child

696
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,250
is gone.

697
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,400
I'm sorry.

698
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,240
Alright, leaders,

699
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:31,050
today, it's one boat per person,
with one coach each.

700
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:33,760
These are all our leaders.

701
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,760
Please give them the best service, okay?

702
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:37,810
Most importantly, stay safe.

703
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:39,530
Safety comes first.

704
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,244
Nothing is more important than that.

705
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:42,810
Which one is mine?

706
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:43,822
This one.

707
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,370
Please keep it stable for me.

708
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,760
I'm

709
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,530
a little seasick.

710
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:53,370
Oh, my.

711
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,050
Watch your paddle!

712
00:34:59,244 --> 00:35:01,155
Your paddle hit mine.

713
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,240
Stop!

714
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:09,244
What? You can't even
keep your paddles apart.

715
00:35:09,266 --> 00:35:10,680
What kind of coach are you?

716
00:35:11,066 --> 00:35:12,240
I'm filing a complaint.

717
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:13,560
What's your name?

718
00:35:14,555 --> 00:35:15,160
Take a guess.

719
00:35:20,933 --> 00:35:21,810
Don't want to guess?

720
00:35:22,866 --> 00:35:23,810
I'll guess for you.

721
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,640
Your name is Tang Jialin, right?

722
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:30,410
They call you Smiling Tiger.

723
00:35:30,577 --> 00:35:31,450
That's you, isn't it?

724
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:32,760
There was a woman

725
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:34,760
at your company, Le Shuishan.

726
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,690
You know her, don't you?

727
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:37,490
Who are you?

728
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,088
Her husband, Zhang Yali. Remember him?

729
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,930
The Zhang Yali who died
in some godforsaken place?

730
00:35:44,911 --> 00:35:46,311
What do you want?

731
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,890
What do I want?

732
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:56,890
The first hit

733
00:35:58,533 --> 00:35:59,410
is for Zhang Yali.

734
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,450
A kind, decent young man

735
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:05,490
died because of your personal vendetta.

736
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,640
You hit me!

737
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,720
The second hit

738
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,010
is for Le Shuishan.

739
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,890
Widowed so young,

740
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,530
left all alone,

741
00:36:15,911 --> 00:36:17,410
and endured years of hardship.

742
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,640
Sir! Sir!

743
00:36:21,066 --> 00:36:23,080
There's been a misunderstanding!

744
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:24,410
Stop talking nonsense.

745
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,450
I've stared at your face in
photos for three whole years.

746
00:36:28,377 --> 00:36:30,280
I could recognize you
from a pile of dust.

747
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:31,850
And the third hit

748
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,160
is for their child

749
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:34,890
who died

750
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,720
before even getting to see this world.

751
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,410
I can't swim!

752
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,080
Heibao!

753
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:53,810
Heibao!

754
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,200
Help me, sir!

755
00:36:59,370 --> 00:36:59,850
Sir,

756
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:01,850
I can't...

757
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:03,720
I can't swim!

758
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:10,760
Sir!

759
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,200
I can't swim, sir!

760
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,490
Heibao!

761
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:54,930
Coming.

762
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:05,760
Shuishan.

763
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:06,760
Mr. Shen?

764
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,720
You left in such a hurry today.

765
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,120
I was worried.

766
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,244
So I came to check on you.

767
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:12,970
I'm sorry.

768
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,050
I left without saying goodbye.

769
00:38:17,155 --> 00:38:17,930
Have a seat.

770
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:18,600
Okay.

771
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,530
Oppo!

772
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:24,410
It's been a while.

773
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,680
Do you remember what I told you before?

774
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,410
About the man who got my husband killed?

775
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,044
The one they call Smiling Tiger?

776
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:37,010
I remember. What about him?

777
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,850
Would you believe it,

778
00:38:39,488 --> 00:38:40,930
turns out he was leading a team

779
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,810
to Xuanwu Lake for a kayaking session.

780
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,970
And wouldn't you know it,
he ran into Heibao.

781
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,370
Talk about walking right into it.

782
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,200
Yes.

783
00:38:52,488 --> 00:38:53,666
Heibao taught him a lesson.

784
00:38:53,733 --> 00:38:54,330
That's great!

785
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,680
That must've felt good, huh?

786
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,010
You've got guests?

787
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:02,890
No.

788
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,560
Excuse me.

789
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,280
Coming!

790
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,120
I found you.

791
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:13,530
You...

792
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:14,640
Le Shuishan...

793
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:15,760
What are you doing here?

794
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:17,970
Le Shuishan,

795
00:39:20,311 --> 00:39:22,760
you made false accusations
against me over 30 years ago.

796
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,530
And now you're still slandering me.

797
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,490
You've really outdone
yourself, Le Shuishan.

798
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:35,080
I'm here to give you a warning.

799
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,760
If you dare smear my name again,

800
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,560
I swear I'll make you pay for it.

801
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,280
Get out!

802
00:39:42,311 --> 00:39:44,088
-You're not welcome here!
-Who are you?

803
00:39:44,155 --> 00:39:44,955
I... I'm...

804
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:46,930
He's my boyfriend.

805
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:47,970
My boyfriend!

806
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,760
Not that tanned-skin guy?

807
00:39:51,533 --> 00:39:53,133
You've switched to
a fair-skinned one now?

808
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,080
Le Shuishan,

809
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,600
you're something else.

810
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:59,720
Still good at making up stuff,

811
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:03,680
but now you're even better
at switching men, huh?

812
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:04,720
What nonsense is that?

813
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,330
What? Am I wrong?

814
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,120
You should be grateful
Zhang Yali died early!

815
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:10,810
You know...

816
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:11,410
Stop!

817
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:12,050
Shut up!

818
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,120
- Get out!
- Shut up!

819
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:14,720
You old man!

820
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,970
Get out!

821
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,450
What are you doing, old man?

822
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:18,490
Out!

823
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,450
Stop poking me!

824
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,600
- Let it go!
- Go!

825
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,760
Old man, you really want
to pick a fight with me?

826
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,160
You...

827
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:24,560
Out!

828
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,810
Who are you?

829
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:28,330
You're just one of her

830
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:30,370
boyfriends.

831
00:40:31,711 --> 00:40:32,555
Tanned-skin man?

832
00:40:33,955 --> 00:40:34,720
Tanned-skin man...

833
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,240
How dare you kick me!

834
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:42,280
You listen to me,

835
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,410
just you wait!

836
00:40:43,466 --> 00:40:44,490
I won't let this slide!

837
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,370
This isn't over!

838
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,560
Don't touch me! Let go!

839
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,050
This isn't over!

840
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:12,970
How can someone

841
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,410
be this awful?

842
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:17,410
Shuishan,

843
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,080
have some water.

844
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,720
What do we do now?

845
00:41:25,644 --> 00:41:26,850
He's clearly not backing off.

846
00:41:27,422 --> 00:41:28,680
We can't just sit here scared.

847
00:41:28,733 --> 00:41:30,977
It's something from the past
that we have to solve.

848
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,120
But now that he has

849
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:34,850
even found your home.

850
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,600
This is serious.

851
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,370
We're out in the open,

852
00:41:38,511 --> 00:41:39,930
while he's lurking in the shadows.

853
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:41,680
It's not safe.

854
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,155
This is a real problem.

855
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,080
What do I do?

856
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,160
How about

857
00:41:49,511 --> 00:41:51,377
you stay at my place for a while?

858
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,370
I'll check with Xibei first.

859
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,490
I don't need to check with anyone.

860
00:42:00,066 --> 00:42:02,066
My daughter's on
a business trip in Shanghai.

861
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,330
You can stay in her room these days.

862
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:05,622
How does that sound?

863
00:42:06,844 --> 00:42:08,155
Are you sure it's okay?

864
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,280
Of course.

865
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,010
Thank you both

866
00:42:19,711 --> 00:42:21,088
for helping me today.

867
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:22,530
Okay.

868
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:23,560
Alright then,

869
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,120
I'll stay with you for a couple of days.

870
00:42:27,622 --> 00:42:28,822
It's not a bother at all.

871
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,120
So,

872
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:31,200
let's go?

873
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,560
I'll just pack up a few things.

874
00:42:35,022 --> 00:42:35,970
You're really going?

875
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:39,533
No need to pack.
I've got everything you'll need.

876
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:42,240
Oppo,

877
00:42:42,755 --> 00:42:44,111
you're coming with us.

878
00:42:44,111 --> 00:42:45,640
Staying at my place too for a few days.

879
00:42:45,644 --> 00:42:46,177
Nope.

880
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:48,680
