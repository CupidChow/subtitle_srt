3
00:01:39,197 --> 00:01:40,880
(Mr. Shen Zhuoran's 70th Birthday Party)

4
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,810
Come on, Dean Ding.

5
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,200
Give some advice.

6
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,320
The country's landscape

7
00:01:45,377 --> 00:01:46,577
with Chinese style and charm.

8
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,810
Good! Impressive!

9
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:50,760
Gou.

10
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,600
There was a little problem.

11
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,640
Keep your mouth shut today.

12
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,760
Don't talk nonsense.

13
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:57,370
Well.

14
00:01:57,622 --> 00:01:58,822
I won't go into details.

15
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,600
- Hello.
- Baoqin is here.

16
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,130
Hello.

17
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:02,040
You're in good health.

18
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,160
Okay.

19
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,530
What songs have you prepared today?

20
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,160
Tian and I

21
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,200
can sing many famous songs.

22
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,290
Right? Tian.

23
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,130
Don't listen to him.

24
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,200
I'm an amateur.

25
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,177
They're professionals.

26
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,410
We'll just have to bare our teeth
and give it a try.

27
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,690
Dean Ding.

28
00:02:17,755 --> 00:02:19,000
Hurry up and serve the food.

29
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:19,690
Hello.

30
00:02:19,777 --> 00:02:21,290
You're even instructing them yourself?

31
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:22,955
It's what I should do.

32
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,160
Mrs. Ding is still so virtuous.

33
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,133
I think it's better for a couple

34
00:02:27,222 --> 00:02:28,530
to be with their original partner.

35
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,720
The original partner
has their advantages.

36
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,040
The latecomer has their own charm too.

37
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,570
Novelty is always the best.

38
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:38,970
Mom.

39
00:02:39,822 --> 00:02:42,355
A cold dish seems to be missing
from the main table.

40
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,640
Go ask.

41
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,549
I'll go check it out.

42
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,400
I'll pick someone up.

43
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,533
Okay. I'll go check it out.

44
00:02:46,822 --> 00:02:48,933
We're not familiar with each other.
Why talk like that?

45
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,400
Thank you

46
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,930
for taking time out
to attend my birthday party.

47
00:02:54,177 --> 00:02:54,760
Speaking of,

48
00:02:54,777 --> 00:02:55,640
let me introduce you.

49
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,400
This is our university's Dean Xu.

50
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,490
Hello, Dean Xu.

51
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,760
Just call me Xu.

52
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:02,810
Thank you.

53
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,377
Mrs. Shen.

54
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,610
My first batch of students.

55
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:08,700
- Is that so?
- That's why he called you Mrs. Shen.

56
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,311
By the way, you should take a seat.

57
00:03:10,311 --> 00:03:11,511
Dean Ding is also in there.

58
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:12,570
Go say hello.

59
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,520
Alright.

60
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:14,490
I'll go in first.

61
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:14,880
Go.

62
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,080
Please go in.

63
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,080
We should probably go in soon.

64
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:28,755
All the guests have almost arrived.

65
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:34,080
Let's go.

66
00:03:36,822 --> 00:03:38,044
Let me take a breath.

67
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:57,280
Are you tired?

68
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,610
I don't get it.

69
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,810
Why?

70
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,370
Am I narrow-minded in your eyes?

71
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,840
What exchange condition?

72
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:12,690
Yilian.

73
00:04:14,511 --> 00:04:15,866
Let me apologize to you first.

74
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:18,200
Isn't it my birthday party today?

75
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,930
Look. The kids put together

76
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,370
such a big event.

77
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,050
Be happy.

78
00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:25,640
After my birthday party is over today,

79
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,880
we'll talk about it.

80
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:27,760
Okay?

81
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,370
Be happy.

82
00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:36,488
Let's go.

83
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:46,577
Here they come.

84
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,010
Start the music.

85
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:54,880
Thank you.

86
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,400
Thank you.

87
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,010
Ms. Lian, sit here.

88
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:11,933
Ms. Lian, sit.

89
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:15,880
I'm 70.

90
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,640
Very good.

91
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,050
Good.

92
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,050
We are gathered together today

93
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,840
to celebrate Professor Shen's birthday.

94
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:29,760
Good.

95
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,520
As the saying goes,
it's rare for people to live to 70.

96
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,400
But as long as you live healthy,

97
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,730
you're awesome!

98
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,080
Today, we must hype up...

99
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:44,190
This old rascal.

100
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:45,760
Hype the atmosphere up!

101
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,170
Mr. Gou has a way with words.

102
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,440
Let's raise our glass

103
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,440
to wish Professor Shen

104
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,170
a long life!

105
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,640
Happy birthday, Dad. Happy birthday.

106
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,250
Here. Drink a glass.

107
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:10,690
Here.

108
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,730
Zhou, here.

109
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,810
Let me add some wine.

110
00:06:13,022 --> 00:06:13,930
I must drink with you.

111
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,370
You finally stop hiding your lover.

112
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:17,930
Ms. Lian.

113
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:19,610
Ms. Lian...

114
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,690
You're under 50, aren't you?

115
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,010
Well...

116
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,280
She'll be 50 next year.

117
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,640
Amazing.

118
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,080
How did you

119
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,644
manage to trick

120
00:06:31,688 --> 00:06:32,960
the beautiful Lian?

121
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:33,840
I...

122
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,520
I didn't trick her.

123
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,760
It's just fate

124
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,880
that puts us together.

125
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,010
Right?

126
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:42,760
That's why

127
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,810
we get together
and take care of each other.

128
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:47,400
Come on, let's have a drink with him.

129
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,688
Otherwise, I'll tell you,

130
00:06:48,911 --> 00:06:49,960
we can't shut them up.

131
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:50,640
Here.

132
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,570
Tell us

133
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,610
how you got together then.

134
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,010
Who conquered whom?

135
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,400
Who resurrected whom?

136
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,520
Who served whom?

137
00:06:59,133 --> 00:06:59,955
Do the math.

138
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,840
You're awesome.

139
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,610
Tell the truth.

140
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,610
You two.

141
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,800
Let me tell you.

142
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,610
During Shen's hospitalization,

143
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,250
Ms. Lian

144
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,450
stepped forward

145
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,920
and took good care of him.

146
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,730
Shen

147
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,210
recovered quickly.

148
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,160
Then, he sang

149
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,160
"Wildflowers"

150
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,880
and found love.

151
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,680
You can say that.

152
00:07:26,022 --> 00:07:27,210
- It's just...
- Okay, Shen.

153
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,800
Today you must sing

154
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,520
"Wildflowers".

155
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,560
Here.

156
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,210
Gou!

157
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:32,640
No, this...

158
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:33,800
Let's eat.

159
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,520
No.

160
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,640
Bring Lian over!

161
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:38,760
Sing for us!

162
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:39,970
Sing for us!

163
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,850
Sing for us!

164
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:43,680
Lian.

165
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,640
Sing for us!

166
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,444
Lian.

167
00:07:45,444 --> 00:07:47,330
- Yilian, how about we go on stage?
- Sing for us!

168
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,380
I don't know how to sing.
You can sing it yourself.

169
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,250
Yilian, please.

170
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,330
Sing for us.

171
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,880
Come on.

172
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,450
Let's sing together.

173
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,880
♪For whom do wildflowers on the mountain
bloom and fade?♪

174
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,680
Why does Ms. Lian look unhappy?

175
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,040
Did they have an argument?

176
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:24,450
♪Waiting quietly to see
if someone will pick them♪

177
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:31,760
♪Just like that flower,
I wait for his arrival♪

178
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,010
♪Pat me on the shoulder♪

179
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,560
How about you sing yourself?

180
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,090
I'll go off stage.

181
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,370
Sing here yourself.

182
00:08:39,444 --> 00:08:40,422
Let go of my mom!

183
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,288
My mom is unfortunate.

184
00:08:44,355 --> 00:08:45,688
She has to serve you every day.

185
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:47,850
She even prepares the chopsticks for you
when you eat.

186
00:08:47,888 --> 00:08:48,355
Why?

187
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:49,920
You have children and a grandchild.

188
00:08:49,977 --> 00:08:51,520
Why should my mom be your housekeeper?

189
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,130
Why did he say that?

190
00:08:53,444 --> 00:08:54,640
I just want her to be happy.

191
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:55,844
She's only in her 40s.

192
00:08:55,844 --> 00:08:57,800
Why should she be
with a 70-year-old man like you?

193
00:08:57,844 --> 00:08:58,266
Enough!

194
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,349
My mom works during the day

195
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,200
and has to work overtime
at your house at night.

196
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,130
She did so much for you.

197
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:02,420
Enough!

198
00:09:02,422 --> 00:09:04,330
You enjoy her dedication
with peace of mind. Why?

199
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,040
Enough.

200
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:06,580
- Because you're a professor?
- Stop...

201
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,800
Because you have a house?

202
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,355
- Stop talking.
- Because you have money?

203
00:09:09,355 --> 00:09:09,777
Lian Jin.

204
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,160
Lian Jin.

205
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,760
- Enough, Lian Jin.
- Don't go too far.

206
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,130
Is that how you see me?

207
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:13,610
Dad.

208
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:14,850
Don't take

209
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,210
what Lian Jin says to heart.

210
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,640
Yes, Dad. Don't be upset.

211
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,250
- He's sick.
- You're the one who's sick!

212
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:19,977
Alright, Lian Jin.

213
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:20,911
We'll talk at home.

214
00:09:20,955 --> 00:09:22,920
Let's go. We'll talk at home.

215
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:23,800
What home?

216
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,010
Which home?

217
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,970
That house is yours, not ours.

218
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
Don't bind my mom to it.

219
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:31,800
Isn't it just a stupid house?

220
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:33,090
We don't want it!

221
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:33,610
Enough.

222
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,280
Dad. Hurry!

223
00:09:55,866 --> 00:09:58,022
Medicine! Feed him
Quick-Acting Heart-Saving Pill!

224
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:58,920
Hurry.

225
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,610
I have it here.

226
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:01,450
I have it here.

227
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:01,970
Be careful.

228
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,520
Here, Zhuoran. Sit down. Hurry.

229
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:04,844
Let Zhuoran sit down.

230
00:10:05,288 --> 00:10:06,250
Let me loosen your tie.

231
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:06,760
Let me.

232
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,130
Here.

233
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:08,520
Unbutton.

234
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,490
Zhuoran, open your mouth.

235
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,280
Suck on it.

236
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,090
Hold it under your tongue.

237
00:10:12,266 --> 00:10:13,040
Under your tongue.

238
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,210
Stop fighting.

239
00:10:15,555 --> 00:10:17,130
- Stop fighting.
- What do you mean?

240
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,280
Let go!

241
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:20,970
He bit me.

242
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,490
Are you okay?

243
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,010
Lian Jin, you've gone too far.

244
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,040
How could you bite him?

245
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:25,920
Sorry.

246
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,280
He didn't mean it. Sorry.

247
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,560
No, Mom. I did it on purpose.

248
00:10:28,688 --> 00:10:29,560
I did it on purpose!

249
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,040
Enough!

250
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:53,970
Sorry.

251
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:55,800
Sorry.

252
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,450
Are you okay?

253
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,250
Thank you.

254
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,330
I'm sorry.

255
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:14,730
Mom.

256
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,370
I'm fine.

257
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,450
I don't want

258
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:23,850
any house.

259
00:11:25,288 --> 00:11:26,711
I just want you to be okay.

260
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:33,970
Mom.

261
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,370
Please don't think
that my illness troubles you.

262
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,280
No.

263
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:42,330
There will be

264
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,880
many people who get sick in this world.

265
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,130
I'm the unlucky one.

266
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:55,730
Mom.

267
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,711
You gave me

268
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:01,330
all the joy and happiness in my life.

269
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,880
You have to be nicer to yourself.

270
00:12:06,755 --> 00:12:08,010
Don't keep thinking about me.

271
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,490
You're my mom.

272
00:12:12,977 --> 00:12:14,400
I'm fine only when you're fine.

273
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,010
Right?

274
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,800
Mom, don't cry. Mom.

275
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:25,880
I know.

276
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,400
I know.

277
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,210
I will be fine from now on.

278
00:12:36,777 --> 00:12:37,880
Look at this commotion.

279
00:12:39,111 --> 00:12:39,777
Let's go.

280
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:40,880
Let's go.

281
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:41,370
Okay.

282
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:46,730
Are you okay?

283
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,560
I'm fine.

284
00:13:01,288 --> 00:13:03,777
My mother didn't take care of you
for your house.

285
00:13:04,444 --> 00:13:06,355
She has lived a tiring life for years.

286
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,970
She just wants someone to rely on.

287
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:17,680
Mom.

288
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,450
I will exercise.

289
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:21,088
You can rely on me from now on.

290
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:24,730
Mom.

291
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,610
Mom, you...

292
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,250
Professor Shen.

293
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,250
Looks like

294
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,730
we're not meant to be.

295
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:49,844
I won't cause you any more trouble then.

296
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,330
Goodbye.

297
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:02,760
Let's go.

298
00:14:04,888 --> 00:14:05,555
Let's go.

299
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:41,900
(Mr. Shen Zhuoran's 70th Birthday Party)

300
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,970
Young couples grow old together.

301
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,930
When one dies,

302
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,490
the other one has to suffer
in the world.

303
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,320
I don't know how long it will take

304
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:04,970
for Dad to get over this.

305
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,250
After this busy period,

306
00:16:08,444 --> 00:16:09,755
let's take Dad to a resort

307
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,170
for a little getaway.

308
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,711
It's indeed time to go out and relax.

309
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:17,866
Might as well not even bother looking.

310
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,360
It's more painful this time.

311
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:23,650
Find one.

312
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,280
You need to find one.

313
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,250
Find a good one to show them.

314
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,266
Let me tell you.
In most second marriages,

315
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,040
adding a name to the property deed...

316
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,080
Just adding a name

317
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,800
is like doing the impossible.

318
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,600
She's good.

319
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,410
She got greedy.

320
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,450
Alright?

321
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,760
She requested for name change to Lian.

322
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,560
The key is that her son
rushed over and said

323
00:16:48,822 --> 00:16:50,155
"I'm not selling my mom."

324
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,840
His mom, who's in her 40s,

325
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,977
found someone in his 70s.

326
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,010
Why is that?

327
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,170
Didn't she want to change her destiny
through marriage?

328
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,280
He doesn't want to sell his mom?

329
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,970
If his mom doesn't suffer,

330
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,410
what can he do with his small frame?

331
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,360
A perfectly good 70th birthday party

332
00:17:09,622 --> 00:17:10,822
got ruined just like that.

333
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,170
It was 1,688 yuan per table.

334
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,760
Look at the mess it has turned into.

335
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,890
This kid is so ignorant.

336
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,040
He's really outrageous.

337
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,010
Mr. Shen should see it clearly
this time.

338
00:17:24,288 --> 00:17:26,422
What's the use
of a young and beautiful woman?

339
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,010
It's useless.

340
00:17:28,466 --> 00:17:29,711
If he wants to find a partner,

341
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,970
he should find women

342
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,650
who live a steady and practical life
like us.

343
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,800
It's true.

344
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:39,866
Peng Yulan.

345
00:17:41,422 --> 00:17:42,730
Give me a straightforward answer.

346
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,360
If you're not after his house,

347
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,600
will you be willing?

348
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:48,730
I...

349
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,120
If you're willing,

350
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,520
leave this matter to me.

351
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,760
How could I possibly
be after Professor Shen's house?

352
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:00,930
Baoqin.

353
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,930
We've been friends for years.

354
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,250
Don't you know me?

355
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,120
I just want a companion.

356
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,250
Every day

357
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,560
after I send my grandson to school,

358
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,970
I have nothing to do.

359
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,490
I don't even have someone to talk to
when I get home.

360
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,170
Yes.

361
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,080
Actually,

362
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:23,210
I really envy you and Liu's life.

363
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:23,600
Look.

364
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,280
You live a lively life.

365
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,490
How wonderful.

366
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,210
Liu?

367
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,970
He's poor and incompetent,

368
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,490
but I feel at ease

369
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:35,890
when he just squats there.

370
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,840
Besides,
when you're sick or feeling unwell,

371
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,330
you have someone to pour you
a glass of water and take care of you.

372
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:42,040
Yes.

373
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:42,890
- Right?
- Yes.

374
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:43,890
Really.

375
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,520
Your 70th birthday

376
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,622
turned out like this.

377
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,410
You were in public.

378
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,170
This is too disrespectful.

379
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,970
At the end of the day,
our bond isn't strong enough.

380
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,560
Ms. Lian Yilian's thinking

381
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,010
is still a little bit behind.

382
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,377
She can't educate her child like this.

383
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,410
He didn't ask for it,

384
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,280
but she just had to help him
get a house.

385
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,320
It's better to teach a man to fish
than to give him a fish.

386
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,600
Shen, haven't you

387
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,800
started looking for a job for Lian Jin?

388
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,010
Tell me.

389
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,650
If anything happens,

390
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,760
can't we old men

391
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,970
help out?

392
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:35,933
He kept saying a 40-year-old
needed to take care of a 70-year-old.

393
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:38,200
Does a 70-year-old like me
need someone to take care of me?

394
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,080
I'm still young.

395
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:39,970
Yes.

396
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,600
What's wrong with being 70?

397
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,170
Look at Shen.

398
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,490
He's old but strong.

399
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,800
He's still giving lectures.

400
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:47,490
Right?

401
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,266
He's contributing his remaining energy.

402
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,450
In my opinion... Shen.

403
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,970
It's okay not to look for a partner.

404
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,080
No matter who you find,

405
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,288
they won't be as good as your wife.

406
00:19:57,844 --> 00:19:59,377
Are you the only one who has a wife?

407
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,844
Can't someone unmarried find one?

408
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:01,800
Look.

409
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,690
I'm telling you, Shen.

410
00:20:02,822 --> 00:20:03,890
I summarized it for you.

411
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,170
You and Lian

412
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,520
are culturally mismatched.

413
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:09,800
Don't worry.

414
00:20:09,911 --> 00:20:11,400
We'll take our time to find a partner.

415
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,360
No, Shen. Stop the search.

416
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,490
Jeez. We'll accompany you.

417
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,490
Ding, don't leave today.

418
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,600
Stay here tonight.

419
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,800
Spend the night with Shen.

420
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,690
Accompany Shen for life!

421
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,760
What's with that tone?

422
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,730
Ms. Lian is protective of her son.

423
00:20:26,888 --> 00:20:28,133
There's nothing wrong with that.

424
00:20:28,155 --> 00:20:29,250
Right? We're all mothers.

425
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:30,280
We understand.

426
00:20:30,644 --> 00:20:31,690
But there are some things

427
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,520
that she should have made clear
from the very beginning.

428
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,569
- Right?
- Yes.

429
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:35,800
Yes.

430
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:38,040
Look, two people are heartbroken now.

431
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,930
Right?

432
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:41,890
Baoqin.

433
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,970
I'll start.

434
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:47,840
I don't want anything.

435
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,320
Do you think I have hope?

436
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,120
Of course, I hope...

437
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:53,800
Yes.

438
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,800
Hope... Well, here's the thing.

439
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,450
I think Mr. Shen

440
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:58,840
needs a break.

441
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,355
Let him stop looking for now.

442
00:21:01,022 --> 00:21:03,222
He stopped, but you're after him.
This is nonsense.

443
00:21:03,244 --> 00:21:03,933
Stop gossiping!

444
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:04,990
He's not looking anymore?

445
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,600
Let's hurry and practice!

446
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,170
- Practice!
- Let's start practicing.

447
00:21:08,288 --> 00:21:08,888
Let's practice.

448
00:21:08,911 --> 00:21:09,511
Let's practice.

449
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:10,280
Practice.

450
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,133
Let's practice.

451
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,930
Don't worry.

452
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:14,930
I went to the union

453
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:15,690
to inquire.

454
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,690
I guarantee we'll match you
with a cultured,

455
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,690
tasteful, and knowledgeable old lady.

456
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,690
We won't even consider undergraduates.

457
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,800
At least find a graduate student.

458
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,080
Shen.

459
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,840
I've studied life thoroughly.

460
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,120
A graduate student?

461
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,170
My age

462
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,080
is a void.

463
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,333
What happened in the end?

464
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,080
I end up all alone.

465
00:21:46,377 --> 00:21:48,280
This is the gift
you and your wife gave us.

466
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,210
It has never been used.

467
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,890
Take it back

468
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:53,840
and use it.

469
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,520
No, Shen.

470
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,170
Look.

471
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,520
It has your name and Lian's name
embroidered on it.

472
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,840
It's inappropriate for us to use it.

473
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,360
How about you keep it as a souvenir?

474
00:22:04,788 --> 00:22:06,766
(Shen Zhuoran, Lian Yilian)
This embroidery is good.

475
00:22:06,766 --> 00:22:08,560
Why don't you give it to me? We don't care.

476
00:22:09,177 --> 00:22:10,320
Why are you causing trouble?

477
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:11,840
I'm just kidding.

478
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,840
Shen, keep it.

479
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,600
Remember this moment.

480
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:18,120
There's no journey taken in vain

481
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,800
and no medicine taken in vain.

482
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,450
What Gou said does make sense.

483
00:22:26,488 --> 00:22:28,177
This medicine can't be taken in vain.

484
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,600
Let alone taken randomly.

485
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,970
I recently took a type of sleeping pill.

486
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,170
It made me...

487
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,890
It made you talk before thinking?

488
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,930
That's why
I accepted my wife's criticism

489
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,320
and stopped taking the pills now.

490
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,080
Right?

491
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:46,690
Shen.

492
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,010
Women

493
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,120
are like medicine.

494
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,010
You must prescribe the right medicine

495
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,800
to cure the disease.

496
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,600
Otherwise,
the side effects will be serious.

497
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,120
Enough.

498
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,133
Stop talking about this.

499
00:22:59,155 --> 00:22:59,577
Come on.

500
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,490
Sing a song with Shen.

501
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,022
I'll accompany you with some music.

502
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,410
Sing?

503
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,210
We're not in the mood to sing.

504
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,760
You can play it yourself.

505
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:08,650
Come on.

506
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,320
Whatever.

507
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,080
Are you having a funeral?

508
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,360
Dad.

509
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,170
Where's the union?

510
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,600
Zhengde Building.

511
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,760
It's that building. Just turn left.

512
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,760
You can do your thing.

513
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,210
You don't have to follow me.

514
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,360
I'm alright.
I just want to take a walk with you.

515
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:06,800
Dad.

516
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,690
Do you remember the horizontal bar
we passed by just now?

517
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:12,280
I fell from it when I was a kid.

518
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,600
The school sent you home.

519
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,170
You didn't say a word all afternoon.

520
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,560
You worried your mom and me.

521
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,170
I wondered
if you hit your head from the fall.

522
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,730
I think I suddenly figured things out
after that.

523
00:24:25,777 --> 00:24:27,300
I think I got smarter from that fall.

524
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,360
Otherwise, I can't study accounting.

525
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:31,890
Dad.

526
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,560
I discussed with Lina.

527
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:34,930
After I'm done with this period,

528
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,890
we'll find a resort to relax.

529
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,600
You two should indeed go out and relax.

530
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:41,970
I...

531
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:42,866
Don't think about me.

532
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:43,600
I'm not going.

533
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:45,040
No.

534
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,022
What's wrong?

535
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,010
If I appear

536
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,930
in front of my colleagues...

537
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:53,730
Dad.

538
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,600
What will they think of me?

539
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,210
It's all over.

540
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,410
I'm over it,

541
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,890
but others might not.

542
00:25:01,555 --> 00:25:01,970
Well...

543
00:25:02,311 --> 00:25:02,970
How about this?

544
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,970
Help me send this material to the union.

545
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,840
I'll turn this way and go home.

546
00:25:09,711 --> 00:25:10,822
Let's leave it at that.

547
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:11,970
Be careful then.

548
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:13,040
I know.

549
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,360
My father-in-law is heartbroken

550
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,120
that they didn't get married.

551
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,040
He poured all his feelings into it.

552
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,600
It fell through at the last minute.

553
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,360
And everyone knew about it.

554
00:25:28,511 --> 00:25:29,377
It doesn't matter.

555
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,490
Ask him to cheer up.

556
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:32,250
Right?

557
00:25:32,977 --> 00:25:34,170
Look at how well Ms. Lian

558
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,955
has taken care of him
these past few months.

559
00:25:35,955 --> 00:25:37,200
He didn't suffer any loss.

560
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,410
I'll introduce Ms. Peng to him later.

561
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,360
Look,
she doesn't want his house or money.

562
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,400
She's not after anything.

563
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,760
That's true love.

564
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,360
Who is this Ms. Peng to you?

565
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,010
You keep mentioning Ms. Peng.

566
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:52,650
Ms. Peng

567
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,560
is your mom's best friend.

568
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,120
Yes.

569
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,490
She gave this to us.

570
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:58,800
What is this? It's black.

571
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,080
It's black sesame soup.

572
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,490
I'm right then.

573
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,800
What are you saying?

574
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,280
I also gave her eggs, okay?

575
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:08,890
Ms. Peng

576
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,040
and I

577
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:12,170
have known each other
since we were young.

578
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,450
We know each other very well.

579
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,666
Our daughter is here. Behave well, huh?

580
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:21,170
Why would I recommend her to you?

581
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,730
I want to place someone of our own

582
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,410
in the Shen family

583
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:28,840
to help you.

584
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,210
What are you doing?

585
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,080
What happened?

586
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:33,930
You...

587
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,450
Why did you spit it all out?

588
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:37,840
Wipe it.

589
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,760
Where did you spit?

590
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,280
On the table.

591
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,360
Are you a spy?

592
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,560
It's okay.

593
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,490
How am I a spy?

594
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,560
I just

595
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,800
want to help you.

596
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,080
Baoqin.

597
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:48,170
Yulan.

598
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:49,410
You came.

599
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,210
Do you think I look okay?

600
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,120
Beautiful.

601
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,760
But I think
your neck looks a little empty.

602
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:58,690
Empty?

603
00:26:59,422 --> 00:27:00,444
How about this?

604
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,170
I'll lend you my scarf.

605
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,010
No need.

606
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:09,360
Won't I look a bit too flashy
if I wear it?

607
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,600
Flashy?

608
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,080
Isn't there a saying?

609
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,730
Getting more charming with age.

610
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:15,890
What does that mean?

611
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,730
You have to be flashy and good-looking.

612
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:20,450
Okay.

613
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:21,650
Perfect.

614
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:22,930
Beautiful.

615
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:25,730
Let's go.

616
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,120
I'm telling you...

617
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:30,360
Last year,

618
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:34,010
I joined a Western self-driving tour.

619
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,250
There was a bonfire one night.

620
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,650
I was excited that day.

621
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:38,800
I drank a lot

622
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,890
and danced.

623
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,210
Suddenly,

624
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,520
I felt light-headed

625
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:44,210
and fell down.

626
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,040
I was almost dead.

627
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,650
Then,

628
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,170
a man on the tour stood forward

629
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:53,040
and persevered in giving me CPR.

630
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,080
He brought me back
from the brink of death.

631
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,650
You haven't told me before.

632
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,760
I met the king of hell,

633
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,280
not the moon goddess.

634
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,400
It's not something
that brings honor to the family.

635
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,666
How could I tell everyone?

636
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,970
So why did you tell me now?

637
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,730
That man had something to ask of me.

638
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,360
My chance to repay him has come.

639
00:28:23,777 --> 00:28:25,377
How are you going to repay him?

640
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,730
He has a female student,

641
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,955
who has retired for years.

642
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,210
She's

643
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,520
a scientist who enjoys a subsidy
from State Council.

644
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:37,600
She graduated
from higher vocational school

645
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,488
and is 100% a talent.

646
00:28:38,755 --> 00:28:40,080
She's been alone for a long time.

647
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,170
The man has been encouraging her

648
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:43,650
to go out and find a partner.

649
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:47,800
You can't repay him then.

650
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,520
Don't you already have

651
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,010
Tian?

652
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,250
Aren't you still available?

653
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,280
Go meet her.

654
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,930
After beating around the bush,
here's the gist.

655
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:07,930
You...

656
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:09,120
Stop.

657
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,311
Don't even think about it.

658
00:29:10,888 --> 00:29:12,760
I'm not a tool for you
to repay your kindness.

659
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,360
Are you my best friend?

660
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:16,890
No.

661
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,410
You still have to go.

662
00:29:21,555 --> 00:29:23,360
Peach Blossom Pool
is a thousand feet deep

663
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,040
but not as deep
as Zhuoran's love for me.

664
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:26,690
Let's go.

665
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:28,520
You...

666
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,644
- Don't grab me.
- Go.

667
00:29:29,688 --> 00:29:31,730
I won't participate
in your matchmaking schemes.

668
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,360
Love is a ray of light.

669
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,840
It's fleeting.

670
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,730
You won't suffer any loss from trying.

671
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,450
Let's go.

672
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:44,890
If I don't go,

673
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,280
you'll kill me.

674
00:29:46,533 --> 00:29:47,010
Let's go.

675
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:49,280
Let me change my clothes then.

676
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:52,650
Fine.

677
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:53,410
Hurry.

678
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,410
I have really become your tool.

679
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,250
Later, just say

680
00:30:08,644 --> 00:30:10,711
you're passing by
and come upstairs for a visit.

681
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:11,890
Passing by?

682
00:30:13,177 --> 00:30:15,177
Would I bring gifts
when I'm just passing by?

683
00:30:16,577 --> 00:30:17,840
How about this? Give it to me.

684
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,560
I'll take this.

685
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,800
I'll say I came over to see Zhuoran

686
00:30:22,911 --> 00:30:24,688
and happened to run into you.

687
00:30:24,711 --> 00:30:26,444
So I invite you
to come upstairs with me

688
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:27,760
and have some tea.

689
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,690
This is better.

690
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:34,977
I'll press first.

691
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,520
This is Professor Shen's home.

692
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,520
Lina

693
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,010
lives opposite.

694
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,120
Look how convenient it is.

695
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:43,760
Indeed.

696
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,080
Shen.

697
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:46,890
Shen.

698
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,930
Why is it so quiet?

699
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:53,930
Is he not home?

700
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,250
Impossible.

701
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,280
He usually stays at home.

702
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,170
Shen.

703
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,650
Be gentle.

704
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:05,080
No.

705
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,170
Maybe he doesn't hear

706
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,080
or is doing something.

707
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:09,320
Mom?

708
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,250
Ms. Peng?

709
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,040
Yes.

710
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,560
Why are you here?

711
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:15,520
We passed by.

712
00:31:15,733 --> 00:31:17,044
We came over for a visit.

713
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,930
I was passing by.

714
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:21,410
Your mom came here
especially to see Professor Shen.

715
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:22,210
Yes.

716
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,711
Well, wasn't your father-in-law

717
00:31:23,755 --> 00:31:25,010
in a bad mood some time ago?

718
00:31:25,111 --> 00:31:25,930
He was in a bad mood.

719
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:26,890
As his in-law, I think

720
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,120
I should care about him.

721
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:28,970
So look.

722
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,333
She happened to be with me.

723
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:31,490
So we came over for a visit.

724
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,410
That's unfortunate.

725
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,010
My father-in-law went out with Mr. Gou.

726
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:35,280
With whom?

727
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,010
He went out with Gou again?

728
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,360
Why?

729
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,320
How would I know?

730
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,320
I told you not to let them
have any contact.

731
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,755
Don't let them have any contact.

732
00:31:44,755 --> 00:31:46,600
That old man
has corrupted your father-in-law.

733
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,730
Can I stop them?

734
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,760
Why are you indecisive?

735
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,170
You're just having a meal,
not getting married.

736
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,490
What are you nervous about?

737
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,622
Why are you so indecisive?

738
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,250
You kidnapped me.

739
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,690
You kidnapped my will.

740
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,520
Gou.

741
00:32:06,177 --> 00:32:07,010
You guys go in first.

742
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:08,890
We'll go in first.

743
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,490
I'll be over in a minute.

744
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:11,410
Over here.

745
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,520
It's Tian's cousin's birthday.

746
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,210
Everything is on the same day,

747
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,666
so I arranged them together.

748
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,890
You're really busy.

749
00:32:19,644 --> 00:32:20,577
What are you doing?

750
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,560
Is it appropriate

751
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,666
to leave me here alone?

752
00:32:22,688 --> 00:32:23,170
No.

753
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,080
I'll be out after saying hello.

754
00:32:25,888 --> 00:32:26,911
I will leave if you leave.

755
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:28,930
Please.

756
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,320
Sit down.

757
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:31,970
Calm down.

758
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,690
What time is it?

759
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,133
I'm leaving if she's still not here.

760
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,010
Why are you so indecisive?

761
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,160
Gou.

762
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,200
This is Professor Shen.

763
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,040
Hello.

764
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,200
Hello.

765
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,410
Tian's cousin.

766
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,520
The soprano of our opera troupe.

767
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,890
She's a great singer.

768
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:52,290
Hello.

769
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,290
They're in a private room.

770
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:54,810
Go in first.

771
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,040
Okay. See you later.

772
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,930
- Goodbye.
- Okay. Goodbye.

773
00:32:58,890 --> 00:32:59,370
Ms. Nie.

774
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,810
When did you come? Hurry.

775
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,450
Here. Here she is.

776
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,040
Ms. Nie.

777
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:07,560
Astronomer.

778
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:11,120
The scientist
enjoying a subsidy from State Council.

779
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,040
Okay.

780
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,120
Hello, Ms. Nie.

781
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:16,720
Hello.

782
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,080
Please take a seat.

783
00:33:23,444 --> 00:33:24,400
Please take a seat.

784
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,080
Ms. Nie, please have a drink.

785
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:34,490
Thank you.

786
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,560
Gou.

787
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,450
Can the food be served now?

788
00:33:38,866 --> 00:33:40,088
I'll make the arrangements.

789
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,155
Wait for me.

790
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:49,330
Ms. Nie.

791
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:50,680
Dig in.

792
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,040
Shen.

793
00:33:57,890 --> 00:33:58,370
Tian.

794
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,120
Say hello.

795
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,770
Ms. Nie, a scientist.

796
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,450
Hello.

797
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:05,450
It was the first time
I met a living scientist.

798
00:34:08,733 --> 00:34:09,720
When I was a child,

799
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,450
the person I admired most
was Marie Curie.

800
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,240
Is it Marie Curie?

801
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:17,490
Yes.

802
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:18,466
Did I say that correctly?

803
00:34:18,511 --> 00:34:19,010
Yes.

804
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:20,490
Here.

805
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,120
I'll give you a toast.

806
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:22,688
Okay. Here.

807
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:24,560
Thank you.

808
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,120
I don't drink alcohol,

809
00:34:26,288 --> 00:34:27,511
so I'll drink tea instead.

810
00:34:27,577 --> 00:34:28,040
Sure.

811
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,160
You can drink tea.

812
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,080
Gou, here.

813
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:30,810
Together.

814
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,560
To Ms. Nie and Shen.

815
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:35,640
Shen.

816
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,240
Invite Shen.

817
00:34:36,355 --> 00:34:37,222
Let's drink together.

818
00:34:37,244 --> 00:34:38,240
Come on.

819
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:41,040
I can't drink either.

820
00:34:41,222 --> 00:34:42,080
I'll drink tea too.

821
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,040
Tea is okay.

822
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:43,370
Okay.

823
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,422
- Bottoms up.
- Here.

824
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,200
Okay, bottoms up.

825
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:45,890
Bottoms up.

826
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,080
Enjoy the meal and have a good chat.

827
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,177
We'll stop bothering you.

828
00:34:55,222 --> 00:34:56,000
Enjoy the meal.

829
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,160
Have a good chat.

830
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:08,370
Ms. Nie looks so serious.

831
00:35:09,022 --> 00:35:11,200
There's a huge difference
between her and Ms. Lian.

832
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,200
Have a meal, chat, and make friends.

833
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,088
They don't have to start a relationship.

834
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:19,680
Yes.

835
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,600
You men

836
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,010
like good-looking ones

837
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:24,970
no matter how old you are.

838
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,577
I don't know about others,

839
00:35:28,577 --> 00:35:29,770
but you're the only one I like.

840
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,622
Don't give me that.

841
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,680
I'm self-aware.

842
00:35:32,888 --> 00:35:34,288
I'm not considered good-looking,

843
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,240
but I'm unique.

844
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:38,370
Ms. Nie.

845
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,410
This yam is good and refreshing.

846
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,755
Thank you. I'll take it myself.

847
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,640
My friend, Gou,

848
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:48,930
is kind.

849
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,933
When he called me over, he told me

850
00:35:50,977 --> 00:35:52,022
it was just a meal.

851
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:52,890
Make friends.

852
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:55,170
The more friends you have,
the more opportunities you get.

853
00:35:57,177 --> 00:35:58,177
No need to stress it.

854
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,600
I'm not here for a blind date.

855
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,200
My mentor is also very enthusiastic.

856
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:06,600
Okay.

857
00:36:07,755 --> 00:36:09,040
It's good that we talked it out.

858
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,080
This restaurant is quite lively.

859
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:20,177
Business is good.

860
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,450
Too far.

861
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,290
It's alright.

862
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,970
The bus stop is right outside.

863
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,222
It's quite convenient.

864
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,520
Different perceptions

865
00:36:29,644 --> 00:36:31,088
will lead to different conclusions.

866
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,290
In my opinion,

867
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,930
it's very far.

868
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,410
This word is sung wrongly.

869
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,044
It's not authentic.

870
00:36:54,266 --> 00:36:55,930
The colorful clouds
drift off leisurely...

871
00:36:55,977 --> 00:36:58,333
It should be "The colorful clouds
drift off draggingly".

872
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:05,970
No way.

873
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:07,680
Ms. Nie.

874
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,200
I studied classical literature.

875
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:12,930
This word

876
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,240
is absolutely correct.

877
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:18,200
Professor Shen.

878
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,330
I may study astrophysics,

879
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,240
but I love Kun Opera.

880
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,720
This word

881
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,520
was "Draggingly" in the olden days.

882
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,520
It was changed
to "Leisurely" in modern times.

883
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:34,290
When Mr. Mei Lanfang
performed in his early years,

884
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:35,680
he sang it the old way.

885
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:40,370
There is always something
to learn from others.

886
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:41,520
Professor Shen.

887
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,120
You should be humble.

888
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,450
We're the same.

889
00:37:51,733 --> 00:37:53,290
There's someone who isn't very humble.

890
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,890
I said this word is wrong.

891
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,680
You didn't ask why,

892
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,850
check or verify.

893
00:38:02,177 --> 00:38:04,160
Just based
on your own experience and identity,

894
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,622
you concluded that it's not wrong.

895
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:06,410
Is this

896
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,240
the way of humility?

897
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,520
This is a publicly released
audiovisual product.

898
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,970
It's also a famous piece.

899
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:22,560
You're at best a fan of Kun Opera.

900
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,160
You easily concluded
that others are wrong.

901
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,770
Aren't you

902
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:28,410
showing off?

903
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:32,010
There are only you and me here.

904
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,370
It's not really a crowd.

905
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:39,490
How unreasonable.

906
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,080
You can go.

907
00:38:42,888 --> 00:38:43,800
I'll settle the bill.

908
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:47,560
I didn't say I was leaving.

909
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:50,040
Besides,
how can I let you settle the bill?

910
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,822
I'll settle the bill.

911
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,560
Waitress.

912
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,690
We would like to settle the bill.

913
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,680
Hello, the total is 264 yuan.

914
00:38:57,930 --> 00:38:58,770
Let's split the bill.

915
00:38:59,866 --> 00:39:01,155
You're sharing the bill?

916
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,790
Do you have the split bill pay function?

917
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:03,450
No.

918
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,720
Then...

919
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:09,666
Are you paying in cash?

920
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,120
We don't have the change.

921
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:12,240
Give me a moment.

922
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,450
Boss, someone is paying in cash.

923
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,080
What happened?

924
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:17,266
You've finished eating?

925
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,080
So soon?

926
00:39:18,711 --> 00:39:19,490
I've done eating.

927
00:39:19,711 --> 00:39:20,822
I'm done being upset.

928
00:39:23,133 --> 00:39:23,850
What happened?

929
00:39:26,844 --> 00:39:28,266
What are you doing? You want to pay?

930
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,520
No need to pay.

931
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,644
I'll settle it with the party's bill.

932
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,770
You can go since you finish.

933
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,520
Please.

934
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:44,200
Thank you.

935
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:50,080
What happened?

936
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,410
Shen.

937
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,200
Shen.

938
00:40:03,703 --> 00:40:07,940
(History of Chinese Drama, Appreciation
of Chinese and Western Classical Music)

939
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:17,810
Dad.

940
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,160
You're back.

941
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,850
I thought of mopping the floor
before you came back.

942
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:23,640
You can mop. It's fine.

943
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:40,600
Dad.

944
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:41,890
Where did Mr. Gou

945
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:43,890
bring you today?

946
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,330
My mom brought a...

947
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,200
I found it.

948
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:51,640
I found evidence.

949
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:04,600
Dad.

950
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,290
You unplugged the phone line.

951
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:18,890
Hello?

952
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,160
Gou.

953
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,520
Give me the phone number

954
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,040
of the scientist, Ms. Nie,

955
00:41:26,422 --> 00:41:27,622
I had a meal with.

956
00:41:28,044 --> 00:41:30,088
What's the matter?
Are you interested in her?

957
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,240
Get lost.

958
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,490
Academic discussion.

959
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,450
Okay, wait a minute.

960
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,149
Wait a minute.

961
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:36,888
I'll write it down.

962
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,200
Go ahead.

963
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:41,370
Six.

964
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,490
Nine.

965
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:43,490
Five.

966
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:44,240
Eight.

967
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:45,370
Eight.

968
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:46,810
Four.

969
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,410
Three.

970
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:56,330
Hello?

971
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,720
Hello, is this Ms. Nie Juanjuan?

972
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:02,520
I'm Shen Zhuoran.

973
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:03,955
Here's the thing.

974
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,200
I went home

975
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:06,850
and did some research.

976
00:42:06,955 --> 00:42:08,200
I've checked some information

977
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,444
and also done some verification.

978
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:11,810
I'm sure

979
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:15,240
the singing tone I mentioned is correct.

980
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,680
Well, that's why

981
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:18,680
I called you

982
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:19,850
to inform you.

983
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,520
We can discuss this together.

984
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,370
No, we scholars

985
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:29,410
must adhere to standards

986
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,640
and be rational.

987
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:34,330
What?

988
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,520
My information is not authoritative?

989
00:42:37,044 --> 00:42:39,355
I'm telling you,
the information I checked is...

990
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:41,810
No.

991
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,330
Listen to me.

992
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:44,850
Why can't you take

993
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:45,890
other people's opinions?

994
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,680
Only by listening
to all sides brings clarity.

995
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:50,755
Well...

996
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:53,890
I'm stubborn?

997
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,120
Listen to yourself.

998
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:56,890
You're very stubborn.

999
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,160
I really...

1000
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:58,810
I...

1001
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,640
Fine. I'll stop talking.

1002
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:02,120
Calling you was unnecessary.
