1
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,460
What do you mean?

2
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,730
I guess I needed time to accept it, too.

3
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,500
It's okay if you forget me,

4
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,900
but I didn't want you to think that
you meant nothing to me.

5
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,930
I'm just...

6
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,140
I'm just not good enough.

7
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,290
I'm really sorry...

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,120
that I hurt you that day.

9
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,370
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,600
 

11
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,070
I'll get one for Je Yeon, too.

12
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,270
So cute.

13
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,720
- It looks like her, right?
- You have such weird taste.

14
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,480
This one?

15
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,990
Yes.

16
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,600
I'll buy. Get more.

17
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,800
- It's fine. We have enough.
- Just grab one more.

18
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,870
Let me!

19
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,500
- Use this.
- I said I was hungry, so I'll pay.

20
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,690
You paid for all of these, too. Let me get this.

21
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,130
We'll pay with this one.

22
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:54,800
Do you have a habit of not checking
the price before buying things?

23
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,090
I did check the prices.

24
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,070
You bought two things worth 3,200 won.

25
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,770
Three things worth 17,000 won.

26
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,000
And the thing you said was cute.

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,090
Anyway, you were short 4,700 won in change.

28
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,510
How did you calculate that?

29
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,090
Anyone can do that math in their head.

30
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,190
You must've been good at math in school.

31
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,310
Is that why you became an accountant?

32
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,910
Math and accounting aren't that related.

33
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,620
I was good at everything, but excellent at math.

34
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,250
Why are you bragging?

35
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,880
I haven't even started bragging.

36
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,500
So annoying.

37
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,640
Then, why did you become an accountant?
Should've become Pythagoras himself.

38
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,390
I used to want to.

39
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,760
The Kim Seok Joo theorem.

40
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,660
Theorem of what?

41
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,640
It's the...

42
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,200
- Geez.
- How do you even know who Pythagoras is?

43
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,380
Anyway, you lost money.

44
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,700
What's the point of going back
and getting the money back?

45
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,100
I'm a regular there. It's good
if they make more money.

46
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,770
I guess some people are like this.

47
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,740
What do you mean by that?

48
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,650
Kind.

49
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,230
Did you quit your job?

50
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,040
You're coming here at erratic times these days.

51
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,780
Who knows? I might quit.

52
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,050
Director.

53
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,410
Do you remember what you said to me

54
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,310
when I came back after my family
went bankrupt in high school?

55
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,810
I was whining to you about not
knowing which direction to go in.

56
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,520
I remember.

57
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,290
"Master, I want to do kendo again!"

58
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,580
You cried your eyes out.

59
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,890
You've read too many sports comics.

60
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,340
You said, after time passes,

61
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:54,350
I'll see that I was meant to be
on the path I was on.

62
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,280
I used to be so cool.

63
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,050
You said this place felt more like home

64
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,120
because you had moved around so much.

65
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,950
Kendo was the thing I stuck with the longest.

66
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,120
When my family went to ruins,

67
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,640
when I quit school...

68
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:22,110
Every time, I thought they were
the toughest moments of my life.

69
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,560
I wonder what kind of path he had been on.

70
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,630
He looked so gloomy every time I saw him.

71
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,220
Is that how he went home that day?

72
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,890
No matter how much you talk to yourself,

73
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,560
I can't give you any more discounts
on your membership.

74
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,730
Gosh! That didn't work!

75
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:54,110
How lost should I be for people
to say I've come a long way?

76
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,890
Aigoo, go away!

77
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,930
Let me do it!

78
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,410
Aigoo, just warm up!

79
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,720
I'm actually not sorry, but I should say this.

80
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,480
I'm sorry, but...

81
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,820
can I get in first?

82
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,550
I've really wanted to try this.

83
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,360
I paid for lunch, too.

84
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,140
So, this is why you insisted on paying.

85
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,900
Go for it.

86
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,200
- Ready?
- Yes!

87
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,680
- Stay still.
- Okay.

88
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,430
Wow!

89
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:02,320
I started this because of the CEO.

90
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,760
I used to cry a lot on set when I was little.

91
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,600
One day, the CEO bought this for me,
trying to comfort me.

92
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,000
She had brought in leftovers from her son's share.

93
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:25,660
I know I've always been
an afterthought as an actress.

94
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,120
But I was an afterthought after you, too.

95
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,850
I'm sure I was the afterthought, not you.

96
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,840
I cried in secret.

97
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,480
At that hotel? Did you cry your eyes out?

98
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,020
Sobbed.

99
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:50,150
Mo Tae Rin, what did you want to be?

100
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,430
I'm sure you weren't born
wanting to be an actress.

101
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,190
That's a secret.

102
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,870
Your dream was to be a secret?

103
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,000
That doesn't sound too bad.

104
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,390
Is that a yes or no?

105
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,530
I said, it's a secret!

106
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,740
 

107
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,840
Hey, Tae Rin! Want to ride bikes with me?

108
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,540
 You can teach me, too. 

109
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,220
I don't know how.

110
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,230
Let's just go diving together later.

111
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,810
Why bikes all of a sudden?

112
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,530
Just because.

113
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,190
I just want to move my body.

114
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,590
I want to clear my head.

115
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,860
 Tae Rin. 

116
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,910
Try this. I made it.

117
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,060
Thank you.

118
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,470
 Director! 

119
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,550
You know how to ride a bike, right?

120
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,640
Can you teach me?

121
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,390
Don't you know I'm busy launching a company?

122
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,480
I'm good at it. Want me to teach you?

123
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,860
Gi Bbeum, you're just learning the
ropes here. Teach what?

124
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,780
 - This coffee is delicious!
- Right? 

125
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,520
B-Bye.

126
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,800
 

127
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,370
 Looking for someone to teach
me how to ride a bike. 

128
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,460
 I'm a 34-year-old adult, total beginner. 

129
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,800
Total beginner.

130
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,840
 

131
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,060
 I'm nearby. Want me to teach you? 

132
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,230
 No need to pay. 

133
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,190
Are you "supergoodatkendo"?

134
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,580
Are you "bbaendolmom"?

135
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,830
- Yes.
- Wow, you're so good.

136
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,240
I'll teach you until I have taekwondo. One hour.

137
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,470
Thank you so much.

138
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,270
This is my last time before I move.

139
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:12,730
Oh, my, I need to learn this!

140
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:15,150
We're just getting started!

141
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,500
 

142
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,670
"I made such as..."

143
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,270
Teacher!

144
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,900
Puffed rice!

145
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,480
I can't believe you make
your aging student do this.

146
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,600
The puff rice seller is out today,
but I didn't want to move.

147
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,400
Aigoo, sure, sure.

148
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,790
The weather is so good for traveling.

149
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,800
I wish I could go to Jeju.

150
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,250
No, I'm scared of flying.

151
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:52,750
I'm still so scared of how planes fly.

152
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,640
Isn't it so strange? Those big things?

153
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,000
- Teacher.
- Yeah?

154
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,480
Is there anything you want to do before you die?

155
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,670
I want to be in front of majestic nature

156
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:12,800
and drink delicious coffee that I made myself.

157
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,900
Australia, I think.

158
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,640
Australia?

159
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,690
I thought you were scared
of flying. Australia is far.

160
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,110
I'll be scared when the time comes.

161
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,040
Maybe I'll follow you there.

162
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,910
These days, I feel like I don't know myself.

163
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,200
There's a lot on my mind,

164
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,150
and I keep moving slowly.

165
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,570
When I was a school nurse...

166
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,080
I hated being in a small, claustrophobic place.

167
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,870
That's why I took over this place.

168
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,600
At first, it was nice.

169
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,940
When I'm bored, I play chess.

170
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,850
I read books, I people-watch...

171
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,880
But I'm even sick of that now.

172
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,390
Is my life ending here?

173
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:02,030
I don't want that.

174
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:05,080
I'm still figuring myself out at my age.

175
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,720
If you know yourself already, I'd be too jealous.

176
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,880
 ♫ The undulating rays of the sun ♫ 

177
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,210
 ♫ The blue sky ♫ 

178
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,880
This is so hard.

179
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,450
Why is this so hard?

180
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,780
You'll learn it in no time.

181
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,470
It's supposed to be hard at first.

182
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,910
I don't know.

183
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:06,620
The world just passes me by.

184
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,610
 I'm sorry. 

185
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,560
And I don't know what's wrong with me...

186
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,000
 I'm... 

187
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,740
 sick. 

188
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,780
Why is he sick?

189
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:28,730
 ♫ Night and day meet briefly ♫ 

190
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:36,310
 ♫ Like us from back then ♫ 

191
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:43,770
 ♫ Like falling into it ♫ 

192
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,270
 

193
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:01,230
 ♫ It's like waves that get pushed away ♫ 

194
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,980
Welcome-

195
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,430
Oh, the firefighter.

196
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Hae isn't here. I told him to take the week off.

197
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,460
You must be here to see him.

198
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,980
Did you fight with him that day
because Hae was late?

199
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,040
He was in the hospital.

200
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,230
He didn't say that. Was he sick?

201
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,010
Did you know, by chance?

202
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:54,000
He just told me that he's sick.

203
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,960
It was the first time he passed out
and had to go to the ER.

204
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,920
So, I was scared, too.

205
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,540
You must have been scared, too.

206
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,250
What is his illness?

207
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,720
Is he going to die?

208
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,490
I think you should let Hae tell you.

209
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,970
It's not my place to say.

210
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,320
You must have been so upset.

211
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,640
Nu Ri, when you spent the weekend
at Min Gyeong's last week...

212
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,470
We studied all weekend.

213
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,040
We weren't just hanging out.

214
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,480
Min Gyeong is ranked 99th.

215
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:43,150
Do you miss your mom?

216
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,820
No. I don't.

217
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,550
Don't talk about that!

218
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,620
People are so...

219
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,270
Littering?

220
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:06,510
They should get fined. In front
of someone's house?

221
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,160
I gave it some thought.

222
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,410
We shouldn't end like this.

223
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,910
This is just like what happened a long time ago.

224
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,400
You have your own reasons, and you reject me.

225
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,810
And I get angry at you.

226
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,830
Sometimes...

227
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,410
I regretted that moment.

228
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,220
I gave it some thought, too.

229
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,640
Oppa, come inside.

230
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,720
Unni, hello.

231
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,350
Are you here to see him?

232
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,910
Yes. I have something to discuss with him.

233
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,810
Come inside. Be comfortable.

234
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:10,250
I'll make you some coffee.

235
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,950
Go inside.

236
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,610
Let's go somewhere else.

237
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,260
I was wondering what you were buying.

238
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,600
That day...

239
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:46,240
I think I told you that out of nowhere.

240
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,820
I thought nothing would scare me in this life.

241
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,700
But after telling you, I got scared.

242
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,500
I don't know how to lie,

243
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,670
and you would cry and live anxiously.

244
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:10,400
I thought that's how it would be.

245
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,600
That scared me.

246
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,830
It doesn't even feel real to me yet.

247
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,620
How could I have explained it to you?

248
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,180
Can I...

249
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,780
ask you what your illness is?

250
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,810
If you wanted to stop seeing me,

251
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,430
- are you...
- Am I going to die?

252
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,070
Yes.

253
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,600
If I'm unlucky.

254
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,420
And I have been unlucky.

255
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,890
Is there...

256
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:16,250
a chance you could possibly
become lucky or something?

257
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,080
I can slow it down with medicine.

258
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,340
By the way, I'm not in pain.

259
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,130
So, don't skip your health checkups.

260
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,600
Get your bloodwork done regularly.

261
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:34,870
For most diseases, the prognosis
is good if you catch them early.

262
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,560
How can you joke right now?

263
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,770
I'm not joking.

264
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,200
You did your best to explain.

265
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,300
So, I just need to accept the reason
we can't be together.

266
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,090
Thank you for coming.

267
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,100
Okay.

268
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,690
I'll get going, then.

269
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,350
This time...

270
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,180
don't follow me, for real.

271
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:50,370
Tae Rin and Sunwoo Hae's show
garnered positive responses.

272
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,400
They came across pretty well.

273
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,470
How about we use them for marketing?

274
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:59,260
Move up the date for the article on
greenlighting "A World Made of Ash."

275
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,740
Say the original author of the hit
movie is Sunwoo Hae.

276
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,250
Je Yeon-

277
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:08,600
I mean, Jae Won, what do you think?

278
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,900
We should release an exclusive before
the last episode of the documentary airs.

279
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,350
Can we make that much noise to promote the movie

280
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,420
without considering his situation?

281
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,150
People are already interested.

282
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,420
That's for him to deal with.

283
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,570
Recently, we created a new
management consulting department.

284
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:31,920
This is Director Kim Seok Joo
for that department.

285
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,600
I'm sure you've probably seen him
around, learning the ropes.

286
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,600
Some of you probably know this, but he's my son.

287
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,870
What was that?

288
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,710
Do you not care what I want?

289
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,330
How can you just decide?

290
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,410
Can we talk later?

291
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,510
Never mind. Make it quick.

292
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,300
I'm trying to use the degree
that I worked hard to get.

293
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,700
Is that so unacceptable to you?
I like the company I'm working for.

294
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,650
You should be ashamed of being
so proud of a workplace so inferior.

295
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,400
Don't insult my company.

296
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,450
You're acting like this for being
at the top of the industry,

297
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,200
but that only works in your industry.

298
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,270
So, why did you learn things around here?

299
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,760
Because I was worried about you!

300
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,800
I wanted to see how you were doing.

301
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,810
We're not...

302
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:28,930
the kind of family that asks about
each other or eats together.

303
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,100
What's the big deal?

304
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,780
You could have just asked!

305
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,790
Mom, I've always done what you asked of me.

306
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,490
I won first place. I studied abroad.

307
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:42,740
Have you ever asked me if I was okay?

308
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,170
Something that's no big deal to you.

309
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:48,650
So, how could I have asked how you were doing?

310
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,030
I never learned how to do that.

311
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:55,700
Yes. This is how you do it.

312
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,460
You did well in there.

313
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,960
I need someone who can disagree with me here.

314
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,350
Nothing works on you.

315
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,770
I won't wait too long.

316
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:12,370
Leave the company you're at now.

317
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,920
Thank you.

318
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,640
Gi Bbeum, what is your problem?

319
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,690
You even got into such a tough school.

320
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:34,220
Why can't you get a driver's license?

321
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,980
I failed the road test again!

322
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:41,830
How was the script?

323
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:46,000
If I have to do it, should I try it?

324
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,320
You brought it to me, and I trust you.

325
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,560
I want to know what you think.

326
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,140
You dig deep.

327
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:02,150
Then, can I think about it a little longer?

328
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:04,130
Sure.

329
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,610
Gi Bbeum, what did you think?

330
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:08,150
The righteous detective Kongjwi

331
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:11,000
investigates Patjwi, who commits savage crimes.

332
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,500
- I felt the limitations of the Korean police.
- What?

333
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,210
The fact that there are so many psychopaths
in Korea is a statistical error.

334
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:23,220
In conclusion, Patjwi is
an ordinary horticulturalist.

335
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,390
I was born again!

336
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,240
What did you think about the
perpetrator role, not the detective?

337
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,030
To designate Patjwi as the perpetrator,
it's a malady of our society-

338
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,600
Gi Bbeum!

339
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,100
I get that you're highly educated.

340
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,300
I asked you to review a TV drama,
not critique Korean society!

341
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:52,570
Does anyone know how to wander?

342
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:54,060
Want to go free diving?

343
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,400
Let's go in the water together.

344
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,600
That's not quite it...

345
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,160
Leave if you're going to chit-chat.

346
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,190
Am I the only one here for a meeting?

347
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,110
I'm here because I was lonely.

348
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,310
Please be kind to me.

349
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:10,550
Leave if you're going to chit-chat.

350
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,340
Gosh, seriously...

351
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:18,830
Kwon Do Eun is reviewing the Kongjwi role.

352
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:20,490
It's almost a done deal.

353
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,400
She has a full calendar next year.

354
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,540
So, the filming starts soon,
and it'll go on air early next year.

355
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:30,480
This is the first script Tae Rin is
looking at after her move.

356
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,300
So, I looked into it back then.

357
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,070
That was so cool just now.

358
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,690
I knew it.

359
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:42,330
I thought you just came here to throw a fit.

360
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:44,970
- What?
- Want to review some scripts since you're here?

361
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,620
Sounds good. But treat me to something delicious.

362
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,730
Delicious!

363
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,430
Thank you.

364
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,170
So good after starving all day.

365
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,600
Why are you starving yourself?

366
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:03,040
I heard Nam Jun Ho is signing
a deal with you guys.

367
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,490
Isn't this a busy time?

368
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:09,620
I noticed you don't even have chairs yet.

369
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,660
When are they coming? Did you custom-order?

370
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:16,580
If you're free, want to go pick up
chairs from my parents' in a truck?

371
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,290
- What?
- Can just anyone rent a truck?

372
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:22,210
I think the renter is supposed to drive it.

373
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,990
Want me to call someone? I know a truck guy.

374
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,670
What? Who is it?

375
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,560
Oppa, are you busy?

376
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,890
Can you pick up some chairs with your truck?

377
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,300
He's asking about the pay.

378
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,510
- Tell him we'll pay well.
- Well.

379
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,440
Want me to come, too?

380
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,170
Okay!

381
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,880
Hired.

382
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,920
Is this a new crush?

383
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:57,420
Hey, you can't have a scandal right
after moving agencies.

384
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:02,230
This place doesn't even have chairs.
They can't deal with it.

385
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,430
Excuse me for a moment.

386
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,820
Yes, Sunbae. What's up?

387
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,770
 Je Yeon, did you see the Bebop article? 

388
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:18,730
What article? Is there more to be exposed?

389
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,230
Gosh, my heart.

390
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,600
 No. 

391
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
We're trending big.

392
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,910
Must be thanks to Bebop.
 

393
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,960
Ever since the article about Bebop
being the original author of

394
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,350
"A World Made of Ash," replay
numbers have been going up.

395
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,540
I'm glad.

396
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:42,260
You scared me when you said
it was an article on Hae.

397
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,400
 Gosh, I'm sorry. Sorry. 

398
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,210
 You're doing well, right? 

399
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,170
What about you, Sunbae?

400
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,100
 I'm busy getting ready for the wedding. 

401
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,480
 I'll send you an invite soon. 

402
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,470
 Take care of your health. 

403
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:04,030
Do you have something in your eyes?

404
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,140
Yes, I do...

405
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,930
I do, I guess...

406
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,500
 

407
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,200
- What now?
- Oppa.

408
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,250
How should I send you the 50,000 won
you lent me for the cab?

409
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:07,200
Oh, right. I almost lost out.

410
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,590
I'll send you my bank account number.

411
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,290
Okay, text it to me.

412
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:12,940
How are you doing? Good?

413
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,680
 Just send me the money. Bye. 

414
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,170
Come on, wait.

415
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:19,070
Everything's good, right?

416
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,110
Are you bored again?

417
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,380
 No. 

418
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,420
I was just wondering if you hurt
someone around you recently.

419
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,800
Does that remind you of anything?

420
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,680
I'm hanging up.

421
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,830
Something bad happened.

422
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,240
What?

423
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,840
You're so adorable.

424
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,400
Making my girl cry?

425
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,340
Who made you cry earlier?

426
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:06,520
I just had something in my eyes.

427
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:13,930
Really. Nothing's going on.

428
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:20,520
I'm thinking of visiting home.

429
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,980
 Wednesday, clear. 

430
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,080
 

431
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,390
 The opening day for Spring Flower. 

432
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,560
Seok Joo, turn on the light.

433
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,210
 My favorite people came. 

434
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,860
It's working!

435
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,320
What does "Ipchoon*" mean?
(Means "Spring")

436
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,150
- Oh, it means you're ugly.
- Hey!

437
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:19,620
 I can now make Nu Ri's
graduation flower bouquet. 

438
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,120
You're uglier!

439
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,270
No, we're not.

440
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,360
Hello, ma'am.

441
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,000
Hi!

442
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,900
"Ipchoon." Love the name.

443
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:31,090
 On Teacher's Day, I'll gift her
a bouquet of carnations. 

444
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,850
I wish you the best!

445
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,470
Yay! It's mine! Thank you.

446
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:37,180
- I brought rice cakes!
- Hi, Hyung.

447
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,720
The rice cakes are delicious.

448
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,980
Hello.

449
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,490
"Ipchoon"...

450
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,980
"Matju" is better than "Ipchoon."

451
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:49,230
 I'll give all my leftover flowers to Geon No. 

452
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,030
Hyung, why not? Give me a plant.

453
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,520
You should pay for it! Pass out the rice cakes.

454
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,700
 I'll have to take care of Seok Joo's
plants. So, they stay alive. 

455
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,370
It's tasty, right?

456
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,470
Let me hand them out.

457
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,500
Hello.

458
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,890
We just opened.

459
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,720
We just opened.

460
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,000
 We handed out rice cakes to nearby stores 

461
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,040
 and ordered in black bean noodles. 

462
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,090
Thanks in advance.

463
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:27,690
 There's a face that came to mind. 

464
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:29,830
 

465
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,470
 
 What would you... 

466
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:37,440
 say if you saw me now? 

467
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,020
 

468
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,260
 Idiot. 

469
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,330
How come your backpack is so big?

470
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,580
Can I try holding it?

471
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,020
My backpack? Is it big?

472
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,110
Je Yeon!

473
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:37,200
What are you doing here without a call?

474
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,550
I came to eat your home-cooked meal.

475
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:45,460
Gosh, I'm already exhausted...

476
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,470
Aigoo...

477
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,780
Oh, right.

478
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,150
Perfect timing. I need to go to the bank,

479
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,720
so watch the kids study.

480
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:59,250
Kids, listen to this teacher.

481
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:00,870
Okay!

482
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,500
I'm your teacher for the day! Let's sit.

483
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,630
 

484
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,250
Hae published a book?

485
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,490
 

486
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,120
Out of print...

487
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,560
Sir, there's an issue with Writer Hwang's
new book cover design.

488
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,560
He took after my talent.

489
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,660
Let's reprint it at our publishing company.

490
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,170
Wait...

491
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,700
What... wait, wait...

492
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,810
Son, it's your dad.

493
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:45,600
I heard you're the original author
of "A World Made of Ash."

494
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,570
I read the article.

495
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,610
 

496
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,840
What?

497
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,150
Let's republish it. It's out of print.

498
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,730
I'll help you.

499
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,610
 I have a great staff. 

500
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,520
How did you get my number?

501
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,370
Nu Ri told me-

502
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,130
 No, wait... 

503
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:09,100
Someone... Someone told me.

504
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,200
 Where are you right now? 

505
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,180
I asked you where you are.

506
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,480
Tell me right now.

507
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,060
 How can I help you? 

508
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,970
I'm here to see the CEO. Where is he?

509
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:21,410
Our CEO is currently out of the office.
How can we help you?

510
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:28,140
I really don't want to introduce myself this way,

511
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,300
but I'm the CEO's biological son.

512
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,010
Did you just introduce yourself as my son?

513
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,910
Why are you...

514
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,520
My son.

515
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:48,060
You want to make a scene here
in front of the whole staff?

516
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,360
Let's talk inside.

517
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,660
Thank you.

518
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:02,430
Aigoo... This is a mess.

519
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,480
I didn't know you'd be coming.

520
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,210
Tell me.

521
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:09,750
Why are you in contact with Nu Ri?

522
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,050
Hae, please calm down and come here.

523
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:18,800
Sit here, and let's talk calmly.

524
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:25,010
And you stayed silent about
staying in touch with Nu Ri's mom?

525
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,640
I mean...

526
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,250
How do you know that?

527
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:32,840
Nu Ri's mom came by after watching the show.

528
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,120
Why did she...

529
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,290
I mean...

530
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,010
Because of her paperwork.

531
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:42,040
It's true, I saw her mom a few times.

532
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,950
But that's all.

533
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,150
While you were in the military,

534
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:50,320
Seok Joo was living at home with Nu Ri.

535
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,270
I really felt for her during that time.

536
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,630
But that was all.

537
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:57,560
I just took Nu Ri out to dinner

538
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,340
and gave her some pocket money.

539
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:03,730
And asked her about you...

540
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:08,520
So, you've been scheming with
Eun Nu Ri for at least ten years?

541
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,560
I only just saw her recently.
I'm telling the truth.

542
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,840
Nu Ri said she found her passion,
and I was so proud...

543
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,480
And you knew about her photography?

544
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:21,710
I love Nu Ri's photos.

545
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:25,580
Gosh, my kids are so creative and talented.

546
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,090
You must've lost it.

547
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:33,530
You raised Nu Ri well and
nurtured her talent, I mean...

548
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:35,170
Do you know why...

549
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,430
I took in Nu Ri?

550
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,200
Because I didn't want to turn out like you.

551
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,490
You wanted to throw her out,
but I didn't want to be like you.

552
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:51,440
You think I wanted to take her in
when I was barely making ends meet?

553
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:58,410
There's one thing I haven't been
able to forgive you for.

554
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,300
 What will you do about Nu Ri? 

555
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,950
 I'll send her to an orphanage- 

556
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,570
 Are you crazy? 

557
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:06,270
I guess you didn't tell Nu Ri about that.

558
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,250
So, Nu Ri didn't mention this?

559
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,250
I'm...

560
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,100
They say I'm dying.

561
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,940
I should've just died with Mom back then.

562
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,610
No, want me to die now?

563
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:39,010
You bastard! Sunwoo Hae!

564
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:44,230
Don't say such a thing, no matter how mad you are.

565
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:47,970
You borrowed your mom's name to write.

566
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,980
You shouldn't say that.

567
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,540
Where were you when all
of that happened to Mom?

568
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:02,600
You were nowhere to be seen when I needed you.

569
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,110
You made me wait forever.

570
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,980
I had no idea about anything.

571
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:17,750
I just waited, waited, waited, and waited more.

572
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,370
For someone like you...

573
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,020
Why did you abandon me?

574
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,940
Tell me.

575
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,710
Why did you abandon me?

576
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,240
Dad.

577
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,580
Was I that big of a burden?

578
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,950
No. That's not it.

579
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,740
I was a fool then.

580
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:00,800
I was immature.

581
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,200
I'm sorry.

582
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,910
You and I were the only family we had.

583
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:12,180
It's not that...

584
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,890
I wish...

585
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,440
I wish I had inherited your irresponsibility.

586
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,550
So that I can live however I want.

587
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,600
After all that...

588
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,630
Mom.

589
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,350
Yes?

590
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:17,060
What's this?

591
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,200
I saw one in the study room, too.

592
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,140
It's supposed to help kids
develop their creativity.

593
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,600
Your Auntie brought it.

594
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,140
Can I try it?

595
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:33,410
I want to be creative, too.

596
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,300
Should we make kimchi fried rice?

597
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:44,770
You said you love the kimchi
from Min Gyeong's. So refreshing.

598
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,240
Eun Nu Ri.

599
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:49,700
Your biological mom came to visit.

600
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,200
Meet her.

601
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,660
And tell her you want to live with her.

602
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:00,140
What? I mean-

603
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:03,700
I don't even remember my mom's face.

604
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,570
- But why?
- So, meet her and talk to her.

605
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:08,300
What's this attitude?

606
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:11,280
Why are you acting like you
were forced to raise me?

607
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,260
- That's how it was.
- Hey!

608
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,990
Don't yell. We're out in public.

609
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:18,240
Did I raise you to act like this?

610
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:23,490
What's wrong with him?

611
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:26,010
Do all the grocery shopping by yourself!

612
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:35,250
 

613
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:46,020
Hey, there are many tables! Come, come!

614
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:54,560
Hey, hey!

615
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,810
You!

616
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:58,970
You didn't even show up to
the baseball team meet-up.

617
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,930
We got annihilated without you.

618
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,500
You bastard.

619
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,770
Who are you?

620
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:06,200
You must be drunk.

621
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,130
I'm Won Seok. Won Seok.

622
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:12,350
Sir, a beer, please.

623
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:13,720
No, no...

624
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,320
A beer, please!

625
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,710
I'm not drunk.

626
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:21,360
I don't know who Won Seok is...

627
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,140
Me?

628
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,870
You're right. I don't know you.

629
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:27,300
Gosh, so sorry.

630
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,620
It's okay.

631
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:34,830
Why don't we share a beer since we met like this?

632
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,750
This neighborhood has changed a lot.

633
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:45,320
All the good stuff disappeared.

634
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,360
It became a tourist destination.

635
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:53,330
I'm raising a little sister, not a puppy.

636
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:57,010
She's so ugly, and she doesn't listen.

637
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:01,120
Gosh, we were skinned alive by the other team.

638
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:05,910
And she went behind my back to meet that moron...

639
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:09,470
Anyway, he's always the problem.

640
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:12,750
Hyungnim, I'm the problem.

641
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:16,080
The pollock tastes good with
the sauce. What's the problem?

642
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,450
Why did it have to be me?

643
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:22,140
Why did it have to be now?

644
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:24,990
Could I die today?

645
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:28,020
No, don't die today. We're drinking today.

646
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,570
Don't live your one and only life like that.

647
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:33,200
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

648
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,620
Won Seok, how do you live?

649
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,980
Me?

650
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,990
Once I strike the bat,

651
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:53,130
I run, no matter what.

652
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:56,730
Whether it's an out or a home run.

653
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:58,340
Go, go, go!

654
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:02,580
Cheers to our one and only life.

655
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,820
Let's go!

656
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:07,170
This is actually my second life.

657
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:22,220
I can't believe I didn't drink
all this time. For what?

658
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:29,670
Hyungnim, when I was younger,
I didn't drink to save money.

659
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:33,240
Once I grew up, I didn't drink for my health.

660
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:37,900
You did the right thing.
Health is the most important.

661
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,540
"Drink till I die!"

662
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:44,390
I didn't even have the guts to say that.

663
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:46,230
No. You shouldn't do that.

664
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,340
Drinking is fine,

665
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,570
but you'd better have guts for something else.

666
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:52,240
To be honest,

667
00:46:53,230 --> 00:47:00,100
I want to grab onto her legs and beg her.

668
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,270
Beg her to love me.

669
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,930
To not leave me.

670
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:07,750
But...

671
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:12,700
I just can't get myself to do that.

672
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,050
It's too selfish.

673
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:22,710
Gosh, it hurts.

674
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,400
What are you doing here?

675
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,490
Come here, have a drink.

676
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:29,000
We've been looking for you for a while!

677
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:32,400
Huh? Aren't you Gi Yong?

678
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,280
Hey, it's not just me, right?

679
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,640
He totally looks like him.

680
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,610
Hey, we've been doing so poorly without you!

681
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:43,650
Aigoo, hello.

682
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:46,300
I'm Sunwoo Hae.

683
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:52,050
I ended up sharing a table with Won Seok.

684
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:55,840
We lost our baseball game today.

685
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,020
It's okay.

686
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,940
Hey, get up. Your driver is here.

687
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,080
You need to go? Your jacket...

688
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,590
It's okay, it's okay.

689
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:04,600
You wear it. It's my gift to you.

690
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,310
It's okay.

691
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:09,370
In that case, my business card.

692
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:11,420
For you, too.

693
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,740
Stay in touch.

694
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,890
Hurry up.

695
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:20,880
Life is tough.

696
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,420
Fighting!

697
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:28,020
Don't get yourself into knots. Okay?

698
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,870
Call me if you want to play baseball.

699
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:32,270
Bye!

700
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:36,230
Hyungnim, bye-bye!

701
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:55,610
What is Seok Joo up to lately?

702
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:59,340
Ask Seok Joo to set you up
with his accountant coworker.

703
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:02,680
Don't just rot like this at home.

704
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:07,660
Gosh, Seok Joo has always been
so tall and handsome since he was a kid.

705
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,740
He was so upright. Right?

706
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:12,500
What? Je Yeon's boyfriend?

707
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,990
- An accountant?
- No, a guy friend.

708
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:17,380
Gosh, seriously...

709
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:19,730
Disgraceful.

710
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:21,600
 

711
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,090
You're actually calling him?

712
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,490
Seok Joo. My Seok Joo.

713
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:30,780
Accountant Seok Joo.

714
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,250
 Are you with your mom? 

715
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:34,710
Seok Joo, how have you been?

716
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:37,450
It's really a no?

717
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:40,360
Can't you do something about my Je Yeon?

718
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:46,570
She's way out of my league, Ahjumma.

719
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:48,400
Okay, take care.

720
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,290
Seriously...

721
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:52,490
Sung Je Yeon. It's Sung Je Yeon.

722
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,260
Yes, it's Sung Je Yeon.

723
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,480
Hey, call Sung Je Yeon.

724
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,490
Gosh, you drank so much.

725
00:49:57,490 --> 00:50:01,030
You always refused to drink with me.

726
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:03,910
Gosh, I don't know...

727
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:06,440
What did Sung Je Yeon say?

728
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:10,530
You're so rude. I need to go
to work tomorrow morning.

729
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:11,980
Gosh, seriously...

730
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,190
I have a lot on my mind, too.
We could've drunk together.

731
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:15,660
Why did you drink alone?

732
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,200
You should've called me
before you started drinking.

733
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,150
Why do you get to do it and not me?

734
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:22,240
I want to do it, too.

735
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,110
What is going on with you?

736
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:26,610
Why? I can't act like this?

737
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:28,090
I'm going crazy...

738
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:31,790
I'm not allowed to do this?

739
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:35,270
Why can't things work out for me?

740
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,830
The plum extract we made last time.

741
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:54,380
Have some or whatever.

742
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,820
Get it stuck in your throat or whatever.

743
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,500
Here's my savings. Use it for living expenses.

744
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:08,200
I turn 20 soon. So, I'll start working
and make money with you.

745
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:11,900
Your flower shop flopped, didn't it?

746
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,270
I've never seen you act like
this in my entire life.

747
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:16,360
The flower shop flopped, so-

748
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:20,300
so you're telling me to go to my mom.

749
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,020
Where did you get this money?

750
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:25,400
I don't understand.

751
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,910
How can you say to go live
with someone I don't even remember?

752
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:30,520
Aren't you sad?

753
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,390
We're family. You're my only family.

754
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:34,930
Why am I your only family?

755
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:36,470
I heard you kept in touch with that moron.

756
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:38,100
Moron-

757
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,750
Chan?

758
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,400
You knew everything?

759
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,100
You were making a fool out of me?

760
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,210
How could you do that as a family?

761
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:47,850
As family?

762
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:50,100
Do you know what makes a family?

763
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:53,790
You eat together, live together...

764
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:56,710
communicate openly, and not hold back like you.

765
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:58,120
That's right.

766
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,910
I feel like we've never been more
of a family than lately.

767
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:03,300
How come everyone wants to get rid of me?

768
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,700
You should've just ditched me
at the amusement park.

769
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,550
Why did you come back for me?

770
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:20,090
You ditched me.

771
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,740
Stop fiddling with that.

772
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,720
It'll fall apart.

773
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:38,410
Are you torturing it?

774
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:40,040
What do you want to do?

775
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,100
How long does a penguin live?

776
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:45,330
Well, 50 years at most?

777
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:49,140
I wish he were born a penguin...

778
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:53,680
Get up, you idiot.

779
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,470
Let's go out.

780
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,900
I'm tired.

781
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,540
Get up.

782
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:07,690
I can beat Tae Rin, but not you.

783
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:11,510
Yeah? They say no parent can defeat their child.

784
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:13,490
I'd better beat you here.

785
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,590
Aigoo, that's your stance?

786
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:17,160
Aigoo, be careful.

787
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,960
Okay, I'm sorry.

788
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,300
I'll zip my mouth and keep going.

789
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:26,760
Wow, the view is amazing, and the air is nice.

790
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,840
I wish we had some coffee.

791
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:33,240
What's that? Why are you eating
it alone? Let me have some.

792
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:34,830
Want some?

793
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,300
- Aren't you glad I brought it?
- Yeah.

794
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:44,030
I feel wide awake!

795
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:45,610
You need to move.

796
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:47,680
Calm your amygdala, you know?

797
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,690
If you sit around all the time,

798
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:53,120
all you do is think nonstop.
What would happen, then?

799
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,250
I forgot that you're tutor Kim Su Jin.

800
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:01,570
Gosh, I just had a trauma response.

801
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:05,500
You don't even know what happens,
yet you sat around all day?

802
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,240
Think about the past. Did it ever work for you?

803
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:14,880
So, let's keep marching forward over there

804
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,570
just like we're doing now.

805
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:19,730
Okay?

806
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:20,840
Okay!

807
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,220
Let's go!

808
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:23,980
Let's go.

809
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,420
Look, Ms. Kim Su Jin.

810
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:48,320
I've stayed away too long to make money.

811
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:56,090
Should I come back here and teach kids?

812
00:54:56,090 --> 00:54:58,340
And have a constant stream of kids.

813
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:00,270
You think so?

814
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:03,580
It's not easy to teach kids.

815
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:08,070
You quit your TA position so quickly.

816
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:15,140
Ms. Kim Su Jin, there's a place
you can hang up your wishes.

817
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:18,040
Sung Je Yeon, I brought you
here to empty your mind.

818
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,300
And your mind jumps to wishes?

819
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,300
Gosh, that hurts. You don't love me, do you?

820
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:26,560
You don't even know what love means.

821
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,120
You and I standing here like this is love.

822
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,440
What more is there?

823
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:35,090
I respect you.

824
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:40,520
I guess you can live with Dad
because you're so strong.

825
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:44,220
Your dad's mental state is so cute.

826
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:47,980
Well, businesses can fail.

827
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:52,570
Life is like banging your head
against a brick wall.

828
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:56,000
Just become the brick wall. Always.

829
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
- The world is your head.
- Mom.

830
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,430
Never mind.

831
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:05,220
I met too big a head for that.

832
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,630
Something's going on, huh?

833
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,460
It's Seok Joo, isn't it?

834
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:11,550
"Seok" in Seok Joo means rock, doesn't it?

835
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:13,900
You can't break him. You're the head this time.

836
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:17,780
I'm not, Mom! I'm telling you.

837
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,820
Gosh...

838
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:25,880
You got me riled up, and it hurts now.

839
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:29,060
You're trying to get out of this.

840
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:32,140
Let's go.

841
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,770
- Mom.
- Yes?

842
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:42,000
Love you.

843
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,720
What?

844
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,920
I can't hear you, princess.

845
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,620
I don't know. I'm hungry.

846
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:51,110
Let's go down.

847
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,480
I'd better climb up.

848
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:37,480
Hi. Truck oppa.

849
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,900
I thought Mo Tae Rin was meeting me.

850
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,210
Truck oppa, aren't we leaving?

851
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,000
I thought about it.

852
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,430
I didn't confirm if you'll get
paid double for this.

853
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:25,090
What did the Director say?

854
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:28,460
She'll pay me a little more
than the truck rental fee.

855
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:31,000
You should also be paid for delivery.

856
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:38,170
Director, it's me.

857
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:40,220
You're paying him double today, right?

858
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:42,270
And the delivery fee is separate, right?

859
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:43,610
Got it.

860
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:49,200
- Be careful.
- Yes. That's all.

861
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:57,160
Aigoo, Han Na is so absent-minded,
and she's only 40.

862
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,280
You must be so proud of the Director.

863
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:04,470
If I think back to when she went
to Seoul with my savings account...

864
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:07,200
She's not perfect, but thank you in advance.

865
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,330
Yes.

866
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:09,800
Also, this.

867
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:10,960
What is this?

868
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,200
In case you want snacks for the road.

869
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,540
Wow, thank you.

870
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:20,900
Thanks to the Director,
we got to get some fresh air.

871
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:24,590
Aigoo, I kept you too long, chit-chatting.

872
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:26,000
Drive safely.

873
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,250
Okay.

874
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:30,050
- Take care.
- Take care. Thank you.

875
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:36,840
What?

876
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,650
Gosh, my stomach...

877
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:43,260
Can we get some digestive pills?

878
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:46,900
It might be because you've been
riding in the truck too long.

879
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,830
Should we take a break before hitting the road?

880
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:50,850
Okay.

881
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:53,790
 Gosh, I feel like people are talking about me. 

882
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:58,490
There are two things.

883
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:01,480
First, I booked a magazine shoot.

884
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,400
I'll ask for the questions in advance.

885
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,800
The editor usually doesn't, but she's a friend.

886
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,250
I'd better get in shape. What's the other thing?

887
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:12,420
About the TV drama, "Kongjwi and Patjwi"...

888
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,720
The casting is complete.

889
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,040
I'm so sorry.

890
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,400
I know you put a lot of work into the reading.

891
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,510
You snooze, you lose.

892
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,650
Why do I feel so relieved?

893
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:31,350
There's something that's been bothering me.

894
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:33,680
It read like a romance, not a thriller.

895
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:36,630
It was difficult to understand the intent.

896
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,970
It read like a romance?

897
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:44,770
That makes it a totally different story.

898
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:46,210
Sounds interesting.

899
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:49,490
I'm sure I misinterpreted it.

900
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:51,790
Maybe I dug in too deep.

901
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:54,880
Why do I dig so deep?

902
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,940
Director, I hope you're not
dreaming too big with me.

903
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:00,390
You know my scale.

904
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:03,580
I'm dreaming at the scale you're at.

905
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:07,180
What?

906
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:09,840
What does that mean?

907
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,510
Want to eat salad for lunch?

908
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:14,560
You said you need to get in shape.

909
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:16,690
Gosh, I'm so lost.

910
01:01:16,690 --> 01:01:19,240
Director!

911
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:23,850
 

912
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:30,810
You didn't have to come.

913
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:32,970
Why come and suffer?

914
01:01:32,970 --> 01:01:34,190
Thanks.

915
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,760
Drink.

916
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,130
What if you faint while driving?

917
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:40,190
You won't be the only one getting hurt.

918
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:42,860
It was for a greater good.

919
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:44,720
Sure...

920
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:51,720
I don't feel ready to get on the road yet.

921
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:56,300
It's time for you to pay me back.

922
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:57,850
What do you mean?

923
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,860
You said you'd teach me how to ride a bike.

924
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:02,590
Right now?

925
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:05,510
The seat is too high...

926
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,810
My feet will drag on the ground like this.

927
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:12,410
This way, you'll be able to stop
before you fall over.

928
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:13,990
There we go.

929
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,260
Fine.

930
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:19,280
Let me try.

931
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,640
Okay. Be careful.

932
01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:25,440
I'm off.

933
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,780
Wow, it's working.

934
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:33,970
Hey, hey.

935
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:40,040
I didn't mean to fall into your arms.

936
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,150
I know. Be careful.

937
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:45,760
Hey.

938
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,620
Give me some tips.

939
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:50,840
Instead of letting me fall on you.

940
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,930
Tips?

941
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:55,540
Well, balance,

942
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:57,400
be brave, don't get hurt.

943
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:01,420
Aigoo. Those are some tips.

944
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:07,180
Don't imagine.

945
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:10,100
Fear comes from imagination.

946
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:14,400
Don't imagine falling down.
Just keep going forward.

947
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,620
You can do that?

948
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:22,110
Yes, that's how I can ride the bike.

949
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:25,410
No. You couldn't do that.

950
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,100
 If something like this happens again... 

951
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:33,680
 the end is going to be like this. 

952
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:36,890
 We should stop seeing each other. 

953
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,810
Teach me again. I'll go for it this time.

954
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:48,400
Let me show you. Watch me ride.

955
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:54,780
Don't be scared.

956
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:57,770
Just look forward. Don't look down.

957
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,340
Want to try it again?

958
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:45,010
Yeah.

959
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,390
You okay?

960
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:50,320
Be careful.

961
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,570
I'm letting go.

962
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:53,140
I'm letting go.

963
01:04:57,530 --> 01:04:59,250
What? Am I doing it?

964
01:05:00,110 --> 01:05:01,400
I'm doing it!

965
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,060
I'm doing it, right?

966
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,220
I did it, right?

967
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:16,700
Yes.

968
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:36,330
I missed you.

969
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:44,200
I thought about it this whole time,

970
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,230
and I came to the same conclusion.

971
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:56,750
What if I say I want to keep seeing you?

972
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:01,200
- What then?
- Je Yeon...

973
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,930
Please...

974
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,750
Please don't do that.

975
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:11,840
All I think about is you.

976
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,120
I don't know why.

977
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:16,440
If it's because I hate you or because I feel bad.

978
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,350
That's why I came.

979
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:21,580
I know now that I see you.

980
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:26,440
I can't control my feelings.

981
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:31,390
I can't end it like this.

982
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:34,590
It's already over.

983
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:37,310
I don't want to burden you.

984
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:44,020
If we start this, I can't bear
the responsibility to the end.

985
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:48,050
I don't want to make you cry and feel
lonely with promises I can't keep.

986
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:50,950
I can't guarantee that it won't happen.

987
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:04,070
I want to make my loved one smile, not cry.

988
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:08,060
I hate that you have to hold back because of me.

989
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:11,760
I hate that you don't get to be you. So...

990
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,680
don't waste yourself on me.

991
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:20,350
I don't know what will happen to me, either.

992
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:23,200
I don't want to ask you to face that with me.

993
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,540
You said life is a bet.

994
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:29,000
Some days, you win. And some days, you lose.

995
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:34,230
So, why do you keep betting on losing?

996
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:36,280
Just pretend you can't say no, and give in.

997
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,710
I shouldn't have told you.

998
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:41,500
I...

999
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:47,820
shouldn't have told you that.

1000
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:50,030
Tell me what?

1001
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:52,020
That you're sick?

1002
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:57,700
You're just not brave enough.

1003
01:07:58,810 --> 01:08:03,120
You only love me that much.

1004
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:05,700
Only...

1005
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:09,560
Only that much.

1006
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,890
I'm so sick of this.

1007
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:33,630
Sung Je Yeon.

1008
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:37,240
Wait a second.

1009
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,550
- Let go.
- Wait a second.

1010
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:40,140
- I said let go!
- Your shoelaces are untied.

1011
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:42,490
- I said let go!
- Wait!

1012
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,060
Just a moment.

1013
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:50,750
Just one moment.

1014
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:14,780
I keep asking the same question.

1015
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,610
Do you like me or not?

1016
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:39,760
I don't like you.

1017
01:09:42,620 --> 01:09:44,190
All good?

1018
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:37,960
 ♫ Can we go back? ♫ 

1019
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:44,210
 ♫ Everything was clumsy ♫ 

1020
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:48,300
 ♫ But we were shining brightly ♫ 

1021
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:54,420
 ♫ Our first season ♫ 

1022
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:59,650
 ♫ If only we can go back ♫ 

1023
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:06,290
 ♫ Let's not be so clumsy ♫ 

1024
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:08,690
 ♫ I will tell you ♫ 

1025
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:10,310
What happened here?

1026
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:13,910
Excuse me, what happened here?

1027
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:19,860
The woman riding the bike
crashed into the skateboarders.

1028
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:21,720
She went off in an ambulance just now.

1029
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:24,940
Gosh, he must know her. Oh, no...

1030
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:28,790
Aigoo, she fell and couldn't get up.

1031
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:30,240
What do we do?

1032
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,280
You should go after her.

1033
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:36,700
 ♫ I closed my eyes ♫ 

1034
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:40,650
 ♫ The flowers bloomed in your fragile hand ♫ 

1035
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:41,710
 

1036
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:47,190
 ♫ Drowning in time ♫ 

1037
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:49,650
 The customer can't answer the call right now. 

1038
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:52,380
 

1039
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,640
 The customer can't answer the call right now. 

1040
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:14,550
 ♫ Because of you, I can breathe ♫ 

1041
01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:25,000
 ♫ When I go back to my shadow ♫ 

1042
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:33,290
 ♫ Greet me again as your shining self ♫ 

1043
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:40,190
 ♫ Your smile sparkles that brilliant season ♫ 

1044
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:50,350
 ♫ I would never leave you ♫ 

1045
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,930
 I got a call from Sung Je Yeon
saying she's here. 

1046
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:05,290
 It's my fault, Je Yeon. 

1047
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:07,840
 When are you free? 

1048
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:11,230
 I thought you said you don't have feelings for me. 

1049
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:16,470
 Will someone like me be okay
for someone like you? 

1050
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:22,040
 Feeling too happy can be scary sometimes. 

1051
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:26,480
 Do some people remember the
first time they experience a season, 

1052
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:30,250
 their first snow? 

1053
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:36,340
 I have no idea what will happen in the future. 

1054
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:41,600
 But let's go through it all together.
