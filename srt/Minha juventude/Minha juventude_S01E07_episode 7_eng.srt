1
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,800
 

2
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,550
Idiot.

3
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,470
It shouldn't be so beautiful.

4
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,780
Are you over me?

5
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,270
No.

6
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,190
Now that I think about it,

7
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,500
I never even tried.

8
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,550
It's just not great timing.

9
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,280
Is it because...

10
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,700
- by any chance...
- By any chance, what?

11
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,900
Let me guess. Your sister in high
school is actually your daughter.

12
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,240
Wrong.

13
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,900
- What are you doing?
- I know.

14
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,450
You and Kim Seok Joo are actually brothers.

15
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,720
Then, you're the CEO's son? Is that right?

16
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,370
Wrong.

17
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:38,200
- What am I doing right now?
- I know! Well...

18
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,770
is that a wig? How bald are you?

19
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,000
What are you saying? This is my real hair.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,170
Can I pull it?

21
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,020
It's real hair.

22
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,860
How come your brain spins so fast?

23
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,650
I wasn't valedictorian for nothing.

24
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,040
Wow, gosh! I look like I'm out of my mind, huh?

25
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,690
It's okay. I feel out of it, too.

26
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,910
When will we ever be okay?

27
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,350
- I know.
- Right? We don't know.

28
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,180
Anyway, I've made my decision.

29
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,120
I'll get through to you.

30
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,370
Once I've made up my mind,
I've got to see the end of it.

31
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,360
I'm going to go for it.

32
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,460
I'm telling you, okay?

33
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,770
Watch me.

34
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,180
 ♫ I feel nervous, but I don't know why ♫ 

35
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,230
 ♫ Faint butterflies in my stomach ♫ 

36
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,140
You didn't have lunch yet, right?

37
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,900
I'm working on a new menu item. This is for you...

38
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,410
What are you doing?

39
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,290
 ♫ You vibrate as if shocked ♫ 

40
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,570
What did the doctor say?
It hasn't gotten worse, has it?

41
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,040
Hyung.

42
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,690
Maybe the results are wrong.

43
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,190
It doesn't feel real yet.

44
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,500
Hey.

45
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,340
Let's eat. It won't be good if it gets cold.

46
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,970
Let's eat.

47
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:41,450
 ♫ Come closer ♫ 

48
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,490
 ♫ The red sunset ♫ 

49
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:55,320
 ♫ Night and day meet briefly ♫ 

50
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:01,640
 ♫ Like us from back then ♫ 

51
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:09,270
 ♫ Like falling into it ♫ 

52
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:19,150
 ♫ Pretending not to know and embrace ♫ 

53
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:26,550
 ♫ It's like waves that get pushed away ♫ 

54
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,360
 Then, you mix like this... 

55
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,670
 Right, mix. 

56
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,160
Is that Sunwoo Hae?

57
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,600
Why didn't you say you were here? You scared me!

58
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,100
Sorry. I think you and I were
looking for the same person.

59
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,740
- What?
- You know Jin Mu Yeong?

60
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,200
That Jin Mu Yeong.

61
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,640
He went on the show after all.

62
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,370
How did you convince him?
You had trouble booking him last year.

63
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,790
He's more chill than he seems. Nice, too.

64
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,190
The out-of-town shoot ran into trouble,

65
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:56,100
but he stayed behind alone to plant the trees.

66
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,580
I hope that comes through in the edit.

67
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,100
That's what we do.

68
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,000
 

69
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,310
I know it must've been very unpleasant that day.

70
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,020
I sincerely apologize.

71
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,230
I remember this feeling.

72
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,700
I don't want to take it, but I have to.

73
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,740
My apology was sincere.

74
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,450
If you don't want to accept it, you don't have to.

75
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:32,230
You know you're out of his league, right?

76
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,600
That's your mom's name, isn't it?

77
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:40,500
 

78
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,250
Didn't you use it as your pen name
because you wanted to hide behind it?

79
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,580
You knew you'd get torn apart otherwise.

80
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,170
If someone involved in a fraud case was
publishing a book and selling the rights.

81
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,750
After the show airs today, it will get worse.

82
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,150
Are you concerned for me?

83
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,670
Even if it gets tough, stay strong.

84
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,580
Don't make those around you worry.

85
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,800
Thanks for the advice.

86
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,880
Enjoy your food.

87
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,630
Why are you so down?

88
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,630
Did you fight with ahjumma?

89
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,300
I should just take it like a sandbag,

90
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,020
but I lost my temper in that moment.

91
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,220
You know how to lose your temper?

92
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,250
I never saw that with my mom
or when we lived at Seok Joo's.

93
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:45,700
I hold back in front of the kids.

94
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,800
You remember things from when you were so little?

95
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,300
I remember both Mom running away
and holding your hand to meet Oppa.

96
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,030
Nu Ri, do you miss your mom?

97
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,630
You never ask.

98
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,330
I don't know.

99
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:05,930
That makes me feel like I'm betraying Oppa.

100
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:10,200
If you need someone to talk to,
you have me. You know that, right?

101
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,170
All right.

102
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:16,200
Can I order kimchi fried rice?

103
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,820
Can we get a kimchi-
Don't tell him I gave you the kimchi.

104
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,230
Keep it a secret that you're seeing me.

105
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,240
When are you two going to make up?

106
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,120
You've been doing this through me for 10 years.

107
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,200
Regarding this matter,
Hae needs to forgive me first.

108
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,380
Wow, this!

109
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:44,470
I used to take pictures of Hae
with this when he was little.

110
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,830
Aigoo, so pretty.

111
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,560
Right. When are you giving me the film?

112
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,630
Oh, no.

113
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,920
Here. Thirty-six bags.

114
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,780
You haven't called once.

115
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,690
Ahjumma! Hello.

116
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,990
Here. Take this and go.

117
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,190
I'll call you.

118
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,910
A minor now? Seriously?

119
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,490
- Is this why you left the house?
- Noona!

120
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,990
Seriously? She's like my daughter!

121
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,690
Right, you're seeing a girl who
could be your daughter!

122
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,240
Let's go to the police.

123
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,740
Come over here! Come!

124
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,510
You come, too.

125
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,290
I'm Nu Ri.

126
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,120
Don't you remember me?

127
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,820
You gave me this camera.

128
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,390
Right. You're Nu Ri.

129
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,910
The little girl that Seok Joo brought in.

130
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,780
- Sunwoo Hae's daughter.
- What?

131
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,870
Not Hae's daughter. The woman I used to be with...

132
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,250
I told you before I got together with you...

133
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,680
After Hae's mom died, I fell in love
with her mom when I was struggling...

134
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:05,100
Hey! Why do you have so many secrets
when you're not even a good liar?

135
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,670
You don't like it when I talk about the past!

136
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,380
I didn't know I'd get caught.

137
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,690
Look at you running your mouth again.

138
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,470
Who cares whose daughter I am?

139
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,790
Ahjussi, ahjumma, stop fighting.

140
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,420
Bye.

141
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,240
Bye.

142
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,640
I can explain everything.

143
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,440
Hae is supporting her. She has a good life.

144
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,980
Sure, sure. I'm a sinner. I am...

145
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,620
- Gosh! I can't watch!
- Oh, my God!

146
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,530
- I'm going to lose my mind.
- You scared me.

147
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,310
Hey! Hey, hey, hey...

148
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,450
Pour it into a glass.

149
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:10,320
Hey. Don't drink on an empty stomach.

150
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,840
I should have drunk the soju earlier.

151
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,870
- Next week, let's drink before we watch.
- Sounds good.

152
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:33,510
I really can't watch.

153
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,840
Hae?

154
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,910
 Hurry up! 

155
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,170
What is wrong with me?

156
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:47,170
Why am I trying so hard to be cute...

157
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,260
Oh, my gosh...

158
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,970
Hyung, they're paying!

159
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,590
Thank you, come again. Thank you.

160
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,890
Table 7's food is ready.

161
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,420
Wait. Isn't the soccer game today?

162
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,970
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

163
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,690
Could you turn on the soccer game?

164
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,080
Soccer? Got it. One second.

165
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,000
Things went over okay today.

166
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,900
Was I the only one who enjoyed it?

167
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,190
I also...

168
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,740
thought it was good.

169
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,840
I might have been a little funny.

170
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,570
I told you! You're so charming.

171
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,300
But Bebop actually chewed me out a lot.

172
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,060
- But in the edit, he came across as so supportive.
- But...

173
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,660
I wonder if Bebop even watched.

174
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,900
I bet he doesn't even know it's out.

175
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,560
He's probably busy making money.

176
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,250
Tae Rin, when you're dealing with
someone who has a lot on their mind

177
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:09,010
and is complicated, what do I do?

178
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,380
Be simple.

179
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,470
Just balance him out.

180
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,030
What's the genre?

181
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:18,070
Thriller? Romance? Action?

182
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,410
Mixed.

183
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,400
Well, I don't know who
you're talking about, but...

184
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,710
Have you kissed?

185
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,640
What? What do you mean?

186
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,270
Well...

187
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:39,170
How was it? What was it like afterward?

188
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,550
I kept thinking about it.

189
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,100
Then, you kiss him next time.

190
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,200
Let's brainwash him.
So, he'll only think about you.

191
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,090
Oh, right!

192
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:51,580
H-H-How do I do that?

193
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:56,380
If I just think about it, will it work? Will it?

194
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,230
You're cute.

195
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:03,220
You just saying that makes my heart flutter.

196
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,830
I'm jealous.

197
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,570
Where can I find someone who's devoted to me?

198
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:11,000
Someone who will sacrifice,
be devoted, and love me only.

199
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,360
Someone who would die for a purpose.

200
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,670
Hey. If it comes up in an interview,
don't ever say that's your type.

201
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,680
Keep it to yourself.

202
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,560
Anyway, go back to him, and...

203
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,690
For instance,

204
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:31,200
let's say you two are sitting
like this, eating tteokbokki.

205
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,400
- Is tteokbokki too spicy?
- Yes. It's spicy.

206
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,300
Can it be ice cream instead?

207
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,790
Even better.

208
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,680
Let's say that you're eating next to each other.

209
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,150
- Then...
- Then?

210
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,000
Then?

211
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,750
Then...

212
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,010
I'll hold him like this and go for it.

213
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,500
- No?
- Seriously?

214
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,950
- So clueless.
- Really?

215
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,530
You need to set the mood first!

216
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,900
Imagine that I'm him.

217
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,820
- You always read scenes with me.
- Okay.

218
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,820
All right. Close your eyes...

219
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,960
Get into it...

220
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,910
What are you doing?

221
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,020
You're just going to look?

222
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,140
I can't. I can't.

223
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,790
Why not?

224
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,270
I'm nervous.

225
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,900
Goodness. Seriously...

226
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,870
Just do it like this.

227
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,620
Go for it...

228
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,010
when the vibe is right.

229
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,900
Can you not do it when you imagine it's Hae?

230
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,190
What?

231
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:26,850
Hey! You! How did you know it was Sunwoo Hae?

232
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,240
I wanted to pretend like I didn't know.

233
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,230
The only men around you are Hae...

234
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,420
and Kim... Kim Seok Joo.

235
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,980
Hold on! Why are you here?

236
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,270
I'm not interested! No, thank you!

237
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,930
Who are you thinking about?

238
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,400
I thought you were practicing with me.

239
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,600
- Why am I thinking about that sunbae?
- Sunbae?

240
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,070
Do I have too little, I mean,
too much dopamine these days?

241
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,360
Last time, you said he's just a kid.

242
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,430
What loser are you talking about?

243
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,110
You're not paying attention to me!

244
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,330
Why would I pay any attention to you?

245
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:08,040
You're paying attention to me!

246
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,100
What are you into?

247
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,520
How far did you get?

248
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,830
I need to shake this off.

249
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,750
Let's just drink.

250
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,530
Okay, then. Wait...

251
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,180
To summarize,

252
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:34,050
you're saying I should set up a situation
and make him go berserk, right?

253
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:37,220
That's right. Kiss him, slap him, or cry.

254
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,320
Do something. Or all of the above.

255
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,810
Then, that will be all he can think about at home.

256
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:44,440
I guess that's true.

257
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,820
Okay, listen.

258
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,010
Cry, slap him, then kiss him. Right?

259
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:53,730
You could slap him first, then cry.

260
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,870
Here it is.

261
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,020
Thank you!

262
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,370
- You ordered potted flowers, right?
- Yes.

263
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,480
You're all set with payment.

264
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,390
You're Sunwoo Hae, right?

265
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,100
Oh, yes.

266
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,010
That's so cool. Hello.

267
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,410
- Thank you.
- Have a nice day.

268
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,250
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

269
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,440
Flower delivery!

270
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,260
 

271
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,990
I saw you on TV.

272
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,930
You deliver these yourself?

273
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,330
Oh, yes.

274
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,890
Could you sign here?

275
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,440
Honey!

276
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,350
My husband is a huge fan.

277
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:10,250
That sitcom was so good!

278
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,970
Could we get a photo with you?

279
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,900
- Sure, could you sign here first?
- Just one second.

280
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,780
Honey! Come on out!

281
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,390
These stairs are too much.

282
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,600
It's just four floors. How come you're so winded?

283
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,660
- Aren't you working out these days?
- No.

284
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:53,260
By the way, what did you think of the show?

285
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,260
Was I clever and wise?

286
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:01,880
You were so goofy and lovable.

287
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,830
You went to a bookstore?
 

288
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,430
- No way.
- Knew it.

289
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,850
Hold on. Let me give you the script
for Episodes 3 and 4.

290
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,110
The chairs still aren't here?

291
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:20,270
They were sent to my parents'.

292
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,960
This box is very sturdy.

293
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:29,040
The script reviewed by the person
who sent the office chairs to your parents'?

294
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,190
I don't see Gi Bbeum.

295
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,530
I sent him to a driving school to get his license.

296
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,720
Aigoo.

297
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,840
Hello.

298
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,490
Excuse me.

299
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,900
What are you doing here? My goodness...

300
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,200
I'm here to see Director Bang Han Na.

301
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:00,950
I didn't know someone else would
be here, so I just bought two cups.

302
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,730
Thanks for the coffee.

303
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,890
Our actress needs a new accountant.

304
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,730
If you're busy, feel free
to recommend someone else.

305
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:14,410
You know Mo Tae Rin over there, right?

306
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,100
She's our top actress.

307
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,640
That's how things worked out.

308
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,170
If you're uncomfortable doing this
since you work with your mother...

309
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,960
It's okay.

310
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,290
Looking forward to working with you.

311
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,270
I'm Kim Seok Joo.

312
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,910
Looking forward to working with you.

313
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,970
You're an accountant, too?

314
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,610
Yes. That's my main line of work.

315
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:12,020
When can I get my bag back?

316
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,340
I thought you were getting rid of it.

317
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,400
We can exchange it for your handkerchief.

318
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,200
- The one you lent me.
- You can have it.

319
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,960
You're not being rude to me today.

320
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,770
Are we using honorifics now?

321
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,900
Where were you going to take me
at the hotel last time?

322
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,500
I got curious.

323
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,400
I know where you can cry without
people watching inside that hotel.

324
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,030
Why do you know that?

325
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:45,320
I might have cried my eyes out there.

326
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,520
I was trying to be nice.

327
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,200
Yet I was treated like a piece of shit.

328
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,610
Cried your eyes out?

329
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:56,100
You seem cold as ice.

330
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,460
Of course, I cry. I'm human.

331
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,370
It seems like you have a grudge against me.

332
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,910
We can take care of that as we go.

333
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,950
You'll have to take it now.

334
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,680
It was my first radio show, so I got nervous.

335
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,310
Maybe that's why it reminded me
of when I was a kid.

336
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:30,890
I heard your radio show on the rooftop, Sunbae.

337
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:38,440
 That voice made me cry once, too. 

338
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,230
Do you ever think this at times?

339
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,960
That the gravity is pressing
down harder only on me.

340
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,990
I just wonder every now and then.

341
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,880
Why am I standing here
in the middle of it all as myself?

342
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,930
Maybe I'm still growing up.

343
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,610
You asked me why I keep crying.

344
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:22,720
Is that why you get in the water?

345
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,390
Well, you know...

346
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,120
No tax evasion.

347
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,600
Just a fair amount of deductions, please.

348
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,760
Of course. Why make a point?

349
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,890
You're funny.

350
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,510
What's funny? You're not even laughing.

351
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,790
Are you human or a robot?

352
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,380
Seriously?

353
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,080
Don't forget my bag next time.

354
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:51,080
She's so weird.

355
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,490
You know about Nu Ri's grades, right?

356
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,420
Yes.

357
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,090
A university in Seoul will be hard.

358
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:03,650
Here are schools she could apply
to with a portfolio.

359
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,110
She's a talented photographer,

360
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,210
and she works hard at extracurriculars.

361
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,860
- Photography?
- Yes.

362
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,560
She should sign up for an after-school class.

363
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,310
If you can't afford it, I understand.

364
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:17,470
No, I'll do that.

365
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:24,500
I'm sorry, but how are you
related to Nu Ri, exactly?

366
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:29,130
She said her older brother was coming,

367
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:32,400
but your last names are different.

368
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,470
We are family.

369
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,860
It's a complicated family situation.

370
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,010
You should take more interest in her.

371
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,840
It's a critical time.

372
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,450
Got it. I will.

373
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,160
Hello, Hyungnim.

374
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,910
I'm Choi Sa Rang, Nu Ri's friend.

375
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,710
You scared me.

376
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,540
Hello.

377
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:02,960
Hey, are you crazy?

378
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,700
Why?

379
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,290
Oppa.

380
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,380
Hey, friend...

381
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,560
How are your grades?

382
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,400
I rank first in my class.

383
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,750
How about you?

384
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,420
Me?

385
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,010
Why do you ask? You already know.

386
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,840
Grades don't make a person happy. So rude!

387
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,800
Your grades are even more rude.

388
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,630
What did my teacher say?
Did the meeting not go well?

389
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,620
I heard you take photos.

390
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,610
Did you not tell me because cameras are expensive?

391
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:49,470
It's just an extracurricular
activity I'm involved in.

392
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,700
Are you upset?

393
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:56,510
Show me your pictures next time.

394
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,450
Share this with your friends.

395
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,690
Not him, though.

396
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,850
Bye.

397
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,260
Does your brother hate me?

398
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,770
I don't know.

399
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:20,110
Cry, hit, kiss?

400
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:24,430
No. Hit, cry, kiss.

401
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,990
Closed?

402
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,460
 

403
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,060
Hello?

404
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,580
This is Sunwoo Hae's number, though...

405
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,060
Hello, did you just find this phone?

406
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,090
Oh, I guess not.

407
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,590
Can you tell me where you are?

408
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:05,700
Got it. I'll be right there. Okay.

409
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:12,100
If it's not urgent, please come back later.

410
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,860
This shop is the best.

411
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,280
Okay.

412
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:22,780
She must have grown up smelling flowers.

413
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,460
Sunwoo Hae!

414
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,520
Sunwoo Hae?

415
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,120
Sunwoo Hae!

416
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,670
You called earlier!

417
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,400
Yes, hello.

418
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,100
He's out on an errand.

419
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,190
He'll be back soon. Look around.

420
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,550
Okay.

421
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,350
I'm losing steam here.

422
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:53,240
Where did he go?

423
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,060
I'm going to buy something.

424
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,550
Aigoo, I'm sorry I was staring.

425
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:05,930
It's the first time someone has come to see Hae.

426
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,670
I was wondering who you were.

427
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,170
You're her, right?

428
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:13,110
You guys must be totally smitten with each other.

429
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,290
Oh, ma'am!

430
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,540
- Change the light bulb.
- Okay.

431
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,310
Don't hang out in the dark.

432
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,930
Got it.

433
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,050
Here.

434
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:30,590
What took you so long?

435
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,980
How did you know I was here?

436
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,940
The class president knows everything!

437
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,470
So, be careful.

438
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,260
Are you a regular here?

439
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,740
You two seem close.

440
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,490
You don't remember?

441
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:54,430
She was our nurse in high school.

442
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:57,700
My goodness. I don't remember.

443
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,840
So, she retired and opened a used bookstore?

444
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,150
Her grandmother used to run it.

445
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:06,810
She took over about five years ago.

446
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,710
I see.

447
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:12,700
If I don't read something, I feel like
my head is going to be empty.

448
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,340
On my days off, I help out.

449
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,040
I told her not to put this book here...

450
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,630
Hey, someone must have sold a gifted book.

451
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,440
"We've been together for almost 100 days.

452
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,150
The college entrance exam will be over in 99 days."

453
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:30,660
Look at these guys, dating instead of studying.

454
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,310
You're right.

455
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:38,560
"I hope we get into the same school. I love you."

456
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,520
Since they sold the book, they must
not have gone to the same school.

457
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:47,670
How cute.

458
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,760
Cute?

459
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,210
Yes.

460
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,510
We're almost touching.

461
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,400
I know.

462
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,790
What are you guys doing?

463
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,350
Aigoo...

464
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:14,690
I left my phone behind.

465
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:21,570
I'm going to buy these books.

466
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:32,740
I mean, it took her a bunch of trips
to the flower shop to buy anything.

467
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,770
I'm seeing her differently now.

468
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,890
How did you see her?

469
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,440
Never mind.

470
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:45,380
The first meeting went smoothly,
so I didn't think there would be issues.

471
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,510
Nam Jun Ho's wife is too much.

472
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:55,950
There aren't that many female
managers in this field.

473
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,210
We're not the only ones who want Nam Jun Ho.

474
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:00,220
Let's decide quickly.

475
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,440
I hate being a CEO in moments like this.

476
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,630
At the end of the day, I make the
call that makes me money.

477
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,560
Hey! Wait for me!

478
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,850
Hurry up!

479
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,670
Do you want to ride bikes?

480
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,510
What?

481
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:26,390
No, I don't know how to ride one.

482
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:32,550
There's something on your face.

483
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,250
Where? Here?

484
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:37,920
No. Lower your head a bit.

485
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,560
There's nothing on my face. What are you doing?

486
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,170
Kiss.

487
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,990
- What?
- I have a plan.

488
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,580
I'm going for it.

489
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,180
Is this what you meant by getting through to me?

490
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,340
I don't know. I need to try to know.

491
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,860
Seriously?

492
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,380
Why are you laughing?

493
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,770
You're being funny.

494
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,880
- I'm funny?
- Yes!

495
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,100
Am I just funny?

496
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:24,630
 ♫ When I revisit a day I kept in my heart ♫ 

497
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,300
Sung Je Yeon.

498
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,730
What?

499
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,840
Want me to...

500
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,090
teach you how to ride a bike?

501
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,470
I...

502
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:54,880
want to enjoy this feeling I have.

503
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,620
It's been a long time. This kind of thing.

504
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:04,600
I don't know how much patience I have,

505
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,070
but there's one way to extend it.

506
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,510
Hang out with me.

507
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,240
I'm on vacation.

508
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,370
Even if you don't want to.

509
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,990
I want to.

510
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:27,420
Hey, hey, we're on the rooftop!

511
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,880
Hey, why are you...

512
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,140
Hey!

513
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,340
I think it was a cliff!

514
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:38,830
I'm sorry! I just wanted to try that once.

515
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,850
Do this.

516
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,890
I always wondered why people take these photos.

517
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,960
- But it's nice.
- See?

518
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,100
Look at your face here.

519
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,390
So funny.

520
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:01,190
- Hey, you're going again?
- Yeah.

521
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:03,140
- Wait a second.
- Okay.

522
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,060
Hello?

523
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:14,260
Oh, hello. By chance, could I get it next time?

524
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,230
Or, could you leave it at the door?

525
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,500
Is that so?

526
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:26,100
Okay, I'll be right there. Okay.

527
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,890
Try this on.

528
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:33,740
I have to go right now.

529
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,640
- Right now?
- Well...

530
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,650
the credit card I ordered is
being delivered right now.

531
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,850
Just tell them to leave it.

532
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,030
I have to sign for it.

533
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:46,080
Sorry.

534
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,210
- I'll leave, then.
- Okay.

535
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,670
See you later.

536
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,500
This was fun.

537
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,460
Same.

538
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,650
Bye.

539
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,890
- Bye.
- Okay.

540
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:01,470
- Get home safe.
- Okay.

541
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,040
 

542
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:59,510
It's raining!

543
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,460
How strange.

544
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,640
It just came on!

545
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,940
Why did the lights come on when I walked in?

546
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,790
Is it a motion sensor?

547
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:44,300
Are the flowers okay?

548
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,980
It was just half a day, so I think we're good.

549
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,400
They were hydrated, too.

550
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,590
It's cool that this is a refrigerator.

551
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:54,520
Some shops don't have one.

552
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,920
I bought this one because it has one.

553
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,030
Why are you here again?

554
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,000
Here.

555
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,640
To give you the photos.

556
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,830
What?

557
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,960
I had both of them.

558
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,120
What a strange day.

559
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,330
I find out about my sister's secret skill,

560
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:22,090
the power goes out in my shop,

561
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:25,700
and someone shows up at the used bookstore.

562
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:29,700
I rode a bike for the first time in forever,
and it started raining suddenly.

563
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:35,000
And you are here again.

564
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:40,030
I don't know what comes next.

565
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:46,550
In the past and now, when I'm with you,

566
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:51,500
I don't really think about my sob story.

567
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,740
Hey, hey, hey.

568
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,890
What are you doing?

569
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,640
Just stay still.

570
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:07,200
I think we have the right mood.

571
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:13,330
What... What do you mean it's right?

572
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:17,660
I'm trying to say something serious.

573
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,480
Were you even listening?

574
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,660
I know.

575
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,920
I've only been thinking about this today.

576
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,240
Hey, Sung Je Yeon!

577
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,600
You're thinking way too much. Okay?

578
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,600
Think less.

579
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,860
You could have...

580
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,390
turned away.

581
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,280
I couldn't have.

582
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:09,400
Sung Je Yeon, you're really strong.

583
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:22,790
Can you teach me how to ride a bike this weekend?

584
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,470
Hello.

585
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:41,440
When my employees whined
about wanting a spot to rest,

586
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,970
I didn't get why we would need that.

587
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,610
But it's nice.

588
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:50,310
The person leading the charge was Bang Han Na.

589
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,090
Fearlessly.

590
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,540
How's work these days?

591
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:58,330
I've been reflecting on things plenty.

592
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,840
Whatever you give me, I'll work hard at it.

593
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,830
Tae Rin is gone.

594
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:05,600
You don't have an assigned actor.

595
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,210
You feel a little adrift, don't you?

596
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,300
I have good news and bad news.

597
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,200
The good news is that we're
signing with Nam Jun Ho.

598
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,580
That's great!

599
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,910
You've wanted him for a long time.

600
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,980
The bad news is...

601
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,460
You have to quit being a manager.

602
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:30,900
M-Me?

603
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,800
- But why?
- Nam Jun Ho's wife doesn't like you.

604
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,980
- I don't know why.
- Do you think that's reasonable?

605
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,640
I don't think it's reasonable.

606
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,480
But I need to pick the more important thing.

607
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,060
The company needs Nam Jun Ho.

608
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,750
I'll move you to another department.

609
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,620
If you're not a manager, it's not a problem.

610
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,670
If I weren't a manager,

611
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:54,200
how could I not be a problem?

612
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,000
That would be the biggest problem for me.

613
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,900
I've worked in this field at this one company...

614
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,100
for six years. Six years.

615
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:13,050
While others switched jobs several
times, got raises, and promotions,

616
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:15,510
I devoted myself to this place.

617
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,290
Because of you, CEO.

618
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:22,930
It doesn't feel good to push out one
of my own because of his antics.

619
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:26,410
I've been grateful to you for a lot all this time.

620
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,160
But I don't know about today.

621
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,050
I'll request a vacation.

622
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,530
This is so shitty.

623
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:59,730
I've been running the numbers...

624
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:02,570
waiting for my pension.

625
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:09,300
I'll have to commute on public transit now.

626
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:17,550
This is a company car.

627
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:31,390
What about my place?

628
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:35,370
I'm going to have to live on the streets.

629
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:39,870
What about my rent?

630
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:47,410
I have nothing to my name.

631
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,130
 It might rain tomorrow. 

632
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:17,620
 We might not be able to ride bikes. 

633
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:20,050
 If it rains, let's do something else. 

634
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,980
What are you doing?

635
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:34,040
Hey. I'm working. What's up?

636
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,380
 I miss you. 

637
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,630
Okay.

638
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:49,250
I mean, we're seeing each other tomorrow.

639
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,860
Is something going on?

640
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,050
No, nothing.

641
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:57,290
I guess I just wanted to hear your voice.

642
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,410
- Want me to come over?
 - No. 

643
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:04,380
I heard your voice, so I'm good.

644
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:06,580
 You have a customer. 

645
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:07,830
Welcome. One second.

646
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:09,820
 Bye. 

647
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,970
Goodness.

648
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:22,160
How is Nu Ri doing?

649
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:33,690
Sunwoo Chan told me you're raising her.

650
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,160
Is that true?

651
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,700
Did he tell you to come here?

652
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,640
I saw you on TV.

653
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,930
When we lived together, he always
bragged about his son.

654
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,330
As soon as I saw you, I remembered.

655
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:48,140
He always asked for paperwork when he needed it,

656
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:51,260
but he wouldn't talk when I asked about my child.

657
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:54,950
If it weren't for the show,
I wouldn't have found you.

658
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:59,890
I thought he had abandoned her
and was putting on a show with me.

659
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:03,590
I think you both abandoned her.

660
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:06,880
I'm just getting back on my feet now.

661
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,530
Back then, I really had nothing.

662
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:15,300
Having a nice shop and all,
you wouldn't know what that's like.

663
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:19,300
A father's love... a mother's love...

664
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,780
I guess those feelings come back
when you have money.

665
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:27,420
You're young, but you must've been through a lot.

666
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:31,810
I'm not here to ask for my child back.

667
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:35,120
I know it's shameless, but I want to see her.

668
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,480
I'd like to see her occasionally
and get to know her.

669
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,470
That's all I need.

670
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,500
Please, I ask you.

671
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,960
I'm sorry.

672
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:54,760
Thank you for not being too late.

673
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,070
I'll let Nu Ri know.

674
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:01,490
Thank you.

675
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,380
 

676
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:19,220
I see...

677
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:22,150
The kiss worked.

678
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,160
Hey, what's up?

679
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,360
 Look outside. 

680
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:35,030
 The moon is out. Look at the moon. 

681
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:38,900
The moon is out every night.
What's so special about it?

682
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:57,770
Wow, it's nice.

683
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:04,890
 Nice, right? 

684
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:07,160
Yes.

685
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,810
Excuse me.

686
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:12,510
Stop looking at the moon.

687
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:15,310
Look down, too.

688
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,600
What?

689
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,820
Why are you here?

690
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,320
You said you missed me.

691
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,920
Want to come down?

692
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,610
No.

693
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,960
I'll just watch you from here.

694
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:35,000
I can see you clearly from here
because your face is big.

695
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,100
Not as big as yours.

696
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:42,030
What did you come here for? To start a fight?

697
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:44,760
Are we going to keep talking like this?

698
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,070
You have no idea what I'll say.

699
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:57,930
I had a really hard day today.

700
00:47:57,930 --> 00:47:59,260
Why?

701
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,750
Who was it? Huh?

702
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:05,390
What is it? Tell me.

703
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:08,640
Just work.

704
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,650
 But seeing you... 

705
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:16,130
makes me want to run over
and dance under the moon.

706
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,450
But I can't.

707
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,570
I must be getting older.

708
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:27,020
If I were nineteen? I'd run out immediately.

709
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,960
Today must've been hard.

710
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,190
 Got it. Get some rest. 

711
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,880
That day...

712
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,920
I told my mom she would have liked you.

713
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:08,500
Bye.

714
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,090
Good night.

715
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:15,860
Right, I'm on vacation.

716
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:17,770
Sung Je Yeon.

717
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:21,270
I won't be a burden.

718
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:29,230
Sung Je Yeon, what do you think
of a guy with an illness?

719
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,400
I'm a little sick.

720
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,000
Seriously...

721
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:40,450
Hurry up.

722
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:52,960
 The customer can't answer the call right now. 

723
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,090
 The phone is turned off.
You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

724
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:26,520
 After the beep, there will be a charge. 

725
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:53,760
Are you awake?

726
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,130
- Hyung...
- We're in the hospital.

727
00:52:56,130 --> 00:52:59,190
When I got there after you called,
you were passed out.

728
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,670
I'm screwed.

729
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:03,980
Why? Does it hurt? Hae!

730
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,970
Don't close your eyes.
You can't cross to the other side!

731
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:08,130
It hurts, Hyung.

732
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:10,100
Sorry. I'm sorry.

733
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:13,680
My phone...

734
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,200
Hey, hey! No!

735
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,460
Can you take out this IV?

736
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:21,880
Hey, I'm too scared to take it out.

737
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,950
The medicine is still working. Just hold on.

738
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:27,640
Hyung, you have Sung Je Yeon's number, right?

739
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,710
- For being my agent.
- Yeah.

740
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:32,910
I didn't save it, but let me look in my call history.

741
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:35,180
I have to go...

742
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:41,850
I have to go...

743
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:06,040
Seriously?

744
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:10,710
You're going to do this to me, too?

745
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:22,800
Sung Je Yeon.

746
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,010
Hey.

747
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:30,140
How long have you been here?

748
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:38,940
Hey, why are your hands so cold?

749
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:42,370
Let's... Let's go inside.

750
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:48,520
Je-

751
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,280
Hey, wait.

752
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,710
Wait. Wait a minute.

753
00:54:56,590 --> 00:55:00,430
Something happened to me today.

754
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:03,520
I tried to get in touch with you,

755
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:07,690
but I left my phone at home, so...

756
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,140
I...

757
00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:18,080
must like you a lot.

758
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:22,220
Now that I see your face,

759
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:27,380
I'm relieved.

760
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,960
I was so scared.

761
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:36,140
I had all kinds of thoughts.

762
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:38,720
Is he sick?

763
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,210
Did he get into an accident?

764
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:46,740
I was scared to death the whole day!

765
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:51,700
And why don't you have an umbrella?

766
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,560
I'm sorry.

767
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,750
I'm... I'm sorry.

768
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:11,630
Promise me this will never happen again.

769
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:20,710
What if...

770
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:27,280
What if I can't promise?

771
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,300
What?

772
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,850
If something like this happens again...

773
00:56:57,810 --> 00:56:59,480
no matter...

774
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:03,060
how I end up going,

775
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,800
the end is going to be like this.

776
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:14,720
 ♫ Can we go back? ♫ 

777
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:21,610
 ♫ Everything was clumsy ♫ 

778
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:22,680
What?

779
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:24,960
We should stop seeing each other.

780
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,590
Why are you saying that?

781
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:36,660
 ♫ If I could go back ♫ 

782
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:40,400
I...

783
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,600
think I knew.

784
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:49,780
I knew, but I think I wanted to

785
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,710
believe that there was a reason

786
00:57:56,870 --> 00:57:58,990
you hesitated.

787
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:04,800
When this is all I am...

788
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,350
to you.

789
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,120
Okay.

790
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:17,530
Let's stop here.

791
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:30,730
 ♫ We flow through time ♫ 

792
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:52,090
 ♫ Because of you, I can breathe ♫ 

793
00:58:56,250 --> 00:59:02,540
 ♫ When I go back to my shadow ♫ 

794
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:10,450
 ♫ Greet me again as your shining self ♫ 

795
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,370
Give me a break.

796
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:17,760
 ♫ That brilliant season ♫ 

797
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:27,850
 ♫ I would never leave you ♫ 

798
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:36,640
 ♫ Into eternity ♫ 

799
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:07,620
Hyung.

800
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:09,620
 Hae, where are you? 

801
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:13,350
I can't come to work today. Sorry.

802
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:15,790
What are you sorry for? Don't worry about it.

803
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:18,620
Let's go to the hospital.
You passed out yesterday.

804
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:20,090
Maybe you're getting worse.

805
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:23,120
Maybe I'm getting worse.

806
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:27,140
I'm sorry.

807
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,540
Why does she carry this around?
 

808
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:32,590
"So, why are you looking?

809
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:35,800
Want to get in the vase instead of the roses?

810
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,830
And turn all red?"

811
01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:42,430
Why does this sound like flirting?

812
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:45,100
Am I crazy?

813
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,800
If I leave now, will you spare me?

814
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,620
No.

815
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:52,580
So, you won't.

816
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:00,360
What you threw away last time.

817
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:03,230
I didn't bring your handkerchief, though.

818
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:05,580
I told you to keep it.

819
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:08,130
Isn't she going to buy chairs?

820
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:11,240
They were sent to her parents' place.

821
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:14,720
So, this is how everyone gets by.

822
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:26,110
Your bank statements, credit card statements,

823
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:27,800
a list of paperwork will be emailed today.

824
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:31,090
Today, I just need your bank
statements up to last month.

825
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:32,690
Okay.

826
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:35,650
But my authentication certificate
is on Je Yeon's laptop.

827
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:37,420
You have it stored there?

828
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,500
You must really trust your manager.

829
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:42,050
- We can get it reissued.
- Wait.

830
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:45,300
Let me call Je Yeon and ask her to bring it.

831
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:51,200
Hey, where are you? What's up?

832
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,020
- She really doesn't listen to me.
- Okay.

833
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:58,430
She has an important meeting. She had to go.

834
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:11,370
Last one.

835
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,820
 

836
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:35,420
Bye. I'm in an important meeting.

837
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:38,680
Team Leader, I heard you're
on a really long vacation.

838
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:41,450
Who am I supposed to ask questions
to without you here?

839
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:44,580
We're not managing any actors right now.

840
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:47,530
I've never taken a day off.

841
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:49,670
You have a problem with this?

842
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:52,000
I don't know.

843
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:54,870
I miss driving.

844
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:56,280
Give it to me.

845
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:59,950
Be honest. Are you quitting?

846
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:03,200
That's what it looks like.
Taking more than 10 days off?

847
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:06,580
 Is it because Dong Jun got
to work with Nam Jun Ho? 

848
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:12,380
Oh, that's what happened?

849
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:13,780
 

850
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:18,140
You have frequent transactions
at a certain stationery store.

851
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:20,100
What do you buy?

852
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:23,850
They're wasting time here, too.
I'm glad I'm an actress.

853
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:27,090
I said, what did you buy at this stationery store?

854
01:04:27,090 --> 01:04:29,100
A shovel?

855
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:32,000
Well, bubbles.

856
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,910
I blow bubbles when I feel like smoking.

857
01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:37,860
How nice. I do bubbles, too.

858
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:40,280
Which one? Bubble gun? Bubble machine?

859
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,950
No way.

860
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:45,180
You have to blow it yourself.

861
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:50,200
That's right. It's no fun to just press buttons.

862
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:51,460
So unromantic.

863
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:54,330
We are in complete agreement.

864
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:57,730
It only feels good when you make an effort.

865
01:04:58,550 --> 01:05:00,940
I don't think we can write that off, though.

866
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:03,910
How about your car? Is it leased? Your own?

867
01:05:03,910 --> 01:05:05,700
When do you have time?

868
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,400
- Let's blow bubbles together.
- I thought you didn't like me.

869
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,880
So what? There are bubbles I can't blow by myself.

870
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,000
Let's do it together. No ulterior motive.

871
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:25,450
You're so weird.

872
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:27,860
Do it with me, even if I'm weird.

873
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:30,650
I really want to try it.

874
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:35,140
I'll see how you do, Mo Tae Rin.

875
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:40,670
It's weird not to drink.

876
01:06:06,010 --> 01:06:08,230
Welcome.

877
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:10,250
I'm still angry.

878
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:14,320
When I lie down to sleep, all I see is your face.

879
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:18,270
It's frustrating. Maddening.

880
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:19,600
Have you been drinking?

881
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,690
Yes, I have.

882
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:25,260
That's all I have to do right now, okay?

883
01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:31,110
I thought I would seem so pathetic.

884
01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:33,850
I thought I shouldn't have.

885
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:37,180
I should've just kept it cool and ghosted.

886
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:40,140
I should've held back.

887
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:41,950
I should've held back one more time.

888
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:45,540
I'm so annoyed that this is what I think about!

889
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,870
Today is the end.

890
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:54,640
Today is the last day I'm a mess over you.

891
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,940
Then, I'll forget all about you.

892
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:02,240
I'm never, ever going to...

893
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:05,490
act like I know you again!

894
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:08,150
Okay.

895
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:18,380
What is it?

896
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,730
This isn't the person I know.

897
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:27,750
You weren't like this.

898
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:30,710
What did I do so wrong?

899
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:32,500
You didn't do anything wrong.

900
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,610
It's all because of me.

901
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:41,940
Let's go. I'll take you home.

902
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:44,100
Let go.

903
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,540
Hey, careful.

904
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:48,280
Don't touch me!

905
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:55,350
- Get up.
- Let go.

906
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:57,450
Let go! Let go of me.

907
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:59,500
Don't touch me.

908
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:04,210
Don't follow me.

909
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:12,860
 

910
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:27,780
I told you not to follow me.

911
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:29,620
You think I'm a joke?

912
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:36,800
When I saw you cry because of me that day...

913
01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:42,000
I realized you probably came angry

914
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:46,200
but I might not be there.

915
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,570
That worried me.

916
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:56,010
I don't want you to waste yourself on me.

917
01:08:56,010 --> 01:08:58,680
Hilarious.

918
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,320
Who are you worried about?

919
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:12,830
Je Yeon.

920
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,550
I'm...

921
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:24,360
sick.

922
01:09:37,650 --> 01:09:40,050
It feels real now.

923
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:48,150
 ♫ Come closer ♫ 

924
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:55,120
 ♫ The red sunset ♫ 

925
01:09:55,120 --> 01:10:01,960
 ♫ Night and day meet briefly ♫ 

926
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:08,440
 ♫ Like us from back then ♫ 

927
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:15,960
 ♫ Like falling into it ♫ 

928
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:25,180
 ♫ Pretending not to know and embrace ♫ 

929
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:32,110
 ♫ It's like love that gets pushed away ♫ 

930
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:39,020
 ♫ Like the longing that comes back ♫ 

931
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:45,020
 ♫ Like the horizon where day and night meet ♫
