1
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,740
 

2
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:03,050
 It would be a lie if I said
I never thought about you. 

3
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:06,200
 It's actually the opposite. 

4
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,330
 Like a tape that's stretched out
from playing too much, 

5
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,140
 I used to replay you over and over again. 

6
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:23,190
 You transported me right back to that time,
the moment we met again. 

7
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,810
 As if you're making fun of me for that. 

8
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,770
 To back then, when there were
no reference points, 

9
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,000
 no matter what page I opened to. 

10
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:47,640
 ♫ I worried about becoming a grown-up,
which seems so real now ♫ 

11
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:58,000
It wasn't that dark, thanks to you.

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,910
 ♫ Walking side by side in lockstep
with you on this street ♫ 

13
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,950
 Team Leader Sung Je Yeon, next script. 

14
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,790
It's a historic fantasy romance drama.

15
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:14,150
It's Director Han Seok Won's first OTT drama.

16
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,330
The motif is "The Fairy and the Woodcutter."

17
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,320
The main character is a seamstress in the palace.

18
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,850
The male lead is a woodcutter who steals

19
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,130
her entry to the stitching
competition at the palace...

20
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,670
He's basically a thief.

21
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,880
The woodcutter is a thief in the
original folklore, too.

22
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,320
Who are we considering for the male lead again?

23
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,700
His name is Pyo Mun Su.

24
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,710
He's a top model, and this would
be his first try at acting.

25
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,030
Trying, how beautiful.

26
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,670
Tell him best of luck. Next!

27
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,980
This one is produced by our company.

28
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,790
You know the folktale "I Won't Eat You
If You Give Me a Rice Cake," right?

29
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,970
The setting is really fun.

30
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,410
The sun and the moon characters in a space opera.

31
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:52,700
But doesn't it sound too far-fetched?

32
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,610
What a pig.

33
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,690
He's a pig, not a tiger.

34
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,900
Isn't he in a time loop because
he wants to eat more rice cakes?

35
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,800
- How many does he want?
- Must've been tasty.

36
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,480
Go in for a day and straighten out
the rice cake matters.

37
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,390
Bring Hye Yeong in and
get this read within the day.

38
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,440
Give the soap opera to Tae Rin.

39
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,920
Ma'am, that starts filming in a month

40
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,080
and she's still filming her current show.

41
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,170
Don't you think Ms. Mo needs a break
after her current show?

42
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,080
This is her third mini-series as an adult.

43
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,370
She needs to settle on her image.

44
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,330
Did you two scheme about this?

45
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,870
Well, we're not that close.

46
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,360
Excuse me, ma'am. I hope you didn't misunderstand.

47
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,190
Tae Rin did lots of historical dramas,
and this would be her first modern.

48
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,120
I wanted her image away from historical dramas...

49
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,600
Was that your lover?

50
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,890
The man with the shirt you ripped
in front of the office yesterday.

51
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,420
Well...

52
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,340
I'm sorry for causing a scene
in front of the office.

53
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,540
Was I getting too nosy?

54
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,300
I thought we were close enough, Je Yeon.

55
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,180
That person from yesterday.
His name is Sunwoo Hae.

56
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,100
Do you remember by chance?

57
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,050
Oh, what was it?

58
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,130
Beat? Bebop? That kid.

59
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,320
You remember, of course.

60
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,340
Tae Rin and I are his classmates.

61
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,530
Plus, So Rah asked me for a favor.

62
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,130
PD Jin So Rah, with whom I went to college.

63
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,180
He won an award with his debut pilot. I know.

64
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,690
Yes, I'm thinking of revisiting
the two-part docuseries

65
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,750
that fell apart last year.

66
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,750
It would be a minimal shoot,

67
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,560
and a non-sensational,
organic program like this is rare.

68
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,880
You love ethical work like that, Team Leader Sung.

69
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,850
- Submit a proposal.
- Thank you.

70
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,230
I'm glad...

71
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,030
Sunbae, I'm so sorry, but...

72
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,300
Your calling me "sunbae" reminds
me of the olden days...

73
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,340
Lately, you've only been calling me "sir."

74
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,740
You're the same as always.

75
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,740
Are you done?

76
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,180
- Yeah.
- Want to take a break?

77
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,290
- Sounds good.
- Sure.

78
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,230
Well, you know Writer Ahn So Jin, right?

79
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,840
Everything she writes receives
over 30% of the viewership.

80
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,400
"My Annoying as Hell Daughter"

81
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,650
The title is annoying as hell.
People still use that phrase?

82
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,140
What slightly bothers me is that
it's scheduled to shoot in a month.

83
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,990
It's a 50-part series,
so it'll be physically exhausting.

84
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,500
You said you don't want to live
in the Joseon Dynasty anymore.

85
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,200
This is based on the 2020s.

86
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,260
This is a pattern with the kinds of scripts I get.

87
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,040
In just one month...

88
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,830
How many people have already turned it down?

89
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,980
If you're up for it, I think it might be better

90
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,860
to do the two-part docuseries,
instead of this one.

91
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,530
The documentary with Sunwoo Hae.

92
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,180
It doesn't work without you.

93
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,200
Doesn't work without me?

94
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,500
It was scrapped when they couldn't find
Sunwoo Hae. But now, it's back with him.

95
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,620
Tae Rin.

96
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,610
Hey, Tae Rin.

97
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,030
Where are you going alone?

98
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,900
To buy bubbles.

99
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,780
I saw some at the stationery store near here.

100
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,470
If you're talking about cigarettes,
I got some for you.

101
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,150
Why do I want to blow bubbles right now?

102
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,570
I know you're worried they'll
label you as a child actor.

103
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,960
"She was better as a child actor."

104
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,800
It's the perfect show for them
to pigeonhole me as a child actor.

105
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,500
It makes me vomit when they call me
a child actor even at this age.

106
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,110
And I should go down memory lane
with the fellow actor from back then?

107
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,580
That's quite punishing.

108
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,010
Your past is also part of you.

109
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,820
I think Mo Tae Rin has always
been cool, back then and now.

110
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,490
What?

111
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,800
You're not usually that sentimental.

112
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,100
- Did you get struck by lightning or something?
- Should I get struck now?

113
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,550
You almost got me with your adorable antics.

114
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,960
I don't know if I can be myself.

115
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,370
Don't be so rigid. Why not mix things around?

116
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,920
There's a script, after all.

117
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,470
Just mix in a little MSG.

118
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,370
What would you like to mix in?

119
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,160
Something wise and smart?

120
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,680
Love it.

121
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,560
You can be whatever you want.

122
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,260
What happened to Sunwoo Hae?

123
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,310
I thought he didn't want to do it.

124
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,650
Not sure. Must've changed his mind.

125
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,650
He said he wants to be rich.

126
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,640
Are you feeling better?

127
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,520
Want me to leave you alone?

128
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,480
Come with me.

129
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:39,510
What's your price range?

130
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,740
It'll be around 70,000 won to make it full,
based on what you picked out.

131
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,410
Cap it at 50,000 won.

132
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,350
I don't want to spend more money on that bast-

133
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,150
on that man.

134
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,010
I'll make sure it looks ample.

135
00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:00,300
But he invited you to his
solo exhibit after you broke up.

136
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,080
Was he asking this question? "A new beginning."

137
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,940
I don't want a new beginning with him.

138
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,500
Okay.

139
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,950
"Impossible."

140
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,800
I'll put something together
at 50,000 won with this.

141
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,750
What a snake oil salesman he's become.

142
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,400
What's this? It's so cute.

143
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,900
I hope the gift works out.

144
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,110
See you next time.

145
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,900
Thank you.

146
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,610
You're a good salesman.

147
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,900
What?

148
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,710
You look pretty today.

149
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:04,050
I'm here to check on something,
and I almost forgot it all.

150
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,730
Is it so shocking that you're pretty?

151
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,370
- You know how to keep moving forward.
- Huh?

152
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,330
Knowing all the meanings of the flowers...

153
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,390
The history and origins of the flowers
were in a book I read over and over.

154
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,180
You never studied that hard.

155
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,280
Why do people buy flowers?

156
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,670
Hey, hey. That's too harsh.

157
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:27,860
Why wouldn't they?

158
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,840
Sure, people buy. For someone.

159
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,700
Tae Rin has many people to
congratulate for their performances.

160
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,770
Blue roses aren't natural blooms,

161
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,240
so they symbolize impossibility.

162
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,590
After successful genetic engineering,
the meaning changed.

163
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,000
What's the new meaning?

164
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,500
- Want to buy some if you're curious?
- What for?

165
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,010
Think about that after you buy them.

166
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,840
I was such a salesman just now, huh?

167
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,780
Who do you think associated
all that meaning with flowers?

168
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,900
- Salesmen, I'm sure.
- Yeah.

169
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:09,200
For whose sake? For the flower shop owner's sake.

170
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,900
Anyway, about the shoot.

171
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,070
Let's just say we're high school
classmates. Keep the story straight.

172
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,900
Why don't I say we're classmates who kissed?

173
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,300
Hey, you!

174
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,400
Hey, hey. That's not technically true.

175
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,080
It's not true, but I won't
let you off if you say that.

176
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,570
You pick the meeting date. Any date.

177
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,500
I decided to get along with you
until the shoot ends.

178
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,860
- Don't push my buttons.
- Let's see how you do.

179
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,990
I bet you'll be overcome with respect for me.

180
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,010
Look at you.

181
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,120
Sure, stare at me.

182
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,710
I will.

183
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,840
I'm leaving.

184
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,380
Bye.

185
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,300
Welcome.

186
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,220
Are you here to buy flowers?

187
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,190
Oh, yes. I'd like to look around. I have company.

188
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,090
Yes, take your time.

189
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,560
By chance, are you a PD?

190
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,940
Pardon? Yes. Pardon?

191
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,000
Hi. Oh, you're here.

192
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,760
Sung Je Yeon, where is he? I said where is he?

193
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,700
If this was a false lead, I won't let you off easy.

194
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,170
- You know why? I stayed up all night last night.
- Wait, Sunbae...

195
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,450
Over there, over there, over there.
There's Sunwoo Hae.

196
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,130
Over there. There.

197
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,560
I did say any date, and you really
went ahead right away.

198
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,340
Hello, I'm Sunwoo Hae.

199
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,600
What? What happened-

200
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,660
I'm Jin So Rah.

201
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,840
I had no idea I'd get to meet you. Whoa...

202
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,700
You got so tall. So tall...

203
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,070
Bebop this little grew so much...

204
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:31,680
I loved Beat and Bebop.

205
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,940
You had no idea I'd grow up like this, right?

206
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,760
Anyway, thank you for coming for me.

207
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,770
I'm more grateful. I'm grateful. I am!

208
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,710
Gosh, my goodness!

209
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,950
I'll put my current project on hold
and have to edit this item.

210
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,370
Because this is such an important project for me,

211
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,990
you can't change your mind, okay?

212
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,900
You just have to make sure
I won't want to do that.

213
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,550
Yes. I stepped out briefly, so...

214
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:04,510
- Je Yeon will contact you if there's any issue.
- Yes.

215
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,245
See you soon.

216
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,290
- Leaving?
- Yup.

217
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,980
Wait for me.

218
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,420
Let's do this.

219
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,140
Hey. Hey, Sung Je Yeon.

220
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,520
She comes and goes as she pleases.

221
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,420
All over the place.

222
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,150
You asked for me?

223
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:41,030
Hi. You double-booked, Mom.

224
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,870
I'm a bit early.

225
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,240
Should I step out?

226
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,000
I saw your report.

227
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,740
Only Yu Jae Il's project is missing.

228
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,690
I'm adjusting our meeting date.

229
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,740
And the "My Annoying as Hell Daughter" shoot dates

230
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,720
are too physically demanding for the talent.

231
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,330
It's Tae Rin's first documentary.

232
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,390
Must we share its viral potential
with a regular person?

233
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:04,490
Why do I feel like people will mention
Sunwoo Hae more once it airs?

234
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,700
Sunwoo Hae disappeared after 13.

235
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,660
He disappeared dramatically.

236
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,350
Thus, people are curious.

237
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:15,300
Sunwoo Hae is a regular person,
so we don't know what will happen.

238
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,870
I prioritized Tae Rin.

239
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:21,250
That'd benefit the company and you, CEO.

240
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,910
I wonder why he wants to come on air at that age.

241
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:28,350
I'm getting curious. Could it be money?

242
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:33,030
With your approval, I'll go around
with him and look after him.

243
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,490
Make sure he doesn't try to flirt with Tae Rin.

244
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,620
Or try to manipulate his way back
into the industry.

245
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,070
You brought him in, so you manage him completely.

246
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,820
Keep monitoring Sunwoo Hae during the shoot.

247
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,730
Yes, ma'am. I got it.

248
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,610
Why did you always hate Hyung?

249
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:00,280
Me? When? Just now?

250
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,750
Why would I hate him?

251
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,430
If it's a good program, he can just do it.

252
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,720
Why you hate him isn't important.

253
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,770
True.

254
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,230
So insightful.

255
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,880
This is how it's rearing its head.
Sticking out like a sore thumb.

256
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,460
I'm so sick and tired of it.

257
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,630
 He doesn't look as good as he does on TV. 

258
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,400
Hey, what do we do? He's not crying at all.

259
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,230
I know. He has to cry so
I can use the dramatic clip.

260
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:12,180
Wait, wait. Excuse me. Coming through.

261
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,840
Take it. Take it!

262
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:33,100
You have to repay! Pay back the money!

263
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:38,260
Isn't Sunwoo Hae's story
so ripe for tearing apart?

264
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,420
The story of the scam hit the headlines.

265
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,620
His mom even committed suicide because of that.

266
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,930
So?

267
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,860
What are you worried about?

268
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,790
I'm just saying.

269
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,370
I think it's a great program,
and I don't want it to get tarnished.

270
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,500
Mom, you sound like you're talking
about 13-year-old Sunwoo Hae.

271
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,850
I see you sympathize with him.

272
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,730
I am?

273
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,390
Why would I sympathize with him?

274
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,210
In my view, it's a good thing if you
only consider your actress.

275
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:19,370
The viewers will say Mo Tae Rin
grew up so nicely, thanks to Sunwoo Hae.

276
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,700
You didn't think about that just now.

277
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,750
It feels like you've gone back in time.

278
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,970
That documentary will be a success.

279
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,930
I'll get going. I have to get back to my office.

280
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,480
 Art Director! 

281
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,580
Excuse me.

282
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,570
PD, you mentioned today is the meet-and-greet...

283
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,020
But there are all these cameras and crew.

284
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,540
To save time and kill two birds with one stone.

285
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,900
We can just do a test shoot as well.

286
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,240
Hello.

287
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,190
I'm Writer Jung Ji Hye.

288
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,270
Hello.

289
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,650
- And our junior writer.
- Hello.

290
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,210
You saw our proposal, right?

291
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,900
Yes. But I didn't really understand it.

292
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:18,200
The nature of broadcasting is that
you never know till the moment it airs.

293
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,960
Go inside and film. Are you waiting for tomorrow?

294
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,630
Excuse us.

295
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,320
What are you making?

296
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,060
I'm working on blooming.

297
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,970
Just lightly since you said it's a test.

298
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,250
Sunbaenim, Mo Tae Rin is here.

299
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,460
Okay. Go and say hi.

300
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,920
- Hello, hello.
- Hello.

301
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,070
- Hello.
- Hello.

302
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,620
Hello. Hello.

303
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,400
Hi.

304
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,020
Hello.

305
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,820
Hey.

306
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,470
You have to say hi to him.

307
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,840
You used to be the nation's favorite siblings.

308
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,920
Here's the nation's favorite sister, Mo Tae Rin.

309
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,040
And this is the nation's
favorite brother, Sunwoo Hae.

310
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,150
Your names were Beat and Bebop, right?

311
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,170
What? That Bebop oppa?

312
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,070
What happened to him?

313
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,910
What does that mean, exactly?

314
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,780
I meant that I didn't recognize you
because you've grown so much.

315
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,940
Then, that's what you should've said.

316
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,940
Your personality hasn't changed.

317
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,330
What?

318
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,090
Hi, Bebop.

319
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,360
Talking casually to me?

320
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,110
Hi, Beat.

321
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,440
What the heck?

322
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,070
What I saw on TV as a kid is unfolding
before my very eyes...

323
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,850
I knew it.

324
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,180
I'm... I'm so moved...

325
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,100
Is this a fake flower?

326
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,840
I dyed a live flower in a preservative,
so it doesn't wither.

327
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,880
Is that why it's expensive? It has labor cost?

328
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,430
It can't be cheap if
I'm stopping it from withering.

329
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,580
Sunbae, I-

330
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:16,470
You scare me sometimes.

331
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,720
I thought you might be thirsty.

332
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:39,550
By chance, do any of your customers recognize you?

333
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,220
I could recognize you right away.

334
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,300
But you didn't.

335
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,020
Should we give it a go before the first shoot?

336
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,220
- Can I ask you for a favor?
- What?

337
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,960
Just pretend you're a customer.

338
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,410
And shyly acknowledge him.

339
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:01,540
Check him out, and act like he might be familiar.

340
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:06,360
I can't bring myself to be shy in front of him.

341
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,420
Why don't you try?

342
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,290
I'll go with it.

343
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:19,100
Oh, Bebop.

344
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,580
Oh, wait. Be-

345
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,400
Sorry, let me try again.

346
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,730
Yes, Bebop, right?

347
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,210
Oh, Bebop, right?

348
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,040
She makes me not want to admit that I am.

349
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,400
I'll try it again, but better.

350
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,300
Wait, aren't you the child actor Sunwoo Hae?

351
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,880
You knew that when you came.

352
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,220
Oh, my goodness!

353
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,020
Gosh, right. You're him.

354
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,400
The youngest winner
of the Best Actor award. Oh, my!

355
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,650
Gosh, slap on "my goodness,"
and it means you're shy?

356
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,400
You said you'll go with it. How come you're not?

357
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,280
That's not so easy to do.

358
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,400
Don't you feel it's right
for Tae Rin to be seen first?

359
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,010
No...

360
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:15,090
I must have a big head now.
I used to not complain at all.

361
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,720
Let me try once again.

362
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,930
No.

363
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,070
We'd better take it out.

364
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,480
How insulting.

365
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,380
One, two, three.

366
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,910
Cue!

367
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,430
Rip that open, and pour it here.

368
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,300
Got it. Pour.

369
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,580
There you go.

370
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,550
Just mix.

371
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,300
There. Doing great.

372
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,680
Of course. I can handle this.

373
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,150
- Keep mixing.
- Okay.

374
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,920
Pull this out,

375
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,970
and just pull...

376
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,550
Then, mix.

377
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,040
Okay.

378
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,780
 Sunwoo Hae. 

379
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,840
 Hey, Sunwoo Hae. 

380
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,620
Are you okay?

381
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,230
I'm okay.

382
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,010
Good.

383
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,240
Don't look at the camera straight

384
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,050
and try to look off to the side.

385
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,450
Okay.

386
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,600
Thank you!

387
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,390
Goodbye.

388
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,740
When you have time, try to hang out.

389
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,510
That'll lead to better content.

390
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:04,350
I'm sure lots of people miss seeing
Beat and Bebop bicker.

391
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,750
Should we head to Geon No's like last time?

392
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:15,080
We have a night scene to tape,
so we're off to the set.

393
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,420
Why don't we drop him off on the way, at least?

394
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,270
You're okay with that, right?

395
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,560
- Bye now.
- Bye. Thank you!

396
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,740
- Great work.
- Thank you. Good work.

397
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,930
Good night.

398
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:39,140
Hey, Sunwoo Hae. You can't say
personal things like you did earlier.

399
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,090
You can't say "like we did last time."

400
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,870
Oh, I guess it was personal.

401
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:47,590
I thought it was both personal and professional.

402
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:51,210
I heard you were classmates.
I guess you were really close.

403
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,870
Stop it.

404
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,470
Were we?

405
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,480
I don't know. I don't remember.

406
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,830
What's the criteria for being close?

407
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,880
Don't know. You weren't from my perspective.

408
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,130
I asked Mo Tae Rin. You said you don't remember.

409
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,470
I don't remember. I don't.

410
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,030
Fine.

411
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,530
You know when I shoveled wrong

412
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,060
and got dirt all over me, didn't I look stupid?

413
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,690
Tae Rin, do you think it's easy
to look cute while doing that?

414
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,140
You were so lovely.

415
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:21,150
Let's be honest. You did look kind of stupid.

416
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:24,220
- Be quiet.
- Right, you were stupider.

417
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,640
Okay.

418
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,330
It's so weird.

419
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:31,130
How come I never ran into you at school?

420
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,450
I avoided you.

421
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,630
I didn't want to draw people's attention to us.

422
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,340
What the heck?

423
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,740
What?

424
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,400
Huh?

425
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,850
I'll buy a shovel.

426
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:49,370
I'll practice at home because
I want to do a good job.

427
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:51,570
What? Shoveling?

428
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,700
Can I cuss?

429
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,400
Go ahead.

430
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,300
- I'm really good at it.
- No, Tae Rin.

431
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,050
She said no.

432
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,140
Look at the kid cursing.

433
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,880
Hey, don't provoke her.

434
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,340
Go for it.

435
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:15,590
- Bye.
- Take care.

436
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,980
- Wait a moment.
- Okay.

437
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,490
Hey, Sunwoo Hae.

438
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:32,730
You had a panic attack earlier, huh?

439
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,300
I know a therapist. Do you want to try it?

440
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:41,320
I haven't been in front of a camera
for a long time. I guess I froze.

441
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,580
I'll watch out next time.

442
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:47,260
I heard that you had rejected
all the casting offers.

443
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,550
What made you change your mind?

444
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,350
What's with the interrogation?

445
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,810
You enticed me, saying it's a good program.

446
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,400
I'm leaving.

447
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:20,500
Why do you write your work log in my shop?

448
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:25,040
It felt like they wouldn't give me a ride
if I stayed behind to do this.

449
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,840
Gosh, I'm two days behind.

450
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,110
Hey, hurry up and write it.

451
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:36,300
Hyung, what do you think of a man with debt?

452
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,170
- Is he cute?
- Kind of.

453
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,670
- Is he young?
- He's past his prime.

454
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:42,260
A cute man with a debt who's past his prime...

455
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,020
Not my taste at all. What do you
want me to do about it?

456
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,980
I'm just self-evaluating.

457
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,110
What do you think?

458
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,790
You know that firefighter you came with last time?

459
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,410
She was your class president
from a long time ago, right?

460
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,800
What happened?

461
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,290
She showed up out of the blue.

462
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,980
She wasn't trying to sell you insurance,
MLM, a cult, or a jade mattress?

463
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,210
She had pure intentions?

464
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,210
Was it pure?

465
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:14,910
I don't think it really matters
what she had in mind.

466
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,600
She was nice to me when we were kids.

467
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,040
If it weren't for her, I would've really...

468
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,660
Who took care of you when you were
in high school? Me. It was me.

469
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,020
Welcome.

470
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,330
Hey, I'm talking to you.

471
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,800
Welcome.

472
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,390
Salad? Are you on a diet?

473
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,030
Yeah.

474
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:36,210
The director said, "Who would want
to protect a big woman?"

475
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,880
Hilarious.

476
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,180
Who's protecting whom?
It's about terminal illness...

477
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,110
Well, it is a romantic comedy.

478
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,870
Sunbae, you go eat with Oppa.

479
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,080
You're dieting along with me without meaning to.

480
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,010
But eat something heavy. Something serious.

481
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,060
So serious that it'll kill both of you.

482
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,800
Got it, calm down.

483
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,530
Je Yeon!

484
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:01,740
See me for a second.

485
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,940
Okay.

486
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,160
- Eat it, okay?
- Okay.

487
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,590
See you.

488
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,240
What does Sung Je Yeon like?

489
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:18,080
Sung Je Yeon likes me. Why?

490
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,620
Eat a lot.

491
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:26,710
There will be a press release
about the programming changes.

492
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,950
Ours is the main.

493
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,040
We need to hand them an overview.

494
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,600
I think Bebop's story will be featured for sure.

495
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,990
Then, you'll mention Tae Rin, too, right?

496
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,770
I'll request some materials from the PR Team.

497
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,280
Yeah, yeah.

498
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,260
Since you're close to Bebop, you get it from him.

499
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,760
- I'm not close to him.
- I'm sure you're closer to him than I am.

500
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,820
Hey, you know Bebop?

501
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,150
To be honest, I was a bit worried.

502
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:01,390
Because of his dark past,
I thought he'd be depressing.

503
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:11,160
I don't think I've ever thought of him that way.

504
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,060
Your high school classmate?
What was he like then?

505
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,200
He really speaks his mind now.

506
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,410
I love it. Doesn't seem to be holding a grudge.

507
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:22,670
I think he was similar back then as well.

508
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:25,530
Was he a bit cuter than he is now?

509
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,290
No. Not at all.

510
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,120
Not at all.

511
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,340
Is there a really good food place in this area?

512
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,370
I don't know.

513
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,430
Where are we going, then?

514
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:47,040
I thought you knew where you were going.

515
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:52,930
Let's just grab something quick and go back.

516
00:32:55,180 --> 00:33:00,110
What happened to the person
who wanted to get along?

517
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,380
Don't pretend like you don't know.

518
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,380
There's no way you don't know a good place here.

519
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,330
You pretended not to know me at first, too.

520
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:10,940
That's not what I'm-

521
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:28,450
Do you tend to hold a grudge?

522
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,280
I tend to hang onto things. Keep that in mind.

523
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,700
It's not that I pretended
not to know you at first.

524
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,380
I just missed the timing to say hi.

525
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:38,920
That's what pretending is.

526
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,300
So Rah says you surprise her.

527
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,910
You speak your mind and don't hold a grudge.

528
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,530
Bullshit.

529
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:52,030
Was I resentful as a child?

530
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,380
I felt like I was acting even
when the camera wasn't around.

531
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,340
To impress grownups,

532
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:02,100
I had to walk on eggshells and think fast.

533
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,010
After I quit,

534
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:08,050
I wanted to speak my mind.

535
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:16,060
Why are you looking at me like that?

536
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,730
How did I look at you?

537
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:22,040
"Can't believe you say that as
an adult. How pathetic..."

538
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,170
Something like that.

539
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:25,680
At least, you know.

540
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:31,400
The PD is preparing a press release
and needs to include news about you.

541
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,630
News since when?

542
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,670
Since the setting is a flower shop,

543
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:39,410
how about after you've become an adult?

544
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,600
You published your book at 20, right?

545
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,640
You didn't continue to write.

546
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,320
Should I include that or not?

547
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,670
- Leave it out.
- Why?

548
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,940
It's cooler than "I just became
a flower shop owner."

549
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:56,850
Writing a novel surrounded by flowers.

550
00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:00,360
Gosh, I'm embarrassed just by listening to you.

551
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,970
Sounds like I'm crazy.

552
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,360
So funny.

553
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,470
Funny?

554
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,280
No, it's not funny.

555
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,200
Not funny at all.

556
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:24,220
This day will never come.

557
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:28,470
But I'm so happy that we're together.

558
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,540
His chewing noise is too loud. What do we do?

559
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,770
It's an emotional scene.

560
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:36,110
How can I tell him that?

561
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:47,180
Wow, she's getting into the emotion
even while hearing that.

562
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,590
You know...

563
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:54,460
I can't stand it, Sunbae.

564
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,420
I'm really sorry, but...

565
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,070
Reminds me of the old days
when you call me "Sunbae."

566
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:04,930
Can you please not chew so loudly?

567
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:11,480
- You don't make a noise when you swallow.
 - Tae Rin, please, no... 

568
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:15,280
Can't you just swallow without chewing?

569
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,590
Probably not. Don't you think?

570
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:26,120
Because you chew so loudly,

571
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,300
I can't get into the feelings.

572
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,610
Please. Can't you?

573
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,020
My apologies!

574
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,920
How did it go, Sunbae?

575
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,160
Is it serious?

576
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:16,620
I took care of it. Don't worry about it.

577
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,600
You should've told me that first.
Why tell the actor directly?

578
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:27,100
The terminally ill guy ate the last meal
I made for him with such gusto.

579
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:33,170
- Like this.
- He considered the effort of the cook.

580
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:37,290
I'm so hungry from dieting, all because of him.

581
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:44,010
Please. Let's only walk down flowery paths

582
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:47,680
and say flowery words, okay, Ms. Mo?

583
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,560
Don't cry.

584
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,820
I won't cry anymore.

585
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,820
- Really?
- Yeah.

586
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,210
Just getting into the feelings again?

587
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:56,470
No, it pisses me off.

588
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:58,370
You laughed.

589
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:02,800
 

590
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,810
So, you cried on the set?

591
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,990
At age 30?

592
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:10,300
You sobbed?

593
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,600
I didn't sob. I just got a bit teary.

594
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:20,280
Gosh, crying solved everything when I was little.

595
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,640
Separating work and life has been
such a chore since I was a kid.

596
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:28,000
A kid shouldn't have to separate work and life.

597
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,510
Their whole job was to greet people
nicely and have fun on set.

598
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:36,330
Seriously... Excuse me?

599
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:40,770
Your hair is a little messed up. Fix it.

600
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,470
Not there.

601
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,570
There. Your left.

602
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,600
Done.

603
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,140
You should've fixed it up from the beginning.

604
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,720
But I'm not your manager.

605
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,300
But I was really good at greeting people.

606
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:08,000
- Perhaps you were good at only that.
- No, I was "also" good at greeting.

607
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,350
- I don't think so.
- I am, too.

608
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,260
- No way.
- Yes way!

609
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,510
Excuse me.

610
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:16,050
That was nice. Can we go with that?

611
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:22,400
Today, you two will eat pork rind
and trotters and have some drinks.

612
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,040
And have a heart-to-heart talk.

613
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,740
It'd be good with the back-and-forth
banter like you just did.

614
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,450
What did you like about it?

615
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,340
Didn't I seem like a loser?

616
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,540
That was the cute part.

617
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,660
I think your usual self is pretty funny.

618
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:42,800
If you could show us sides of you
that could develop into characters,

619
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,500
I'll figure out the concept.

620
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:52,510
But due to my diet, I might have to only drink...

621
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,900
I think she's right. You're funny
because you seem like a loser.

622
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,550
- She didn't say it like that.
- She did.

623
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:04,710
Please scold this Oppa for me.

624
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,970
Oppa, you got in a lot of trouble as a kid, huh?

625
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,580
You obviously look like that.

626
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,580
They always asked me why I made you cry.

627
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,650
I didn't make you cry. You just cried.

628
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:18,210
I'm sure there was a time you made me cry.

629
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:23,040
Cold, hungry, sleepy, hot...

630
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,930
I wasn't one of the reasons you cried.

631
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,890
Great memory. I'll give you that.

632
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:32,850
Who cares? It's all in the past.

633
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:36,030
I must still be living it.

634
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,520
Can I cuss today?

635
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,360
I said go for it.

636
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,250
Je Yeon is taking a while on the phone.

637
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:51,500
She must be getting calls because
of the article today.

638
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,900
It was received very well.

639
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,670
I didn't see anything.

640
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:56,330
I'm afraid of the reactions.

641
00:40:56,330 --> 00:41:01,050
Did you discuss whether to renew
your contract or not with Je Yeon?

642
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:03,030
You were scared to do that, too?

643
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:06,470
I feel like I'm giving her too much burden.

644
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,740
I think I just need a little ventilation right now.

645
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:16,410
If what you're hoping for is a guide,

646
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,870
rather than human affection, don't worry.

647
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:21,080
I'm a great guide.

648
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:27,300
- Okay.
- Okay.

649
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,460
What if there's a thief?

650
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:45,470
You were always here right about
this time when I came after lunch.

651
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,910
What are you reading?

652
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:49,920
I don't know. Just anything.

653
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,570
Read the title.

654
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:54,410
Don't just read like you always do.
 

655
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:55,750
Okay.

656
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,630
Be sure to lock up for a while.

657
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:01,400
I might not be able to come on my days off.

658
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,730
What nonsense.

659
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,670
I'm going on TV.

660
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:12,990
Yes. It worked out that way.

661
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,070
How did that happen?

662
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:18,540
There's this girl I haven't seen in a while.

663
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:22,540
I thought I could see her more if I did that.

664
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:27,010
- She's greasing a broken part.
- Come on.

665
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:29,300
Who are you calling broken?

666
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,360
Supporting yourself and your sister,

667
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,780
you spent away my twenties.
How could you not be broken?

668
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,130
I really resent your parents.

669
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:40,270
Aigoo, not as much as I do.

670
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,460
Hey, you!

671
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,610
You shouldn't empathize with that as their son.

672
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:49,360
They gave birth to you and raised you, kind of.

673
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,740
- Ma'am?
- What?

674
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:55,330
What song would you like me to dance to?

675
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,740
Get the drums going!

676
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:02,600
And grease them, too!

677
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,740
This is how I'm paying back debt.

678
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,990
- You owe her, too?
- Of course.

679
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:13,520
A big one. Huge.

680
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,580
Sunbae, do you really need the ocean backdrop?

681
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,930
You said you wanted to plant a tree on a mountain.

682
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,460
The writer says he'll need the ocean.

683
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,300
 Come on. It'll only take two days. 

684
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,500
Okay. I'll share the schedule
with you when I get it.

685
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,720
Yes. I'm hanging up.

686
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,620
- PD Yu, they're here already.
- Okay.

687
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:37,230
- Is your friend doing okay?
- Yes.

688
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:39,880
My daughter wanted him to look at her writing.

689
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,420
And she wants to hear the feedback in person.

690
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,100
That's too much to ask, isn't it?

691
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,740
I'll ask him when I hand him the writing.
And try to make it happen.

692
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:50,320
Aigoo, thank you so much.

693
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:56,230
We're meeting with various
sub MC candidates for our show.

694
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:59,410
We'll be going with the right person
after the meetings.

695
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:01,730
Thank you in advance. For today's meeting, too.

696
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:03,130
Sure.

697
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:10,980
This is PD Yu Jae Il.

698
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,100
- Hello, I'm Mo Tae Rin.
- Hello.

699
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,000
- Hello, I'm Director Bang Han Na.
- Hello.

700
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:23,660
What? Closed?

701
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:29,670
Why is it closed? Are we bankrupt?

702
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:37,250
 

703
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:41,460
If you say "Closed," some people might
think you've gone out of business.

704
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:45,000
Let's take those hearts out.

705
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,300
- I don't think so.
- At least, take "Happiness" out.

706
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,750
Oppa, it's meaningless without the "Happiness."

707
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:52,750
How do I deliver "Happiness"?

708
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:54,200
This is exaggerated advertising.

709
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,840
What? You don't think it's false advertising?

710
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:03,420
Hey, what did you buy?

711
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,990
I didn't buy it.

712
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:08,250
Someone bought it for me because
he likes me, unlike you-know-who.

713
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:12,960
Who? A boyfriend?

714
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,980
Actually, I bought it. I did.

715
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,680
Oppa! Go inside.

716
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:20,530
I'm behind on uploading to social media.

717
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:24,040
Hey, you're behind on your studies, Nu Ri.

718
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,870
And you'll fall behind in your life, Nu Ri!

719
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:29,030
You left your doll behind again!

720
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:33,230
Thirty minutes to pick up her costume.

721
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:37,790
Then, from the flower shop...

722
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,090
You're working while eating?

723
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:44,630
Is it because you're low-ranking?

724
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:48,570
Don't pick a fight with me. Go over
there and smoke a cigarette.

725
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,740
Son of the boss.

726
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:52,980
I'm not here to smoke.

727
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:14,710
 Honestly, everyone was hesitant
to take on Mo Tae Rin. 

728
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,500
Not until Je Yeon took over.

729
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,670
But still, does Sung Je Yeon even think?

730
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:24,120
How can she have her actress work
with that crook Sunwoo Hae?

731
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,040
Geez.

732
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,650
Trying to sell their childhood story... Geez...

733
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:33,480
Huh?

734
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,270
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

735
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:38,600
W-What's the deal?

736
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,940
- Let's just go.
- He's weird.

737
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,010
- Who's that?
- Let's go.

738
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:44,630
Who's that?

739
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,930
Geez...

740
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:06,630
- Are you bored?
- You'd better behave.

741
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,270
What?

742
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,980
What did you say?

743
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:15,670
Je Yeon told you before, right?

744
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,930
You don't have to take it on. But just read it.

745
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:19,850
No pressure.

746
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,520
Is the "My Annoying as Hell Daughter" me?

747
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,910
It's a titular role, even.

748
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,100
Did you slack off and not study?

749
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,230
Yes. I came here to slack off.

750
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:38,520
Say hi. Tae Rin. You know her.

751
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,040
This is my son, Kim Seok Joo.

752
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,280
Your son? Why?

753
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,800
Because I gave birth to him.

754
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,120
Please keep it a secret that we're family.

755
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:51,610
But what's your son doing here?

756
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:55,520
I came to clean up this building. My side job.

757
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,620
Gosh, he's so silly.

758
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,870
Good luck with your shoot today.

759
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:05,190
Are things going okay with Sunwoo Hae?

760
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:08,270
Yes. I feel relaxed around him.
It's going pretty well.

761
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:09,780
It was nice to see him again.

762
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,070
Don't go overboard with that.

763
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,730
Let's grab lunch after you read that.

764
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:17,220
Okay. Bye now.

765
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,740
 

766
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,760
Hey, you made it.

767
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,070
Geez!

768
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:42,390
- Rainbow.
- Rainbow. Did you see that?

769
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:44,450
Whoa, a rainbow.

770
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,380
Is there Sunwoo Hae?

771
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,020
Yes, it's me.

772
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,470
Mr. Kim Seok Joo sent it for you.

773
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:54,210
Kim Seok Joo?

774
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:56,270
Please sign here. Thank you.

775
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:58,120
Bye.

776
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,380
Kim Seok Joo...

777
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,620
Sending a flower basket to a flower shop...

778
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,550
 Why did you let me find out
about your debut through an article? 

779
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:08,720
 Are we strangers? 

780
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,840
 - Your No. 1 fan, Seok Joo. 
- Seok Joo, heart?

781
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,990
How dare he buy flowers elsewhere?

782
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:14,670
I ought to. Seriously.

783
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:15,950
Oh, that part?

784
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,130
Seok Joo?

785
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:19,700
Are you really brothers with Kim Seok Joo?

786
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,190
- Partly blood related?
- What?

787
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:25,460
You don't know Kim Seok Joo, do you?
You were in a different grade.

788
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:28,570
No. I don't think I know him.

789
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:30,560
It'd be good to keep it that way.

790
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:32,080
Why? Did you not get along?

791
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,070
We'll continue not to get along.

792
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,670
- I'll go in first.
- Okay.

793
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:40,020
Okay.

794
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:42,970
Give me that. I'll take it inside.

795
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:45,110
Thank you.

796
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:48,010
- Sung Je Yeon.
- What?

797
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:50,860
You've known Kim Seok Joo much longer than I have.

798
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:54,160
- How come you don't know?
- That doesn't mean we're close.

799
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,680
If you and Seok Joo are brothers,

800
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,300
our CEO and your father...

801
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,770
What?

802
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:04,670
She's your CEO?

803
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:08,130
What an interesting reaction.

804
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:13,350
I don't have any ill feelings toward her.

805
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:15,870
Though I don't know how she feels.

806
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:24,000
Looks like you have lots of questions.

807
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,030
I have so many questions, but I'm holding back.

808
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:29,400
You can ask me.

809
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,700
They have nothing to do with me at all.

810
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,910
My father married her when I was in 12th grade.

811
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:38,650
I didn't move into Seok Joo's house
because I wanted to live with my sister.

812
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:41,620
Anything else you want to know?

813
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:46,620
But still, I thought people
would be glad to see you.

814
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,900
How is the reaction? How bad is it?

815
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,260
I think you'll live long.*
(Koreans say you live long if people criticize you)

816
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:59,720
We should've called you a flower shop
owner and a novelist.

817
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:05,110
Sure, yellow journalism would love my old story.

818
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:07,120
I think that means virality.

819
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,950
People don't say anything
if they're not interested.

820
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:13,330
It means you still have power over the public.

821
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:16,690
I didn't jump in if I was going to regret it.

822
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:21,950
I'll take care of things I need to handle.

823
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:23,900
Don't worry too much.

824
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:41,470
Long time no see.

825
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:51,030
Hey, you can't come here-

826
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:53,630
Hey, why are you so thin?

827
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:56,900
Are you eating? Are you sick?

828
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:00,640
I got my draft notice.
I can't postpone it any longer.

829
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,400
What do I do with Nu Ri?

830
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,760
Huh?

831
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:11,110
Hey, let's talk inside.

832
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:12,950
Come.

833
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:21,130
W-What should I do...

834
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:24,440
Oh, Geon No's mom.

835
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,190
She took care of you when you were little.

836
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:27,650
She could take care of her...

837
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:29,920
She's the daughter of the woman
you used to live with.

838
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,160
After you ditched Mom and me.

839
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,490
- I didn't ditch you.
 - Chan? Is someone out there? 

840
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:35,490
Oh, no one.

841
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,060
Hae is here.

842
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,490
Hello.

843
00:52:42,490 --> 00:52:45,230
Can you take care of my sister
only while I'm in the military?

844
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:47,600
- Hey-
- She hasn't started school yet.

845
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,750
Your sister?

846
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:52,630
But your mom died a while ago...

847
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:57,320
It's not her daughter.

848
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,910
I can't afford to save face right now.

849
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:07,700
- Chan, take care of this.
- Oh, okay. Got it...

850
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:14,400
Why did you want to see me?

851
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:19,550
Because I wanted to see how you're doing.

852
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:23,490
It was so tough to see you.

853
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:26,090
I was surprised you called me.

854
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:28,170
I've waited a long time.

855
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,450
Not as long as I've waited.

856
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:40,700
This is the money you gave me
when I was in high school.

857
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,580
Thank you.

858
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:52,890
If I needed that money, I wouldn't
have paid off your debt.

859
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:55,620
Don't you know what it means
when I paid off your debt?

860
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:57,520
Of course, I know.

861
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:03,120
This is to repay my heart full of burden.

862
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,700
You're living with that moron.

863
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:15,890
I guess you're doing quite well.

864
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:21,000
No matter how you're doing now,
you're still 20-year-old Sunwoo Hae.

865
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:26,020
As a student, you skipped school
and frequented motels and bars.

866
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:28,530
I guess you didn't feel sorry for me.

867
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:31,130
How could I think highly of you after all that?

868
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:34,050
I don't see why you couldn't.

869
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:39,070
You'd feel better if you blamed me
for Seok Joo's bad behavior.

870
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:45,400
Seok Joo insisted on bringing your sister
or daughter, so I even gave her a room.

871
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,360
That's why I'm being nice to Seok Joo
to repay that debt.

872
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:53,380
She was just about the age for you
to have had her out of wedlock.

873
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,870
Do you take after your mom in that way, too?

874
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:59,810
I don't want to know why you
suddenly want to take it out on me.

875
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:04,810
I just came out because this was
a chance for me to pay off my debt.

876
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:06,440
Bye now.

877
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:17,480
That kid still has a temper.

878
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,900
- Aigoo!
- Welcome.

879
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:34,280
Son, I opened up a publisher.

880
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:36,760
Here is the rice cake for the opening.

881
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,470
The rice cakes came out nicely.

882
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:46,130
I should keep them in a fridge.

883
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:47,870
Did you open it today?

884
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:49,710
Three years ago today...

885
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:56,010
Why did you come?

886
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:59,110
Weren't we assuming we were dead to each other?

887
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:02,730
Well...

888
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,630
I saw the article.

889
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,650
Are you really going on TV?

890
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:13,260
I was just worried.

891
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:14,960
I didn't think of this.

892
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,530
That something like this could
happen after the article came out.

893
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:21,690
If you need money, I'd like to give support-

894
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:27,800
I was just worried.

895
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:35,400
Does that Ahjumma know that you're here?

896
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,640
I'll go now.

897
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,290
Gosh, I'm so busy.

898
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:42,460
I'm leaving. Give me a rose stem.

899
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,580
A rose.

900
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:45,980
A stem...

901
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:49,150
Men usually buy flowers when
they've done something wrong.

902
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:51,940
There are tons of flower shops in Seoul.

903
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:54,600
Buy it somewhere else, Mr. Poet.

904
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:58,390
I'll be back.

905
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,200
Oh, pull.

906
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:12,920
A stem? Why a stem?

907
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:25,870
- Knock, knock.
- Hello!

908
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:28,100
I've been watching you.

909
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:31,980
Are you shopping for yourself or for Tae Rin?

910
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,190
Wait. I didn't get a call from her stylist.

911
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:37,210
I need something.

912
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:41,110
Is there something that doesn't rip easily?

913
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:42,800
Okay...

914
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:47,200
So, do you want it to rip at the end?

915
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:52,490
Or do you want it to rip only with
brute force? What do you want?

916
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:54,390
Something strong. Strong.

917
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:56,330
Something I can wear for about 10 years.

918
00:57:56,330 --> 00:57:59,230
Design, color, durability...

919
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:02,360
I don't want it to lack in any aspect.

920
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,930
I know.

921
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:05,300
Let's see.

922
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:07,990
Let's look at my babies...

923
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:12,930
Oh, my baby!

924
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:14,760
Oh, my.

925
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,610
We missed this.

926
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:20,410
This is the best one for you. What do you think?

927
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:22,740
I'll trust you.

928
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:25,780
This will rip in the end.

929
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:29,370
- It can't happen.
- It can't...

930
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:32,310
- Here.
- You'll wear this for 10 years, no problem.

931
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:33,740
I trust you.

932
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:35,350
Okay...

933
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:43,180
 Je Yeon, what do I do? Did you
see the follow-up article? 

934
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:45,780
 There's a video clip... 

935
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,390
Yes, Sunbae. What video clip?

936
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:01,970
Pardon?

937
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:11,730
CEO.

938
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:17,710
There's an article out about Tae Rin's
documentary. There's an issue.

939
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:20,000
You should take a look at it.

940
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:23,960
There's an old news video attached.

941
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,240
It's being abused.

942
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,130
It won't be good for Tae Rin.

943
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:33,270
What an unlucky guy.

944
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:34,950
Did you see that video clip of Mo Tae Rin?

945
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:38,510
The video summary of the sitcom
"Beat and Bebop" is up.

946
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:42,210
And someone posted a clip sabotaging them as well.

947
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:44,620
Anyway, to be entertained
by someone's misfortune...

948
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:46,780
What's going on?

949
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:49,580
What about someone's misfortune? Gossip?

950
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:52,610
Did you see this? There was an article.

951
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:33,660
It turned out much better, considering my mood.

952
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:36,450
I should take a picture.

953
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,850
Where's my phone?

954
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:52,210
Here it is.

955
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:54,520
 

956
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,900
Why did she call so many times?

957
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,200
 

958
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:02,970
Yes, PD.

959
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:05,410
Why didn't you pick up?

960
01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:08,550
I thought something had happened to you.

961
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,920
I'm sorry.

962
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,420
I was working and had it on mute. I'm sorry.

963
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:18,140
What's going on?

964
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:32,460
Yes.

965
01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:39,750
Yes. I'm okay.

966
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,420
I'm really okay.

967
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:44,900

01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:18,180
 the former A-Entertainment's CEO,

01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:20,540
 as the sad news is reaching everyone.

986
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:07,100
 What do we do? He's not crying at all. 

987
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:10,760
 I know. He has to cry so
I can use the dramatic clip. 

988
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,160
Wait, wait. Excuse me. Coming through.

989
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,390
Hey, move, move, move.

990
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:22,540
Whose fault do you think this is?

991
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:24,570
You think dying would solve it?

992
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:25,990
You can make it go away by dying?

993
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:28,160
She has my money, but died!

994
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,380
What?

995
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:33,910
 You can make it go away by dying? 

996
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:37,890
 What are you going to do? My money! 

997
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:45,970
Hey, hey.

998
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:48,790
Hey, I heard you made tons of money.

999
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:51,650
Here. Sign here.

1000
01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:59,240
Say something!

1001
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:02,860
Hurry!

1002
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:05,340
Who the hell are you?

1003
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:10,360
Are you his father?

1004
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:11,750
What about my money?

1005
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:14,690
- Give me my money!
- Hey, the dad!

1006
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:02,770
Sorry.

1007
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:06,340
I'm sorry.

1008
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:07,970
I mean...

1009
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:11,810
I didn't know. I mean...

1010
01:05:11,810 --> 01:05:16,130
I looked up everything, but I guess I missed it.

1011
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,900
It was my fault.

1012
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,340
I'm sorry.

1013
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,010
I'm sorry.

1014
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:37,070
I'll... I'll put it all back.

1015
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:42,030
Give me a little time.

1016
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:50,700
 ♫ I feel nervous, but I don't know why ♫ 

1017
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:52,390
Don't go.

1018
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:55,230
 ♫ Faint butterflies in my stomach ♫ 

1019
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:57,890
 ♫ That familiar voice from the memory ♫ 

1020
01:05:57,890 --> 01:05:59,670
Can you...

1021
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:05,390
just hug me one more time?

1022
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:14,450
 ♫ You vibrate as if shocked ♫ 

1023
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:19,990
 ♫ The undulating rays of the sun ♫ 

1024
01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:23,470
 ♫ The blue sky ♫ 

1025
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:29,100
 ♫ We're stuck on that day ♫ 

1026
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:34,760
 ♫ So beautiful ♫ 

1027
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:44,960
 ♫ When I look at you blankly ♫ 

1028
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:50,460
I think I've been waiting...

1029
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:55,330
for you to do this.

1030
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:06,240
 ♫ Day and night briefly meet ♫ 

1031
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:12,710
 ♫ Like us from back then ♫ 

1032
01:07:14,670 --> 01:07:20,270
 ♫ Like we're about to drown ♫ 

1033
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:30,080
 ♫ Pretending not to know and embrace ♫ 

1034
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:06,170
 ♫ Assuming it's you, your light smile ♫ 

1035
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:11,910
 ♫ Stain called you that I never erased ♫ 

1036
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,610
 ♫ Some memories ♫ 

1037
01:08:17,610 --> 01:08:23,710
 ♫ I lean on them gladly ♫
