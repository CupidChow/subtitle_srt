1
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,010
 

2
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,990
Yes, sir. Hello.

3
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,340
Yes, hello.

4
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,410
I'm almost there. Yes, yes.

5
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,130
Hello.

6
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,360
How much are lisianthuses going for today?

7
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,430
- Is this lisianthus?
- Yes.

8
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,700
- 7,000 won?
- Yes.

9
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,950
Uncle, hi.

10
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,080
 

11
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,160
There...

12
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,690
That's mine.

13
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,250
Yes, thank you.

14
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,380
Thank you. Take care.

15
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,360
Thank you, ma'am.

16
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:49,970
 The Best Actor award goes to Sunwoo Hae
for his work in "Beautiful Moonlight." 

17
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,970
 He's only 11. The youngest winner. 

18
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,690
Sir, sit here.

19
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,120
Yes, I'm Sunwoo Hae.

20
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,410
Who's calling?

21
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,130
By chance, are you the child actor Sunwoo Hae?

22
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,830
No, no. Just a second.

23
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,690
Please listen to me for a moment, sir.

24
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,360
Let me talk to him.

25
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,570
Hello? I'm Director Jin So Rah...

26
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,000
He hung up.

27
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,670
He declined without even hearing about it.

28
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,390
 - The person you are calling is not available. 
- He's not picking up.

29
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:02,940
Let's find him.

30
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,280
Let's at least get closer
to the threshold of casting him.

31
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,730
 This is an edit of the "Famished for Love" scene. 

32
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,740
 Please review. 

33
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,760
 

34
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,760
Yes, Director Jo.

35
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,260
You can't send a scene edit
two hours before the shoot.

36
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,090
Don't tell me you just sent it to us late again.

37
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,800
 Your to-go salad is ready. 

38
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,800
Okay, I'll see you on set. Yes.

39
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,210
Thank you.

40
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,840
Thanks.

41
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,660
It changed to white clothes
in the new edit of the scene.

42
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,560
A man who keeps wearing white in front
of a woman who's traumatized by white...

43
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,220
Is this a romance or a thriller? Thriller, right?

44
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,720
He'll keep going until he gets his fill.

45
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,060
You can't change people.

46
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,650
No. Don't mess it up.

47
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,190
Thank you.

48
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,250
He's so obnoxious.

49
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,460
I'm near the traffic light. Where are you?

50
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,980
 I'm near the four-way intersection.
Where do I pick you up? 

51
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,090
Huh? I see you.

52
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,020
- Hey.
 - I'll across the street and hop in. 

53
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,680
- Okay.
- Hey, this, this. I got it.

54
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,220
Okay.

55
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,650
Oh, no! Are you okay?

56
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,320
He's about to dash away! Chase him!

57
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,630
- Are you okay?
- Oh, no...

58
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,910
What do we do?

59
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,280
Get your phone.

60
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,600
- Hospital first. Yes, yes.
- Hospital?

61
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,580
Are you okay?

62
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,100
Wait.

63
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,020
Thank you.

64
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,620
Great work.

65
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,640
- Tae Rin.
- Yeah?

66
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,730
Go to the car first. Let me wrap up
one thing before we go.

67
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,570
- Sure.
- Okay.

68
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,050
Manager Yang.

69
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,110
Do you have a moment?

70
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,200
Hey! Are you crazy?

71
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,240
Who do you think you're hunting down, you psycho?

72
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,270
- Get out while I'm still using words.
- What?

73
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,960
You just wait, you asshole.

74
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,400
Hey, what if you don't use words?

75
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,450
What will you do, you asshole?

76
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,470
I wish you'd follow traffic laws.

77
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,190
You little punk...

78
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,100
Did you just dodge?

79
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,400
Look at this punk. Fine...

80
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,420
Don't you dare dodge, you punk. Got it?

81
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,390
You punk... You...

82
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,920
Shit!

83
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,980
Sir.

84
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,420
Would you like to go to the police station with me

85
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,840
or would you like to go and apologize?

86
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,960
I'd like to do both together.

87
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,590
What do you mean by resolve amicably?

88
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,630
That's how you always
get the short end of the stick.

89
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,240
It's going to be tough to get
those liquors right away.

90
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,460
But can you just drive Seok Joo's car like this?

91
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,060
Does he know what you're up to?

92
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,370
That's none of your-

93
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,200
Anyway, open up the shop early today.

94
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,700
- Better make up for that liquor you lost.
- You cheapskate.

95
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,060
You chased him because
of the cost of liquor, didn't you?

96
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,200
Hey!

97
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,490
How dare you say such an obvious thing?

98
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:28,340
The wardrobe team prepared
black clothes as written.

99
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,800
We need to follow the script.

100
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,790
The writer switched it
to white clothes in the script.

101
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,570
This is the best sequence of the episode,

102
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,200
and all the main characters could shine in it.

103
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,200
But because of your actor who wants to look good,

104
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,600
we're about to ruin it all.

105
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,820
Gosh, you talk as if Mo Tae Rin
is the main character.

106
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,100
She's just a side character.

107
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,310
Hey. Clothes that were black a month
ago suddenly changed to white today.

108
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,900
In a continuous scene, at that.

109
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,700
Does it make sense that he's suddenly
in white in the same scene?

110
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,440
I'm not the only one who thinks that's weird.

111
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,800
Did the writer get shot in the head?

112
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,660
- Hey!
- What?

113
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,800
I need to go get curry because he's craving curry.

114
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,560
- And you're giving me shit, too?
- Don't muddy the conversation.

115
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,070
We're not talking about curry right now.

116
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,830
Is the curry ready?

117
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,650
Yes, I'm on my way.

118
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,300
Je Yeon, before you said anything,

119
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,200
the assistant director and the script
supervisor already yelled at me.

120
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,900
But what can I do? He was so insistent.

121
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,120
I'm dying here. Everyone is lashing out at me.

122
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,360
What am I supposed to do?

123
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,260
At least pretend to convince him.

124
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,260
I'm leaving.

125
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,240
I bet you could just bump his elbow
and be done with the curry...

126
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,500
Never mind.

127
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,830
- Bye!
- Bye.

128
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,390
I'm leaving.

129
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,780
Bump?

130
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,570
Please spill the curry...

131
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,690
Spill...

132
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,450
Head! Side!

133
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,600
Head! Side!

134
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,470
Curry!

135
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,640
Head!

136
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,000
On the clothes! Curry!

137
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,130
On the clothes! Curry!

138
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,500
Spill it! Spill it!

139
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,230
Spill! Curry! On the clothes!

140
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,170
On the clothes!

141
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,360
I love curry...

142
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,480
So yummy.

143
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,350
Curry, curry...

144
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,630
Hey.

145
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,530
- Yes?
- I'm wearing white.

146
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,110
I'm sorry, Hyung.

147
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,630
Be careful.

148
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,560
Gosh, this...

149
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,930
You only have one set of white clothes...

150
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,780
I'm leaving.

151
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,350
See you, Sung Je Yeon.

152
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,660
Aren't you guys leaving?

153
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,640
 Nam Jun Ho is wearing his original costume 

154
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,920
 because he doesn't have any spares. 

155
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,890
 He spilled curry on his clothes. 

156
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,140
What?

157
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,930
 Je Yeon, I'm stuck at a meeting, so I can't meet. 
 

158
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,720
 Sorry. 

159
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,210
You just got off work!

160
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,700
Don't you sleep?

161
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,460
It's 3 a.m.

162
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,520
Wow, you waited up this late?

163
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,010
That program by PD Yoo Jae Il...

164
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:57,900
Even if it's a one-off appearance,

165
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,910
could you please make it happen for me?

166
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,630
Apparently, the CEO even mentioned it today.

167
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,650
I wanted to get it done in advance...

168
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,180
Jae Il is busy looking for a novelist.

169
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,900
Maybe you could learn about that novelist.

170
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,870
He looks for the novelist every
so often. He must love him.

171
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,260
What's that novelist's name?

172
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,450
Jin Mu Yeong.

173
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,590
Gosh, I was so shocked at how refreshing
it was when I read it in college.

174
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,200
Got it.

175
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,820
Then, how about the pilot you're working on?

176
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,400
Isn't there anything for Tae Rin in it?

177
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,260
Will you act like this every quarter?
Do I owe you something?

178
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,690
Do you know how it feels
to desperately look for someone?

179
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,700
Who are you looking for?

180
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,800
I'll help you.

181
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,180
The only way to cast Mo Tae Rin
is to get Sunwoo Hae.

182
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,930
The project that got killed last year.

183
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:51,500
You're still stuck on that?

184
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,700
Je Yeon, would you do some
footwork and find Sunwoo Hae?

185
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,900
Then, I'll introduce you to Jae Il right away.

186
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,680
Really?

187
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,600
You mean it, right?

188
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,860
You're shopping for flowers?

189
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,480
I can't believe I'm so resentful
about getting dumped at my age.

190
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,000
What?

191
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,310
Some days, you'd sob.

192
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,040
Some days, you'd curse him out.

193
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,100
And at the end, you missed him.

194
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,050
You still remember that?

195
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,880
Please forget it.

196
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,600
You hadn't even had a drink till you were 20.

197
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,980
And you were sobbing.

198
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,550
So intense.

199
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,000
What about Sunwoo Hae, out of the blue?

200
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,870
Is this about the project that
got killed last year again?

201
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,590
No, no. We don't know that yet.

202
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,880
Someone uploaded a photo online.

203
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,500
I can't help but think it's him.

204
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,710
I feel weird going there to look for him.

205
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,000
I said a lot of mean stuff to him in high school.

206
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,520
He was hardworking, but I put him down.

207
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,590
Just pretend it's not you.

208
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,800
Just put on some makeup.

209
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,460
- Want to wear a mustache?
- That won't work.

210
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,460
Should I just go check out his business?

211
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,500
So Rah can take care of the casting.

212
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,700
Let's say you went to see him.
And it is Sunwoo Hae.

213
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,040
Do you think he'd agree to be on it? I wouldn't.

214
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,690
Not because of you.

215
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,800
You know what I'm talking about.

216
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,510
I'm sure he'll be hesitant after
what happened when he was little.

217
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,830
And yet you put him down?

218
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,180
If he declines this time, it'll be because of you.

219
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,540
Me?

220
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,180
Don't act like you know me ever again!

221
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,960
Forever!

222
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,000
 

223
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,190
Is the business closed?

224
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,640
Excuse me.

225
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,220
 ♫ I feel nervous, but I don't know why ♫ 

226
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,800
 ♫ Faint butterflies in my stomach ♫ 

227
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:42,390
 ♫ That familiar voice from the memory ♫ 

228
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:46,050
 ♫ So beautiful ♫ 

229
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:56,230
 ♫ When I look at you blankly ♫ 

230
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:04,440
 ♫ Come closer ♫ 

231
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,120
Welcome.

232
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,790
I think I need to buy a potted plant.

233
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,900
I think you should buy it if you want to buy it.

234
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,520
Right?

235
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,570
Come on in.

236
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:41,370
 ♫ Pretending not to know and embrace ♫ 

237
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,840
 ♫ Like the bubbles that recede ♫ 

238
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,080
What? He didn't recognize me.

239
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,730
So, you're looking for a potted plant, right?

240
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:28,240
Well, something that's easy to take care of.

241
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,010
- Something that grows by itself.
- Okay.

242
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,300
Sung Je Yeon.

243
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,100
You still want me to pretend I don't know you?

244
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:04,540
Oh...

245
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,980
Well, that's...

246
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,280
Is that a yes or a no?

247
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,560
It's good to see you.

248
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,000
Have you been well?

249
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,400
Well, you know Mo Tae Rin, don't you?

250
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,860
I'm her manager. I'm here
because of casting matters.

251
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,670
- I don't know her.
- Gosh...

252
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:50,190
How can you not know Tae Rin?

253
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,510
Sir?

254
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,780
You were super popular as the
nation's favorite siblings on TV.

255
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,760
You even went to the same high school.

256
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:19,500
You must've been asked to approach
me just for going to the same school.

257
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,660
A PD is looking for you regarding
the sitcom you were in as a child actor.

258
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,830
Through Mo Tae Rin and Sunwoo Hae,

259
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:30,670
we lean into nostalgia of those days, and...

260
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,230
You can promote your shop
by appearing on the show.

261
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:44,260
It'd be so nice to see grown-up versions
of the nation's favorite siblings.

262
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,800
People are curious about how Sunwoo Hae
grew up. They'd want to see you.

263
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,600
I can guess why you're hesitant.

264
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,940
But this is a decent project.
At least, take a look-

265
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,520
And what's your guess?

266
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,900
How much would they pay me?

267
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,340
The pay.

268
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,930
I'm curious how much the offer is.

269
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,280
The way you're saying it is so...

270
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,770
They're not locking you up in a cage to film you.

271
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,620
The past is in the past.

272
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,900
I have no desire to be indebted to
Mo Tae Rin to appear on TV.

273
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,180
You're asking me to put my life on exhibit

274
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,300
for the sake of strangers' nostalgia.

275
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,960
Gosh, I can see why you heard it that way.

276
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
But you're jumping to conclusions.

277
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,200
Looks like something has offended you.

278
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,240
Let's say that I'm too busy with
my day job to say yes to that.

279
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,970
Are you acting like this...

280
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,020
because I put you down badly in high school?

281
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:07,500
I'm sorry if you were hurt.

282
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,300
- I apologize.
- Did you...

283
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:14,100
ever put me down?

284
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,580
Geez, that little...

285
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,450
Just help me out once.

286
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,930
That's what classmates are for.

287
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,310
How's this potted plant?

288
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,300
Please.

289
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,340
No?

290
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,420
How are you getting home?

291
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,790
By car.

292
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,430
You don't have to pay me.

293
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:11,190
Since you came all this way for nothing.

294
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,100
Don't speak half-casually to me.

295
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,510
Did you want to see it, too?

296
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,810
How I've grown up?

297
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,370
I understand that you decline.

298
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,990
Goodbye.

299
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,390
Gosh, I should've acknowledged him off the bat.

300
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:16,170
 - Hey. 
- I was such a pushover.

301
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,300
 Can you hear me? Who are you talking to? 

302
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,200
I thought about it,

303
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,000
and I don't think I was too harsh back in the day.

304
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,750
 What are you talking about now? I'm so sleepy. 

305
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:32,140
- I just met Sunwoo Hae.
 - What? 

306
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,400
He won't do the show.

307
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,350
Hey! Behind my back...

308
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,000
I wanted to meet him myself!

309
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,890
Where did you meet him?

310
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,240
I don't want to give you his information
when he clearly declined.

311
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,350
 Sung Je Yeon. 

312
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,440
Are you messing with me right now?

313
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,500
- He was so sure.
 - Where are you, Sung Je Yeon? 

314
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,000
Wait, come on. Why are you yelling?

315
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,970
I'm the one who's been humiliated because of you.

316
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:05,090
I'm not angry at you. I'm just really upset.

317
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:09,650
 

318
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,460
What about dinner?

319
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,100
I have dinner plans.

320
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,890
You're here. Did the meeting go okay?

321
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:23,010
Are you reading the original? Is it good?

322
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,850
Jin Mu Yeong?

323
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:27,290
I heard PD Yu Jae Il is going
crazy looking for him.

324
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,220
He's shouting it from the rooftops.
 

325
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,540
Yes, that's right.

326
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,850
I'd better do my homework
so we have some shared topics.

327
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:36,670
But it feels familiar,
and I don't even read novels.

328
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,980
Can't be that hard to find a novelist.

329
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,040
Yes, it's Kim Pil Du.

330
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,100
I checked with the publisher,

331
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:47,700
and it looks like he hides behind a proxy.

332
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,410
- What?
- Aigoo, my heart...

333
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,770
Aigoo, I'm sorry.

334
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,970
Your heart is on the left.

335
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,640
Wait. I'm going home.

336
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,170
I need to check something.

337
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,910
I need to leave. Sorry.

338
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,300
 

339
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:15,030
 ♫ Walking side by side in lockstep
with you on this street ♫ 

340
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:18,750
 ♫ I still walk this street every day ♫ 

341
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,980
 

342
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,530
 ♫ I felt like I was dreaming ♫ 

343
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,700
 

344
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,250
 

345
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,520
It was true...

346
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,080
Wait a minute...

347
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,470
What's this?

348
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,060
A wish bracelet.

349
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,340
 I got it for you. 

350
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,930
Why is he still wearing it?

351
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,640
One comped item...

352
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:08,900
A cactus.

353
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:25,300
 ♫ If I close my eyes and think of you ♫ 

354
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:30,150
 ♫ I feel like you'll suddenly appear ♫ 

355
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:34,980
 ♫ And feels like you'll walk toward me ♫ 

356
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,970
 ♫ I don't know what tomorrow will bring ♫ 

357
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:41,520
 Coincidences always happen
when you least expect them. 

358
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,800
 How come there are no previews in real life? 

359
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:51,000
 ♫ Smiling silently back then ♫ 

360
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,020
Did you see the message board?

361
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:55,950
People are dying to know who read the first verse.

362
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,950
They love your voice.

363
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:11,780
 Just one stone slipped out, 

364
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:14,530
 but everything crumbled. 

365
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:17,400
 His name had too much rain in it. 

366
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,120
 So, his fate was apparently meant to be chilly. 

367
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,840
 I hope your weather is all clear. 

368
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,220
 He laughed, saying his life was all rain. 

369
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,100
 But I don't remember his face so well. 

370
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,950
 The reason I borrowed his name for my garden 

371
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:38,500
 is to let him know that his life was all rain, 

372
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,250
 so it can get clear. 

373
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,000
 That's when I realized. 

374
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,480
Whose voice is this?

375
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,240
Voice of the Day.

376
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,950
This show invites listeners
and has them read books.

377
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,600
Voice of the Day...

378
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,600
 I had forgotten I forgot about him... 

379
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,460
I think it's him...

380
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,240
Yes.

381
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,680
I'm getting a call.

382
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:06,270
Yes. I'll see you later. Okay.

383
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,600
Hello?

384
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,000
 I'm in the lobby, and I need entry authorization. 

385
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,260
- Where is this?
- I said I'm in the lobby.

386
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,540
I meant, who are you?

387
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,890
Bang Han Na sent flowers.

388
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,350
Okay, I'll be right down.

389
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,900
- Hey.
- What?

390
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,100
The Executive Director must've sent
flowers for your first radio show. I'll go get it.

391
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,700
- I'll head in first.
- Yeah, it's that way.

392
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:33,870
 If you exist in another world, 

393
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:36,880
 I hope you understand my wish. 

394
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:43,630
 I hope it's clear there. 

395
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:47,250
 That was my small wish and faith. 

396
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:53,350
 That was "Voice of the Day"
on "Beautiful Morning." 

397
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,340
 We'll listen to music and come back for part 4. 

398
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,290
 The guest will be actress Mo Tae Rin. 

399
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,620
Good?

400
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,460
Tae Rin, why are you crying?

401
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,740
Are you nervous because this is
your first time on the radio?

402
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,280
I'm reminded of a time...

403
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,360
I don't know.

404
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,060
It's okay.

405
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,200
Great work.

406
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,390
- Sunbae.
- Yeah?

407
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:37,430
I'm headed home.

408
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,050
You're mocking me.

409
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,530
Aren't you?

410
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:42,590
Get out.

411
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,810
Call me again if your listener cancels again.

412
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,520
If you buy me a drink.

413
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,460
Hello.

414
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,990
Hello...

415
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,890
I'll get going.

416
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:58,300
 Thank you. 

417
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,920
Did you cry?

418
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,700
Yes.

419
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,720
Why are you crying?

420
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,490
Why are you smiling?

421
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,550
Because you're pretty.

422
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,600
Oh, I understand.

423
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,500
I laughed because it was funny this time.

424
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,390
You don't know who I am?

425
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:27,590
Who doesn't know Mo Tae Rin?

426
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,360
Yes, this is Kim Seok Joo.

427
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,970
It was Kim Seok Joo.

428
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:37,940
Is he saying he knows or doesn't know me?

429
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,540
Hello.

430
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:57,280
We spoke on the phone.

431
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,970
You can just hand it to me.

432
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:01,680
Is this a coincidence?

433
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,880
Why are you speaking to me so casually?

434
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,960
Are you pretending you don't know me again?

435
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,090
Because I declined the casting offer?

436
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,120
Nope.

437
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,900
- Why are you smiling?
- It's good to see you.

438
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,770
Let me take a photo of you with the flowers.

439
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,400
Why a photo?

440
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,300
I need a proof of delivery
for Bang Han Na. Taking it now.

441
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:27,540
You still like him?

442
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,500
Are you crazy?

443
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,130
- I'd better take it again.
- No, no.

444
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:36,180
I'll let her know it was received.

445
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,450
Please delete the photo of him and me.

446
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,330
Thank you.

447
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,550
What's the deal between you two?

448
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:48,730
What brings you here? Flower delivery?

449
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:51,100
What else? You think I'm here to debut?

450
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,330
If they'd debut you again, would you do it?

451
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:57,290
You stayed in touch with Sung Je Yeon
after graduation?

452
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:00,260
Or, did she study abroad like you?

453
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,910
She couldn't after her family went bankrupt.

454
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,660
Should I send a flower basket when you debut?

455
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,500
Buy the flower basket from my shop.

456
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,930
Where are you going?

457
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:09,570
To debut?

458
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,480
Fighting!

459
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,500
- The cactus.
- The cactus?

460
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,230
What about the cactus?

461
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:27,000
The one I gave you the other day.

462
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,500
Did you kill it already?

463
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:34,410
I thought you had changed your mind
about coming on the show.

464
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,110
Anything else to discuss?

465
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,520
Well...

466
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,300
You have my number from the call. Call me.

467
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:55,030
- Why would I?
- Well, if there's an issue with the cactus

468
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:57,290
or if you're hungry.

469
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,270
I was wondering what you were doing...

470
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,130
What is this?

471
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,060
Water in a paper cup.

472
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,660
You water it that much once a month.

473
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:27,200
Use your words. That's faster.

474
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,500
- Doodling when you're all grown-up...
- To stretch time.

475
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,370
What are you trying to pull?

476
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,010
Ho.

477
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,830
Ho?

478
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,840
Ho?

479
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,730
Ho.

480
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:55,150
Ho?

481
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,210
So I get better?

482
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,560
She still does that?

483
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,770
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

484
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,110
Sunbae.

485
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:21,120
Somebody smiled at me earlier.

486
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,470
Why did he smile?
Was it really because I'm pretty?

487
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,740
Hey.

488
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,960
Huh?

489
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,920
How could anyone not smile
looking at you unless they're dead?

490
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,900
Wait a moment.

491
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,500
Did you cry? Your eyes look red.

492
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,690
I teared up, thinking about the old days.

493
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,840
What thoughts?

494
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,570
Thoughts of wanting to die.

495
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,260
What?

496
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,870
I'm joking.

497
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,770
- You have a lot on your mind lately, huh?
- Nope.

498
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,850
This is no good. Go hiking with me tomorrow.

499
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,020
- I don't want to.
- Go, Ms. Mo Tae Rin.

500
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,990
- I don't want to.
- Come, Ms. Mo Tae Rin.

501
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,900
 Je Yeon, I'm stuck at a meeting, so I can't meet. 
 

502
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,460
 It's okay, Assistant Director. 

503
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,000
 Call me anytime. 

504
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,550
Hello, PD Yu Jae Il.

505
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:37,460
I'm actress Mo Tae Rin's manager.

506
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,870
Sure.

507
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,100
I'm your hoobae.

508
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,330
Business at Seoul National University.

509
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,330
I was a communications major.

510
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,950
I've never met a manager who went to SNU.

511
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:53,100
I hear you like Jin Mu Yeong's novels.

512
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,900
Might be because we were classmates.

513
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,020
I was glad to hear that.

514
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,860
We went to the same high school.

515
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,770
Are you close? You keep in touch?

516
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:07,350
Yes, well...

517
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:11,150
That's how it's worked out.

518
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,400
Could you connect us?

519
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,680
It'd feel much friendlier and approachable
if a classmate reached out

520
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,140
rather than a stranger.

521
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,700
Right, right.

522
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:28,000
Are we friendly?

523
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,630
Approachable?

524
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,040
 Why are you smiling? 

525
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,400
 It's good to see you. 

526
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:49,650
Maybe it feels like that...

527
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,260
Leave if you're done.

528
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,780
How long will you meditate?

529
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,180
Master, I'd better shamelessly use that.

530
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,090
 I'm turning off the lights. 

531
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:06,470
I'll build up my accomplishments
and up my salary...

532
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,300
He really turned off the lights.

533
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,910
How's your condition?

534
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,320
I'll be fine.

535
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,350
Breathe in the air.

536
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,190
Gosh, it's so hot.

537
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,050
Thank you.

538
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,970
I'm glad we came out.

539
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,830
Right?

540
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,730
What's Jin Mu Yeong?
 

541
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:49,200
The meeting I'm setting up with PD Yu Jae Il.

542
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,390
Sounds like Yu Jae Il failed to cast Sunwoo Hae.

543
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:56,380
I summarized all the novels.

544
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,660
Commit them to memory.

545
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,190
And bring it up naturally in a meeting later.

546
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,820
You need shared conversation topics.

547
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,890
PD Yu would never use me.

548
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:08,280
Even the most popular talents line up for him.

549
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,030
Even a one-off appearance
on PD Yu Jae Il's show would be amazing.

550
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,470
A regular spot would be even better.

551
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:17,000
Better not get my hopes up.

552
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:21,040
Let's get down and go eat something tasty.

553
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,440
Sure.

554
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,510
Looks tasty.

555
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,090
Is it okay to order makgeolli?

556
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:38,260
Makgeolli is all carbs.

557
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,150
So sweet and tasty.

558
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,140
Order away! Let's have it.

559
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,400
I won't drink it.

560
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,300
I won't dip in shrimp sauce,
load up on greens, and eat mostly meat.

561
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,400
Tae Rin, you don't want to do variety, do you?

562
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,850
I'm just not confident about showing my real self.

563
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:07,100
- Plus, I'm not fun.
- You're so fun.

564
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,830
Don't worry.

565
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:13,260
Variety is the best way to raise
public awareness of you.

566
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:18,580
I don't want to force you to do
something you don't want to do.

567
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,090
You're like my mom.

568
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:22,620
Forcing me to do stuff
under the guise that it's for me.

569
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:24,210
I've never had a daughter like you.

570
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:26,170
You're so mean, Mom.

571
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:32,390
What remains is delivering Jin Mu Yeong to PD Yu.

572
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:36,330
What if you cried in front of Jin Mu Yeong?

573
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:38,510
People did everything for me
when I cried as a little girl.

574
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:41,410
Stop joking around.

575
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,820
Do you think it'd work even at 34 years old?

576
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,960
I think...

577
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:51,700
it'd work, in a different way.

578
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,590
Is there a way?

579
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,540
 The customer can't answer the call right now. 

580
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,030
Why are they not picking up?

581
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:07,060
 

582
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,530
Gosh, you scared me.

583
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:13,490
What's up? Why are you here?

584
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:17,180
I guess you're still not high enough
to know about unofficial personnel matters.

585
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,840
What were you again? An underling?

586
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,500
Team Leader.

587
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:23,050
- When did you start coming around?
- Today.

588
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,930
Working two jobs since the economy is down.

589
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,770
Whatever.

590
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,920
You're not inheriting our company, are you?

591
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,380
It's not a management training, right?

592
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,730
Why don't you consider that
I might be here to debut?

593
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:39,690
Hilarious. Are you a comic?

594
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,820
Hello, CEO.

595
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,350
Why is Seok Joo here?

596
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:49,400
It's time for him to learn the
ropes of the company.

597
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,240
If my son becomes your boss,
will you quit, Team Leader Sung?

598
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,100
Please don't go anywhere, ma'am.

599
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,310
Oh, what about PD Yu? Did you
mention your school connection?

600
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,870
You went to SNU.

601
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:03,500
Well, I did drop out, to be exact.

602
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,100
- I mentioned it, though.
- Bringing up SNU for that...

603
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:11,950
Take care.

604
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,200
 

605
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,200
Can I get my hopes up? A regular
on a Yu Jae Il variety show?

606
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,800
I'll try my best to make it happen.

607
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,870
Yes, PD.

608
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,810
It's Yu Jae Il.

609
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:29,980
Do you have a date on the books?

610
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,920
My daughter starts exam prep next week.

611
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,140
I see your daughter is a fan, too.

612
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,350
Oh, your daughter is the fan...

613
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,170
Yes, I see.

614
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:45,320
I'll set a date and call you. Okay.

615
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:51,590
What if he doesn't pick up any calls
unless it makes him money?

616
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:54,160
I'll go in person if he doesn't pick up.

617
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,540
 

618
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:11,990
Why does he keep putting up the sign wrong?

619
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,100
- You called?
- Yeah.

620
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,060
They want to put some flowers inside, too.

621
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,050
Oh, hello.

622
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:24,230
You can speak to him.

623
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,070
- Good luck.
- Bye.

624
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,800
You want to put real flowers inside the cafe?

625
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,100
Yes.

626
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,530
If you want to use flowers,
how about using preserved ones?

627
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:36,670
It'll feel like real flowers.

628
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:39,810
What are preserved flowers?

629
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:42,890
Gosh, look at him selling.

630
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:43,910
That guy...

631
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:45,700
Just a moment. Let me show you.

632
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:49,710
We most typically use hydrangea or roses.

633
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,120
Take a look.

634
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,180
 

635
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:53,480
- Just a moment. I'm sorry.
- Okay.

636
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,010
Excuse me.

637
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,340
Hello?

638
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:01,280
Gosh, you finally picked up.

639
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,030
Where are you?

640
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:30,640
You told me to call, yet you won't pick up.

641
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,320
That's wrong, no?

642
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,700
Why? Something wrong with your cactus?

643
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:41,300
Doesn't seem like you're here about that.

644
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:45,960
- Are you hungry?
- Who do you think I am, sir?

645
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,850
As someone who comes looking for me for a reason.

646
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,090
 

647
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,790
Jin Mu Yeong.

648
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:06,820
How could I have forgotten this?

649
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,560
You kept that?

650
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:11,360
I paid for it, so I couldn't throw it out.

651
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,160
And the bookstore I bought it from is gone.

652
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,910
That bookstore is gone?

653
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:18,420
The publisher went bankrupt.

654
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,560
- Okay?
- And it's out of print.

655
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,350
And?

656
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:24,800
What's your point?

657
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,370
That's the kind of book this is.

658
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:31,060
But there's still a fan. A high schooler.

659
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:34,730
I'm so proud, and my heart goes out to her.

660
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,430
Won't you meet her once?

661
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:41,240
A high schooler?

662
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,260
Should I beg in tears?

663
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:45,590
Yes. Go for it.

664
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:49,080
That was just a matter of speech.

665
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,950
It's just a fan. Not even an appearance request.

666
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,690
Could you?

667
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,450
Sure, I'll meet her.

668
00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:09,280
This easily?

669
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,620
Want me to make it harder?

670
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,680
I love how easy that was.

671
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,540
 Good day. 

672
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,130
Let me help. Move these?

673
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:25,080
They're heavy.

674
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,310
I'm strong. Really.

675
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:29,630
Plus, you hurt your hand.

676
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:33,700
Sure.

677
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,500
Lift at my count of three.

678
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,720
One, two...

679
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,380
Why did you touch me?

680
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:04,810
Touch what?

681
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:07,100
I mean...

682
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:11,300
you said lift at a count of three,
but you lifted at two...

683
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,650
I got spooked.

684
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:20,890
Why did you lift at two?

685
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,770
I'll do it.

686
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,100
Why is your ear so red?

687
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,400
- Do you have a fever?
- Don't.

688
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,130
What did I do?

689
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:40,200
- When you-
- Don't do it.

690
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,070
Let me do it. Go and rest.

691
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,590
So much spilled.

692
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:48,380
I know.

693
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:57,170
So, you'll act like you know me
out in the open now?

694
00:47:57,170 --> 00:47:59,700
You're so...

695
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,290
You sure speak your mind.

696
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:04,370
So honest.

697
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:08,680
You used to be like that, if I remember correctly.

698
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:18,950
Whoa, it's nice.

699
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:46,390
I so wanted to live neatly organized.

700
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,060
Like that.

701
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:35,390
Stop with the nonsense.

702
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:37,540
And finish cleaning up.

703
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:55,840
Yes, Executive Director.

704
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:58,150
Okay, I'll be right there.

705
00:49:58,150 --> 00:49:59,620
Yes.

706
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:04,000
I need to get back to work.

707
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,210
Just a moment.

708
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:13,910
Pick up my calls.

709
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,500
I'm leaving.

710
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:23,600
I brought a bribe in case you said no.

711
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:27,130
Wear these if you get hurt.

712
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,090
I've never seen such ugly gloves.

713
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:36,830
My heart behind getting you
the gloves is beautiful.

714
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:39,510
Suck it up. Bye.

715
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:48,500
She left without cleaning up.

716
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,920
- Your drinking snacks.
 - Thank you. 

717
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,490
Bon appétit.

718
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:59,190
Why do you keep looking at your phone?

719
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:04,840
I thought Nu Ri manages the
flower shop's social media.

720
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,950
I'm waiting for a call. I'd get in trouble
if I don't pick up again.

721
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:11,400
Wow, someone's got a nasty temper.

722
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,000
- Something like that.
- Sometimes, you enable it.

723
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,760
Carry your phone with you.

724
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,330
Okay.

725
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:20,060
I'm meeting a Jin Mu Yeong fan soon.

726
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:21,730
Oh... What?

727
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:23,890
Why did you decide that alone?
What about my opinion?

728
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:25,110
I'm your proxy.

729
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:27,300
Don't worry, I'll go myself.

730
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:30,800
Then, why did you decline all the
money-making casting offers?

731
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:36,400
I thought she'd call.

732
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,520
 2 p.m. on Saturday at a cafe. 

733
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,220
 Attaching a map. 

734
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,960
You're up.

735
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,970
Drink the juice.

736
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:54,660
You're even working at home.

737
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:57,390
You're crazy for money.

738
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:59,110
Nu Ri.

739
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:01,150
Do kids your age read books?

740
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:02,820
Books?

741
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,120
No, why?

742
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,220
Apparently, I have a fan.

743
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,660
It sounds like she's your age.

744
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,700
I'm amused.

745
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:14,840
I had forgotten about the fact that I wrote a book.

746
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,000
Oppa, didn't you write a novel
to read to me when I was little?

747
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
But wasn't it too hard for a kid in kindergarten?

748
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,110
It's better than deciding the level
arbitrarily and writing something childish.

749
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:28,610
You should've met my level if it was for me.

750
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:31,480
Aigoo, you fell asleep every time
I tried to read it to you.

751
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,420
Whatever.

752
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:37,080
What?

753
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:40,590
I heard your wish comes true
if this breaks off by itself.

754
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:42,610
What did you wish for that
it didn't come true yet?

755
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:44,770
You listening to me.

756
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:47,560
I bet it'll never break off.

757
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,930
No, never...

758
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:52,670
Never, ever.

759
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:58,370
Hang up the laundry.

760
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:00,110
Yes, PD.

761
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:04,940
Yes, all good. Yes.

762
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:08,240
Yes, take your time. Okay.

763
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:12,660
You made it.

764
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:16,130
What's up with the flowers?

765
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:19,380
Wow, fan service?

766
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,300
It's for you.

767
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,600
- You used to like these flowers.
- I did?

768
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,530
- Want something to drink?
- Yeah.

769
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:32,800
Oh, the guests are running late.

770
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,430
- They're stuck in traffic.
- Guests?

771
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:38,810
A variety show PD and his daughter
are coming together.

772
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,870
You'd lose nothing by getting to know him.

773
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:46,750
No, there's way more you'd gain in many ways.

774
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:52,000
He's been in the industry a long time,
so would he know you're Sunwoo Hae...

775
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,490
No, I don't think he'll recognize you.

776
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,760
How pretty.

777
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,610
"There's a fan who wants to meet me."

778
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:05,340
I'm an idiot for believing that.

779
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:10,720
Hey.

780
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,810
Where are you going?

781
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:18,450
Hey.

782
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,700
You can't just leave like this.

783
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:25,150
There's no reason for me to stay
for something like this.

784
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:28,850
Do you think I lied about your fan?

785
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:31,390
Your fan is a teenager and a high schooler.

786
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:32,610
Is it weird that she's coming with a guardian?

787
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:35,760
Seems important to Sung Je Yeon
that the guardian is a PD.

788
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,840
Well, I won't deny it.

789
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,510
It was always that kind of a meeting,

790
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:47,630
but I'm paying for it for wanting it
to be a personal occasion.

791
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:51,040
It can't be completely personal
between classmates in the working world.

792
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,030
It's work and personal both.
You're not paying for anything.

793
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:55,720
I said I didn't want to be used
for strangers' nostalgia,

794
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,710
but I tried to use you for my own nostalgia.

795
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:05,100
My request was for you to come here as a writer.

796
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,800
- What's the problem?
- The problem?

797
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,670
There's no problem. What could be the problem?

798
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:22,800
To you, am I just foam on the surface
to scoop up for your work?

799
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,890
Then, should we have a heart-to-heart
after all these years?

800
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:29,000
Were we that meaningful as classmates?

801
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,500
If we were, would you believe it?

802
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:41,670
Aigoo, you're here.

803
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:42,960
Hello, PD.

804
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,570
Hello.

805
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,410
- A side effect of the profession.
- You weren't happy to see them?

806
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:52,060
You made it.

807
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,010
Oh, my gosh...

808
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:55,930
Who's...

809
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,030
Hello, I'm Jin Mu Yeong. Nice to meet you.

810
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:03,420
I'm Yu Jae Il.

811
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:06,900
You must've been hiding
because you're so handsome.

812
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,870
I'm applying to be a literature student.

813
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:13,700
My Korean teacher says I'm talented,

814
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:17,050
and that I should study it in college.

815
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:19,700
Are you using a pen name?

816
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:22,650
- May I ask what your real name is?
- Dad!

817
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:24,870
Don't invade his privacy.

818
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:30,430
Would you be open to reading my writing later?

819
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:33,780
Why are you asking a busy person such a thing?

820
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:39,450
If you need my opinion,

821
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:40,970
I'm not sure if it'd be helpful...

822
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:43,570
It's already so helpful!

823
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:48,200
How did you become a novelist?

824
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:53,420
I was hoping to just make
a few bucks when I started.

825
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:55,670
Doesn't sound like there was a compelling reason.

826
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:57,800
Dad, please.

827
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:03,160
I totally understand your reasoning.

828
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,180
I want to make money through writing, too.

829
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:07,200
I plan to enter writing contests, too.

830
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:11,720
He was popular for always winning
prestigious writing contests.

831
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:15,090
Oh, right. You became a professional
writer in high school, didn't you?

832
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:17,500
What was he like?

833
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:22,400
He had a vibe back then.

834
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:28,050
And others were hesitant
to approach him because of it.

835
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:31,290
You didn't know that, did you?

836
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:34,820
I didn't.

837
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:38,840
Doesn't he look similar to Sunwoo Hae?

838
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,100
You hear that from time to time, don't you?

839
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:47,400
He's missing a little something to say
he looks like him. Don't you think?

840
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,100
Me?

841
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,380
Who's Sunwoo Hae?

842
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,970
Stop acting so old.

843
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:58,130
Why do you keep lashing out at me today?

844
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:00,700
Drop the pretense. What's with you?

845
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:02,700
I owe you big time.

846
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:05,900
You manage Mo Tae Rin, right?
Let's have a meeting.

847
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,850
Thank you.

848
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:11,930
Thank you. See you.

849
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:14,200
It was nice to meet you.

850
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:17,380
Take care.

851
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,810
A PD who outright says let's have a meeting,

852
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:24,070
and you who accepted that...

853
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:27,230
Am I supposed to say no?

854
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:30,240
How could I get anything done
if I worry about all that?

855
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,410
Sure.

856
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:36,050
Good job pretending to be a classmate
who's happy to see me.

857
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:38,370
What a thing to say.

858
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:46,460
It doesn't look like you're happy to see me again.

859
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:53,340
Let me ask you one thing.

860
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:58,280
Would you have bridged the connection

861
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,850
even if the guardian was not a PD?

862
00:59:01,850 --> 00:59:03,280
What is it you want to say?

863
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,800
I'm just curious.

864
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,900
To know if you're like that.

865
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:15,600
I'm curious about what kind of dreams 
shining ones like you dream.

866
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:25,350
What kind of person did you expect me to be?

867
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:30,970
Thanks for staying today.

868
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:34,570
I don't know what it was like for you,
but I owe you one.

869
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:37,880
Thanks for making time.

870
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:40,820
I hope you do well.

871
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:43,680
Sure.

872
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,060
You, too.

873
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:13,700
She asked me to delete this.

874
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,750
I can see why.

875
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:18,510
You should've taken it better. What is this?

876
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:22,680
 

877
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,740
Run to the store and get some green onions.

878
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:28,910
And get some fresh air.

879
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:30,360
Green onion, my foot.

880
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,480
It bothers me to watch you space out like this.

881
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,840
Go now since we don't have customers.

882
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,630
- Go get some fresh air.
- We're out?

883
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,880
 What kind of a person did you expect me to be? 

884
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,370
What is this?

885
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:41,630
What's going on?

886
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:46,900
Why are you here?

887
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:48,480
So...

888
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:54,680
I didn't finish what I had to say earlier.

889
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,560
So...

890
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:02,060
The flowers from earlier.

891
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:07,810
I trimmed the stems at an angle,
so you just need to put them in a vase.

892
01:02:07,810 --> 01:02:10,470
I figured you'd at least have a plastic bottle.

893
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:12,330
You can recycle for this purpose.

894
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:15,330
Change out the water once a day.

895
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:21,930
You're here to say that?

896
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:25,100
Yes.

897
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:29,090
That's that... and...

898
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:37,020
Sunwoo Hae?

899
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:48,240
You really want people
to misunderstand, don't you?

900
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,720
Misunderstand what?

901
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,800
People will misunderstand
if they see me with a man.

902
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,670
I don't want the company to know
about my personal life...

903
01:02:56,670 --> 01:02:58,630
Hey.

904
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:00,630
What happened to your shirt?

905
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:04,410
You're way too strong.

906
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:09,380
I told you I'm strong.

907
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:12,530
Why are you wearing clothes like this?

908
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:14,310
It'll melt away in the rain.

909
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:16,200
I had this for ten years.

910
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,580
- So thrifty.
- I am like that.

911
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,510
How did you know where I work?

912
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,200
Wasn't this an invitation to come find you?

913
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:30,150
It wasn't.

914
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,220
So, why did you come here?

915
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:35,330
Wearing an apron...

916
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:39,380
I was so out of it.

917
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:42,690
Do I look too indecent?

918
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:45,220
Well, it's not that bad...

919
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,090
Can't we...

920
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:58,000
see each other as much as we want now?

921
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:09,100
No, I guess.

922
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:39,860
What was that?

923
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:42,910
Just...

924
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:47,860
to say it was nice to see you.

925
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:52,940
Bye.

926
01:04:59,950 --> 01:05:01,520
Hey!

927
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:11,220
 ♫ My breathing gets faster and faster ♫ 

928
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:14,530
Why don't you buy me dinner
if you're happy to see me?

929
01:05:14,530 --> 01:05:16,010
And drinks, too.

930
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:20,100
We're not 19 anymore.

931
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:28,240
 ♫ I barely spit it out ♫ 

932
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:35,150
 ♫ Thoughts of you spill out ♫ 

933
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:39,330
 ♫ I try to swallow it back ♫ 

934
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:46,700
 ♫ And I can't fight through my memories of you ♫ 

935
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:57,300
 ♫ Hiding in the time that's slipping away ♫ 

936
01:06:09,030 --> 01:06:13,680
 ♫ Without any thoughts ♫ 

937
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:19,000
 ♫ As if nothing matters ♫ 

938
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:23,380
 

939
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:26,180
 ♫ As if we had nothing ♫
