1
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,660
 

2
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,680
Why isn't it working?

3
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,900
Did water go in?

4
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,290
My dad bought it for me.

5
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,690
Is it broken?

6
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,830
It paused for a moment.

7
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,770
 Director! 

8
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,660
 Director! 

9
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,470
Excuse me! Sorry!

10
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,410
Director!

11
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,080
You ruined a good shot. What's wrong?

12
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,320
Wol Baek can't come.

13
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,200
- What?
- He has chickenpox.

14
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,390
How about tomorrow's shoot then?
How about the day after?

15
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,990
What do I do?

16
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,300
This is too far. We can't come back here!

17
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,050
Hey, you.

18
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,220
Do you live here?

19
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,180
Did your parents go to work?

20
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,190
My mom went to work at the factory

21
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,450
and my dad wanted to become a poet, so Mom...

22
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:24,860
He doesn't come home often,
so I don't know where he is. Why?

23
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,120
Listen to you.

24
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,680
Your answers are so smart.

25
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,400
Can you give me your parents' numbers?

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,200
We're filming a movie and holding
an audition on location.

27
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,110
 The fact that chance came to me, 

28
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:45,780
 was it good luck or misfortune? 

29
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,840
Hey, hey. Where did you ever find a kid like that?

30
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,900
He's really good. Good job.

31
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,590
- He's so good.
- He's good.

32
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,750
- Really?
- Yes.

33
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:06,270
 ♫ The sun will rise brightly, a great day for me ♫ 

34
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,110
Hae!

35
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,670
- Mom!
- I'm home!

36
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,360
Mom!

37
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,820
My wonderful son!

38
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,370
My gosh!

39
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,740
Let's move to Seoul for good.

40
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,650
All we have to do is become successful.

41
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,110
I'll be your manager.

42
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,570
Then, we'll be together all the time.

43
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,310
What? If we go to Seoul,
I can stay with you every day?

44
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,910
Of course.

45
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,320
I wanted to give you this, Hae. Ta-da!

46
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,950
- Wow! Shoes!
- Open it.

47
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,620
 I held onto this unknown opportunity. 

48
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,120
 I thought it might hold our family together. 

49
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,300
Yes!

50
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,820
Try them on.

51
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,820
 The Best Actor award goes to Sunwoo Hae
for his work in "Beautiful Moonlight." 

52
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,810
 He's only 11. The youngest winner. 

53
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,570
 Hello, I'm Sunwoo Hae, who played Wol Baek. 

54
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,310
 I'd like to share this honor
with all the children. 

55
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,830
 Thank you! 

56
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,370
 ♫ Grow big, grow big! ♫ 

57
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,550
 It's not. 

58
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,350
 You should be pure for your wish to come true. 

59
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,080
 But because of you, our parents lost pure hope. 

60
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,090
 I didn't go anywhere... 

61
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,310
 I'm so tired. 

62
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,730
 Don't leave a scar. 

63
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,590
 

64
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,580
Off the show?

65
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,520
Why is Hae getting off the show?

66
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,520
He has grown a lot in a year.

67
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,040
No one would think that Tae Rin
and Hae are only a year apart.

68
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,420
- Director,
- Ma'am...

69
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,740
please give this another thought.
Please, Director.

70
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,750
Ma'am, I'll call you for a good project next time.

71
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,930
When next time, Director?

72
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,430
Mom!

73
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,780
Mom, we're going to buy
a new pair of sneakers, right?

74
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,240
You have to go on a diet starting today.

75
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,170
You need to be smaller, the older you get. Got it?

76
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,390
 I couldn't find a reason to quit 

77
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,840
 and I couldn't even quit. 

78
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,640
Hello, Director.

79
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,510
That movie, "Harry Potter." You know it, right?

80
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,060
I'll make a Korean version.

81
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,800
- Really?
- You're the first one I'm offering it to.

82
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,960
You have to grab it.

83
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,110
W-What can I do?

84
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:39,840
My Hae became a star, thanks to you, Director.

85
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,720
 Fraud usually starts with trusting. 

86
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,930
Would you like to go out to eat?

87
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:47,510
 

88
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,550
 Believing that this will work out. 

89
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,850
 Trust that this is real. 

90
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,010
 - Without trust, 
- That scammer.

91
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,810
 we wouldn't have gone into debt. 

92
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,990
Wait until I catch you.

93
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,670
If you didn't believe him, to begin with...

94
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,730
It would've been fine
if you were suspicious of him.

95
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,430
How stupid.

96
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,380
How dare you?

97
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,190
I'm sorry...

98
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,610
I must be crazy.

99
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,510
My Hae, I'm sorry. So sorry.

100
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,270
Your dad is out there looking for him.

101
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,150
He'll catch him soon.

102
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,770
That's all we need to do.

103
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,640
That's all we need to do.

104
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,730
Sorry, it's my fault.

105
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,780
Because I'm small...

106
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,750
No. Because I grew up.

107
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,450
Do you know how much I love you?

108
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,280
You trust Dad and me, right?

109
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,750
You have to, okay?

110
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,730
I do.

111
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,260
 I think I learned too early on. 

112
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,600
 That there's also comfort in not trusting. 

113
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,590
 Just because it sparkles, 

114
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,490
 not everything is a jewel. 

115
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,760
 The victim of the A-Entertainment
fraud case, actor Sunwoo Hae's mother 

116
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,530
 was found dead in her house this afternoon. 

117
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,110
 Sunwoo Hae, who found the body at the scene, 

118
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,740
 is standing by alone at her funeral service. 

119
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,840
 I think I thought this back then. 

120
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,120
 Step aside. Move, move! 

121
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,360
Seriously...

122
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,010
Film him. Take the picture.

123
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,500
 You think you can make it go away by dying? 

124
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,660
 - Where are adults?
- Speak! Speak! 

125
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,250
 - Where are they?
- Forget it. 

126
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,930
 You must know where your dad is! 

127
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,790
 Are you his dad? 

128
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,710
 What the hell? 

129
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,660
 Look, are you his dad? 

130
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,960
 Look, look. The dad. 

131
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,690
 - Give me my money back!
- Stop filming! 

132
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,680
 Here, here. 

133
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,270
 Look, look over here. 

134
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,110
 That I don't know how I'm
supposed to act at times like that. 

135
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:09,500
 Perhaps, I was waiting
for someone to yell out "Cut!" 

136
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,210
 Cut! Okay. 

137
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,230
Mom! Let's go home!

138
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,710
 The filming is bound to end at some point 

139
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,800
 and that was the end of acting that scene. 

140
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,250
 I told myself that this is some scene. 

141
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,180
 That I was playing that character. 

142
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,820
 ♫ Happy birthday to you ♫ 

143
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,020
 ♫ My dear Sunwoo Hae ♫ 

144
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,070
 That my acting was all right. 

145
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,100
 That it wasn't too bad. 

146
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,040
Haven't dreamt in a while...

147
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,150
 Due to harsh weather in the coastlines, 

148
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,260
 many ships are stalled at the dock. 

149
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,000
 If you're planning a domestic trip, 

150
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,250
 consider heading to the
mountains, not the ocean. 

151
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,890
 Enjoy the refreshing mountain air. 

152
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,120
 Take in the greenery. 

153
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,540
I gave you our schedule.

154
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,620
Tae Rin has a shoot in the
countryside for the documentary.

155
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,750
Shoot as soon as we come back to Seoul?

156
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,750
And an emotional scene at that?

157
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,140
Gosh, how could they put
together a schedule like this?

158
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,270
Je Yeon.

159
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,140
The CEO is asking for you.

160
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,790
Is this a blessing in disguise?

161
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,810
People will watch more with
this being the talk of the town.

162
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,460
CEO, you know that video clip that was posted?

163
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,850
I've tried to contact them,
but it's not going through.

164
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,500
This shouldn't be happening, don't you think?

165
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,580
- A sensitive and personal issue like that.
- I took it down.

166
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,740
It was such an annoying process.

167
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,220
Thank you.

168
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,230
Thank you so much! I'm so relieved.

169
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,100
The reporters would never take it down.

170
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,740
There was no problem with the
article that was initially released.

171
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,700
That asshole with the video clip
in the follow-up article was the problem.

172
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,620
Pay close attention. Try to stay chummy.

173
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,450
In case something else breaks out.

174
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,940
There were rumors about Sunwoo Hae
back in school due to his financial difficulties.

175
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,030
But everything was false.

176
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,290
I think he just lived his life to the fullest...

177
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,930
Did you grow attached to him, and not Tae Rin?

178
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,050
Seems like you're getting involved
in irrelevant matters.

179
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,720
The staff got him to sign his contract, right?

180
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,160
It'll be tricky if he decides
to pull out over this.

181
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,020
Check it yourself.

182
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,860
Okay.

183
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,170
You didn't get him to sign a contract?

184
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,300
I know we started all of a sudden,

185
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,270
but you shouldn't have forgotten this.

186
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,210
 Can you get him to sign it for me? 

187
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,860
I'll email it to you.

188
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,150
I don't want to. Never. Never.

189
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,480
 

190
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,620
Hearts?

191
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,930
Was he like this?

192
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:37,260
Did the shop owner go somewhere?

193
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,320
I just got here, but the door is locked.

194
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,600
He must be away.

195
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,700
He must be delivering happiness.

196
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,440
Oh, boy...

197
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,740
But who are you?

198
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,270
Who are you? What brings you here?

199
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,910
I brought kimchi...

200
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,490
I'm here to see my colleague...

201
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,110
No, a friend. I mean, a classmate.

202
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,310
Oh, really?

203
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:12,340
Well, I'm Hae's dad.

204
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,340
- My gosh. Hello.
- Hi.

205
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,040
- Yes, hello.
- Hello.

206
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,900
I'm...

207
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,620
Aigoo, I forgot my wallet.

208
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,750
I'm filming with Hae right now.

209
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,860
 

210
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,210
It's my noona's company...

211
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,200
So, is Hae doing okay?

212
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,820
Something negative was online.

213
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,960
You must've come out of concern.

214
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,300
Well, I'm not sure if I have the right...

215
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,940
Son!

216
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,750
Did you deliver happiness?

217
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,440
You came.

218
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,750
- Why did you come?
- Huh?

219
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,240
Oh, right. I made some kimchi.

220
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,910
Kimchi is a must at home.

221
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,230
I have kimchi at home.

222
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,480
Leave. I'm closing soon.

223
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,590
Hey, the sun is up high. Why close...

224
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,670
I'm good since I got to see you.

225
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,850
- Please come in.
- No, no.

226
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,840
Oh, here. Give it to him for me.

227
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,030
Hey, son, don't come out. I'm leaving.

228
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:21,370
 He must be busy. See you soon. 

229
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,700
 - Bye now.
- Bye. 

230
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,710
Where is it...

231
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,400
So...

232
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,350
are you supposed to recycle withered flowers?

233
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,890
Withered flowers? That'd be regular trash.

234
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,360
The blue roses you gave me last time withered.

235
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,490
Hey, you still have that in a vase?

236
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,640
Throw it out. You're being rude
to the flower, too.

237
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,530
Why are you laughing?

238
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,040
I'm just in a good mood.

239
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,500
Sung Je Yeon.

240
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,060
Are you awkward with me, by chance?

241
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,950
No. I'm not. Why would I?

242
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,570
You're not.

243
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,720
Then, you feel 1. uncomfortable.
2. You feel sorry for me.

244
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,880
Why do you say such a thing...

245
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,210
Neither.

246
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,110
Maybe I shouldn't have asked her to hug me.

247
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:56,390
About the video clip. The one with the article.

248
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,510
Yeah?

249
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,670
The CEO took it down.

250
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,220
I thanked her in your place.

251
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,730
So, you don't have to worry.

252
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,420
What am I thankful for again?

253
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,990
The reporters won't take it down for you.

254
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,730
I'm thankful since she did pull it off.

255
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:26,340
I do think the timing is really strange for this.

256
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,710
What?

257
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,980
The appearance contract.

258
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:35,100
I mean, it happened to come out today.

259
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,960
You came here for this, huh?

260
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,570
You'll...

261
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,680
sign it, right?

262
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,670
Just get to the point from now on.

263
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,320
Don't try so hard, beating around the bush.

264
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,300
I mean, it's not that... I guess it's true, but...

265
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,030
Gosh, I'm just so easy to kick around, huh?

266
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,760
I imagine you've been going through
the wringer these past few days.

267
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,600
I'm sure that's why you initially
turned down doing the show.

268
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,390
Actually, I didn't think that far.

269
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,370
I didn't know all of that would still remain.

270
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,290
I'm sorry.

271
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:28,350
If you're considering dropping out even now...

272
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,680
I'll do better.

273
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,280
No.

274
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,310
I'm fine as long as the program
isn't negatively affected by me.

275
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:42,220
I'll leave it in your hands until the end.

276
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,620
Thank you.

277
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,790
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

278
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,830
- Hey, Nu Ri.
 - Oppa, don't you need to explain? 

279
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,190
 Looks like there's a filming. 

280
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,420
Where are you?

281
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,260
I'll explain.

282
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,200
Oppa, you've really lost it over money.

283
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,110
I heard people pay to be on TV these days.

284
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:29,060
- And you wouldn't do it if it costs you money.
- Right on.

285
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,660
Why would a broadcasting station
advertise a random flower shop?

286
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,750
Nope.

287
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,890
- What is it, then?
- That's what I mean.

288
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,130
What are you asking?

289
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:41,070
I just wanted to criticize you.
It seemed like you were crazy for money.

290
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,360
Excuse me.

291
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,920
Yes.

292
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,050
Here's the ice cream you ordered.

293
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,730
- Thank you.
- And...

294
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,070
I won't take the payment.

295
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,980
You always pass out flowers.

296
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,830
Thank you. I'll enjoy this.

297
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,650
Thank you.

298
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,620
Come on.

299
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,430
My childhood story will also air.

300
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:12,390
You didn't look like a child when you were little.

301
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,620
Do you still scatter your leftover
flowers in the area?

302
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,730
That'd get you in huge trouble.

303
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:22,460
Eat it. Before it melts.

304
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,010
Eat a lot.

305
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,830
Is it tasty?

306
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,500
I thought I'd pick up some coffee for the PD.

307
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,060
Who?

308
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,190
Hello. I'm his sister.

309
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,090
Are you shooting with Oppa?

310
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:45,120
You really grew a lot.

311
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,960
Hello. I'm the manager
of the actress he's shooting with.

312
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,740
But how do you know me?

313
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,390
Did you become that close to my oppa?

314
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,850
I guess you don't remember.

315
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,770
I used to read to you when you were little.

316
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,720
Book? Book...

317
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,400
 A small stone slipped away... 

318
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,060
 I like her, too. 

319
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:18,380
Unni, fighting on your shoot.

320
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,050
Share it with her.

321
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,170
What's with her...

322
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,490
It was great to see you again.

323
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,100
She really grew a lot.

324
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,970
Sounds like she didn't see it.

325
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,630
That's good.

326
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,200
- This was you, Oppa?
- Yeah.

327
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,990
- Why? Can't it?
- What happened to you?

328
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,630
What do I look like that everyone keeps saying...

329
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,180
- Seriously...
 - Hello, I'm Sunwoo Hae... 

330
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,490
You always seemed huge to me.

331
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,770
But he's so small.

332
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,380
But he's so cute.

333
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,530
Aren't I cute now?

334
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:04,360
- When will you bring me your report card?
- You're cute.

335
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,430
You're the cutest in the world.

336
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,520
- The cutest in the world.
- It's getting late.

337
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,810
- I don't think it's late yet.
- Hey.

338
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,980
That Unni from earlier. It's her. Isn't she?

339
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,500
Come here.

340
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,930
I'm right!

341
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:22,150
What grade did you get that you keep hiding it?

342
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,470
Hey, Eun Nu Ri. Talk to me.

343
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:30,270
Hey, the weather is too nice
for me to just go home.

344
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,480
 How come Je Yeon isn't picking up my calls? 

345
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,090
How would I know?

346
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,480
 I feel like she has a hobby, but 

347
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,820
 she won't tell her coworkers. 

348
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,620
She didn't even go hiking with me today.

349
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:49,350
So, I have nothing to do after.

350
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,270
So...

351
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,940
why are you telling me all this? Are you bored?

352
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,280
 Yeah. I'm off today. 

353
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,180
 I can come hang out, right? 

354
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,330
Oppa, you're bored, too.

355
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,590
Don't you feel lonely now that
the bustle of the film crew is gone?

356
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,800
 Must I see you today when
we'll meet in a few days, anyway? 

357
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,670
You'll have some coffee, right?
I'll bring you some.

358
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:16,450
I keep telling you not to come. You know?

359
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,400
Hello? Hello-

360
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,410
She hung up.

361
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:48,500
- Aigoo, hello.
- Hello.

362
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,650
It's our first time here.
Can we ask you for directions?

363
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,060
I'm sorry, but I'm lost, too.

364
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,950
Oh, my! So, you are!

365
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,980
But you have such great energy.

366
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,390
Oh, thank you.

367
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,510
Are you in the arts?

368
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,760
It looks like your ancestors
accrued lots of good karma.

369
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,770
Do you know my ancestors?

370
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:13,660
I told you not to go around alone, babe.

371
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:35,060
So, you had a friend with you.

372
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,570
He looks like a stranger. Can we help?

373
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,580
Want me to be a friend?

374
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,070
They talk to people who are alone.

375
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,590
Thank you for helping me out.

376
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:53,360
I tend to get shy.

377
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,730
I helped out because it made me nervous.

378
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,750
You were nervous?

379
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,700
In case you'd cry again.

380
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:05,050
Sounds like you have a low emotional threshold.

381
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:07,500
What do you mean by threshold?

382
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,930
The lowest level of stimuli needed
to elicit a response.

383
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,190
Fins?

384
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,910
Oh, I free dive.

385
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,350
You must hold your breath well.

386
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,760
The end.

387
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,370
Too short.

388
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,660
Pardon?

389
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,170
Over there, a long banner.

390
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,630
Will you read it for me?

391
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:37,260
 

392
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,290
You're shy, but you wanted to speak up.

393
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,380
It must be tough for you.

394
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,640
Why do you worry about me?

395
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,770
Are you coming onto me right now?

396
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:57,160
You almost got picked up earlier.

397
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,920
This isn't about coming onto you.

398
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,000
But you spoke casually and
called me "babe" earlier.

399
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,100
To pretend like I was with you.

400
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,690
But "babe" was a bit too much.

401
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,420
Where are you headed?

402
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,660
I hope it's close.

403
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:20,050
If I left you in the middle of the street,
you might get picked up again.

404
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,410
Yes, this is my destination.

405
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:36,560
You know you have map and
ride share apps on your phone.

406
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,450
Why don't you befriend
those guys and find your way?

407
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,880
Don't stare.

408
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,990
You'll bore a hole in my face.

409
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,500
Are you always this friendly?

410
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,400
Watch out for people like me.
Don't just blindly follow.

411
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,230
Move. Don't block the entrance.

412
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,220
You move, Oppa. Don't block the entrance.

413
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:02,090
She's so strong...

414
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,850
Does she take a herbal tonic?

415
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,670
- What's with you?
- I know, huh?

416
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:10,560
We were headed to the same place.

417
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,850
What's with him?

418
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,240
"Babe."

419
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,220
"Babe"?

420
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,590
"Babe"...

421
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,630
Why are you looking for your "babe" here?

422
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,460
I wonder why he chose "babe" of all things.

423
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,990
He could've said "friend."

424
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,840
Get a hobby and don't do this here.

425
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,340
I did my hobby.

426
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,280
You want to do it with me? Free diving.

427
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,900
Why do you do that?

428
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,300
But if it was "friend,"

429
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,240
should you be close enough
to grab a drink? Like you and Je Yeon?

430
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,860
I just remembered.

431
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,030
You never listened to others
when you were little, either.

432
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,360
No.

433
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:54,300
Drinks are a waste of money.

434
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,940
Drinks? My treat. Drink with me.

435
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,570
I don't want to.

436
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,450
I knocked yours over earlier.

437
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,330
Thank you.

438
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:09,720
Then, I'll ask Sung Je Yeon
to grab a drink with me.

439
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,780
 The customer can't answer the call... 

440
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,830
She didn't pick up.

441
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,730
I texted her and said your place is on fire.

442
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,590
Will she come?

443
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:21,680
- There's something I haven't told you yet.
 - The customer can't answer... 

444
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,100
I didn't ask you.

445
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,320
Why? I'm curious.

446
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,230
- Hello?
 - What is it? 

447
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,450
I'm holding your actress hostage.

448
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,680
Come here if you want to take her.

449
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,430
Mo Tae Rin, you said there's a fire? Where?

450
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,000
Did you put it out?

451
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,780
Is anyone hurt?

452
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,420
What's with you?

453
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,460
Found it.

454
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,100
You were here, too.

455
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,390
Shouldn't I be? It's my flower shop.

456
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:55,200
Oh, right.

457
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,910
What's a flower* shop on fire?
("Kkot" means flower in Korean)

458
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,280
Fireworks.
("Bul-kkot" means fireworks)

459
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,740
Fireworks!

460
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,180
I don't believe in hitting women, but...

461
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:19,050
let me beat you up today. You scared me!

462
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,500
Where would you even hit me?

463
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,880
Gosh, seriously.

464
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,490
Let's beat you up.

465
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:29,090
- Where would you even hit me?
- Right, you don't even deserve that.

466
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,090
- Hyung.
- What, what, what?

467
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:34,610
Here. The study guide I put together.

468
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,820
Tell Nu Ri to study it. I'll test her this week.

469
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,500
Okay.

470
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,910
- What are you?
- A tutor.

471
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,900
Who are you teaching, exactly?

472
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,650
My sister.

473
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,820
Oh, really?

474
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:51,270
Why would you trust him?

475
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,250
Sung Je Yeon.

476
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,700
How come you never talk back to Hyung?

477
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,520
When?

478
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,950
But excuse me...

479
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:09,850
If you're all done here, can you leave?

480
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,480
Why are you two brothers? For real?

481
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,230
- Yes.
- No.

482
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,040
We'll get going now.

483
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,490
Let's go.

484
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,010
- Go, now?
- We're off. I'm leaving.

485
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,590
Sure, bye.

486
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,310
I'm leaving. See you tomorrow.

487
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,620
Don't come around for a while.

488
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,560
So, we're not.

489
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,010
We weren't.

490
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,610
Until when will we not be?

491
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,020
Who knows?

492
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,660
We might've been brothers if you
had bought that flower basket here.

493
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,770
Gosh, you're still holding onto that.

494
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,870
So adorable.

495
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,560
You're doing pretty well.

496
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,790
Despite that terrible article.

497
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,560
You must have a different attitude,
having hit rock bottom as a kid.

498
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:04,580
I'm well aware of what it feels
like to hit rock bottom.

499
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,010
I can't even make fun of you.

500
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:10,110
Aren't you leaving?

501
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,240
I'm going. I'm going.

502
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,530
A stranger, not your brother, is leaving.

503
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,360
Have her study it in advance.

504
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,020
Oh, so quiet...

505
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,900
- You're him, right?
- What?

506
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:40,370
You and I were the only two
who failed the driving test.

507
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:45,220
I got so chatty because I was so nervous.

508
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,960
Don't you remember me?

509
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,210
Do I have to remember you
after we failed together?

510
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:50,849
Here's your car assignment.

511
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,240
 

512
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,640
It was just last week.

513
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:01,450
I tend to remember only what I want to remember.

514
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:04,030
It's fateful we met again.

515
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,570
Let's both pass this time.

516
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,900
Don't betray me.

517
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,660
I'm so happy to make a new friend
in Korea after a long time.

518
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,500
You have such a cheery personality.

519
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,840
I'll see you again...

520
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,570
Next time.

521
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,420
I saw him last week.

522
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,650
We failed together.

523
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:30,280
Oh, the license number...

524
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,850
 

525
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,960
If I process it right away, does it
look like I've been waiting for it?

526
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,390
Because people were talking,

527
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,680
I'm sure you had suspected it.

528
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,110
You were so influential here.

529
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,220
You raised many hoobaes, too.

530
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:55,890
I didn't speak to other employees.
So, don't worry.

531
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,470
Better wrap up warmly, right?

532
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,590
I'd cheer you...

533
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,250
But not today. Perhaps tomorrow?

534
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:13,010
There was a time I wanted to be like you.

535
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,830
Quite desperately.

536
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:18,710
Don't women in this field all say that?

537
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:25,300
But more and more, I wanted
to veer off into a side path.

538
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:30,180
There was a time I liked it
because you weren't scared of me.

539
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:33,710
I became more and more fearful of you, CEO.

540
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,340
Thank you for everything.

541
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,450
Can I ask you why you're quitting?

542
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,890
Am I the only one taken by surprise?

543
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:18,970
Team Leader Sung, what kind
of company do you want to work for?

544
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,510
That's the first time I've been asked that.

545
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:26,050
But it seems like such a great question.

546
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,430
There's no company I'd want to work for.

547
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:32,470
That'd be Utopia. Not a workplace.

548
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,920
Your answer sucks.

549
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:42,200
I can't imagine the company
without you two working together.

550
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,170
At some point, it became difficult
for me to face the CEO.

551
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:52,760
I kept having questions
about the CEO's rules and methods.

552
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,750
Who do I throw a tantrum with?

553
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,170
What's your goal here at this company?

554
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:01,540
Are the CEO's beliefs also yours?

555
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,780
What are your goals, Director?

556
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:09,000
Me? To work solely based on my judgment.

557
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,650
No. To prove that my judgment was correct.

558
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,620
Get enough sleep.

559
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:33,690
No, Mom. I sent home the package.

560
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,800
Not the study room.

561
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:41,190
I bought enough masks for Auntie, too.
So, share them with her.

562
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,200
 - Goodbye! 
- Bye.

563
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,030
Okay, got it. Stop nagging.

564
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:49,140
Oh, that child from the sitcom.

565
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,090
I heard he'll be on TV.

566
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,330
 Is he still so cute? 

567
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:55,340
 Gosh, he was so cute. How did he turn out? 

568
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:59,420
I don't know. He turned out ugly.

569
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,820
Is the Director forming a new company?

570
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,050
 - Huh? 
- Huh?

571
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:09,400
Oh, nothing. I was talking to myself.
What did you say?

572
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,390
 
Wow...

573
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:15,320
I thought I was good at teaching.

574
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,800
I'm glad I didn't get into education.

575
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:27,170
Feed Nu Ri while I'm gone.

576
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,580
Where are you going?

577
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,270
To plant trees.

578
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,050
Planting trees? Do you know her grades?

579
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:33,790
Are you Spinoza?

580
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:37,520
What are you doing, Oppa?

581
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,270
Eun Nu Ri, speak.

582
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,790
Do you know Spinoza or not?

583
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:53,020
I'll really check your report card when I return.

584
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,900
Oppa! Be careful with my suitcase.

585
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,720
I took great care of it during the field trip.

586
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,530
Why are you using hers? Want me to buy you one?

587
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,730
Hey, do you really not know,
or did you get me in trouble?

588
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,420
Both?

589
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,210
A disposable camera?
I haven't seen one in a while.

590
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:27,710
I've never used one, so I was curious.

591
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,870
Right, you were a Gangnam princess.

592
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:34,480
You must've used expensive cameras.

593
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,170
Yes, I used to be a princess at one time.

594
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,610
- Let me snap one.
- Okay.

595
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,390
One, two...

596
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:45,900
So pretty! One more time.

597
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,400
So pretty.

598
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,070
Looking good.

599
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,930
Want nausea pills?

600
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,650
Or water?

601
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,800
I think I need to sleep to fix this.

602
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:16,350
 ♫ Remember, I will always be there ♫ 

603
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:23,680
 ♫ Like that moonlight in the dark of the night ♫ 

604
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:33,090
 ♫ Even if we forget at times, hidden by time ♫ 

605
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:39,520
 ♫ We will never disappear ♫ 

606
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,110
 ♫ That day, we carved it ♫ 

607
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:48,090
 ♫ It felt like sunshine ♫ 

608
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,650
Look at the ocean, too.

609
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,630
Gosh, love the view.

610
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,920
So nice!

611
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,880
The ocean, the ocean!

612
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,150
Wow! Beautiful ocean!

613
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,500
Laugh, like you're friends.

614
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,530
- Like we're friends?
- I'm not friends with her.

615
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,580
Just pretend a little.

616
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,300
 ♫ With you ♫ 

617
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,800
No, seriously.

618
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,890
No, stop!

619
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,540
No way.

620
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,450
They look like kids.

621
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,530
Great work.

622
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,160
Here.

623
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:38,400
 ♫ Smiling like back then ♫ 

624
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,090
 ♫ That day, we carved it ♫ 

625
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:47,380
 ♫ It felt like a flying bird ♫ 

626
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:52,410
 ♫ Anywhere, anytime ♫ 

627
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,580
The trash...

628
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,000
- Want to do it together?
- Let's.

629
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,600
Should we film that?

630
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,490
- Sure.
- Go together.

631
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:03,330
- Thanks.
- Let's do it together.

632
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:05,520
Why is there so much trash?

633
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,390
Yeah, why is there so much trash?

634
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,950
People littering...

635
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,580
I grew up so much.

636
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,200
I used to be so pretty.

637
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,950
Looking toward you... Look at you.

638
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:19,600
There's a scene in the water...

639
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,100
We're supposed to do it like this?

640
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,850
Yes.

641
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,780
Do it like that.

642
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,040
Like this.

643
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,580
Look, I don't remember.

644
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:39,720
The view is so beautiful.

645
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,600
- Writer, there's more.
- Thank you.

646
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:58,230
Gosh, all she does is shoot.
Why did she plan something like this?

647
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,050
Tae Rin, it's tough, right?

648
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:05,020
Gosh. Want me to say something?

649
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,980
No, it's not tough.

650
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,920
I'm glad I practiced shoveling. Don't you think?

651
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,110
Sure, if you're okay with it...

652
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:17,140
Is there anyone who can drive a truck here?

653
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,900
Me!

654
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,400
I almost drifted in a van back in the day.

655
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,870
I have a ten-year accident-free record.

656
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:29,200
I drive for work.

657
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,120
What is it?

658
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,550
Who would move the equipment
if I don't come with you?

659
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,810
I would.

660
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:54,380
This is deer country. Aren't you worried?

661
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,370
I told you I'm strong.

662
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,150
Hey.

663
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:01,010
Just try getting in.

664
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:15,310
Let me start the car again.

665
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,690
I must do this. Once again.

666
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,710
You need to shift the gear to second...

667
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,570
Get out. I'll drive.

668
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,700
One more time.

669
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,020
The sun's going down.
Will you really disrupt the shoot?

670
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:40,670
Let's see how well you do.

671
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,330
Let me guess your mood.

672
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,670
Pick.

673
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,330
1. Miffed.

674
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:03,190
2. Sulking.

675
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,820
- What?
- I have four options.

676
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,350
3. Resentful.

677
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,690
- 4...
- Whatever.

678
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:10,000
I'll go with 2.

679
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,180
Stop spewing more meaningless options.

680
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,490
You're sulking...

681
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,300
Geez, I said I'm not. Seriously.

682
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,270
About Writer Jin Mu Yeong.

683
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:41,130
Won't he write anymore?

684
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:44,270
He's a good writer.

685
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,600
Good writer...

686
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,610
His first book went out of print
after the first printing.

687
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:55,870
Do you really have to say that
when I said I enjoyed it?

688
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,210
You really are miffed.

689
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:00,750
I said no. Really.

690
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:04,490
I said I'm sulking.

691
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:07,830
 Fine. 

692
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,630
 See you tomorrow. 

693
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,660
 Great work. 

694
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,830
Yes, I'll pass it on. Okay.

695
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,780
Yes, got it. Okay.

696
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,960
- Tae Rin.
- Yeah?

697
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:29,900
There's a scene edit.

698
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,250
Again?

699
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,360
How many?

700
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,400
Three.

701
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,230
Since you memorize your lines so quickly,

702
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:40,930
they must trust you and make a lot of edits.

703
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:45,140
Pork belly for dinner and debrief tonight!

704
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,750
Yay...

705
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,240
You can't eat it, right?

706
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,000
My character is pale from her suffering.

707
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,950
I can't glow from eating meat.

708
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:01,470
I'll just go memorize the script.

709
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,700
Thanks.

710
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,260
Yes.

711
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,630
What?

712
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:30,210
Open your mouth.

713
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:33,340
I can't.

714
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,130
Say ah.

715
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,640
Ah...

716
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:47,630
Ah...

717
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,980
No.

718
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:00,780
I'm loyal to Tae Rin.

719
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,530
Make me the sly one.

720
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:05,170
I'm leaving.

721
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,890
Yummy...

722
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:47,770
 

723
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,080
What a pro.

724
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,310
 What's a flower shop on fire? 

725
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:01,150
 Fireworks! 

726
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,420
Such a strange sense of humor.

727
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:21,310
 Love the ocean... 

728
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,000
A deer?

729
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:28,910
By the ocean?

730
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:37,770
Excuse me. Are you okay?

731
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:42,640
Sung Je Yeon.

732
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,620
Don't come near.

733
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,230
Pretend you don't know me. Go away.

734
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:51,690
I didn't see you fall.

735
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:53,190
Get up.

736
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:00,530
Do you like the ocean?

737
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:04,630
Not sure.

738
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:07,500
I guess I was born seaside.

739
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,110
You were born seaside?

740
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:11,170
Is that so shocking?

741
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:12,700
I just...

742
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:16,840
didn't know that about you.

743
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:20,430
What about you? Do you still like the ocean?

744
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:25,440
I like everything.

745
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,370
Mountains, oceans, fields...

746
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,040
It's nice here.

747
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:35,140
Right?

748
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:38,400
It doesn't feel like this in the city.

749
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,230
Right.

750
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:56,520
Huh? What happened to the other one?

751
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,420
You used to have two bracelets.

752
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,270
You're right.

753
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:03,870
When did it break off?

754
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:06,720
Looks like you'll really get rich.

755
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,520
You remember.

756
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:18,100
Of course, I remember. Sure.

757
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:26,430
I knew it was you when I saw that.

758
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:33,150
It lasted a long time without breaking off.

759
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:42,950
Sung Je Yeon.

760
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:46,640
Do you still feel awkward around me?

761
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:50,960
We need to be around each other the whole shoot.

762
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:55,270
Whenever I almost forget, I feel guilty again.

763
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:58,300
I feel like I dragged you into something.

764
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:10,030
Get rid of that thought as of this moment.

765
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,800
That's a useless word.

766
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,260
Don't fall down on your way back.

767
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:20,160
Don't you have a good night.

768
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,730
Hey!

769
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:26,280
Want to die?

770
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,740
Goodnight.

771
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,570
What are you giggling about?

772
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,810
 What? A snake! 

773
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:57,630
Hey, hey, Tae Rin. Climb up somewhere. Go up.

774
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:58,930
There's nowhere to climb up to.

775
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:01,280
Go to the car or something.

776
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:05,590
Hey.

777
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:06,790
Want some, Oppa?

778
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:07,980
Sure.

779
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,150
Wake up.

780
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:10,250
Thank you.

781
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:13,830
They said there might be snakes,
and there really is one.

782
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:16,120
Where's the snake? Snake...

783
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,300
Don't come near. Don't, don't.

784
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:20,480
Oh, it's real.

785
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,040
Why am I the only one fussing about it?

786
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,260
During the fieldwork yesterday,
they said it was okay if we stayed still.

787
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:29,710
Sounds like you weren't paying attention.

788
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:31,080
It's dangerous.

789
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,920
You're an actress. You need to be careful.

790
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,830
 Snake? Where? Where? 

791
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:38,640
Where's the camera? Camera! Hurry!

792
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,070
- Here, here.
- Show me.

793
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:42,690
Camera...

794
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:45,150
She has turned into a monster.

795
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:46,240
He was bitten?

796
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,100
Yes, and there's only a public health center here.

797
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:52,360
I'd better head out on the next boat with him.

798
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:53,870
Okay, sure.

799
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:56,900
I'll pick up the receipts. Have a safe trip.

800
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:59,230
I'm sorry to put this on you, Team Leader.

801
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:00,350
Thank you.

802
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:01,900
 Who are you people? 

803
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,650
Do you have permission to film here?

804
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:06,470
Hello, sir.

805
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:08,300
Were we too loud?

806
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:11,560
How dare you set up cameras on my land?

807
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,480
You broadcasting station
people are all the same...

808
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,710
I agreed to you planting trees,

809
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:19,260
but I didn't approve of filming.

810
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,670
I see. Please listen to us for a moment...

811
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:25,250
I haven't heard about any of this.

812
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,360
We're almost done.

813
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:30,060
Writer, go and help out.

814
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:32,590
- Hurry up. Go and beg, beg.
 - What are you trying to say? 

815
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,020
 Come on. 

816
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:37,310
What did he say?

817
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:40,020
He's quite firm.

818
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:43,310
He said planting is fine, but no filming at all.

819
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:46,420
What? Do we need to just leave then?

820
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:50,080
Let's ditch the planting and pack up.

821
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,860
We'll mess up our schedule
if we miss the boat. That's a wrap!

822
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,990
Let's get moving!

823
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:56,920
If we're going to throw them out,

824
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:00,680
can I stay behind and plant them?

825
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,790
They'll grow well as long as they're planted well.

826
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:05,480
By yourself?

827
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,570
Gosh, how can you plant them alone?
We were going to do it together.

828
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:10,880
Plus, our lodging ends tonight.

829
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,060
I'll find a place to sleep.

830
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,970
Don't worry about it.

831
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:17,200
Have a safe trip back.

832
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,790
- Great work.
- Thank you.

833
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:22,180
- I'm leaving.
- Take care.

834
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,260
Fine then, take care.

835
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:26,840
Let's get going! Let's move!

836
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,120
 Thank you. 

837
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:35,620
Sunbae, go ahead. I'll wrap up here.

838
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,150
I trust you.

839
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:38,640
Thanks.

840
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:43,620
Gosh, what a shame.

841
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:47,250
 I gathered all the receipts. 

842
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:51,030
I'm about to take the boat out. Yes.

843
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:54,590
I'll see you next time. Okay.

844
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:00,850
Hello. One ticket for the 4 p.m. boat, please.

845
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:04,470
Aigoo. The afternoon boats
have all been cancelled.

846
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:07,700
Boats can't go because of bad weather.

847
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:11,320
But it's so clear, though.

848
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:12,790
It is now.

849
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:15,680
Anyway, get on tomorrow's boat.

850
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,980
It's me. Well...

851
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:36,420
can I help you?

852
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,560
Isn't it hard by yourself?

853
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,810
Hey, hand it over. I'll carry it.

854
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:48,550
Save your energy.

855
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:51,370
We need to start planting early tomorrow morning.

856
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,770
It rains so many times a day.
I guess it's because it's an island.

857
00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:02,120
Right? I can't predict the weather.

858
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,410
 

859
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,640
Oh, right. The blood draw.

860
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,240
Blood draw? Do you have an annual health exam?

861
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,980
My regular exam.

862
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:15,780
It was scheduled for tomorrow morning,
but I can't make it.

863
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:16,840
 

864
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,550
Give me that.

865
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:22,370
I guess we are getting older.

866
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:24,730
Old and rusty...

867
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:29,670
Honestly, I was worried about
planting all this by myself.

868
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:32,530
It worked out.

869
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:45,090
If they only have one room left here, too,

870
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:47,470
I'll go sleep at the earlier lodging.

871
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,720
I only have one room left.

872
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:57,220
We're not in a relationship
where we can share a room.

873
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:59,900
We need two. Two, please.

874
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:04,300
I mean it. I bet all the nearby rooms
filled up, too, from all the cancellations.

875
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:07,070
You sleep here.

876
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:08,970
We'll take that room.

877
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:12,240
Yes, hello?

878
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,600
Yes, I was there ten minutes ago-

879
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,970
Oh, yes. You called me
a pretty young lad from Seoul.

880
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:20,910
Yes, that's me.

881
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:25,480
You said there's one room left. Yes.

882
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:32,450
I understand. Thank you.

883
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:38,360
Good work today. It's late.

884
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,380
Go get some rest.

885
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,370
No, right?

886
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:55,980
That room didn't get booked, did it?

887
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:08,650
Do you want to sleep in the car?

888
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,810
For fairness, rock, paper, scissors?

889
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:14,610
- One round?
- Sure.

890
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:16,700
Rock, paper, scissors.

891
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:19,940
Best out of three. Rock, paper, scissors.
Rock, paper, scissors!

892
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:23,180
I guess I'm sleeping in the car...

893
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:26,100
I do feel a little bad...

894
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:39,190
You could sleep in the car.

895
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:40,810
Why would I?

896
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:50,550
Great work.

897
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:53,940
Thanks in advance for your efforts tomorrow.

898
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:57,580
So professional, when we're sharing a room.

899
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,080
It's just a habit of mine.

900
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:06,490
Did you finish reading my book?

901
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:10,740
Sounds like you're curious if I enjoyed it.

902
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:15,370
Yes. I've been curious ever since
you brought it up yesterday.

903
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:19,470
It was so hopeful.

904
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:22,160
Like you wanted to live like that.

905
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,610
I asked if you enjoyed it.

906
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:30,400
Gosh, I don't want to pay you a compliment,

907
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,990
but it was funny.

908
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:39,630
And I think I felt a sense of solidarity.

909
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:42,360
My twenties were kind of like that, too.

910
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,570
What was it like?

911
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:49,210
Just for taking time off from school,
my entire extended family

912
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:52,890
pounced at me, scolding and consoling me.

913
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:56,860
They said I'm experiencing late puberty.

914
00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:00,070
They were more united than
when my family went bankrupt.

915
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:03,560
You barely slept because you studied
so hard in 12th grade.

916
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:07,000
Well, I gave up, ultimately.

917
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,290
Turns out I like adventures.

918
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:19,530
What's weird about this world is that

919
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:24,060
dirt-cheap, low-budget work
sometimes turns out well,

920
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:28,170
and huge investments fail sometimes.

921
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:31,430
You never know what will happen.

922
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:34,680
So, why do I continue?

923
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,750
Should I give up again and
go on another adventure?

924
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:49,160
Because of the people?

925
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:54,050
The times you shared. Stuff like that.

926
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,680
I've never been on a shoot like this.

927
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:08,350
Where someone is listening to me.

928
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:12,310
And asking me if I'm okay.

929
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,080
Should we just sleep together?

930
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:29,950
We'll just hold hands, right?

931
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:31,510
Sure...

932
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,720
What? No!

933
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,600
No!

934
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:42,910
There's still just one bed.

935
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:46,900
Should I sleep in the bed?

936
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:49,520
Just because you say it softly, it doesn't cut it.

937
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:54,650
Should we be fair and sleep together?

938
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:56,000
Huh?

939
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:03,510
This is the kind of stuff you should say softly.

940
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:07,450
I'm so tired and sleepy.

941
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:09,530
Let's kill the lights.

942
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:21,680
Oh, right.

943
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,990
It's not here...

944
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:25,900
I am here.

945
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:29,730
I'm even breathing.

946
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:32,400
Sounds like you're totally ignoring me.

947
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:36,590
Right, you're here.

948
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:41,370
I feel weird...

949
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:45,110
You're not thinking weird thoughts, are you?

950
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:47,200
I'm not.

951
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:55,550
Why not?

952
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,400
You want me to or not?

953
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,190
Whatever.

954
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:02,080
Forget it. Don't.

955
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:14,730
You were shining so brightly back then.

956
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:17,670
 ♫ On a bright day, will our stories be the same? ♫ 

957
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:19,990
And...

958
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:24,360
 ♫ I wrote so much, enough
to stay up all night reading ♫ 

959
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:31,190
 ♫ All the pretty words I couldn't say ♫ 

960
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,880
Goodnight...

961
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:43,720
 ♫ I visit a day I've recorded in my mind ♫ 

962
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:46,200
 ♫ You and I are awkward ♫ 

963
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:51,280
 ♫ Thank goodness we're still there like we were ♫ 

964
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:59,850
 ♫ I curious about becoming a grown-up,
which seems so real now ♫ 

965
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:01,770
It's past tense.

966
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:08,970
I guess not anymore.

967
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:20,390
 ♫ Walking side by side in lockstep
with you on this street ♫ 

968
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:25,200
 ♫ I still walk this street every day ♫ 

969
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:30,000
 ♫ The weary day ♫ 

970
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,810
 ♫ I felt like I was dreaming ♫ 

971
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:39,780
 ♫ A strange kiss ♫ 

972
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:44,870
 ♫ It felt like yesterday ♫ 

973
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,260
He's not here.

974
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:02,930
Must've been a dream.

975
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:05,240
What a relief.

976
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:10,770
I'm here.

977
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:12,810
You want to get rid of me?

978
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:16,570
What a relief.

979
01:03:16,570 --> 01:03:18,650
It was a dream.

980
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:31,590
 ♫ If I close my eyes and think of you ♫ 

981
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:36,030
 ♫ I feel like you'll suddenly appear ♫ 

982
01:03:36,030 --> 01:03:41,100
Gosh, this is why you run a flower shop.

983
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:46,350
I can smell the earth, and my head is clear.

984
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:48,400
And the sounds.

985
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:52,840
I've only heard it on the apps,
but it's great hearing it live.

986
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,000
Oh, right.

987
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:00,500
What about the cactus? Is it alive?

988
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:03,720
Why do you keep asking if I killed it?

989
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,640
Because I feel like you'll kill it.

990
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:08,220
Out of spite toward me.

991
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:10,030
Should I really kill it?

992
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:12,380
- Huh?
- Not the cactus.

993
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:14,820
Want to die?

994
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:17,200
You brought it from the land?

995
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:23,400
Why would you bring a car
to an island without any prep?

996
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,340
The PD said she'd cover all car-related costs.

997
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:28,930
But she must've forgotten and left.

998
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:33,120
No signal...

999
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:36,480
Call your insurance.

1000
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,180
Just a second.

1001
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:42,430
 

1002
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,890
What if the boats get cancelled again?

1003
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:47,300
And we're trapped on the island again?

1004
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,960
And what if there's only one room again?

1005
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,300
Some TV shows contrive scenes like this.

1006
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:55,100
Oh, contrived...

1007
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:58,650
In Tae Rin's current drama, a perfectly
functioning car suddenly breaks down.

1008
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:01,360
Why? Because it needs to break down.

1009
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,630
What are you looking up right now?

1010
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:06,430
What?

1011
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:08,640
Gas station?

1012
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,650
When you run out of gas?

1013
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:18,060
There we go.

1014
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:20,010
There's a gas station nearby.

1015
01:05:20,010 --> 01:05:21,810
I'll go get gas.

1016
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:24,960
Hey.

1017
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,780
I got a text alert earlier about wild boars.

1018
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:32,730
What if I encounter a wild boar alone?

1019
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:34,950
That would be more contrived.

1020
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:38,880
You're not avoiding the insurance,
so you don't increase your premium, right?

1021
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,560
No.

1022
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:44,030
This is outside of their roadside assistance area.

1023
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:47,080
Why are you just saying that now?

1024
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,280
Geez.

1025
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:56,020
Gosh, I'm a rule-follower.

1026
01:05:56,020 --> 01:06:00,510
But the boats are canceled
and the car has broken down.

1027
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:05,030
Have you always followed the rules?

1028
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:10,080
I mean...

1029
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:14,770
I just wonder if you've ever
followed a map you've never seen.

1030
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:26,000
I've had to go down roads
I wasn't sure were even roads at all.

1031
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,110
Like now?

1032
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:29,740
Right.

1033
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:32,150
You said you like adventure.

1034
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,330
- Wow.
- What?

1035
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:39,270
I've been looking forward to it
since we got here to shoot.

1036
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:40,970
What?

1037
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:43,010
Planting trees.

1038
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:45,050
I wondered when else I'd get a chance.

1039
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:51,130
It felt like they'd grow up nicely
as long as I plant them well.

1040
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:59,300
It'll take about five years
before it looks halfway decent.

1041
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,260
It'll be pretty when they bloom.

1042
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:03,850
What's the meaning behind the flowers?

1043
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:06,250
I'm not telling you.

1044
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:13,230
- Sunwoo Hae.
- Yeah?

1045
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:18,070
So, why did you agree to be on the show?

1046
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,720
You're still curious about that?

1047
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:32,180
I understand why you kept declining
casting offers this whole time.

1048
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:38,610
But I don't understand why you accepted this one.

1049
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:43,570
A heart for my long-lost friend.

1050
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:51,390
What a sweet sentiment.

1051
01:07:53,700 --> 01:08:00,000
And that's also the meaning
behind the tree we planted.

1052
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:04,000
What? When did you look it up?

1053
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,200
- When did you have a chance?
- I made it up.

1054
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:15,290
Gosh, listen to the writer here.

1055
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:33,740
 ♫ I feel nervous, but I don't know why ♫ 

1056
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:37,070
 ♫ Faint butterflies in my stomach ♫ 

1057
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:42,400
 ♫ That familiar voice from the memory ♫ 

1058
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:49,000
 ♫ Some memories ♫ 

1059
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:53,080
Careful, you might touch me.

1060
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:56,300
You might touch me, touch...

1061
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,670
You made contact.

1062
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:02,030
So hectic.

1063
01:09:02,830 --> 01:09:05,050
Calm down. I won't eat you alive.

1064
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:10,170
 ♫ We're stuck on that day ♫ 

1065
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:16,200
 ♫ So beautiful ♫ 

1066
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:19,360
 ♫ When I look at you blankly ♫ 

1067
01:09:19,360 --> 01:09:21,960
Dodge, if you don't like it.

1068
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:23,910
What if I don't dislike it?

1069
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:28,360
Then, I'd be glad.

1070
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:33,910
 ♫ Come closer ♫ 

1071
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:40,820
 ♫ The red sunset ♫ 

1072
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:47,790
 ♫ Night and day meet briefly ♫ 

1073
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:56,120
 ♫ Like us back then ♫ 

1074
01:09:56,120 --> 01:10:01,730
 ♫ Like falling asleep ♫ 

1075
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:10,880
 ♫ Pretending not to know and embrace ♫ 

1076
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:17,870
 ♫ It's like love that gets pushed away ♫ 

1077
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:24,880
 ♫ Like the longing that comes back ♫ 

1078
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:34,580
 ♫ Like the horizon where day and night meet ♫ 

1079
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:48,000
 What happens to us now? 

1080
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,470
 We kissed, so we can't go back to before. 

1081
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:52,870
 What did I do? 

1082
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:55,450
 It'll be more awkward if we go silently. 

1083
01:10:55,450 --> 01:10:59,530
 At age 19, you were spiky like a rock 

1084
01:10:59,530 --> 01:11:02,510
 and would trip me over all the time. 

1085
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:04,560
 The original publisher went bankrupt. 

1086
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,450
 The original is out of print, and the
contract just states original writer. 

1087
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:12,280
 Come back? You didn't come back
after what happened to Hae's mom! 

1088
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,200
 Can I go on a date here? 

1089
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,850
 With whom? 

1090
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:17,040
 Someone I like. 

1091
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:20,040
 Being curious about what someone's
up to is the beginning of a crush. 

1092
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:23,910
 Isn't it nice when someone
who rejected me is begging? 

1093
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:28,100
 Want to date me if you don't have a boyfriend?
