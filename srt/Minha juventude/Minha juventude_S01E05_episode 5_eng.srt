1
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,100
Careful, you might touch me.

2
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,460
You might touch me, touch...

3
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,750
You made contact.

4
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,570
Calm down. I won't eat you alive.

5
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,520
Dodge, if you don't like it.

6
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:23,940
What if I don't dislike it?

7
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,860
Then, I'd be glad.

8
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,860
Hey...

9
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,790
You're so strong.

10
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,690
What did I do?

11
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,460
Hey... then...

12
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,720
When should I have done it?

13
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,930
Gosh, I...

14
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,200
After we got back?

15
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,930
Or, once I've taken you home?

16
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,990
It's not about the timing...

17
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,400
Let's be quiet. I-I'm tired.

18
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,420
Hey, I bet it'll be more awkward
if we're quiet. No?

19
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,890
Why are you laughing?

20
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,610
Because it's awkward.

21
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,250
Hey!

22
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,590
 

23
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,140
 ♫ I wrote so much, enough
to stay up all night reading ♫ 

24
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,670
 ♫ All the pretty words I couldn't say ♫ 

25
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,060
I knew it.

26
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,160
A part of me expected it.

27
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,130
You said to be quiet.

28
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,780
I didn't say let's be absolutely silent.

29
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,850
Why did you do that?

30
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,650
Because I wanted to.

31
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,240
Gosh...

32
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,890
Aren't you embarrassed?

33
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,540
Why are you embarrassed?

34
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,190
I'm thinking about it.

35
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:34,140
An adult man and a woman could kiss.

36
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,800
An adult man and a woman can't do
that without any feelings.

37
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,750
Who said I don't have feelings for you?

38
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,070
I held back yesterday.

39
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:00,160
I didn't want to make it weird
when we had to share a bed.

40
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,320
I told you I'm thinking!

41
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,640
Geez... All right...

42
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,570
Calm down.

43
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,590
I'll be outside.

44
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:17,510
 ♫ A strange kiss ♫ 

45
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:25,360
 ♫ It felt like yesterday ♫ 

46
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:49,040
 ♫ If I close my eyes and think of you ♫ 

47
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,800
 ♫ I feel like you'll suddenly appear ♫ 

48
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,760
 ♫ And feels like you'll walk toward me ♫ 

49
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,970
 ♫ I don't know what tomorrow will bring ♫ 

50
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,240
Want a ride?

51
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,920
Well...

52
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,720
Oh, I bet it's too awkward for you.

53
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,180
Want me to read between the lines and go away?

54
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,660
Why did you even ask me, then?

55
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,130
Right.

56
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,330
Just get in. We don't have to talk on the way.

57
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,360
Why? What?

58
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,730
What? Why?

59
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,960
You startled me.

60
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,810
What's going on?

61
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,450
Why did you come toward me?

62
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,800
Why? What are you doing?

63
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,760
My bag is in your car.

64
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,410
Please don't contact me for a while.

65
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,150
Hey!

66
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,250
I can't do that.

67
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,460
W-Why not? W-Why can't you?

68
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:02,190
I bet you'll ghost me, pretending
to take time to think.

69
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,480
Gosh, who do you think I am?

70
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:10,460
It was just sudden.

71
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,220
What happens to us now?

72
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,530
We kissed. We can't go back to before.

73
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,530
Then...

74
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,730
1. We grow distant. 2. We become difficult.

75
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,180
3. We date.

76
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,270
Let's think about it.

77
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,220
I'm leaving. Don't hold me back, please.

78
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:12,570
Would I have let it slide if it were someone else?

79
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,430
Back then...

80
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,990
you were really...

81
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,210
Give me the car key.

82
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,430
I'll sleep in the car.

83
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:26,170
Hey, I didn't get to tell you how brightly you...

84
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,370
shone...

85
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,620
It'll be pretty when they bloom.

86
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,090
Obviously.

87
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,890
Don't you want to know the
meaning behind the flower?

88
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,750
No, I don't.

89
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,260
A heart for my long-lost friend-

90
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,120
Shut up if you don't want to get buried.

91
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,750
I'm tired.

92
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,340
You brought me all the way here.

93
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,290
You should really try harder in this reenactment.

94
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,880
It's very unpleasant for me, too.

95
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,330
I don't think I would've let it
slide with anyone else.

96
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,200
His back was pretty warm...

97
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,130
What a nightmare.

98
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,690
Yikes. It's a thief.

99
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:47,660
You should've told me if you were
going to the flower market today.

100
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,730
So, if you avoid me now,

101
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,460
will you have a different grade in the evening?

102
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,820
Hand me your report card.

103
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,630
It just feels different.

104
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,520
 

105
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,100
200th place out of 206 students?

106
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,650
- Why are you reading that out loud?
- No one's listening. So what?

107
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:37,000
Exactly. No one's listening, so why?

108
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,500
I see.

109
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,900
Here.

110
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,790
Why did you ask me for the report card

111
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,600
if you weren't going to yell at me?

112
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,860
How come you never tell me if I did
a good job or a bad job?

113
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,630
I've been living in fear all this time

114
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,530
that you'd yell at me for my poor grades.

115
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:04,720
I feel strangely futile right now.

116
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,100
Are you satisfied with these grades?

117
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,930
Say something like that?

118
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,260
You're so annoying.

119
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,450
 Nu Ri. 

120
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,080
How come you're here so early today?

121
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,940
I preferred coming to school early.

122
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,050
Let's go.

123
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,330
Hold on tight, Choi Sa Rang.

124
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,610
 

125
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,150
You're up early.

126
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,660
I was about to come up.

127
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,930
It feels like I haven't seen you forever,
but it's only been a few days.

128
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:18,090
Good to see you, Sunbae.

129
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,680
What?

130
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,070
You didn't get to sleep again?

131
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,210
I'm practicing sleeping without sleeping pills.

132
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,560
I just brushed my teeth.

133
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,920
Good. Let's wash your salon at the hair.

134
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,670
No, wash your salon...

135
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,080
It sounds like you're the one
who didn't get any sleep.

136
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,140
Right.

137
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,230
I didn't get good sleep. Yeah.

138
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,660
Let's go.

139
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,620
We'll go in self-driving mode.

140
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,290
Okay.

141
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,250
Hello, everyone.

142
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,300
This is the set of "Famished for Love."

143
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,330
This air, this weather, this sun, this breeze...

144
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:02,010
It's such a pity that I get
to enjoy this by myself.

145
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,950
This project is really living up to its name.

146
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,440
What?

147
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,200
"What's up? LOL"?

148
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,410
Why would he be curious about what you're up to?

149
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,580
Does he not have a job?

150
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,170
Tell him to volunteer or something.

151
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,170
Stop. He's just a kid.

152
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,510
This is just the beginning
of his being interested in me.

153
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:27,620
"Thinking of you~"

154
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,140
Were you really thinking of him?

155
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,920
It's a lie.

156
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,800
Hey, Tae Rin, you know...

157
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,060
Do you think not disliking someone
means liking that person?

158
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,820
Not disliking doesn't equal liking, right?

159
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,900
So, there's some interest.

160
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,430
This is so unlike you. Why do you ask?

161
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,440
Is this about someone you know?

162
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,840
Oh, yes, she's wondering if it's
enough for her to date someone.

163
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,370
What would be enough to date someone?

164
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,930
Not sure.

165
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,940
Maybe if your heart is 100% sold?

166
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:12,700
How would you know if you're 100% sold?

167
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:19,600
I don't know who this is,
but they sound so square.

168
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,330
Sounds like they'll be alone for the
rest of their lives without ever dating.

169
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,440
If he has a decent personality and
you have shared hobbies, it's a go.

170
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,530
Of course, a nice voice gets bonus points for me.

171
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:39,900
But isn't it nice when someone
who rejected me is begging?

172
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,700
Is that good?

173
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,280
Well, I'm not talking about myself.

174
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,200
I need some air.

175
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,230
She's so cute. Seriously.

176
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:06,360
 

177
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,170
You're here.

178
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,870
When can I see you on TV?

179
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,910
I'm getting chills.

180
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,980
How did you know we're almost done filming?

181
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,130
Because you're here for the first time in a while.

182
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,390
Did you get your blood drawn?

183
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,230
- What did they say at the hospital?
- The same.

184
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,730
They said I might croak any day, in so many words.

185
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,490
Hey!

186
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,370
You can't unspeak what's already been said.

187
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,520
I'd get sick before you do.

188
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,400
Gosh, I'm aching all over.

189
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,500
Don't you feel like you're wasting your prime?

190
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,660
Going from book shop, library, flower
shop, book shop, library, flower shop...

191
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:54,580
You're not that much older than me.

192
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,680
- Ma'am.
- Yeah?

193
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,130
Can I go on a date here?

194
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,920
Please go hang out outside!

195
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,080
Trying to bring in a freeloader...

196
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,700
With whom?

197
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,430
Someone I like.

198
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,230
I hope it goes well!

199
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,420
You don't need to come in on your hospital days.

200
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,370
Aigoo. Don't treat me like a patient.

201
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,290
Look at you throw a tantrum.
You're alive and well.

202
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,010
Hyung.

203
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,220
What do you think about a guy
who goes in for a kiss suddenly?

204
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,870
Is he cute?

205
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,430
You see my face every day.

206
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,430
Gosh, seriously.

207
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,670
Wait a second. W-What? What?

208
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,460
Are you dating that class president?

209
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,600
No. Dating, my foot.

210
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,070
No?

211
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,870
Wow, you trash.

212
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:02,070
I've never seen you ask such a frivolous question.

213
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,570
- Geez...
- Bring her in here officially next time.

214
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:06,440
I need to study her carefully.

215
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,990
Who are you to study her?

216
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,580
You don't even know how to read people.

217
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,490
Without me, you'd be...

218
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:16,100
I want to decide whether to give
her free drinks or not until I'm 70.

219
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,590
Oh, yes. Of course.

220
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,610
You usually get sensitive during your check-ups.

221
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,500
I'm glad you seem better lately.

222
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,330
I am sensitive.

223
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,250
If she says yes, I need to plan our dates.

224
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,020
If she rejects me, I need to think
about how I'm going to cling.

225
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,830
So, what led you to kiss her out of the blue?

226
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,710
I wasn't really thinking at the time.

227
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,030
Are you an idiot or trash?

228
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,800
This is the last day of the shoot.

229
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,990
I'm thinking we'll have you write letters.

230
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,880
To Beat and Bebop.

231
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,720
As a final gesture.

232
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,220
We'll send you the letter you write
today a year from now.

233
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,840
Do you have any ideas about the letter?

234
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,400
- Me!
- Geez.

235
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,280
I subscribe to a will-writing service.

236
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,700
It changes content every year.

237
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,770
It's nice because it feels like
doing end-of-year accounting.

238
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,960
A will...

239
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,220
Why are you doing stuff like that?

240
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,840
A letter to my younger self...

241
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,820
It's something like that.

242
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,940
Makes me reflect on what remains with me.

243
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,620
It's similar to a will.

244
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,140
Beat, you're so trendy.

245
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,960
- Wait.
- What?

246
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,740
- Let me.
- No!

247
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,740
Seriously, you're so petty.

248
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:46,260
Gosh, to me, you two seem exactly
the same as you did back then.

249
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,530
You're the same age as me.

250
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:51,470
You're not that much older.

251
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,930
Bebop is laughing more and more.

252
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,220
And Beat looks more comfortable.

253
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,510
No!

254
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:01,270
Should we make this a regular program?
Not just a pilot?

255
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,690
 No! 

256
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,760
- Just once.
- No!

257
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:11,060
I have no problem writing this.

258
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,360
But look at this Oppa.

259
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,260
You haven't written a single word.

260
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,560
- Don't.
- So lame.

261
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,270
Aigoo!

262
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,170
Can I curse a little?

263
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,800
You can't curse at all.

264
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,140
Okay...

265
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,380
The most important project is the
three-part series, "A World Made of Ash."

266
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,990
It's a tentpole.

267
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:34,970
Sounds familiar. When did I see it recently?

268
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,800
You all read it, right? What do you think?

269
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,800
An adaptation that took a whole
year turned out like this?

270
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,990
The co-producer has the copyright,
so I trusted them.

271
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,050
And look how it turned out.

272
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,600
We shouldn't have taken it just
because it's a huge production.

273
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,940
Vice President, is it just me?

274
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,580
Today is going to be a tough one.

275
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,800
 The sub MC for our show will be
a different actor, unfortunately. 

276
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,700
 My daughter will reach out.
Thanks in advance for the critique! 

277
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:25,190
What a shame.

278
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,120
 Yes, thank you! 

279
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,300
 

280
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,350
What is Director Bang Han Na up to these days?

281
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,770
Tell me if you hear anything.

282
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,580
We're close enough to send flowers, aren't we?

283
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,000
Okay.

284
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,000
It feels weird without Director Han Na here.

285
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,700
- Is it just me?
- Yes, you're the only one.

286
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,120
It's nice and sunny here.

287
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,700
Should we go with this place?
There's also a park nearby.

288
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,170
A four-story building without an elevator...

289
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,250
You're trying to work out?

290
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,630
That is my goal, but...

291
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,770
Are you worried now that you're actually here?

292
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:55,580
No. I've been worried even before I came.

293
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:33,730
Hyung, I just noticed grass I haven't seen before.
Looks like weeds.

294
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,760
Can I just pull them out?

295
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,800
Won't they fire you if you work like this?

296
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,950
I might get fired soon.

297
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,760
With the bad economy, I have much less work.

298
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,820
I might need to run sales.

299
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,860
Aigoo...

300
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,000
Looking at you like that,

301
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,920
I feel like you're Cinderella
and I'm the evil sister.

302
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,860
To be exact, more like the Grasshopper.

303
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,490
And this grass you were about to pull out.

304
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,850
It was always here with you.

305
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,430
"The Ant and the Grasshopper."

306
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,040
Gosh, I hate bugs.

307
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,940
Let's just go with Cinderella.

308
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,070
Sure.

309
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,600
Hyung, that still hasn't died.

310
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,830
I bought it at your opening,
so it's been three years.

311
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,060
Must be.

312
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,810
It was withering at first.

313
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:28,180
Looks like I don't need to worry anymore.

314
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,630
I must be talented.

315
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:35,510
I came every time you called me to say it's dying.

316
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,710
You have zero talent.

317
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,670
Move.

318
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,210
You said to let you know
if there's an issue with that.

319
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,070
You said it wasn't doing so well
when you sold it to me.

320
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:48,100
Change the order. It started having
issues after you bought it.

321
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,140
Hardship is necessary for a beautiful bloom.

322
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,700
Gosh, I'm glad it's growing nicely.
Both this flower and you.

323
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,760
Gosh, seriously...

324
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,970
This one's dead.

325
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:03,450
I need to cut it off completely.
Give me the scissors.

326
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,850
Sure.

327
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,380
Seriously...

328
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,600
Yes, it's Kim Seok Joo.

329
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,970
Gosh, I feel so bad.

330
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,760
Who are you? A new gardener?

331
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,520
Hello.

332
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,590
Where did the original guy go?

333
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,600
He used to do a great job.

334
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,370
Hyung, no more grass pulling. Drive, please.

335
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:55,830
- Mom.
- Why is he your hyung?

336
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,000
Your husband's son.

337
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,680
Why is my husband's son pulling grass here?

338
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,980
Your son made me.

339
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,900
So, you do everything you're asked to do?

340
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,690
- Why did you ask him to do this?
- Because he's better than me.

341
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,320
Why are you home at this hour?

342
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,850
I had a bad day, so I came home
for a change of scenery.

343
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,650
But now, I feel worse.

344
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:19,670
I wanted to go on a drive with my Chan.

345
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:23,540
That was gross what she said.

346
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,950
Love of the century, I guess.

347
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,240
Give me money.

348
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,370
Just a moment.

349
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,800
Why are you asking me for money?

350
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,360
"Sunwoo Hae shall serve Kim Seok Joo
for taking care of

351
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,090
his sister Eun Nu Ri during his military service

352
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,020
until he is satisfied."

353
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,100
When will you be satisfied?

354
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,900
"If Hae violates this, they shall live together."

355
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,320
Let's live together. Sure.

356
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,130
Because of you, I delayed my studies
to take care of her.

357
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:09,630
Hey. You ran back to Korea
when I asked you to take care of her.

358
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,950
You cried your eyes out when I took Nu Ri back.

359
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:15,290
Aren't you grateful? You work at my shop.

360
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:18,100
The shop belongs to me. You just funded it.

361
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,150
You're so weird. I'll need to bill you extra.

362
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,970
I didn't know my mom was coming, either.

363
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,760
Really. I swear.

364
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,840
It's just that...

365
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,000
while your mom and that moron had all the fun...

366
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:44,260
Never mind. It's all my fault.

367
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,340
Right, it's your fault.
Why are you taking my money?

368
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,870
Give me a ride to my office.

369
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:51,470
I didn't bring my car. Take the bus.

370
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,130
Why aren't you driving the car I gave you?

371
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,880
Let go of me!

372
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,350
Hello?

373
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,000
Yes. I'm Sunwoo Hae.

374
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,830
 We noticed something abnormal
in your blood sample. 

375
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:11,550
 You'll need to do additional tests. 

376
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,160
Why?

377
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,300
But I'm healthy.

378
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,640
I've been fine all along.

379
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,100
How long will the tests take?

380
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,290
I need to open up my business, even if it's late.

381
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,860
My business, yes.

382
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,400
 

383
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:59,230
One, two, three...

384
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,300
 I brought you a bribe. 

385
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,530
 Wear these if you get hurt. 

386
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,170
I miss her.

387
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,150
 

388
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,530
Bye.

389
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,100
 

390
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,830
You don't need the company car
today, right? Key, please.

391
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,340
Sure...

392
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,530
You're going to see So Min's film?

393
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:04,060
Eat first. It's a long movie.

394
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,570
Yes, I need to monitor...

395
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,070
Isn't your phone vibrating? Not picking up?

396
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,070
It's what I've been waiting for...

397
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,030
You should take it, then. Bye.

398
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,620
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

399
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,350
 

400
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,840
Hello?

401
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,720
 Yeah. What are you up to? 

402
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,470
Doing something. Why?

403
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,240
I miss you.

404
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,730
Okay. What?

405
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:38,430
 I need to give you the appearance agreement. 

406
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:41,360
 I signed it. Don't you need it? 

407
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,880
Well...

408
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,740
I'll get it.

409
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:50,210
I'll send a courier service.

410
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,630
 Text me where to meet up. 

411
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,270
H-Hel...

412
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,800
Hello? H-Hello?

413
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,840
What the heck?

414
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:11,610
"I miss you"?

415
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,460
Sung Je Yeon.

416
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:41,670
Just be calm... Just be calm...

417
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,470
- Did you take a cab?
- Just be calm...

418
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,420
- What?
- What?

419
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,230
- What?
- Yeah.

420
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:51,340
Oh, yes. W-What about you?

421
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:54,200
Cab? Car?

422
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:59,120
I only drive when I need to.
When I have a lot of stuff.

423
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,700
You should be driving a truck then.

424
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,010
Why drive a foreign car?

425
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,340
I know, huh?

426
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:11,010
Why did I buy a car when I didn't
even have a driver's license?

427
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,030
Are you talking to yourself?

428
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,730
Oh, it's not my car.

429
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:20,350
What crazy person would entrust
someone with their car?

430
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,630
Kim Seok Joo.

431
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,530
Everything makes sense.

432
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:30,400
What about the appearance agreement?

433
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,390
- Give it to you and get lost?
- No...

434
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,060
I have a movie to watch.

435
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,800
If I miss it, I have to catch the early
morning screening tomorrow.

436
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,110
I guess we have no choice, then.

437
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,090
I'll give it to you after the movie.

438
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,400
What?

439
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,190
What?

440
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,390
It's here.

441
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,950
How did you know without paper tickets?

442
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,970
What?

443
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:58,130
When was the last time you watched a movie?

444
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,830
I don't remember.

445
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,500
It's been so long...

446
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,490
 Please check the emergency exits. 

447
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:13,660
 The theater you're in right now is... 

448
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,000
Enjoy.

449
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,960
Okay. You, too.

450
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,530
It's starting.

451
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,450
Here.

452
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,990
A hoobae submitted a letter
of resignation and said this.

453
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,940
That my path is not her path.

454
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,450
She's leaving because she's scared of me.

455
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,000
So, I came home to see you,
but your son was there.

456
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,860
- Interesting, right?
- Very interesting.

457
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,520
What? Hae came home?

458
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,100
That can't be. How did he get in?

459
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:17,160
Seok Joo must've opened the door
for him. To make him his lackey.

460
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,110
They're still in touch...

461
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,350
What's the nature of their relationship?

462
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,110
Are they dating?

463
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,550
Want to ruin our family tree?

464
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,870
Not even over my dead body.

465
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:37,230
I won't ask you to love Hae.

466
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,030
Just don't hate him too much.

467
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,700
Who knows? I might've loved
him if he were like you.

468
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:53,550
I don't know what I'm feeling.

469
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,510
What's this side dish? It's delicious.

470
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,940
You like greens with your liquor.

471
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,410
I'm glad I made it earlier.

472
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,450
Cheers.

473
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,800
Cheers.

474
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,210
Cheers.

475
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,000
It's burning.

476
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,550
Here.

477
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,830
What did you think about the movie?

478
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,900
I'm curious since one of our actors is in it.

479
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,210
Delicious.

480
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,260
Want me to be honest?

481
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,820
No.

482
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,370
I'm lost as to what to say in my feedback.

483
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:50,690
Did you read the novel draft? What did you think?

484
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,130
Want me to be honest?

485
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,100
No. Prepare some cushioned language.

486
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,490
She's at a sensitive age. She might get hurt.

487
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:09,570
You looked very focused
during the child actor scenes.

488
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,180
Does it remind you of the old days?

489
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,610
It's R-rated.

490
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:20,500
I was thinking they can't even
watch the film they're in.

491
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,780
I was so annoyed about that.

492
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:32,800
They used to make me hold ice in my mouth
when they could see my breath.

493
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,250
I had to cry and sob and drown myself.
Do all kinds of things.

494
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,630
But I still wasn't allowed to watch it.

495
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,460
I was thinking this when
we were filming with Tae Rin.

496
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,600
It seems like you remember your entire childhood.

497
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:53,210
But you can't seem to remember only what I did.

498
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:57,980
You can't remember what you did to me.

499
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:03,200
Sung Je Yeon, this is in place
of your speech lessons.

500
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,690
All the child actors come here.

501
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:08,130
 It's Sunwoo Hae! 

502
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:10,070
Isn't that Bebop?

503
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,980
You're here.

504
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,920
Ma'am, you're here.

505
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,630
- Hello.
- How's your husband?

506
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,470
Good, of course.

507
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,110
Hae, say hi to your friend.

508
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,510
Hi.

509
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,030
- Ma'am, see me for a moment.
- Okay.

510
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,300
Your name is Hae?

511
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,140
Wow, I saw you on TV.

512
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,710
 Hey! 

513
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,320
Why did you throw that out?

514
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,220
I bought that with my allowance!

515
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,610
I don't need it anymore.

516
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,670
We're not even friends.

517
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:45,380
 The acting studio you went to as a kid. 

518
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,770
 I went there, too. 

519
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,750
 Forced by my mom. 

520
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,340
You were there?

521
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,120
- Yeah.
- Don't mess with me.

522
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,270
Wow...

523
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:59,140
You really don't remember?

524
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:03,850
Well, you were quite popular back then.

525
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:07,180
- Are you serious?
- Why would I lie?

526
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,870
I'm so sorry.

527
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:12,570
I don't remember much about those times.

528
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,310
I was constantly at the hospital.

529
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:18,450
You have too many stories.

530
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:21,370
Makes me scared of talking to you.

531
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:24,510
Why were you at the hospital?

532
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,770
Psychiatry?

533
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,870
That, too.

534
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:32,700
I wasn't feeling well, so I was
seeing different doctors.

535
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,920
Aigoo.

536
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,370
Must've been tough for a kid.

537
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,400
Are you okay now?

538
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,860
Oh, did you draw your blood okay?

539
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,770
It's about time you asked.

540
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,940
What if I'm not fine?

541
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,870
You're not fine?

542
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:58,620
What if I'm fine?

543
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,570
You'd better live a good life.

544
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:14,330
How do you remember me?

545
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:17,940
Back then, I wrote in my diary,

546
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:22,920
"Sunwoo Hae acted mean to me today.

547
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,030
He threw away the flowers
I bought him for Children's Day

548
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:30,200
with my allowance."

549
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,990
Why did I do that?

550
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,940
That's so unlike me.

551
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,890
That was very much like you.

552
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:38,500
I'm getting angry rehashing it.

553
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,280
Okay.

554
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,230
Want to take out your anger
on me now? I'll take it.

555
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,500
Where will you take it?

556
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:51,300
Your face? Stomach? Chest? Just say the word.

557
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,240
Lips.

558
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:05,030
Is this going to work?

559
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:10,560
Hey. W-W-Wait.

560
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,630
Should we go with the stomach?

561
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,900
Don't make a fuss.

562
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,720
I didn't even go all out.

563
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:22,560
Why did I do that back then?

564
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,900
It's just so unlike me.

565
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,130
What is it to be like you?

566
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:37,000
I'm sure you were under a lot of stress back then.

567
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,820
Watching the child actors on-screen today,

568
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:45,820
I was thinking I could never make them do that.

569
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,790
Hilarious.

570
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,350
So, you were just whining.

571
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,890
What?

572
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:05,280
You brought your car?

573
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,770
I thought you only drive when you need to.

574
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:09,980
I thought I'd need to drive you home.

575
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,190
Just get in.

576
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,950
Just pretend you're sleeping or something.

577
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,800
I'll turn a blind eye.

578
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:27,230
 ♫ My breathing gets faster and faster ♫ 

579
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:35,670
 ♫ It's caught in my throat, a piece of a memory ♫ 

580
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:42,500
 ♫ I barely spit it out ♫ 

581
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:49,920
 ♫ Thoughts of you spill out ♫ 

582
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,850
Sung Je Yeon!

583
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,490
Just a second.

584
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:59,990
 ♫ And I can't fight through
my memories of you ♫ 

585
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:00,990
This.

586
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:08,100
 ♫ Hiding in the time that's slipping away ♫ 

587
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,270
 ♫ Alone ♫ 

588
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:19,870
I've never bought flowers for someone before.

589
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,010
I know this doesn't undo

590
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:31,190
the fact that I threw out the flowers you gave me.

591
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:34,760
But consider this my apology.

592
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,420
You gave me a hug, too.

593
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,630
Even though this doesn't undo it,

594
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,510
I'll just remember your hug from now on.

595
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,950
I'm sorry I threw out the flowers you gave me.

596
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:55,000
At that age, I wasn't able to receive
your sweet intentions.

597
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,660
I don't know how you remember yourself,

598
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,160
but you used to shine brightly.

599
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,860
Separate from being annoying.

600
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,210
That's past tense.

601
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,750
You used the past tense, too.

602
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,960
Wait, you...

603
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,150
you were asleep...

604
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,630
You think I'm a stone Buddha?

605
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:30,520
 ♫ In the end, I'd sweep up all the pieces of you ♫ 

606
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,600
There were many days I went to school to see you.

607
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:40,700
I went on the show because
I thought I'd be able to see you more.

608
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,890
I had forgotten about this for a long time.

609
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:50,130
This is what happens when you like someone.

610
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,800
Want to date me if you don't have a boyfriend?

611
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,950
Here we have it.

612
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,690
Why are you laughing again?

613
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:20,830
You made me laugh.

614
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,670
4.

615
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,600
Return to before, and pretend nothing happened.

616
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,930
How can I pretend nothing happened
when something did happen?

617
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:37,800
- I'd be too shameless.
- I'm not saying to forget everything.

618
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:44,600
Some people date if their personalities
and preferences generally align.

619
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:48,510
But I guess I'm not like that.

620
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,750
Sorry.

621
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,450
Okay.

622
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,130
Got it.

623
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:10,420
Change the water daily for those flowers. Okay?

624
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:14,120
I'm leaving. Go in.

625
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,410
Bye.

626
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:24,730
Gosh, darn it...

627
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,020
Hey, Sunwoo Hae!

628
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:40,640
Make sure to walk on brightly lit streets.

629
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:55,270
If you feel bad, do me a favor.

630
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,610
As long as I'm your number one
friend and classmate, I'm good.

631
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:08,220
Never make me your number two.

632
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,030
Number one, always.

633
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,680
I'm really leaving now.

634
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,750
Why...

635
00:44:56,210 --> 00:45:01,770
 At age 19, you were spiky like a rock 

636
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:05,320
 and would trip me over all the time. 

637
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,470
 I would always trip over,
as if I couldn't help it. 

638
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:13,850
 And with each fall, 

639
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:17,880
 I was able to live a few more days. 

640
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:26,900
 Some light shines through the broken cracks. 

641
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,780
 

642
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:47,940
 One day, light might shine through that crack. 

643
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,260
Don't you think it's fully cooked by now?

644
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:23,830
- You like it crispy.
- You're right.

645
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:25,610
Want a glass?

646
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:33,370
 Cheers! 

647
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:42,350
So sweet.

648
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:46,840
I understand why they pack
liquor for the battlefield.

649
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,430
This is what kept them going.

650
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:51,390
This battlefield.

651
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:54,550
We've walked through ruin after ruin.

652
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:56,610
Great work.

653
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:59,260
You worked harder, Sunbae.

654
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:04,390
I want to beg you to stay with me forever.

655
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,800
Do you want to leave the company together?

656
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:25,430
Let me know if there's anything
you want to discuss.

657
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:28,560
No matter where you are, I'm always on your side.

658
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,160
You know that, right?

659
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,690
I do.

660
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,630
Gosh, it's pouring.

661
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:42,480
You're headed home, right?

662
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,450
Just drive me to the office.

663
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:47,740
You need to return the car, too.

664
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:51,490
It's my job to take you home.

665
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:53,480
It's raining, too.

666
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:56,290
I'm not the only one in the rain.

667
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,430
Don't worry about me, and let's
each get ourselves home tonight.

668
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:01,660
Sure, let's do that.

669
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,790
I need to go process the receipts.

670
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:05,960
Aren't you cold?

671
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:08,000
I'm okay.

672
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,020
It's not so nice to see you.

673
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,310
Are you cramming for something?

674
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:22,280
I might not inherit the company,
but I thought I'd better study up.

675
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,080
Hey, smoke somewhere other than the rooftop.

676
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:28,120
I would've gone elsewhere if you didn't say that.

677
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,750
Don't mess with me.

678
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,870
I'm not in the mood to play ball.

679
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,820
Want to make my stress worse?

680
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,840
Why are you stressed?

681
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,470
I want to stop thinking.

682
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:39,670
So, don't mess with me.

683
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:41,230
You're taking it as that.

684
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:42,670
Hilarious.

685
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,630
Laugh then.

686
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:51,840
Hey.

687
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:56,500
If she looks too drunk, you drive her home.

688
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,270
Better an acquaintance than a stranger.

689
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,620
Don't get any ideas.

690
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:23,490
Hello.

691
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:25,230
Hello.

692
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:32,550
Do you smoke?

693
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:34,270
I'll take one.

694
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:41,070
- And the light?
- Light, too.

695
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:12,580
 

696
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,890
Yes, Ma'am.

697
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,860
I'm eating alone.

698
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,920
 They stare when I go to the cafeteria. 

699
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,190
That's no good.

700
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,510
Want me to ask my son for a favor?

701
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:29,630
He goes to your school.

702
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:31,500
No.

703
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,390
I'm fine right now.

704
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,840
Yes, thank you.

705
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,210
 This is an announcement. 

706
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:46,120
 We'll be voting on school apparel next week. 

707
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,640
Please check the school bulletin board.

708
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,790
 The school book review competition starts today. 

709
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:57,440
He has a great voice...

710
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,930
 Please inquire at the library for details. 

711
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:02,820
 This is the phrase of the day. 

712
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:06,630
 "It's always darkest before the dawn." 

713
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:13,390
It's dangerous! What are you doing?

714
00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:14,820
Right?

715
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:17,090
I almost crossed the river.

716
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,700
Mo Tae Rin?

717
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:24,030
Hello.

718
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,800
Hello...

719
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:29,660
Sung Je Yeon?

720
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:31,640
Yes.

721
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,940
 Hey, she's so pretty! 

722
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:38,570
Please wear the apparel throughout
the promotion period.

723
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:40,280
Three days total, one day per grade.

724
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,410
I'll bring more outfits for you to try on.

725
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:44,490
Just wait a moment.

726
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:50,120
 You can't stay here. 

727
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,900
 Step away. 

728
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:02,480
Hello.

729
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,220
Your voice...

730
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,230
Should we sit for a bit?

731
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:10,360
The chairs look sturdy.

732
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:19,650
You're going to sit in the air?

733
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:22,730
Your voice is amazing.

734
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:24,720
Can you say that in a long sentence?

735
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,610
How can I say this in a longer sentence?

736
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:34,100
Sit... in... the... a... i... r...?

737
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,770
It's so weird.

738
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:42,260
Yeah, it's so weird.

739
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:47,370
Is it okay to be here alone?

740
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:49,640
Can't I be here alone?

741
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:52,720
I ran into your manager.

742
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,250
She seemed worried or something.

743
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:57,130
Sounds like you're close to my manager.

744
00:52:57,130 --> 00:53:01,310
Well, enough for her to freak
out if she heard that.

745
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:29,220
What do you think?

746
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:36,260
- Pretty.
- You didn't even look.

747
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,080
Do you feel better?

748
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:54,820
Voice of the Day.

749
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:57,670
I feel better.

750
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:03,690
What does that have to do with my voice?

751
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,240
Did you hear me on air?

752
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:11,740
Yes, I've listened to you a couple
of times. Since a while back.

753
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:15,100
I see. A while back...

754
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,210
How will you get home?

755
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:21,080
Did my manager ask you? To give me a ride?

756
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:23,130
Apart from that, I wanted to give you a ride.

757
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:25,250
I have company.

758
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:28,610
He'll give me a ride.

759
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:31,520
Thanks for the thought, though.

760
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,320
My eyeglasses...

761
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,370
Won't you give them back?

762
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,520
Goodbye.

763
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:01,190
Your hands are cold.

764
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:03,790
You'd better get home soon, too.

765
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,480
Her hands were colder...

766
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:15,970
Tae Rin.

767
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:18,340
This color looks great on you.

768
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:21,680
Your hair is sticking out. Let me redo it for you.

769
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,240
She has other people doing everything for her.

770
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,510
It must be because she's a celebrity.

771
00:55:27,510 --> 00:55:30,260
Guys, recess is almost over. Go rest.

772
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,740
- Okay, we'll head out first.
- We'll head out first.

773
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:40,600
- Why did you embarrass them?
- I did?

774
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,690
You just embarrassed my friends.

775
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:45,650
They're your friends and not maids?

776
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:49,610
You just really embarrassed us by saying that.

777
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:51,740
Is it that you don't know since
you have no friends?

778
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:54,490
Doesn't it embarrass you to take all that in?

779
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:58,000
It's impolite to reject the kindness of friends.

780
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,670
It's your prejudice that I'm just taking it

781
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:03,490
because I don't know anything.

782
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:05,660
You'd better change that.

783
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,400
Where is she going? She needs to head back.

784
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,100
To the restroom!

785
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,080
She heard that?

786
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:16,120
I shouldn't have said all that to Mo Tae Rin.

787
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,820
 

788
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,850
You failed again?

789
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:39,110
Why are you talking to me?

790
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:40,560
I'm here to take the test.

791
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,035
I didn't ask you.

792
00:56:42,035 --> 00:56:43,153
 

793
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,880
- You've never held a job, huh?
- How did you know?

794
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:56,000
Gosh, I came back from studying abroad recently.

795
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,580
Do you have a job?

796
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,520
Yes, I do. Yes, yes.

797
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:02,230
I had to take time out to come here.

798
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:04,460
I need to go take my test.

799
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:08,950
Don't be so sad if I'm not here next time.

800
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,720
I hope you fail.

801
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,240
- Damn!
- Wow.

802
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,550
Stocks during the week, lottery
during the weekend.

803
00:57:23,550 --> 00:57:25,200
You're crazy about easy money.

804
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,840
Because it's easy money.

805
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,710
I'll hit the jackpot and leave the company.

806
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:31,190
My goal is to quit my job.

807
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:33,600
Why did I join the company? To leave!

808
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,790
You had a goal, after all.

809
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:37,920
Did you get Tae Rin home okay?

810
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,270
How was she?

811
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:41,870
Why do you entrust your actress to someone else?

812
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:43,820
- Weren't you nervous?
- I was.

813
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:45,980
Tae Rin doesn't hold back, and you have no filter.

814
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:49,000
And yet you entrusted someone
so dangerous to me?

815
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:53,720
Hey, do you live here now?

816
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,130
Something like that.

817
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:57,230
Hey.

818
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,730
Teach me how to drive.

819
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:03,160
Why would I teach you? Get an expert to teach you.

820
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,760
Not just any lessons. Road driving practice.

821
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,050
What are you talking about?

822
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:09,980
I don't want to go to the driving school
because of an annoying guy.

823
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,090
You really don't have a license?

824
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:16,410
Did you say you only made one million won
from the stock info I shared last year?

825
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,220
Can't believe you don't have
a license at your age.

826
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:19,300
Want me to help you make 10 million?

827
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,780
I guess it happens. When? Not today.

828
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:24,280
I can't, either. I'm here to review
a contract for my mom.

829
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,360
- How's tomorrow?
- I have to go on-site tomorrow.

830
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,090
How's the day after?

831
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:29,980
I have a blind date that day.

832
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,290
How about the day after that? No, I can't make it.

833
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:34,160
You don't need to practice driving?

834
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,190
It is okay not to have a license on a blind date?

835
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:38,610
It's okay since I have a great background.

836
00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:39,890
Let's find a time after my date.

837
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:41,810
Why are you going on a blind date?

838
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,650
Is the CEO making you?

839
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:46,210
All because of the CEO of the company I work for.

840
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:47,390
Plus, it's business.

841
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,890
Wow, you're so busy.

842
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:57,120
 This is Yu Eun Ji. 

843
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,450
 I got your number from my dad. 

844
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:02,440
 Can I get the feedback
on my writing after my exam? 

845
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,490
I'm going crazy...

846
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:11,470
 About the feedback for the
student you met last time... 

847
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:13,120
Hae!

848
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,940
Hand it over. I'll carry.

849
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:17,580
Thank you.

850
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:20,770
Gosh, looks like you had this
flower left over today.

851
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:21,880
Yeah.

852
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,500
Hyung, what should a reply look like?

853
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:29,010
Just make sure you keep the phone on you.

854
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:30,940
What do you know?

855
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,220
Well, do you?

856
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:35,410
The feeling of receiving flowers on just any day?

857
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:39,940
It makes just any day suddenly special.

858
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,320
Love that line.

859
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,720
You should become a writer, Hyung.

860
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,540
That's too big a compliment.

861
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,090
I'll use it on a customer next time.

862
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:52,050
"It makes just any day..." What was it?

863
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:53,240
Suddenly special.

864
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,700
"Suddenly special." That's pretty good.

865
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,650
I feel insulted.

866
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:03,620
Who sent this?

867
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:05,420
The director of "A World Made of Ash."

868
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:07,870
He sent premium pears.

869
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:10,610
He always takes such great care of us.

870
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:12,480
I'm overcome with gratitude.

871
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,170
He got so rich off your novel.

872
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:17,310
It doesn't feel right whenever he tries
to get by with sending something like this.

873
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:20,630
You stopped writing after the movie worked out.

874
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:22,050
Who did?

875
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:25,070
- I stopped writing?
- You didn't?

876
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:28,510
I'll think it was a win for the production
company when the film adaptation went well.

877
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:31,690
Did you really write only to pay your bills?

878
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:33,310
You never dreamed of the
Nobel Prize in literature?

879
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:35,360
Who knew writing novels would bring in no money?

880
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,990
Flowers don't make money, either.

881
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:40,900
But I don't think that's so important in life.

882
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:46,190
So, I hope you do everything you want
without worrying about money.

883
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:50,300
- You are so...
- I'm just me.

884
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,460
Lee Geon No.

885
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:54,940
Lee Geon No.

886
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,960
You live like that, Hyung.

887
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,150
I'll be thinking a lot about money.

888
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:07,470
I wish this were money.

889
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,840
Wow, it's Actress Mo.

890
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,440
Is this a still from the new show?

891
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:22,260
Yes, they wanted selects for the
press release and promotion.

892
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:25,630
Gosh, Tae Rin looks prettier on her other side.

893
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:29,520
She closed her eyes here, but she
looks cute. Don't you think?

894
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:34,550
You know that Tae Rin's contract
with our company ends this month, right?

895
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:37,300
Have you talked to her?

896
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:41,400
There's not much I can do.

897
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:46,100
I just support Tae Rin's decisions.

898
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,200
 

899
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,400
You did last time, too.

900
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,420
Did you have a fight with your phone?

901
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,890
I wonder what he sent...

902
01:01:58,890 --> 01:02:01,070
You'd better check if you're curious.

903
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:04,140
This one's pretty. Go with that one.

904
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:07,630
You and your meaningless comments...

905
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:20,670
 Okay. 

906
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:22,290
Okay?

907
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:25,130
 

908
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:32,610
 

909
01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:35,050
"Sleet and Fog."

910
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:36,670
"Waegeum."

911
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,800
"A World Made of Ash."

912
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:43,290
You didn't check? We're already in pre-production.

913
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:45,300
The actors from the first two series
stayed true to their words,

914
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,220
and the main character signed
the appearance agreement!

915
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:49,950
What will you do about this?

916
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:53,650
What the hell have you been doing
with expired copyrights?

917
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:02,700
Did you check with those who worked
on the first phase of the film adaptation?

918
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:05,700
The copyright expiration of "A World Made of Ash."

919
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:07,960
- Why did you just get here?
- I had a meeting.

920
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:10,100
Many people had left the company.

921
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:13,300
It's tough to hold the current staff accountable...

922
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:17,900
Before you try to pin it on someone,
review other issues.

923
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:19,470
Director, you have a solution, right?

924
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:21,500
If we can't resolve this,
the third sequel will cancel.

925
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:25,550
Why don't we start filming
and solve it eventually?

926
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:27,680
 
The original author has kept quiet this whole time.

927
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,860
That's why it sounded familiar.

928
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:32,910
It comes down to paying them
out if there's an issue.

929
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:37,030
- We'll pay.
- Is that how you'd recoup the investment?

930
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:40,520
Just be pathetic and say you'd step down!

931
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,750
Kim Pil Du, are you crazy?

932
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:44,630
Sorry to be late.

933
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:47,960
The original publisher went bankrupt...

934
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:51,800
The original is out of print, and the
contract just states "original writer."

935
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,720
Other than the CEO of the publisher,

936
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:56,500
no one directly interacted with the author.

937
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,890
I heard there's an agent. So, I'm looking for him.

938
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:01,300
We wouldn't have wasted time
if you had collaborated from the beginning.

939
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:04,200
Just stay out of this. Out!

940
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:08,340
Excuse me.

941
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:10,750
If the original author extends the copyright,

942
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:12,640
does that solve the problem?

943
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:20,100
It's the same person I was looking
for for PD Yu Jae Il.

944
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:21,980
Jin Mu Yeong.

945
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:27,330
Yes.

946
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:30,790
The name sounds familiar.

947
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:32,770
I am in touch-

948
01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:38,310
with the original author's agent.

949
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:39,410
Good job.

950
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:42,600
Although I'm sure you didn't expect this stupidity.

951
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:45,200
Je Yeon, contact them and set up a meeting.

952
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:48,210
- As soon as possible.
- Okay.

953
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:50,140
Please draft the agreement.

954
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:53,230
Based on the original contract,
the publisher and the production company

955
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:55,210
monopolized the copyright
and the running guarantee.

956
01:04:55,210 --> 01:04:57,070
Did he get screwed-

957
01:04:57,970 --> 01:04:59,130
It was an unfair contract?

958
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:02,150
I'd be so offended that I wouldn't
even consider an extension.

959
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:04,150
Offer two to three times the
market price for copyright,

960
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,210
and a separate running guarantee. Okay?

961
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:11,000
All right, marketing team.
How are the press materials?

962
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:20,370
Welcome.

963
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:23,970
Hi.

964
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:27,440
Yes, hi.

965
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:30,770
What brings you here out of the blue?

966
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:32,090
Take this first.

967
01:05:32,090 --> 01:05:34,310
Your shirt I ripped last time.

968
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:36,550
I bought a sturdy one.

969
01:05:37,950 --> 01:05:41,560
- Took you long enough.
- Of course, you didn't forget.

970
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:43,460
Thank you.

971
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:48,330
1. Work request.

972
01:05:48,330 --> 01:05:50,500
2. Personal request.

973
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:53,810
- What do you want to hear first?
- Whatever is more urgent.

974
01:05:53,810 --> 01:05:56,900
The film "A World Made of Ash." Third sequel.

975
01:05:56,900 --> 01:06:01,000
The copyright of the original has expired,
so I need the author's extension.

976
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,320
And?

977
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,500
I reviewed the draft of the contract,

978
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,920
and it's the best-in-class offer,
in terms of money.

979
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:12,680
It'll be tricky if we can't extend it.

980
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,320
Could you send your agent?

981
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:17,490
Geon No. He's my agent.

982
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:19,740
I'll send you his number.

983
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:21,280
This easily?

984
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:24,160
You said you reviewed my contract.

985
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,990
I'd imagine you made sure it's in my favor.

986
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:32,400
I didn't know you trusted me that much.

987
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:39,120
I've learned that trusting is easier
than being suspicious.

988
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:42,090
What's number two?

989
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:46,180
Your old contract was ridiculous-

990
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:49,120
I meant, it's not great.

991
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:50,910
If that happens again,

992
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:55,610
air your grievance and share
how you were screwed over.

993
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:59,320
We can curse them out together and feel better.

994
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,740
I'm great at cursing.

995
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:04,330
In order to curse them out,

996
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:08,710
I need to go back into the past and regurgitate...

997
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,270
That's harder.

998
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:15,970
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

999
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:17,590
Why would you be?

1000
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:22,090
Oh, right. You put the snapdragon
in a vase, right?

1001
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:24,410
- Yes.
- Do you even have a vase at home?

1002
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:26,590
- I think so...
- "I think so"?

1003
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:28,430
Wait a minute.

1004
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:48,770
Hello, CEO.

1005
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:53,700
Oh, I was able to contact the original author.

1006
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,730
As you know, his agent will come in.

1007
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:57,920
How disappointing.

1008
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,200
I wanted to meet the face behind the name.

1009
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:06,240
How come my eyes hurt so much today?

1010
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:11,110
 

1011
01:08:11,110 --> 01:08:13,880
 

1012
01:08:15,390 --> 01:08:17,680
The official article is up.

1013
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,600
The sitcom was so great.

1014
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,250
Weren't you a baby back then?

1015
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:24,610
Gosh, it's all online these days.

1016
01:08:24,610 --> 01:08:28,500
Plus, I met Bebop in person.

1017
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:32,070
Is Sunwoo Hae still good-looking?

1018
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:34,930
He was pretty cute when he was little.

1019
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:36,800
Did he do the show because
he needs sponsorships?

1020
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,230
Is it okay for Sunwoo Hae to go on TV?

1021
01:08:39,230 --> 01:08:41,430
His career ended when he scammed people.

1022
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:45,590
Really? He didn't look like a scammer.

1023
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:47,490
He seemed like a nice person.

1024
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:50,130
You're so naive.

1025
01:08:50,130 --> 01:08:54,000
Look up "Sunwoo Hae scam" online.

1026
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,800
No, man...

1027
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:00,200
Right. Did that video get taken down?

1028
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,950
I watched it. The kid was fierce.
Not a single tear.

1029
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:07,280
That felt like acting, too.
Doesn't it give you chills?

1030
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:11,030
I'm sure he knows, too.
That he caused his mom's death.

1031
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,320
Let's not rehash old news.

1032
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,300
It's so tacky. What are you doing?

1033
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:21,540
What did you just say?

1034
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:23,870
This is not cool.

1035
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:26,060
It embarrasses me just by listening to it.

1036
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:28,760
Why don't you fend for yourself
instead of meddling?

1037
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:31,070
You can't even take care of your actress.

1038
01:09:31,070 --> 01:09:34,110
I let it slide because you're a woman,
and you think you can act out, huh?

1039
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:36,600
What did you let slide?

1040
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,580
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1041
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:40,940
What did you say? You crazy...

1042
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:43,850
Hey, hey. Je Yeon, stop.

1043
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:48,350
Stop what? Did I trash you or your mother?

1044
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,320
Why are you overacting?

1045
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:52,180
You have no idea about other people's lives.

1046
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:55,470
Making assumptions is just vulgar.

1047
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:57,550
- How dare you?
- Stop, stop!

1048
01:09:57,550 --> 01:09:59,210
Stop! Stop, stop!

1049
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:00,700
Let go.

1050
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,020
Who the hell are you?

1051
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:04,980
What is this?

1052
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:06,460
I didn't have a sponsor.

1053
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:09,320
People who stole my name are the scammers.

1054
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,630
I worked my ass off to pay that money back.

1055
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:17,400
And I know I caused my mom's death.

1056
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:23,020
How dare you lay a finger on her,
you son of a bitch.

1057
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:31,690
 ♫ Come closer ♫ 

1058
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:38,690
 ♫ The red sunset ♫ 

1059
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:45,560
 ♫ Night and day meet briefly ♫ 

1060
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:51,850
 ♫ Like us back then ♫ 

1061
01:10:53,950 --> 01:10:59,570
 ♫ Like falling asleep ♫ 

1062
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:08,680
 ♫ Pretending not to know and embrace ♫ 

1063
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:15,610
 ♫ It's like love that gets pushed away ♫ 

1064
01:11:15,610 --> 01:11:22,640
 ♫ Like the longing that comes back ♫ 

1065
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,210
 ♫ Like the horizon where day and night meet ♫
