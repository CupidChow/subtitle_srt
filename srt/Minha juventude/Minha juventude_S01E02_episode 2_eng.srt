1
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,970
 

2
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,370
What was that?

3
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,400
Just to say it was nice to see you.

4
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,760
Bye.

5
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,350
Hey!

6
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,070
Were you always this impatient?

7
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,990
Why don't you buy me dinner
if you're happy to see me?

8
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,140
And drinks, too.

9
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,230
We're not 19 anymore.

10
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,130
- I used to like that flower?
- Yeah.

11
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,390
I don't even know what it's called.

12
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,460
That's what I remember.

13
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,960
If I liked it, I would at least remember its name.

14
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,500
Forget-me-not.

15
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,580
Not that.

16
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,670
Do you remember everything from the past?

17
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,160
- How about you?
- I only remember the things I want to forget.

18
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,540
Here it is. You don't remember?

19
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,100
Right, this.

20
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,450
I don't remember.

21
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,650
You got good grades.
What's wrong with your memory?

22
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,220
Here you go.

23
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,980
Thank you.

24
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,840
Good night.

25
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,260
Hey.

26
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,380
Did you just get out of school?

27
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,870
Are you eating properly?

28
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,700
How come you got so thin?

29
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,050
- I have no money. Go.
- Hey! You-

30
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,050
When did I ever take money from you?

31
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,790
Wait a second.

32
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,960
I mean... it's just...

33
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,520
Could you watch her?

34
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,760
I'll be back soon to take her back.
So, just until then.

35
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,700
You always said that and never came back.

36
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,570
- How can I trust you?
- I mean it.

37
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,360
Nu Ri, ahjussi had something come up.

38
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,330
I can't watch you anymore.

39
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,540
I'm sorry!

40
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,740
You have no idea how I live.
Now, a stranger's kid?

41
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,970
How old are you?

42
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,390
Isn't she cute?

43
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,410
You had a second family?

44
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,630
Hold onto Oppa, okay?

45
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,740
- Hey, you!
- Don't say "Hey, you" to your dad!

46
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,000
 In just a few hours, 2008 will be over 

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,100
 and 2009, the year of the cow, will begin. 

48
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,360
 Currently, at the New Year's Bell,
crowds are gathering. 

49
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,980
O-Oppa.

50
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,880
Can I call you that?

51
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,530
You can, sure.

52
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,470
I'm older than you.

53
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,470
What does this mean?

54
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,540
Nothing about this is normal.

55
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,600
Do you even read Hangul?

56
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,710
Thank goodness you don't know what it means.

57
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,310
Why are you looking for a well-paying
job all of a sudden?

58
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,650
Did your dad get into trouble again?

59
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,640
He dropped off the daughter

60
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,810
of the woman he was living
with and totally ghosted.

61
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,310
That woman ran away a long time ago.

62
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,380
So, you'll raise her or something?

63
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,630
Someone has to take care of her. She's a kid.

64
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,680
Hey, you're a kid, too.

65
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,720
 ♫ For no reason ♫ 

66
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,740
 ♫ Like nothing happened ♫ 

67
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,530
 ♫ Like it's nothing ♫ 

68
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:52,860
 ♫ Like it doesn't mean anything ♫ 

69
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:04,330
 ♫ My breathing gets faster and faster ♫ 

70
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:13,020
 ♫ It's caught in my throat, a piece of a memory ♫ 

71
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,640
 ♫ I barely spit it out ♫ 

72
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:26,550
 ♫ Thoughts of you spill out ♫ 

73
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,620
 ♫ I try to swallow it back ♫ 

74
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:38,050
 ♫ And I can't fight through
my memories of you ♫ 

75
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:45,080
 ♫ Hiding in the time that's slipping away ♫ 

76
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,670
 ♫ Even if I just breathe ♫ 

77
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,000
 

78
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,720
 

79
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,850
Perfect.

80
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,830
Yay!

81
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,140
I'm returning the keys.

82
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,600
Thank you.

83
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,010
- Good night.
- Bye now.

84
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,560
Hello, Boss.

85
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,150
It's "noona".

86
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,620
Why are you always reading?

87
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,120
I felt like I needed to read something.

88
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,650
- See you tomorrow, Boss.
- "Noona"!

89
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,580
Don't go anywhere else.

90
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,550
I could only do that if I had any energy.

91
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,500
How did you find my address?

92
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,820
Does that matter right now?

93
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,650
If you take my money, take it out on my dad.

94
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,640
What are you doing here?

95
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,940
Did you forget that people fell
for scams because of you?

96
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,460
Stop it. Let's go get tteokbokki.

97
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,640
We didn't come here for this.

98
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,540
If he hasn't run away, that's good.

99
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,710
You must have been hungry.

100
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,080
What a first impression.

101
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,630
Wow. You live here?

102
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,890
With your mom?

103
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,700
My mom is marrying your dad. Isn't that sad?

104
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,380
Sounds like you're sad.

105
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,100
My mom will come to see your face.

106
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,860
Try to act pitiful. To let you live with her.

107
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,060
- Why would I do that?
- To make her suffer.

108
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,610
Why do you need her to suffer?

109
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,800
You must be really sad...

110
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,470
Kim Seok Joo.

111
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,920
Why don't you look like you're struggling?

112
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,030
That's so bloody annoying.

113
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,660
If you're done messing with me, leave.

114
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,540
I'm not messing with you. I'm curious. Hey!

115
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,700
Hey, let's talk!

116
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,160
That guy...

117
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,120
 

118
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,460
Seok Joo, you're still here.

119
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,400
Make yourself at home.

120
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,840
Should I go inside one of the rooms?

121
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,900
Sure.

122
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,690
Stop it. I know you're here.

123
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,770
Are you doing this on purpose?

124
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,900
I'm the guest. How come you're
acting more like the guest?

125
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,990
You make the guest feel uncomfortable.

126
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,240
What brings you home?

127
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,460
Home?

128
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,790
I mean, your place. I mean, Noona's...

129
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,730
 

130
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:44,900
Ahjussi, aren't you curious
how your kids are doing?

131
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,500
Am I allowed to be curious?

132
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,650
How is Hae doing?

133
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,230
Do you still talk to him?

134
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,060
I'm actually leaving now.

135
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,230
I hope you live a healthy, long life.

136
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,320
He doesn't even have a single gray hair.

137
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,810
I get it dyed...

138
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:17,300
Is Seok Joo nice or mean?

139
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,510
Hello.

140
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,160
A pack of cigarettes, please.

141
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,130
The yellow one over there.

142
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,700
This one?

143
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,210
You don't resemble Chan.

144
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,190
I don't know where he is,
and I don't have any money.

145
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,650
He is at my place.

146
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,540
He's going to marry me.

147
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,930
No need to introduce yourself.

148
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,560
I heard you have a special talent.

149
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,340
You skip classes but go to essay contests,

150
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,680
and always win a prize.

151
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,510
I started the transfer process for you.

152
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:15,830
I'm sure Chan wasn't a good father.

153
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,830
You should at least graduate
from a proper high school.

154
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:22,230
I'll provide tuition and rent within reason-

155
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,960
When an adult is speaking, you should respond.

156
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,550
When adults tell me things,
it turns out like that.

157
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,440
I'm legally still a minor, so...

158
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,170
So, I can start going to school
next semester, right?

159
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,550
Would you like a bag?

160
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,130
It's great that you're obedient.

161
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,330
I wish my Seok Joo were like this.

162
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,080
How much are you going to give me?

163
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,730
I'm curious what kind
of price range you put on me.

164
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,940
You can't stand to bring me into your house,

165
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,470
so you want to make up for it with money.

166
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,600
No thanks.

167
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,940
Those things always end up being something I owe.

168
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,680
I heard you got held back a grade.

169
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,990
You should at least graduate from high school.

170
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,600
Ahjumma, why do you like him?

171
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,550
Because he's innocent.

172
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,170
I'm not interested in moving in with you,

173
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,100
so don't worry and be happy, you two.

174
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,580
Hi.

175
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,360
Hi.

176
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,400
- Hi!
 - Hello. 

177
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,560
- How was your summer vacation? Good?
 - Yes. 

178
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,790
Then, let's check attendance and begin right away.

179
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,230
 Yes. 

180
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,010
 

181
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,340
Sunwoo Hae!

182
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,050
Sunwoo Hae!

183
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,050
Time to wake up.

184
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,530
- I'm going to start that over, guys.
 - Yes! 

185
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,230
- Number one, Go Hyo Seon.
- Here.

186
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,390
 - It's him. 
- Hi.

187
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,190
Let's put it in groups of three.

188
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,840
- First one?
- One.

189
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,300
One? Next one? Zero.

190
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,440
One, right?

191
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,930
It says, "Will you really abandon me?"

192
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:18,730
The best accomplishment is
to blur the line between work and play.

193
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:22,210
In the phrase, "Blur the line
between work and play,"

194
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:25,050
the subject is this. Got it?

195
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,440
Until your study halls are assigned, study here.

196
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,800
If you're skipping night study hall,
submit your academy enrollment papers.

197
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,060
 - Got it! 
- That's the end of our day. Bye!

198
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,500
 Bye! 

199
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,320
All he does is sleep.

200
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,320
Hyung, wake up! Time to go to work.

201
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,740
Wake up! Let's go.

202
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,600
- Did you decide on an academy?
- I told you not to act like we're friends.

203
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,400
But we are friends. We've known
each other for 10 years.

204
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,590
No. I don't like kids like you.

205
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,770
What is a kid like me?

206
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,840
Ones with knives right here.

207
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,660
Do you already know Sunwoo Hae?

208
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,500
Seems like you knew him already.

209
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,730
- Did you like him when he was a celebrity?
- Come on.

210
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:21,060
He was so annoying back then.

211
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,460
So what are you two?

212
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,040
You didn't want me to be friendly.

213
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,180
I could just...

214
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,720
I sent you my number.

215
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,780
You finally got a phone.

216
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,770
Ta-da. Happy birthday.

217
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,280
All right.

218
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,910
Make a wish and blow out the candle.

219
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,200
One second. Hold this.

220
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,380
My goodness.

221
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,190
Hey! Make a wish before blowing it out.

222
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,290
When you were doing sitcoms, it was this concept.

223
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,790
Making other people's wishes come true.

224
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,960
If you make your own wish, it'll come true.

225
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,860
Make my own wish come true?

226
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,100
I'd rather not.

227
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,710
Since you're 20 now,
I will buy you alcohol for life.

228
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,270
- Give it to me in cash.
- I can't do that.

229
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,180
 

230
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,100
I'm back.

231
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,860
Hey, you made it.

232
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,260
Hey, what happened to your shirt?

233
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,210
Oh, hello.

234
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,740
Hello.

235
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,910
Have some food while you wait.

236
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,650
Wait for what?

237
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,230
I work part-time here at night.

238
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,400
I'm covering for someone today. Here.

239
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,560
- Hey!
- I'll go change.

240
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,280
Hey! Where are you going?
Where are the green onions?

241
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,300
- The green onions?
- Yes.

242
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,900
I thought you just sent me out for fresh air.

243
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,380
Hey! Don't you know what multitasking is?

244
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,560
I've never skipped green onions in my appetizers.

245
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,000
You must have some in the fridge. Just look.

246
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,750
He was out for green onions, I see.

247
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,560
Would the evening be difficult?

248
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,550
I can just deliver the profile really quickly...

249
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,480
My boss says sorry we ran out of green onions.

250
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,080
It's all right.

251
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,360
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

252
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,840
I know you're so busy.

253
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,440
Okay, then, when you're en route...

254
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,310
She works hard.

255
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,550
Are you finished?

256
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,200
One second. Let me ring you up.

257
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,930
I see. Okay.

258
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,020
- Would you like a receipt?
- No, thank you.

259
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,210
Thank you.

260
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,350
- Thank you.
- Get home safe. Thank you. Come again!

261
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,860
 Je Yeon, let's talk for a second. 

262
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,700
Je Yeon, can you give this to Hae?

263
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,570
A career aspiration form is in there.
Get that from him.

264
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,300
Hae is the only one who hasn't turned it in.

265
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,900
- Do me a favor.
- Sure.

266
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,240
Teacher, I heard Hae is a year older than us.

267
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,940
Did he just get back from being abroad?

268
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,850
He wasn't abroad.

269
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:50,950
I heard he took a year off because he was sick.

270
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,460
You know we're getting
a grass lawn outside, right?

271
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,840
Hae's family is paying for it.

272
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,390
 

273
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,290
His family is paying for the lawn?

274
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,130
Hey.

275
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,930
I'm the class president.

276
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,630
I have your prize certificate and gift card.

277
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,460
You waited for me because of this?

278
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,200
I thought I might miss you if I came after dinner.

279
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,120
Our teacher says to fill out the career
aspiration form inside the envelope.

280
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,500
Who is this?

281
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,940
Do I need to say hello?

282
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,610
Hello.

283
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,310
I'm the class president.

284
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,260
I'm running an errand.

285
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,230
Hello.

286
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,990
I'm his sister.

287
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,660
I go to daycare.

288
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,670
Want ramen?

289
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,420
Ramen?

290
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:30,010
Thank you for the food.

291
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,400
- So good.
- I make good ramen.

292
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:53,610
It's just one pebble that fell in,

293
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,490
but everything spilled out.

294
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,210
It's been so long since I read
a novel that wasn't on an exam.

295
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,300
It's so good.

296
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,500
- Is it good?
- I'm hard to please.

297
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,900
Everything they told me to read
since I was little was no fun.

298
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:41,050
If you like it, do you want to borrow it?

299
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,120
- Can I?
- It will be published soon.

300
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,260
- Published?
- Yes.

301
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,000
Wait, did you write this?

302
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,780
I wanted my sister to read,
but I didn't see anything I liked.

303
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,780
You did something amazing, like it was nothing.

304
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,480
Are you a genius or something?

305
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,210
I don't know about that.

306
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,980
I just want to make money.

307
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,530
Money.

308
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,970
I'll buy the book when it's out.

309
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:17,760
If you want me to pay for the ramen, I will.

310
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,920
She wanted this form from me?
 

311
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,240
How did she know I'm not going to school?

312
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,050
Why do you keep missing school?

313
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,830
To work and sleep.

314
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,840
There's nothing for me to do there anyway.

315
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,290
My future aspiration?

316
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,900
George Clooney.

317
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,360
What are you doing? Be serious.

318
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,520
I am serious. It's just hard.

319
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,430
That's the easiest thing in the world.

320
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:50,100
Then, fill out the part about
what your parents want first.

321
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,020
 

322
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,700
What did you write, Class President?

323
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,320
Judge, prosecutor, lawyer.

324
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,800
I wrote down what my mom said.

325
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,740
Aren't you supposed to write what you want?

326
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,050
- You're not your mom.
- Geez.

327
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:10,050
Let's see what you come up with, then.

328
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,890
Sorry.

329
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:18,400
We're not that close yet.

330
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,620
I got too riled up.

331
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,480
I'm just going to write "rich."

332
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,740
I want to be rich.

333
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,000
Can you fill out all three choices?

334
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,700
Then, rich, billionaire, chaebol.

335
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,560
Hey.

336
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,010
So do you work part-time? Something like that?

337
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,690
Yeah. When I'm awake, always.

338
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:54,260
Can I ask you why?

339
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,930
I don't know. To make a living, I guess?

340
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,660
What do you do when you're awake?

341
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,910
Except for when I'm sleeping, I study.

342
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:05,080
Wow. Amazing.

343
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,160
Isn't that exhausting?

344
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,250
Is it supposed to be?

345
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,900
I don't know.

346
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,880
I thought you were going to write down "actor."

347
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,190
That's nonsense.

348
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,720
For the career aspiration form.

349
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,970
When we were young, you were so famous.

350
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:25,840
Did you retire or something like that?

351
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,280
George Clooney is an actor, too.

352
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,600
I didn't know.

353
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,050
I don't really watch TV.

354
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:38,500
I guess that's why it sounded strange.

355
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,040
It was a person.

356
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,760
You must not be online so much.

357
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,780
Haven't you heard what kids say about me?

358
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,730
I'm not interested in other people's business.

359
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,950
How about you sleep at school?

360
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,430
You can say you're sick
and sleep at the nurse's office.

361
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,500
Or you can be late or go home early.

362
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,130
- Get to the point.
- I'm worried about you.

363
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,620
What if you don't have enough
attendance days to graduate?

364
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,290
Wow.

365
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:10,690
It's been so long since someone
else besides Geon No worried about me.

366
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,850
Who's Geon No?

367
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:16,000
If he's your hyung, he must be really old.

368
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,970
Can you ring me up?

369
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:27,210
One moment.

370
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:29,600
- How was everything?
- Good.

371
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,790
One soju, one beer...

372
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,770
47,000 won. Ow!

373
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,160
- Would you like a receipt?
- No, thank you.

374
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,130
Thank you... ow!

375
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,450
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. All good.

376
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,530
Thank you. Come again.

377
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,900
See you later.

378
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,530
Bye.

379
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:54,060
Hae, does this have to be here?
I keep getting poked.

380
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,380
It looks nice here.

381
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,380
It's been there forever.
You're still getting poked?

382
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,340
Here's your food that you didn't order.

383
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:08,120
If I didn't order it, why am I getting it?

384
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,010
Why are you only drinking then?

385
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,770
A flower shop during the day and a bar at night?

386
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,900
I've been helping out since I was 20.

387
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:20,280
- We're from the same town.
- Since you were 20?

388
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,660
Right, you were 20 when we were in 12th grade.

389
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,960
You got held back because you were sick, right?

390
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,200
Did I even tell you that?

391
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,250
The Class President knows it all.

392
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,510
Don't act up.

393
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,400
Got it, Class President.

394
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,830
Please eat.

395
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:41,160
Hey. I had this childish thought
for the first time back then.

396
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,900
When you would miss school because of work,

397
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,060
the fact that you were making money for yourself

398
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,390
seemed like such a foreign idea.

399
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,070
It seemed so grown-up.

400
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,470
Working to make ends meet and pay down debt?

401
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,670
That does seem grown-up.

402
00:26:56,670 --> 00:27:00,420
Hey, why be so rude when I'm saying you were cool?

403
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,400
Fine.

404
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,260
Just eat. It's really good. Eat.

405
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,760
- Did you make it?
- Of course.

406
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,900
- It's tasty!
- I know.

407
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,970
What drink should I pair it with?

408
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,760
One second.

409
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,670
Here.

410
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:25,630
This one. See? The Boss himself-

411
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,250
230,000 won?

412
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,260
Did you forget you were treating?

413
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,400
I acted like a server without
even thinking about it.

414
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,050
Fortunately, Geon No broke this bottle last time.

415
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,900
- What? Fortunately?
- Fire!

416
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,070
Oh, my gosh!

417
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,920
Let me help you. One second.

418
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,420
I've been waiting for this.

419
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,460
I knew this would come in handy.

420
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,260
Excuse me!

421
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,490
- Excuse me!
- Don't get close!

422
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:55,130
Excuse me! Move out of the way!

423
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:59,090
What are you doing?

424
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:02,130
Hey! Careful!

425
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,070
Wow, what was that?

426
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,050
It went out right away. Are you a firefighter?

427
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,220
Are you okay?

428
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,730
Water would have worked just fine.

429
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,440
That's your guest. You clean it up.

430
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,460
This is our restaurant. Let's clean up together.

431
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,240
So cool.

432
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,870
Is it true that Sunwoo Hae goes to a motel?

433
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,480
And he transferred to our school?

434
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,740
That hurts our school's reputation.

435
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,300
Hey, did you get into college yet?

436
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,900
Go gossip outside.

437
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:55,100
Guys, let's be quiet. We're studying.

438
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,240
Including you, Kim Seok Joo.

439
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,400
Me?

440
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,760
Also, spreading rumors is wrong.

441
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,530
Please stop.

442
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,900
If you keep missing school,
you might not graduate.

443
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,670
Here are places you might apply
for special rolling admission.

444
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:19,500
If you study, you could try for regular admission.

445
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,180
Is it weird to go from troublemaker
to special student over a few awards?

446
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:26,050
Coming here in the first place was cheating.

447
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:28,570
You should cheat in life sometimes.

448
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:31,200
You're allowed.

449
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,220
Also, what's with George Clooney?

450
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,990
Will you change your name?

451
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,840
Sunwoo... Clooney?

452
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,440
Those are both surnames.

453
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,420
In Korean, it's like Sunwoo Namgung.

454
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:46,500
Why am I even entertaining this?

455
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,500
What did the Teacher say?

456
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,720
She wants me to try for rolling admission.
But why bother?

457
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,690
It's because your grades are crap, right?

458
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,860
I know you don't study at all.

459
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,500
I told you to pay attention to your attendance.

460
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,990
That's true, but I'm not going to college.

461
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:11,640
How can you not go to college?

462
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,030
Some people don't.

463
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,610
Where are you going? It's lunch.

464
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:25,110
Hey, run, run!

465
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,800
- Hurry up!
- Here.

466
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,770
For dessert.

467
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,690
What?

468
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,500
What is this candy?

469
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,260
Wait for me!

470
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:56,620
Is it good?

471
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,780
It's suddenly good.

472
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,670
How about you? Is it good?

473
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,640
It's so sweet.

474
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,930
Why aren't you eating lunch?

475
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,500
I didn't pay for it. Didn't want to waste money.

476
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,540
But the nutritionists worked
so hard to put it together.

477
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,710
It's healthy...

478
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,620
I see.

479
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,330
I think your idea was actually good.

480
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,380
I'm going to use it more often.

481
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,330
 

482
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:40,650
 Oh, sleeping at the nurse's office? 

483
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,040
Yes.

484
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,630
Give it to your sister.

485
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:50,950
Glow-in-the-dark stars?

486
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,250
You can put them on the ceiling
or wherever your sister wants.

487
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,680
Why didn't I think of this?

488
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,530
Because I thought of it?

489
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:01,200
How are you going to be rich like that?

490
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,840
Besides what your mom told you
to write, what do you want to be?

491
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,920
What?

492
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,130
Me?

493
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,510
Going to Seoul National University?

494
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,210
That's about going somewhere.

495
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,470
My question was about your dream.

496
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,600
Do you have to have a dream?

497
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:23,800
I'm curious about what kind
of dreams shining ones like you dream.

498
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,340
Hey!

499
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:31,430
Why would you say that?

500
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,990
Are you okay?

501
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,710
The sky is really pretty.

502
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,370
 Focus! 

503
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,410
I am focused.

504
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,080
Bullshit.

505
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,900
At least pretend like you're reading.

506
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:33,030
Hae, I'm hearing a rumor.

507
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,250
What is wrong with you?

508
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,790
Listen to what he has to say.

509
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,110
Motel?

510
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:42,080
A student going to a motel?

511
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,600
I turned a blind eye to your issues
because of your special skills.

512
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,520
But I hear you walked out of a motel
behind City Hall with a woman.

513
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,490
The rumors are everywhere!

514
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,500
How did anyone see? It must've been a customer.

515
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,280
You should say sorry first!

516
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,160
You are suspended.

517
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,510
You'd better stay home.

518
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,560
What? You really came.

519
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,470
Do you have a crush on Sunwoo Hae?

520
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,490
Does Sunwoo Hae like you?

521
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,710
Do you have a crush on Sunwoo Hae?

522
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,700
How did you know?

523
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,610
- Don't be funny.
- Then, laugh.

524
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:02,840
You haven't changed since you were a kid.

525
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,460
You have such a weird personality.

526
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:13,240
- Did you bring her?
- Is she someone who'd follow me?

527
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,190
Stop showing up where I am.

528
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,060
I don't want your mom to think I lured you out.

529
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,000
I wanted to see if the rumor was true.

530
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,370
You and the motel, Hyung.

531
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,880
Why are you curious about that?

532
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,180
I thought she might be.

533
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,090
This is no fun.

534
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,600
I'm leaving.

535
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:39,030
I-I'm not curious.

536
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,680
I trust you.

537
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,080
I don't trust him.

538
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,840
But this place doesn't suit you.

539
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:49,040
I feel like you're struggling.

540
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,900
Take it easy.

541
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,400
 

542
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,970
I work at the front desk.

543
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:05,060
There aren't many evening part-time jobs.

544
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,580
Go home. Don't be in a place like this.

545
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,900
Okay.

546
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,560
Go.

547
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,910
Okay.

548
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,300
Bye!

549
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,830
Hae.

550
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:30,080
Why are you out so late?

551
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,860
Hae!

552
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,740
Come with Dad.

553
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,440
Noona...

554
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:48,270
Pil Du is going to pay back all of our debts.

555
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:51,930
That ahjumma sure priced you high.

556
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,420
What will you do about Nu Ri?

557
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,230
Nu Ri...

558
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,900
I can't get in touch with her mom.

559
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,190
- I'll send her to an orphanage-
- Are you crazy?

560
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,930
We'll figure out a way to live on our own.

561
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,540
Don't ever show up like this again.

562
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,860
Don't you ever think of your mom?

563
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,950
If you get sick...

564
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:16,670
we can't pay for your medicine, the hospital...

565
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,620
If I get sick and die,
will that ahjumma pay for it all?

566
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,530
It's not like I'm going to be terminal.

567
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,550
You want me to die, don't you?

568
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:28,790
- Hae!
- I'd rather as well.

569
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,680
I'm sorry.

570
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:36,550
Neither your mom nor I have the right to face you.

571
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,970
Leave me alone.

572
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:43,360
I'm hanging on each and every day.

573
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,050
Son.

574
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,910
I liked that Unni.

575
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:30,020
How about you? Do you like her?

576
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,230
What are you talking about?

577
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,800
All done.

578
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,070
Pack your bag. You'll be late for daycare.

579
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:39,180
I'm not going to daycare today.

580
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,590
It's Children's Day.

581
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:47,210
What do I do if the daycare
doesn't open on Children's Day?

582
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:48,950
What should we do?

583
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,760
Tie my hair again.

584
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,940
I want to go to the amusement park.

585
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,630
Should we ride that one?

586
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,550
I want ice cream.

587
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,180
You're asking for something?

588
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,320
Should we go get it together?

589
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,520
My legs hurt.

590
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,640
I'll be over there.

591
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,500
I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere.

592
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,430
I'm sorry, did you see that girl over there

593
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:12,430
with pigtails and a yellow shirt?

594
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:15,780
I don't know. I'm sorry.

595
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,410
I'm sorry, but did you see this girl

596
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,630
about this tall, with pigtails and a backpack?

597
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,160
I didn't.

598
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,250
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

599
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,410
Eun Nu Ri!

600
00:41:09,410 --> 00:41:11,370
Eun Nu Ri!

601
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,530
I'm sick and tired of this.

602
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,370
 A girl wearing a yellow shirt,
red backpack, and pigtails is missing. 

603
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:41,410
 Her guardian is desperately looking for her. 

604
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:45,570
 If you've seen this child... 

605
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,790
Is someone inside?

606
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:58,830
We're closing. You need to come out.

607
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,080
Excuse me, I'm Eun Nu Ri's guardian.

608
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,400
- You found her?
- Yes.

609
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,680
An employee found her.

610
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,150
There she comes.

611
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:17,540
She said she was thirsty, so I got her some water.

612
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:20,020
I told you not to go anywhere!

613
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:22,460
I thought I lost you.

614
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,880
I thought you abandoned me, too.

615
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,280
I was hoping you would lose me.

616
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,230
I make your life hard.

617
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:36,190
If I go away, your life might not be as hard.

618
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,800
You little brat.

619
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,790
Is this why you wanted to come here?

620
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:43,300
My life isn't hard.

621
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:47,470
Today was the hardest day of my life.

622
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:49,060
Got it?

623
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:25,540
You're not reading. What are you looking at?

624
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,170
The stars.

625
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,110
Maybe I should have looked from home.

626
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,540
There's plenty on the ceiling.

627
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,840
The stars you see?

628
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,520
They're satellites.

629
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,960
I knew it. They shine so artificially.

630
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,170
Are they satellites?

631
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,470
Seong Je Yeon.

632
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:01,590
What?

633
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,830
Don't go.

634
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,470
What?

635
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:13,770
You forgot to pay.

636
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:16,170
Don't you see that I left my bag behind?

637
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:18,890
You have your wallet. Where is it?

638
00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:20,930
Hey!

639
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:25,910
You keep acting like I'm buying.

640
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:28,640
None for you.

641
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:32,940
Hey, be careful. Hey...

642
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:36,470
Hey.

643
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:38,530
Aigoo.

644
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:54,100
If you plan to sleep until
tomorrow's morning announcements,

645
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,760
give it up.

646
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,630
Summer vacation started today for us.

647
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:01,120
for us.

648
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:08,570
Whoa, hey.

649
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:15,440
Hey.

650
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:21,930
What are you doing now? Going to work?

651
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:25,290
I'm going to the bank and then home to sleep.

652
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:27,080
Hang out with me.

653
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:30,060
I've never done anything fun.

654
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,510
I might not be good at it.

655
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:34,260
Me neither.

656
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,300
Let's go to the bank first.

657
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:39,910
And then?

658
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:44,030
Should we rob the bank?

659
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:49,600
 Thank you for choosing us. 

660
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,900
 
 Be sure not to leave anything behind. 

661
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,550
What's wrong?

662
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:08,530
Did you not get your paycheck?

663
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:10,380
Bad guys.

664
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,250
I have something I get every month.

665
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:17,410
I don't want to spend it, but I do need it.

666
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:21,280
It hurts my pride.

667
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,150
Who cares about pride?

668
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:24,950
Even when I get mad at my mom,

669
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:27,370
I take the money she gives me.

670
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:31,500
Don't be mad at your mom. Be nice to her.

671
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,240
What should we do now?

672
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:42,220
Don't people usually go
to karaoke or an internet cafe?

673
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,400
What?

674
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,100
No.

675
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,900
We robbed the bank, so let's go to the bookstore.

676
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,380
You're such a model student.

677
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:56,900
He keeps smiling.

678
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,570
I like it.

679
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:06,540
 ♫ On a bright day, will our stories be the same? ♫ 

680
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:11,330
 ♫ I wrote so much, enough
to stay up all night reading ♫ 

681
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:18,160
 ♫ All the pretty words I couldn't say ♫ 

682
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:25,860
 ♫ I borrow a memory of us from that day ♫ 

683
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:30,790
 ♫ I visit a day I've recorded in my mind ♫ 
 

684
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:33,160
 ♫ You and I are awkward ♫ 

685
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:37,870
 ♫ Thank goodness we're still there like we were♫ 

686
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:44,190
 ♫ Walking side by side in lockstep
with you on this street ♫ 

687
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:45,850
Want it?

688
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:49,750
Just looking. It's pretty.

689
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:57,620
 ♫ The weary day ♫ 

690
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:01,360
 ♫ I felt like I was dreaming ♫ 

691
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:07,380
 ♫ A strange kiss ♫ 

692
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:11,810
 ♫ It felt like yesterday ♫ 

693
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:13,360
 

694
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,250
- Let's go.
- Okay.

695
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,620
Huh?

696
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,320
It came out.

697
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:35,170
But what is "Waegeum"?

698
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:36,900
It's a kind of apple.

699
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,990
I just thought it sounded cool.

700
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:40,740
Pretentious.

701
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,540
 

702
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:46,100
Jin Mu Yeong?

703
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,730
- My pen name.
- You're even using a pen name?

704
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,230
It's my mom's name.

705
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:54,540
Wow. Your mom must be so proud.

706
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,010
That would be nice.

707
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:58,200
I'll buy one. I promised.

708
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,570
Give it to me in cash.

709
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:01,520
I'll buy the book.

710
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,630
Here's a gift.

711
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:23,360
Will you sign this with it?

712
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:28,270
Why a gift?

713
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:30,840
I don't have an autograph.

714
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,570
What did you do when you were little?

715
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:34,700
I just wrote my name.

716
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:37,150
What's this?

717
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:38,890
A wish bracelet.

718
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:41,490
I got it for you.

719
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:43,200
There are two.

720
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,680
Do we split them?

721
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,030
No. They're both yours.

722
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:49,000
One is so you can be rich.

723
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,960
The other...

724
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,500
You make a wish.

725
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,540
Can you put it on? I can't do it by myself.

726
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:02,940
Sure.

727
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,580
Ho.

728
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,940
Ho?

729
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:26,250
You got hurt.

730
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,750
I blew on it hard, so you'll get better soon.

731
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,950
Sign it. For real.

732
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:50,630
 

733
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,880
A tragic and beautiful book
written by a young genius,

734
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,100
and I got it autographed.

735
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,500
Stop it.

736
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:09,680
I've never spoken with a genius before.

737
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,820
Gosh, stop it.

738
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:13,350
Wait, genius!

739
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:16,040
Your ears are red, genius.

740
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:35,670
Doesn't that sound like waves?

741
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:52,340
Hey. Being with you, I'm getting so lyrical.

742
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,680
Do you like the ocean?

743
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,920
Who doesn't like the ocean?

744
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,470
How about you?

745
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,850
I don't know. I've never thought about it.

746
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,460
Want to go see the ocean right now?

747
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:40,300
We can go to the terminal and get on the next bus.

748
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,230
We're on summer vacation!

749
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:32,900
 ♫ Remember, I will always be there ♫ 

750
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:41,690
 ♫ Like that moonlight in the dark of the night ♫ 

751
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:43,800
That way!

752
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:50,810
 ♫ Even if we forget at times, hidden by time ♫ 

753
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:57,200
 ♫ We will never disappear ♫ 

754
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:01,940
 ♫ That day, we carved it ♫ 

755
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:06,220
 ♫ It felt like sunshine ♫ 

756
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:09,750
 ♫ Anywhere, anytime ♫ 

757
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:12,480
Can I get this much worth of these flowers?

758
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,440
That will be a lot.

759
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:21,450
 ♫ We will shine ♫ 

760
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,740
Come over here.

761
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,380
Wow...

762
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:45,980
When I'm with you,

763
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:49,320
I don't remember my situation.

764
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,220
I can't do that.

765
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:59,070
I can't believe something like this happened.

766
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:02,100
I feel like I'm dreaming.

767
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:06,990
I must really like you, too.

768
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:14,540
But right now, I have to focus on my studies.

769
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:17,170
If I asked you out in college,

770
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:20,240
will you go out with me?

771
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:43,390
Class President, take me out
of your vision of your 20.

772
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:44,880
Because of college?

773
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,050
I get good grades. You can, too.

774
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,180
This is my number.

775
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,780
If you don't know something, just call-

776
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:00,310
When I'm with you, I keep...

777
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:02,870
I don't have the energy to spend on that.

778
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:04,880
I don't, but I keep...

779
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,600
I feel like I'm pouring out.

780
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,380
Do you not like me?

781
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:15,930
If you don't, why did you come here with me?

782
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:18,060
Why did you buy me flowers?

783
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,150
I'm sorry.

784
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:23,160
I'm really sorry.

785
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,100
I mean, you don't need to apologize.

786
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:27,420
Just tell me why. I just don't understand.

787
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,420
I'm not asking you to date me right now.

788
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,040
When we're 20-

789
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,200
Right. You are 20 already.

790
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,690
Anyway.

791
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:45,420
Do you not like me?

792
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,060
I don't like myself.

793
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:48,850
Me.

794
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:50,000
Myself.

795
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,300
What are you talking about?
What kind of bullshit is this?

796
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:57,000
What kind of foolish nonsense? Is this a joke?

797
00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:31,550
We have to do dictation and reading.

798
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,340
Right.

799
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:43,740
I can write this without dictation.

800
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:06,810
 

801
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:16,210
I want my world to be beautiful,

802
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:19,320
even just every once in a while.

803
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:24,780
But it happened too many times today.

804
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:44,100
I guess...

805
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:51,380
I also just wanted to spend one season like that

806
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:55,550
before I graduated.

807
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,080
I...

808
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:09,950
like that Unni, too.

809
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:24,840
 

810
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,780
Je Yeon, did your family go bankrupt?

811
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:31,500
What? My family?

812
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,630
Je Yeon.

813
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:55,910
Where should we go to get tteokbokki?

814
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:57,190
- Mom.
- Huh?

815
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,660
Is our family in ruins?

816
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:01,040
We're not.

817
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,190
We're on our way, though.

818
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:05,580
You need to focus on your exams, so we didn't-

819
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:08,020
You want to drive this car while we're going down?

820
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:10,020
I'm on my way to sell it!

821
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:15,910
Dad will take care of it. Don't you worry.

822
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:17,830
Focus on your business.

823
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:20,810
Gosh, I am...

824
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,160
How can we crumble overnight?

825
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,650
If we're crumbling, you should have told me!

826
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:32,450
I didn't want it to get in the way of your studies.

827
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:35,500
Are you crying?

828
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,780
Where are we at, exactly?

829
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:40,820
I mean...

830
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:44,160
if I had known that even yesterday,

831
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,980
I would've told him we're in the same boat.

832
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:49,830
I would have said I'm struggling, too.

833
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,200
For real?

834
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:05,690
 

835
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,280
 

836
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:12,410
 

837
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:15,690
 

838
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,760
It's a night for counting stars, Mother.

839
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:41,260
I can't study at all.

840
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:01,560
Hey!

841
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,490
If you're here, come inside.

842
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:06,240
You lied to me.

843
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,770
The rumors are true.

844
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:09,960
Motel! Woman!

845
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:12,910
I'll be in when I handle this, Boss.

846
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:14,380
Sure.

847
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:16,300
Hurry up.

848
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:22,490
The Boss must have a lot of money.

849
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:24,700
Was that the money you didn't want to spend?

850
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,400
Why her and not me?

851
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,200
Did you study with a nosebleed just
so you can waste your energy here?

852
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:33,880
How did you know I got a nosebleed?

853
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:36,720
Damn it!

854
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,010
You wouldn't even kiss me!

855
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:42,060
If I kiss you or whatever,

856
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:43,400
will you leave quietly?

857
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,930
I don't know! Unless you do it.

858
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:49,080
Don't stop me this time.

859
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,680
I can't study at all because of you.

860
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:07,580
All I write in my diary is your name.

861
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,590
It's so annoying!

862
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:14,430
That's the only thing you can't do?

863
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:16,000
Studying?

864
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,070
Only?

865
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:18,900
Right now, my life depends on it.

866
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:22,930
That's what I mean.
Live for that right now. Not me.

867
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:27,280
Go home. Don't come back.

868
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,720
You shouldn't be at a place like this.

869
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:36,380
Hey.

870
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:38,900
Don't act like you know me ever again!

871
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:40,680
Forever!

872
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,830
 

873
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,230
It's sweet.

874
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:33,610
Wow, you really bought enough
ice cream for yourself.

875
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:36,050
I thought it would melt.

876
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:38,390
You're working.

877
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:41,990
Fine. Have plenty.

878
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:49,500
We're all grown up and sharing drinks.

879
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:56,060
Are we really all grown up?

880
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:58,260
I'm all grown up.

881
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:00,290
You're not, I guess.

882
01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:10,400
What happened with the TV program?

883
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,240
Why do you want to know?

884
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,800
It's not like you're going to do it.

885
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:17,900
If you're casting it yourself,
it must be important to you.

886
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:26,060
I didn't know you'd become a manager.

887
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:31,160
I didn't know you'd become a flower shop owner.

888
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:34,950
I feel like I'm in a time machine.

889
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:39,810
What about college? Did you go?

890
01:06:39,810 --> 01:06:41,670
I did.

891
01:06:41,670 --> 01:06:46,320
I had to get a scholarship.

892
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,470
But was it my first year, second semester?

893
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:50,790
I lost my top spot in my department.

894
01:06:50,790 --> 01:06:54,740
Seriously. I really wanted to kill.

895
01:06:55,900 --> 01:07:00,900
I even wondered if I'd get it if I did...

896
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,990
Isn't that funny?

897
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:15,060
Hey, are you okay?

898
01:07:15,060 --> 01:07:17,820
Yeah. I'm fine.

899
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:20,320
She can't hold her liquor.

900
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,720
She can walk on two feet, right?

901
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:26,110
I didn't even get to talk to her that much.

902
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:30,810
Thanks.

903
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:42,800
What?

904
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,560
I'm moving.

905
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:46,990
But why?

906
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:49,960
You should pay me.

907
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:53,360
Am I on your back?

908
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:57,840
I let you drink too much by yourself.

909
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,880
Are you okay?

910
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,990
No, I'm not.

911
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:03,440
You're not?

912
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,220
I'm fine.

913
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:07,960
Let's get down.

914
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:12,290
Aren't I light as a feather?

915
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,350
This is just until the taxi stand.

916
01:08:19,350 --> 01:08:22,470
I feel so drunk.

917
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:28,040
 

918
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:34,120
Careful.

919
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,800
Let me go get a hangover drink.
Stay here for one second.

920
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:46,040
Is there a convenience store around here?

921
01:08:50,070 --> 01:08:55,390
I think I missed you once.

922
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,540
I think I was curious.

923
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:07,580
You disappeared without a trace.

924
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:11,710
I wondered how you were doing.

925
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:14,920
How would I disappear without a trace?

926
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,070
Are you a poet?

927
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:21,610
All the paths you turned your back on

928
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:26,750
were all so dark.

929
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:34,420
I think I'm drunk.

930
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:38,610
All these feelings are coming.

931
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,070
I was curious, too.

932
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:57,200
Whether you'd be in college

933
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:00,370
or become one of the things your mom wrote down.

934
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:05,720
I wondered if we'd see each other again,
no matter what you became.

935
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:08,400
Stuff like that.

936
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:22,220
Should we?

937
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:25,300
What?

938
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,780
The thing your actress is in.

939
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:36,120
- Why?
- Well...

940
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:41,100
if I go on TV and helps the flower
shop, I'll make a lot of money.

941
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:45,380
My career aspiration...

942
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,510
was to be rich.

943
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:11,350
 ♫ Come closer ♫ 

944
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:18,260
 ♫ The red sunset ♫ 

945
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:25,220
 ♫ Night and day meet briefly ♫ 

946
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:31,390
 ♫ Like us back then ♫ 

947
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:39,140
 ♫ Like falling asleep ♫ 

948
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:48,330
 ♫ Pretending not to know and embrace ♫ 

949
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:55,230
 ♫ It's like love that gets pushed away ♫ 

950
01:11:55,230 --> 01:12:02,270
 ♫ Like the longing that comes back ♫ 

951
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:11,840
 ♫ Like the horizon where day and night meet ♫ 

952
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:22,880
 It would be a lie if I said
I never thought about you. 

953
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,420
 It wasn't that dark, thanks to you. 

954
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:28,480
 Is that what she was asking about? 

955
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:29,800
 A new start. 

956
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:33,340
 I'm determined to get along
with you until the shoot is over. 

957
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:34,380
 That's Sunwoo Hae! 

958
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:35,940
 What happened? 

959
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:37,680
 - What?
-Hey, Bebop. 

960
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:38,890
 Hey, Beat. 

961
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:41,250
 Do you feel awkward around me? 

962
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:43,800
 No. Not at all. Why would I? 

963
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:48,740
 Isn't Sunwoo Hae's story
so ripe for tearing apart? 

964
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:54,960
 Hey, Sunwoo Hae. Why did you agree to do this? 

965
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,000
 What happens to us now? 

966
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:07,100
 ♫ Some memories lean on me
like they're happy to see me ♫
