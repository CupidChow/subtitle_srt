1
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,370
 

2
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,370
- Hey, Hyung.
-  Are you sure it's okay if I don't go? 

3
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,310
All they'll make you do is the contract stuff.

4
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,240
I'll just sign it right away.

5
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,750
 Okay. Call me. 

6
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,240
Okay.

7
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,400
His career ended when he scammed people.

8
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,810
Really? He didn't look like a scammer.

9
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,400
He seemed like a nice person.

10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,640
You're so naive.

11
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,760
Look up "Sunwoo Hae scam" online.

12
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,900
No, man...

13
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,200
Right. Did that video get taken down?

14
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,460
I watched it. The kid was fierce.
Not a single tear.

15
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,090
That felt like acting, too.

16
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,370
Doesn't it give you chills?

17
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,980
I'm sure he knows, too.
That he caused his mom's death.

18
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,130
Let's not rehash old news.

19
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,890
It's so tacky. What are you doing?

20
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,600
Why don't you fend for yourself
instead of meddling?

21
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,700
You can't even take care of your actress.

22
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,490
- How dare you?
- Stop, stop!

23
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,700
Let go.

24
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,610
Stop it!

25
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,380
Who the hell are you?

26
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,450
What is this?

27
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,940
I didn't have a sponsor.

28
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,220
People who stole my name are the scammers.

29
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,900
I worked my ass off to pay that money back.

30
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,700
And I know I caused my mom's death.

31
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,470
How dare you lay a finger on her,
you son of a bitch.

32
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,060
Come out.

33
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,030
Why are you here?

34
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,230
Geon No was supposed to come.

35
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,600
Did you...

36
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,780
hear everything?

37
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,430
If you did, why did you listen to all that?

38
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,060
Just ignore what you hear about me.

39
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,590
Don't waste your energy on useless stuff.

40
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,300
Useless? Why would that be useless?

41
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,040
Don't address every single thing.
People will say what they want.

42
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,270
No use rolling in the mud with them.

43
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,820
But I'll roll with them.

44
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,370
If I'm going to roll, let me roll in it real good.

45
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,510
Why am I the only one making a big deal?

46
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,500
Then, what should I do?

47
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,230
Be happy for you?

48
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,550
And just watch as people say
horrible things to you?

49
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,290
The girl I like, because of me?

50
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,020
I know what kind of life you've had. I've seen it.

51
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,800
You've been doing your best.

52
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,260
I don't like people insulting you.

53
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,230
 What is all this mess? 

54
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,040
We have a guest coming. What is going on?

55
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,790
- Explain.
- Dong Jun held Je Yeon by the collar

56
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,070
and then Sunwoo Hae came in...

57
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,490
Sunwoo Hae?

58
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,790
Yes.

59
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,740
You guys...

60
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,650
Sung Je Yeon. Han Dong Jun.

61
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,170
You two...

62
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,550
I'm here because of the copyrights.

63
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,250
I heard you need permission
from the original author.

64
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,690
So, you're the agent?

65
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,060
That's why your name is...

66
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,800
That's not possible.

67
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,200
Yes. I borrowed that name.

68
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,400
Did you know that Sunwoo Hae was Jin Mu Yeong?

69
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,610
Should I keep standing here?

70
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,310
What a mess we've made
on your first time visiting.

71
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,660
Let's go talk in my office.

72
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,990
I'll... take you...

73
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,060
Do I have to sign today?

74
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,760
I don't really feel like it.

75
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,260
I'm not the one in a rush.

76
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,850
I'll head out for today.

77
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,600
You're... You're leaving?

78
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,770
The name on the contract.

79
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,320
- Fix it before you leave.
- Okay.

80
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,650
Reschedule the meeting as soon as possible.

81
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,660
You, get lost. I don't even want to see you.

82
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,560
Sunwoo Hae!

83
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,060
I'm leaving. Get back to work.

84
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,520
Gosh. I feel so out of it.

85
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,500
Bye.

86
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,410
Are you okay?

87
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,880
Are you okay?

88
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,930
I'm okay.

89
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,990
You can go. Please.

90
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,340
 

91
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,380
Are you okay?

92
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,980
Yes.

93
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,440
You have a nosebleed.

94
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,650
Hyungnim probably got his
feelings hurt earlier, right?

95
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,060
I wasn't standing there because I agreed...

96
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,390
He's your hyungnim already?

97
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,520
Make sure you tell him that next time.

98
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,280
To Hyungnim.

99
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,790
You're still here?

100
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,610
Did the CEO say anything else?

101
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,610
Let's talk on the way.

102
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,300
We need to reschedule the meeting.

103
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,240
- Hey, let me see. You fell-
- Stop it. Seriously.

104
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,260
So embarrassing.

105
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:40,190
Why? What is?

106
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:44,900
You think I don't feel humiliated
after you saw all that?

107
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,760
He held me by the collar.

108
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,870
I'm already upset, then you say
those things to me...

109
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,660
This is crazy.

110
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,200
You were really annoying earlier.

111
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,180
So pointless.

112
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,510
I know.

113
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,370
Why are you laughing?

114
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,500
Why are you hugging me?

115
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,430
This is so natural.

116
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,540
Just stay still.

117
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,550
I can see how swollen you are from afar.

118
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,940
Hold this up.

119
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,940
Just stay still.

120
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,400
I-I can do it...

121
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,740
Fine.

122
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,320
When do you want to meet again?

123
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,790
If you're uncomfortable at the office,
we'll adjust. So just sign-

124
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,190
I'll do it even if you tell me not to.
It's a lot of money.

125
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,450
But while I do,

126
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,350
- I'll make them antsy.
- Are you serious?

127
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,680
If you make them antsy, I feel nervous, too.

128
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,970
- Hey! Hey...
- What?

129
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,790
Don't touch it!

130
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,240
- Wait.
- It's still bleeding. Wait.

131
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,790
Here.

132
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,570
Don't treat me like a gorilla!

133
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,070
Hey, but...

134
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,180
a gorilla is probably calmer than you are.

135
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,130
Stop teasing.

136
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,160
Sorry. I can't help it.

137
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,890
You're not...

138
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,390
going to be bothered and keep thinking about

139
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,910
what they were saying, right?

140
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:44,870
Once I'm on TV, I figured people
would talk like that anyway.

141
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:48,100
When I was little, my mom would scold
me for watching you on TV,

142
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,510
but I still did in secret.

143
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:54,200
I'm sure there are people like me out there.

144
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,030
I feel like...

145
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,920
you haven't changed.

146
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,840
You still carry a heavy backpack.

147
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,210
You still don't know how to hold back.

148
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,730
You live by the books.

149
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,960
That's right.

150
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,650
I live by the books.

151
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,240
It's the world that's messed up.

152
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,420
So, just do as you did today.

153
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,710
- What?
- Explain what's unfair,

154
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,380
and if someone hits me, hit them.

155
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,450
Let's try again.

156
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,740
Turn on the blinker.

157
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,210
Check your side mirror.

158
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,680
That car is waiting for you.

159
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,030
- Right now!
- Now?

160
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,390
Now.

161
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,330
Hey! Hey!

162
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:56,010
Are you going to just drive straight forever?

163
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,020
We might get to the highway!

164
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,480
I'll get in next time. There will be a chance.

165
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,260
I thought you signed up for driving school.

166
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,050
Then, go to driving school!

167
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:10,030
Instead of working three jobs, focus on driving.

168
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,820
Have you considered that
I can't focus because of you?

169
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,140
Who slapped you today? And why
are you taking it out on me?

170
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,530
Hey.

171
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,150
Don't get your license.

172
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:23,670
I can't bear to see someone like you on the road.

173
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,940
Someone like me?

174
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,050
Try teaching me properly!

175
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,370
What more can I teach you?

176
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,990
Look in front of you! Hey! Geez...

177
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,290
Oh, son!

178
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,810
Here...

179
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,280
Why do you keep coming?

180
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,450
I heard you stopped by the house... Geez...

181
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,720
Are you really being Seok Joo's lackey?

182
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,860
Isn't his personality so weird?

183
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,610
Stop it. He's nice.

184
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,310
Is my old photo album...

185
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,670
Yes.

186
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,580
It's not there, is it?

187
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,230
Hey! I have everything!

188
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:15,380
Your mother took good care of them.

189
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,410
- Should I...
- Ship it.

190
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,210
Or send a courier, whatever.

191
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,290
I'll send a courier.

192
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,610
Hey, here...

193
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,130
I'll send a courier! Bye!

194
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,660
Hello, son. Courier delivery.

195
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,690
I'll just take 5,000 won.

196
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,000
Do you have a lot of time?

197
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,570
I thought you ran a publishing
company or whatever.

198
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,110
We just finished up a deadline, so...

199
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,070
I'm not too busy right now.

200
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,120
I'm not talking about that.

201
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,500
So absurd.

202
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,770
This photo album...

203
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,620
This album...

204
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,800
Even when I had no house and nothing...

205
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
I gave it to someone trustworthy to look after it.

206
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,200
And I made sure to get it back.

207
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,060
These photos are moments that we can't get back.

208
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,800
Right.

209
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,350
It was probably cheaper to get
the album back than your child.

210
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:27,000
If Seok Joo bothers you again, let me know.

211
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,190
I'll totally...

212
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,100
I'll teach him a lesson.

213
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,540
Just because he's Noona's son, it can only-

214
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,450
I'm leaving!

215
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,980
You're not giving me one of those, are you? Fine.

216
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,520
Bye!

217
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,500
 

218
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,030
Where is Sung Je Yeon?

219
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,860
Must you get a license?

220
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,360
Can we stop by a gas station?

221
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:32,760
Hyung said to fill up before we return it.

222
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,170
I can't even get angry anymore.

223
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,600
Return it where?

224
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,930
Aren't you cold?

225
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,830
Unni!

226
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,530
How long have you been here?

227
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,200
W-W-Why are you here?

228
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,160
I've been here for a bit. What was it...

229
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,290
We were told to return your oppa's car here.

230
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,670
I don't know where here is, but...

231
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,610
Who are you? This is Nu Ri's house.

232
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,710
Unni, let's talk.

233
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,240
- But it's too dangerous here.
- I-It is?

234
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,370
Let's go somewhere less noticeable.

235
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,760
What? Where?

236
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,480
Could you keep this a secret?

237
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,200
I'll get my hair pulled out.

238
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,800
Is Sunwoo Hae the type of brother
to scold you for dating?

239
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,630
He never said anything about my bad grades.

240
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,320
Do you think he'll let this one go, too?

241
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,140
I hesitate to say this, but...

242
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,240
If your grades are bad, and you're dating,

243
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,790
he might blow up the grades he let go, too.

244
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,480
You don't seem hesitant at all.

245
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,880
But who is she?

246
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,190
- My oppa's situationship.
- Sit...

247
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,250
- Oh, Hyungnim is in a situationship?
- No...

248
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,540
I thought he was too stingy to
do that kind of thing.

249
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,970
Did you just insult my brother?

250
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:00,350
No, I look up to him for being so frugal.

251
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,460
Oh, wait.

252
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,890
This isn't much, but...

253
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,640
Get some yummy food with this.

254
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,000
Thank you.

255
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,010
Oppa said if an adult gives you
something, say "Thank you" and take it.

256
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,070
Good job.

257
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,600
- The lunch here is good, right?
- Yes.

258
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,900
Thank you for the food.

259
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:34,460
Contractually, you're aware that your
contract is over this month, right?

260
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,760
Yes.

261
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:45,300
Do I fit in the garden that you're growing?

262
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,690
I thought about what the issue
might be for a long time.

263
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:53,160
You taught me about so many great things.

264
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,340
You did so much for me and taught me so much.

265
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,350
But I wasn't enough.

266
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,070
You must have put a lot of thought into this.

267
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,070
Are you talking to any companies?

268
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,620
If not, want me to look into them?

269
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,070
Oh, no.

270
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,520
Thank you for offering.

271
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,200
Sure.

272
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:24,210
As for your next project,
the timing is a bit tricky.

273
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,430
You must've wasted time reading scripts.

274
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,190
No.

275
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,620
Please turn them down for me.

276
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,310
I will.

277
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,200
Ever since you were this big,

278
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,830
I've been comforting you when
you cried, sent you to shoots...

279
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,290
I once raised you more passionately
than my own children.

280
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,540
Thanks for everything.

281
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,180
Of course.

282
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,900
You, too, CEO.

283
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,100
Oh, my. Aren't you Tae Rin?

284
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,830
Who are you?

285
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,780
What? You don't remember me?

286
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,510
I took such good care of you in high school.

287
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,560
Are you Hae Bin?

288
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,660
Hey. Can't believe I bumped into you.

289
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,490
You're on social media, right?

290
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,070
I just started a health supplement business.

291
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,720
Let's go have a cup of tea.

292
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,230
I'm so sorry, but next time. I'll buy.

293
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,410
You must be busy.

294
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:40,400
True, you were always too busy to come to school.

295
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,900
No, I'm not doing so well right now...

296
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,120
Can you let go?

297
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,660
Oh, my.

298
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,510
Who made you cry?

299
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,890
Not me.

300
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,240
Hey, you put me on the spot. What's wrong?

301
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,300
Never mind.

302
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,500
Cover your face as you wipe.
You'll cry more, right?

303
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,460
Let's go that way.

304
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,860
You keep giving me stuff.

305
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,580
Coffee, cigarettes, a handkerchief.

306
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,080
And you still aren't hitting on me?

307
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,290
- What?
- Just go on your way.

308
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,920
Hey, excuse me-

309
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,690
I can't stand this.

310
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,090
Hitting on you?

311
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,620
Me?

312
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,260
What's his deal? Why does he care?

313
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,700
Wait, my bag...

314
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:58,120
Can I have my bag back?

315
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,660
Why do you keep crying?

316
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,690
Want me to think about it and tell you?

317
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,310
Why I keep crying?

318
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,740
Yes.

319
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,320
This is my business card.

320
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,550
You can reach me here.

321
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,510
So weird.

322
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,830
- You're weirder.
- Be as weird as you want.

323
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:20,920
It's really weird that you chased
me here to tell me that.

324
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,580
I thought our vibes on the rooftop
that night weren't bad.

325
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,940
Our?

326
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,360
Vibes?

327
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:34,300
Just be honest and say so.

328
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,600
So, I can decide how to act.

329
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,950
You left your bag, so I brought it.
It's not fair to call that hitting on you.

330
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,310
I'm not saying be honest about that!

331
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,430
When a man approaches me,
I assume they're hitting on me.

332
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,790
I assume they're interested.

333
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,700
Sure, it starts as politeness, kindness, but...

334
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,540
At the end of the day, they
all want the same thing.

335
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,400
Why would you be any different?

336
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,220
You seem like you're in a better mood.

337
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,970
- That's good.
- Hey!

338
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,590
Are you messing with me?

339
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,660
I'm not messing with you.

340
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,200
You're being quite short with me.

341
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,200
Are you a boomer? If you were
honest, that might be cute.

342
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,700
Why do you keep pissing me off?
I'm already in a crappy mood!

343
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,270
Boomer?

344
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,580
So if I were interested?

345
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,700
If I am hitting on you,
would that make you less angry?

346
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,800
If I weren't angry, would you have
said you weren't interested?

347
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,390
Why do you talk so strangely?

348
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,300
No, I really am not interested.

349
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,710
If I were, I wouldn't be doing this.

350
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,400
So, why did you say that about being less angry?

351
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,840
You have to be less angry and calmer
for us to have a conversation.

352
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,230
So simmer down.

353
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,450
Hey.

354
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:58,280
If you actually like me, you're dead.

355
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,040
What did I-

356
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,650
What?

357
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,220
Hey, Hyung.

358
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,360
Hyung, does Mo Tae Rin come here often?

359
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,990
Hey.

360
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:29,400
Can you take this back to your house?

361
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,490
Put it somewhere unnoticeable.
 

362
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,930
That was the favor you needed?

363
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,810
Here.

364
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,390
I went on a blind date.

365
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,890
She says ceramics is her hobby.

366
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,510
A blind date?

367
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,520
Cute! She made these?

368
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,270
Bought.

369
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,240
Do me a favor, too, okay? I'll call you soon.

370
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,270
If it's about Mo Tae Rin,
she doesn't come here often.

371
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,510
It wasn't about that.

372
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,140
Bye.

373
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,890
Hey, Bebop!

374
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,830
Hey, Beat.

375
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,850
Can you pay for my cab?

376
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,010
Seok Joo went that way. Ask him.

377
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:26,460
What? When?

378
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,460
Did Kim Seok Joo say there's something between us?

379
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,020
Tell him to dream on!

380
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,920
I don't want to know.

381
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,050
You go tell him.

382
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,780
Excuse me, you need to pay.

383
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,350
One second.

384
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,550
Oppa!

385
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,580
Oppa! What are you doing? Hurry!

386
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,100
Seriously?

387
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,620
You come all this way to...

388
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,440
I don't need change.

389
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,830
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

390
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:11,270
Can you eat this stuff?

391
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,970
I thought you were on a diet.

392
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,410
I'm done filming. I'm unemployed.

393
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,420
Is the store usually this empty?

394
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,820
Why don't you buy some since you're here?

395
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,010
Sung Je Yeon said you have a lot
of occasions that call for flowers.

396
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,820
True. She bought a lot for me.

397
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,530
Why did I take all that for granted?

398
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,110
So, you two talked about that?

399
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,960
I'm just reading the room these days.
I can't even reach out to her.

400
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:45,420
Oh, Seok Joo gave me these.

401
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,130
A gift from his blind date. I'll give you more.

402
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,460
Why are you telling me that?

403
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,690
I didn't say it because it's you.

404
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:58,640
I thought I was getting better at reading
between the lines, not acting.

405
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,780
A blind date?

406
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:03,260
I don't know about acting, but you got taller.

407
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,040
Are you mocking me for never
winning an acting award?

408
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,470
Why would I mock you?
Do you have a victim mentality?

409
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,870
You're retired. You don't know anything.

410
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,520
I have 10 years more experience than you!

411
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,120
Hey, I debuted earlier.

412
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
Stop talking back to your sunbae.

413
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,060
Other than the elders, you're
such a huge sunbae to me.

414
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:22,000
Should I speak formally to you, Sunbaenim?

415
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,020
You can be as crass as you like,
so please buy some flowers.

416
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,510
You've never bought one.

417
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,380
Here.

418
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,820
Give it back to Kim Seok Joo.

419
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,540
What?

420
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,810
Should I read between the lines and say no?

421
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,020
I don't know!

422
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:04,380
I have no idea!

423
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,250
I'm so confused, Oppa.

424
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,150
Can you leave now?

425
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,860
For real.

426
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,770
Fine, I'll go.

427
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,900
Just lend me 50,000 won.

428
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,810
 

429
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,020
What's wrong with your face?

430
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,700
I'm not asking you to give it to me.
Just lend it to me.

431
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,700
Welcome!

432
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,350
- Squid.
- Thank you.

433
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,660
Come again.

434
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,060
How much?

435
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,070
Ten thousand won for four.

436
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:53,750
 ♫ Like nothing happened ♫ 

437
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:01,930
 ♫ Like it's nothing ♫ 

438
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:07,040
 ♫ Like it doesn't mean anything ♫ 

439
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,710
 ♫ My breathing gets faster and faster ♫ 

440
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,150
Don't overexert yourself.

441
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,070
You went through a lot of hard tests.

442
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,610
Got it.

443
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:23,540
Thank you. Bye.

444
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:33,080
She's going to let it go...

445
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,230
Here you go.

446
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,830
Got it.

447
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,970
Here you go.

448
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,730
Thank you!

449
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,350
Say "thank you."

450
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,220
Want to eat this?

451
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,930
Can I eat it?

452
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:53,870
Show me your pink teeth.

453
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,610
It's pink!

454
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,200
It's sweet.

455
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,870
Here.

456
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,820
- Which way?
- Here.

457
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,150
My hand!

458
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,330
Wait, wait.

459
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,410
What did you buy?

460
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:12,820
Wait a second.

461
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,300
- What?
- Did you hear that sound from outside?

462
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:19,220
- What sound?
- Didn't your dad go by earlier-

463
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,310
Back up.

464
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,350
That way. Hurry.

465
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,130
Get down.

466
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,050
Quiet.

467
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,280
- Is she gone?
- Okay.

468
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,940
Let's go.

469
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,010
Don't make any foot noise.

470
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:41,210
Over there. Hurry.

471
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,510
Geez.

472
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,010
 

473
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,960
What are you doing in Seok Joo's room?

474
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,800
You scared me.

475
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,990
You just got home?

476
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,730
We're supposed to have breakfast.

477
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,360
I'm so hungry.

478
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,250
Let me just hide this real quick.

479
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,740
Sure, hide it really well.

480
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:48,900
Scared me. Did she just come home?

481
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,600
I told you to get the right information!

482
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,800
What kind of company makes
its CEO pull an all-nighter?

483
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,940
Ow! Hey, hey, my hand!

484
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,570
I'll go to the sauna after I eat.

485
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,250
Seriously!

486
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,630
If you ever put in the wrong
shipping address again...

487
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,390
Love you, Hyung.

488
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,930
But why are we hiding?

489
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:12,280
Then, should we go say hello?

490
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,950
Stay still!

491
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,550
Let's just stay here.

492
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:19,650
What were you hiding?

493
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,770
An old album.

494
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:29,330
I didn't think you'd feel good seeing it.

495
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,370
I already feel pretty bad.

496
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,860
You don't like Hae's mom.

497
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:43,500
Hae's mom was Mu Yeong. Jin Mu Yeong.

498
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:50,340
If we weren't location scouting
in the middle of nowhere,

499
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,390
I wouldn't have met you fatefully.

500
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:57,030
Are we just bringing up all that old stuff again?

501
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,480
"Just"?

502
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,440
I didn't bring up how you got
a new woman and abandoned a child.

503
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,400
Noona, why are you being so harsh
this early in the day?

504
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,030
That hurts my feelings.

505
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,800
There's a right time for everything.

506
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,610
"A right time for everything"?

507
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:18,180
What a way to package it.

508
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,210
Why didn't you wait for me, then?

509
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,650
Were you that in love with Hae's mom?

510
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:24,840
When you left for Seoul without a word,

511
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,150
I was struggling, too!

512
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:31,290
I couldn't just be stuck by the sea
waiting for you forever.

513
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,150
I came back to you eventually.

514
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,800
You told me to come back
if I was unhappy, so I did.

515
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,900
You didn't come back! You didn't come
after what happened to Hae's mom!

516
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,120
You are being too harsh.

517
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,650
That was just a sad thing.

518
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,620
I needed comfort.

519
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,320
You're not someone like that.

520
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,200
So, what am I to you?

521
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,320
What kind of person am I?

522
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,960
Do you even love me?

523
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,780
Of course, that's why I'm living like this.

524
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,730
Why do I even like you?

525
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,210
Sometimes I don't know.

526
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:20,400
You still act emotionally toward me.

527
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,120
You yell at me.

528
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,890
When you're with me,
it reminds you of being young.

529
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,020
When we were passionate.

530
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,950
You're still stuck there.

531
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,710
I'll stay elsewhere for a while.

532
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:40,710
Get back here!

533
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,850
Hey, Sunwoo Chan!

534
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,090
I'll move the rest.

535
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,670
Go inside.

536
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,080
Hyung isn't here because he wanted to be.

537
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,480
I asked him to do something,
so he's here to do that.

538
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:14,370
I didn't call him up to ruin your day.

539
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,340
Have you eaten?

540
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,630
- Have you?
- Let's go. I have breakfast reservations.

541
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,110
Where did I put it?

542
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:02,050
Oh, my!

543
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,620
Aigoo, please...

544
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:25,840
What did I like so much about him?
Why am I not looking ahead?

545
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,730
Hello.

546
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,160
Hello.

547
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,670
We have a few left again today.

548
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,520
Again?

549
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,330
I'm really okay.

550
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:57,860
You didn't let me pay
for ice cream last time, either.

551
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:03,970
If you keep doing this, I might not
let you pay next time, either.

552
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:09,840
They're going to wilt soon, so don't worry.

553
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,550
Oppa!

554
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,550
Hey.

555
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,040
Good night. Bye.

556
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,920
Is he shy?

557
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,360
When is he going to ask me out?

558
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,640
Don't you know?

559
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,350
It'd be too obvious if he gave them just to me.

560
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:31,120
That's why he gives them out to everyone.

561
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:35,390
He's not my type, though.

562
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,920
- Ouch.
- Just throw out the leftover flowers.

563
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,060
Isn't it a hassle every time?

564
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:47,890
You give them out for free.
No wonder nobody buys them.

565
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:52,870
Also, Oppa, you'll get your hair
pulled out acting like that.

566
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,560
I'll bet on it.

567
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,530
Sure.

568
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:59,780
Pisses me off when I think of Sa Rang* doing this.
(Means "love")

569
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:02,030
I'll pull his hair out!

570
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:07,700
Love? Who?

571
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,660
- Your boyfriend?
- No.

572
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,630
You know, just...

573
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:15,380
Love someday.

574
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:19,750
I hope you get there someday, Nu Ri.

575
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,700
- I'm popular, you know.
- Really?

576
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,760
Oppa, you have no idea.

577
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,400
Try saying that again. Take that back.

578
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:51,000
Hey, you didn't tell me you
were coming today. Huh?

579
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,320
How did you know where I live?

580
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,400
Excuse me.

581
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,970
What?

582
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,940
What's going on? So out of the blue.

583
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:11,890
This is for you since it's
my first time visiting here.

584
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:15,800
And some snacks for us to munch
on during the feedback session later.

585
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,430
They're for a student,
so I picked good ingredients.

586
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,150
Why did I not even think about this?

587
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,890
Because I was going to.

588
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:28,650
You're so detailed and good at stuff
like this, unlike how you look.

589
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,680
Must be a natural talent.

590
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:34,030
Oh, right. I forgot coffee.

591
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:37,380
I was going to make some. Just wait a second.

592
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,820
Somebody might think the two of you had a baby.

593
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,780
Hot!

594
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,710
Hey, are you okay?

595
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,020
Not hot.

596
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,270
What?

597
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:05,740
Why isn't this on?

598
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,000
Hey. It's not plugged in.

599
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,430
Why isn't it plugged in?

600
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,220
Are you stupid?

601
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,440
You can go.

602
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,980
- What?
- Now that you're here,

603
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,890
I'm nervous. Go home.

604
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,960
Go, go.

605
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,530
Go now!

606
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,500
What? So cute.

607
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,560
Oh, my. What am I saying?

608
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,780
 

609
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:54,210
This book. Where did you get it?

610
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,800
It was so hard to find.

611
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,260
It's been long out of print.

612
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:03,220
Could you sign it?

613
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,610
Sign...

614
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,600
Sure.

615
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,759
 

616
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,220
Here.

617
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:23,310
Wow! Daebak!

618
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:26,820
How did you get to publish your debut novel?

619
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,940
I was eating ramen, and on a book
that I was using as a coaster

620
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,800
had an ad for a contest.

621
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,760
I sent it in because it said
there was a cash prize.

622
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,580
You're so annoying.

623
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,730
- What...
- On your first try?

624
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,140
You didn't do any Spring Literary Contests?

625
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,600
I didn't know that was a thing.

626
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,200
I wasn't trying to be a novelist
in the first place.

627
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,500
- You're very annoying.
- Come on.

628
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:57,170
So, how long has it been for you two?

629
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:59,060
Since you started dating?

630
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,870
Was that rude?

631
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:09,340
It's just that you look good together.

632
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,760
- We're just...
- Friends.

633
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,690
It sends us shivers down our spines to hear that.

634
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,110
Friends...

635
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,780
That's right.

636
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,310
Shivers.

637
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,770
Bye.

638
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,230
Tell PD Yu I said hello.

639
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,470
Okay. Thank you! Bye!

640
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,560
Bye!

641
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:38,000
So, you're here to show your face
to the producer's daughter.

642
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,120
Well, two birds with one stone.

643
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,440
I should get going.

644
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,470
I have to get back to work.

645
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,190
Want me to take you?

646
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,940
- Are you in a good mood?
- Me?

647
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:00,070
Looks like you're way up because you met a fan.

648
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:03,200
That's half true, and half...

649
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,990
How far do you want me to take you?

650
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:09,740
To the ends of the earth?

651
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:13,630
Is this taking me?

652
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,810
I guess that wasn't the appropriate way to put it.

653
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,278
I guess people weren't just cruel to you.

654
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:28,340
What do you mean?

655
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,430
The student. Yu Eun Ji.

656
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:34,570
I was just writing for money.

657
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:38,660
She made it sound meaningful.

658
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:42,160
But I wonder how she found it.

659
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,700
- Oh, your first novel collection?
- Yeah.

660
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,800
Hey, speaking of...

661
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,370
What kind of title is "My Beloved Gorilla"?

662
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:54,970
And, "I wish the world were beautiful." Gosh.

663
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:57,160
Wish the world were beautiful?

664
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,570
Who says? You?

665
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:00,400
You!

666
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,346
It's your author's note!

667
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:03,370
I did?

668
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:06,720
All three books. Did you copy it from somewhere?

669
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,530
I don't know. I guess I felt that way then.

670
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:11,260
Who knows.

671
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:15,320
Hey.

672
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,860
Just ask me.

673
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,720
I never have anyone in the passenger's seat.

674
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,050
Get back to work.

675
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:44,280
I'll go from here.

676
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,680
This isn't efficient, is it?

677
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,900
You're going back to work,
and I couldn't ask you to hang out.

678
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,000
But I didn't want to say bye.

679
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:58,350
Je Yeon noona.

680
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:02,430
Oh, my gosh!

681
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,000
Aigoo, Sang Yeob.

682
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,570
Why are you calling me "noona"?

683
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:14,390
I prefer "Noona" over "Team Leader."

684
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:16,980
But people might get the wrong idea.

685
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,030
It's not a bad idea to be careful.

686
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,200
The wrong idea?

687
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,260
So who is this?

688
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:26,160
He got out of your car.

689
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,500
By chance, is he your boyfriend?

690
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,800
No! I-It's not like that.

691
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,170
He's just...

692
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,240
a t-talent.

693
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,470
He's going to be on a show with Tae Rin.

694
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:48,470
Hello. I'm Lee Sang Yeob.

695
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:50,360
I'm sorry I got the wrong idea.

696
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,880
It's okay.

697
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:55,300
Noona, did you change your hair?

698
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,700
- My hair...
- It looks so nice.

699
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,690
The talent is going to leave now.

700
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:04,930
Bye.

701
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:06,590
Bye.

702
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,960
Are you on your way to the office?

703
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,870
Yes. The manager wants to see me
about my military service.

704
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:15,470
I need to decide on a time frame.

705
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:17,410
I see.

706
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:19,920
If you got your draft notice,
go to the military already.

707
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,550
Go fulfill your duty.

708
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,780
Hope you never get discharged.

709
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,670
Hello!

710
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:29,620
Hello!

711
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:35,270
CEO, we are figuring out a meeting
date with the original author

712
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:37,250
of "A World Made of Ash."

713
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:39,680
I'll need to see that face again?

714
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,120
Got it.

715
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,660
I'm sending you on vacation. Get some rest.

716
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:47,280
You know what I really mean, though, right?

717
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,770
Han Dong Jun is also under
discipline starting today.

718
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:53,430
I'm sorry to cause trouble at work.

719
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:55,340
My personal feelings aside,

720
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,680
you did one good thing.

721
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,320
You sent a lifeline down to the people involved.

722
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:05,790
He started it first, though.

723
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:15,290
Six years.

724
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:19,590
My first vacation in six years, I mean...

725
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:22,780
is it suspension?

726
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:40,940
It's lasting pretty long.

727
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,560
Hello! Today is my first day.

728
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,860
My name is Choi Gi Bbeum.

729
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:54,880
It's just me here. No need to be so loud.

730
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,240
Got it!

731
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:00,290
The chairs haven't shipped yet.

732
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:02,850
You can sit on one of those unopened boxes.

733
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:06,450
I'm not standing because it looks good.

734
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:27,230
Oh, Tae Rin...

735
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:30,330
She's going to be good. She'll do
great with lines like these.

736
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:31,880
All done!

737
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,370
What else can I do?

738
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:38,550
The newbie doesn't know how to read the room.

739
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:40,920
Oh, should I go get some coffee?

740
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,550
Very good idea.

741
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,050
If you want something, get that, too.

742
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:49,410
Okay.

743
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:51,720
Get a power strip, too.

744
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:58,200
Head!

745
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,990
Don't get distracted!

746
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:02,170
I don't want to get distracted, either!

747
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,690
Focus, focus!

748
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:05,360
Last one!

749
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:09,620
Head!

750
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,330
What?

751
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:28,660
Why are you here?

752
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,650
I don't know.

753
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:41,300
How much more are you going to look?

754
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,100
I don't know.

755
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:45,720
As much as...

756
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:49,600
I want?

757
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,100
 Thank you! 

758
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,100
Thank you!

759
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,550
Please.

760
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:13,390
Who snores during meditation?

761
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:15,600
Did I say anything weird?

762
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,190
I didn't talk in my sleep, did I?

763
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:18,750
You can stop coming now.

764
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,430
How many times just this week?

765
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:23,870
We've used all the lidocaine patches
in the dojo because of you.

766
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:29,430
Do I keep thinking about him
because I have too much time?

767
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:33,400
Got it, we'll get you a full one. Thank you! Okay.

768
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,770
Okay.

769
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,800
Hi.

770
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:46,540
Why are you looking at me like that?

771
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:48,960
I feel like we're seeing each other often.

772
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,640
Are we?

773
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:55,240
You change out the pots often, too.

774
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:59,520
If a pot stays in one place too long,
people think no one wants it.

775
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,740
How do you know? Do you read minds?

776
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:06,500
Then read mine.

777
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,770
- Why would I?
- Right.

778
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:14,660
What was that?

779
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,090
What did you do when you got suspended?

780
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:22,460
What?

781
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,060
When the vice principal suspended you.

782
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,300
You were out of school for a week.

783
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:36,640
Why bring that up now? It's nothing to brag about.

784
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,420
Because something similar happened to me.

785
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:44,710
I made money.

786
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:46,680
I worked at construction sites.

787
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,150
I loaded and unloaded packages.

788
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,200
There was a really good home-cooked meal place.

789
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:57,060
I wonder if it's still there.

790
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:59,360
Did you go there often?

791
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,990
Not too often.

792
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:05,660
If I ate something, I had less time to sleep.

793
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:08,370
That day, I meant to pass out after work.

794
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:10,180
But I thought I might not wake up.

795
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,620
It was my first day of school after transferring.

796
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:16,620
I stayed up all night and got on the bus, and...

797
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:20,240
I fell asleep on the bus.

798
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,020
Then, you kept sleeping at school?

799
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,420
Were you watching me sleep?

800
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:35,410
I was the class president.

801
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:40,070
I led by example. It bothered me.

802
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:47,180
I have to work. Are you going to keep talking?

803
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,330
What are you doing after?

804
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:49,950
Working part-time at Geon No's.

805
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:51,280
What about after that?

806
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,500
I need to go home and sleep.

807
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,950
I see.

808
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:57,950
You must be shocked at being suspended.

809
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:00,080
You seem a little off.

810
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,190
I know.

811
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:06,600
So, why am I doing this here?

812
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,440
Why are you looking at me like that?

813
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,940
How am I looking?

814
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:26,840
How mean. You dumped me.

815
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:31,010
Sung Je Yeon, karma will come get you.

816
00:52:31,010 --> 00:52:34,080
I'm already being punished.

817
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:40,950
Yes, Director.

818
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:47,580
Go ahead. What is it?

819
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:50,420
I hired a new employee. What do I make him do?

820
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,870
 Company rules. 

821
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:53,980
Formatting documents. Operating transportation.

822
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:56,340
Teach him stuff like that.

823
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,960
Is he experienced? How many years?

824
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,490
Experience? None.

825
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:03,340
He came home from being abroad not too long ago.

826
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:04,740
Did he even graduate?

827
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:07,850
You need to hire experienced employees first!

828
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:14,660
Sir, can I get a bouquet?

829
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:18,590
What's the occasion?

830
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:19,840
You've never bought one.

831
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:23,300
A special mentor of mine just switched jobs.

832
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,510
I think I need to pay a visit.

833
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:27,890
So, it's to set a mood.

834
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:29,620
A man or a woman?

835
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,800
Why do you ask?

836
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,610
How long does it take to get there?
Are you going from here?

837
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:39,940
Are you sad that I'm leaving?

838
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:43,430
I ask all my customers.

839
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:47,170
Would you like a card with this, ma'am?

840
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:49,050
It's a woman. 30 minutes away.

841
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:51,730
I'm going straight from here. No card.

842
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:11,550
That was out of character for me.

843
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,530
Okay. See you on the day, Accountant.

844
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:25,810
Bye now.

845
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:28,530
Are you Bang Han Na?

846
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,110
Here you go.

847
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,270
Congratulations, whatever it is.

848
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:39,690
It's my first time buying flowers
with my own money.

849
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,220
Oh, my.

850
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,920
Where? Is it here?

851
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,340
Nice building.

852
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:50,440
What? Mo Tae Rin? Why are you here?

853
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,280
Hi, Sunbae.

854
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,140
I stole her for real.

855
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:59,250
You! You traitors!

856
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:18,410
Faith, belief...

857
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:21,970
You left with such an epic speech.

858
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:23,740
Where's the new employee manual I asked for?

859
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:25,550
I emailed it to you.

860
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:28,000
You know I don't give those out to anyone, right?

861
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,830
You're a lifesaver. Thank you.

862
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:36,440
How does it feel to be the first guest
at The New Utopia?

863
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:40,510
How so?

864
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:42,190
You said it before.

865
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:43,980
You want a company you want to work for,

866
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:47,230
not a company you have to work for.

867
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:51,640
Oh, your mission is a little...

868
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,310
I didn't think it was bad, but...

869
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:57,080
It does sound a little like a religious group.

870
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:04,510
We should have discussed stuff like this!

871
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:06,270
If you were going to come to a place like this!

872
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:08,470
What do you mean by "A place like this"?

873
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:10,430
Oh, right.

874
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:12,990
Tae Rin.

875
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:16,060
Read this.

876
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:19,280
If you like it, I'll do anything to bring it here.
 

877
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,300
"Kongjwi and Patjwi"?

878
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,610
I barely managed to bring her to the modern genre.

879
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:27,100
You'll send her back to the Joseon Dynasty?

880
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,740
It's a modern detective story.

881
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:31,140
When did you become so hasty?

882
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:34,550
Snack delivery!

883
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:36,030
Is he...

884
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:37,740
A celebrity.

885
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:39,330
Oh, it's a celebrity.

886
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:41,440
Hello.

887
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,540
Say hello. This is our actress, Mo Tae Rin.

888
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:47,320
My former colleague, Sung Je Yeon.

889
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,950
Hello.

890
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:50,470
If you're here, run away.

891
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:52,030
Must you become a manager?

892
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:55,950
What are you saying? He's from the
world-renowned University of Hong Kong.

893
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:57,510
My name is Choi Gi Bbeum.

894
00:56:57,510 --> 00:57:00,220
This was the only place that
gave me work right away.

895
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:04,030
This place values driving more than education.

896
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:05,470
You must be disappointed.

897
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:07,350
Let me help you.

898
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:12,500
Why is this here?

899
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:15,080
- It looks good there.
- It felt like it had to be there.

900
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,180
You probably didn't know how to discard it!

901
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:20,530
We have to report it and put a sticker on it,
then they'll take it away.

902
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:23,220
Should I look into cleaning companies?

903
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:27,040
Let's talk to the building management first.

904
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,910
Okay! Now, you have something to do, Gi Bbeum.

905
00:57:30,910 --> 00:57:33,290
I will go to the management office.

906
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:35,870
- See you later!
- Okay.

907
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:42,630
It must remind you of your newbie days.

908
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:46,110
I caught on faster.

909
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,340
 I put in a few extra flowers. 

910
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:59,140
 Tell them to come to my store often. 

911
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:01,750
Is he just being a salesman?

912
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,320
 Bang Han Na sent flowers. 

913
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:12,740
Director, remember the flower
delivery for Tae Rin's radio show?

914
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:16,340
Did you know that flower shop by any chance?

915
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:18,840
What flower shop? I don't know. Why?

916
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:24,800
Fate can be so cruel.

917
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:32,710
Why do I feel like I'm being punished?

918
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:37,320
I would've chewed him out,

919
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:41,150
saying "What right do you have
to talk about punishment?"

920
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,070
Sunbae?

921
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:44,790
Who are you talking to?

922
00:58:44,790 --> 00:58:46,900
I'm a little scared.

923
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:50,420
So, I couldn't retort.

924
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:53,930
Why is she trying to make us feel uncomfortable?

925
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:57,000
- The shaman said there wasn't anything here.
- What?

926
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,800
Come on, stop it! I'm scared!

927
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:05,360
Also, I told you not to keep spending
money on that shaman.

928
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,420
She's wrong about everything.

929
00:59:11,870 --> 00:59:14,850
So, something is here.

930
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:19,080
Are you okay?

931
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:22,820
Let me see.

932
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,440
Are you hurt?

933
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:28,240
No. I'm okay.

934
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,480
Thank goodness these aren't breakable. Sorry.

935
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,270
It's okay.

936
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:51,830
 

937
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:58,860
Eight, nine.

938
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:02,770
Ten. One, two!

939
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:04,760
Three! Four!

940
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,680
 I had forgotten about this for a long time. 

941
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,040
 This is what happens when you like someone. 

942
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,970
 How would I disappear without a trace? 

943
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:13,520
 Are you a poet? 

944
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,280
 Bye. 

945
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,780
 Bye. 

946
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:26,170
 ♫ Some memory ♫ 

947
01:00:26,170 --> 01:00:34,540
 ♫ You vibrate as if shocked ♫ 

948
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:35,790
I think I'm screwed.

949
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:39,220
 ♫ The undulating rays of the sun ♫ 

950
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:42,780
 ♫ The blue sky ♫ 

951
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:48,160
 ♫ We're stuck on that day ♫ 

952
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:54,050
 ♫ So beautiful ♫ 

953
01:00:54,050 --> 01:01:04,360
 ♫ When I look at you blankly ♫ 

954
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:11,700
 ♫ Come closer ♫ 

955
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:16,720
 ♫ The red sunset ♫ 

956
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:25,590
 ♫ Night and day meet briefly ♫ 

957
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:31,800
 ♫ Like us back then ♫ 

958
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:39,600
 ♫ Like falling asleep ♫ 

959
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:46,530
 ♫ Pretending not to know and embrace ♫ 

960
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:48,890
Happy birthday, Mom.

961
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:55,090
I'm going to go see my mom tomorrow.

962
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:57,360
Can I tell her about you?

963
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:00,220
What kind of question is that?

964
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,830
Of course, you can tell her.

965
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:06,440
What are you going to say?

966
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,280
I don't want to tell you.

967
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,240
Mom.

968
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:18,100
I think you would like her, too.

969
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:43,590
 Did you have any symptoms? 

970
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:46,040
 Like fatigue or... 

971
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:49,010
Numbness?

972
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:53,570
I'll prescribe the medication you'll take, but...

973
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:56,130
it's not covered by insurance...

974
01:02:56,130 --> 01:02:58,030
Am I going to die?

975
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:03,670
Amyloidosis is a challenging, complex disease.

976
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:06,540
There aren't that many cases in Korea.

977
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:08,670
When will I die?

978
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:15,320
To put it crudely, we don't know if it will
be tomorrow or 10 years later.

979
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,990
I know that must be tough to hear.

980
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,630
 If I ever... 

981
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:33,930
had the chance to meet my 19-year-old self?

982
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:40,580
I think I'd give her the spoilers
for my life ahead.

983
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,420
Party when you can.

984
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,510
Invest in this and that.

985
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:48,940
Avoid the day you get slapped.

986
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:52,800
How about you?

987
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:55,340
Me?

988
01:03:56,380 --> 01:03:58,460
Well..

989
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:00,720
I could buy him a meal.

990
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:04,180
That makes me feel so materialistic.

991
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:07,560
You should give him spoilers, too.

992
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:15,940
Life is a bet.

993
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:19,100
Nice intro.

994
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:23,010
I don't know the rest.

995
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:25,390
What would he think if he heard that?

996
01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:28,630
Make something up.

997
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:34,680
It's a bet, so...

998
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:42,200
Some days, you win too much.

999
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,700
Some days, you lose an unbelievable amount.

1000
01:04:53,020 --> 01:04:55,830
 

1001
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:15,340
 

1002
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:37,590
There's a delivery for you.

1003
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:39,330
 

1004
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:41,070
This one's nice.

1005
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:44,340
- Thank you!
- Thanks. Have a good day.

1006
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:49,650
 For you... 

1007
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,060
you'll lose a lot...

1008
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:59,020
and win a little on most days.

1009
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:03,970
Still, you wouldn't bet on misfortune.

1010
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:12,430
If it's you that I know.

1011
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,640
What did you say about me to your mom?

1012
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,440
Did you badmouth me?

1013
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:48,170
What?

1014
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:51,900
You're curious why I'm here, right?

1015
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,300
Yes.

1016
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:57,200
You're excited, right? Right? You will be.

1017
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:12,340
I...

1018
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:19,100
like you.

1019
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:29,830
The timing is...

1020
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:38,310
Am I too late?

1021
01:07:54,730 --> 01:07:57,110
I think I'm crazy.

1022
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:03,120
I shouldn't feel good about this.

1023
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:10,490
The world...

1024
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,470
seems a little beautiful.

1025
01:09:33,790 --> 01:09:35,970
 Let's make him only think about you. 

1026
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:38,410
 You need to set the mood first! 

1027
01:09:38,410 --> 01:09:39,950
 What are you trying to do? 

1028
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:42,210
 I have a plan. 

1029
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:46,120
 Mo Tae Rin, what did you want to be? 

1030
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,630
 Hae published a book? 

1031
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:51,380
 I... I'm going to die. 

1032
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:53,400
 If this happens again, 

1033
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:56,930
 the end is going to be like this anyway. 

1034
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:01,540
 How can you do this to me? 

1035
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,800
 Let's stop seeing each other now. 

1036
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:12,400
 Is this all I am to you?
