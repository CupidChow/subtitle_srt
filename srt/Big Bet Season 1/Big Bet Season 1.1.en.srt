<i>Hey, Moosik.</i>

11
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,981
<i>Do you know the saying,
"there are no permanent flowers"?</i>

12
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:49,901
What?

13
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,779
It's about flowers.

14
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,115
No flower can bloom for ten days.

15
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:59,202
Cherry blossoms and forsythia,
they all die in ten days.

16
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,788
That's what it means.

17
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,373
Just look at that.

18
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,792
The flowers have all fallen.

19
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,086
It's not "permanent flowers."
It's "everlasting flowers."

20
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,004
There are,
"There are no everlasting flowers."

21
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:16,177
It's a metaphor for political power.
You really need to study more, okay?

22
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,347
It means political power doesn't mean
anything in the end,

23
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,557
and neither does life.

24
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,143
That everything's meaningless and vain.
That's what it means.

25
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:24,978
God.

26
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,563
You're embarrassing. Pathetic.

27
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,731
All right.

28
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:31,901
Wait,

29
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,779
why did you bring that up all of a sudden?

30
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,031
Are you trying to tell me something?

31
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:37,949
Oh.

32
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:42,412
No, I'm just saying,
life is just like that.

33
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,467
Welcome.

34
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,385
Hey.

35
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,516
Yes, Moosik.

36
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,936
I'll go in there alone,
and you wait out here.

37
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,896
Wait...

38
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,200
Hello, Mr. Cha! How are you?

39
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,159
Good.

40
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,118
This way, please.

41
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,347
Your favorite spot.

42
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,264
Yes.

43
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,893
Usual order?

44
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,272
Looks like a slow day, huh?

45
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,442
Maybe they're all at the beach,
enjoying the sun, sir.

46
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,946
Was there an American looking for me?

47
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,614
No, so far, sir.

48
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,866
Excuse me, I'll just get your order.

49
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:06,829
He's here.

50
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:09,666
Come on, hurry.

51
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,285
Hey! Hey, get out!

52
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,661
Get out!

53
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,371
Get out!

54
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,290
-Hey, hey, hey, stop right there.
-Don't move!

55
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,750
Put it down!

56
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,710
Put it down!

57
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,752
Put your guns down!

58
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,045
Put it down!

59
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:56,963
Put it down!

60
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,589
-Put it down!
-Put it down!

61
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,882
That's right.

62
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,259
Put your hands up.

63
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,847
Cha Moosik, you are under arrest

64
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,307
for the murder of Seokjun Min.

65
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,224
What?

66
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,019
I said, you are under arrest
for the murder of Seokjun Min.

67
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,478
You know who I am?

68
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,314
Yes, I know who you are.

69
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,898
This is a fucking mistake.

70
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,775
No, you're the mistake.

71
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,361
Put handcuffs on him.

72
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,654
These fucking bastards.

73
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,866
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

74
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,826
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

75
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,119
Team two!

76
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,288
Handcuff that man

77
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,914
and get him in the police car!

-He murdered Seokjun Min.

83

-Hey, hey, hey--
-You two, why don't... Come out.

84
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,601
Excuse me, excuse me.

Sir, sir!

86
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,771
Sir, why you murdered Seokjun Min?

87
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,688
Sir.

88
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,613
Sir, why you murdered Seokjun Min, sir?

89
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,744
Everyone, please settle down.

90
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,496

Time for questions.

94
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,179
First question.

95
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,138
Yes, ma'am.

96
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,598
Thank you.

97
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,183
Why did you murder Mr. Min?

98
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,939
Okay, second question?

99
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,191
Yes, sir.

100
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,693
You two were known to be very close.

101
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,278
Did something happen between you?

102
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,322
And was that the reason for murder?

103
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,450
Next question.

104
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,411
Yes, sir.

105
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:55,206
Do you also admit to killing
the three Chinese gang members?

106
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,251
Okay, next question.

107
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,587
Yes, ma'am.

108
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,383
There's also an allegation
that you killed another person.

109
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:08,511
Do you admit to that as well?

110
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,226
Fuck this shit.

111
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:20,291

<i>Let me tell you a bit
about my life so far.</i>

115
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,305
<i>My family was very poor when I was young,</i>

116
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,641
<i>so my mother left me at a daycare.</i>

117
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,435
<i>She said she'd come get me in a month,</i>

118
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,854
<i>but I was already spending
my second spring there.</i>

119
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,982
<i>They never had enough food at the daycare.</i>

120
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,860
-It's seaweed soup again.
-Chew your food well, okay?

121
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,237
Then you can eat the noodles.

122
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,406
I don't like the noodles. It's too salty.

123
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,659
Well, I like it.

124
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,286
Can I have a lot of the noodles?

125
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,164
Just a bit more.

126
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,290
Come on.

127
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,334
Don't you see the kids
lined up behind you?

128
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,587
You can eat that, and if you
still want more, you can come back.

129
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,173
-Go.
-She always says that.

130
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,341
I want the seaweed soup.

131
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,762
I wish I could eat some meat.

132
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:19,267
If you boil some chicken
and drink the stew...

133
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,855
Have you ever had fried chicken?

134
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,233
You can fry chicken?

135
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,484
Of course!

136
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,236
It's so good when you fry it.

137
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,821
It's like eating chips.

138
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,740
Don't lie to me. You've never had
fried chicken.

139
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,576
I swear I've had it before.

140
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,077
I had some when I went to the town.

141
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,454
They fry it in a big metal pot
and sell it.

142
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,165
Really?

143
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,962
But that doesn't matter.
I don't have any money.

144
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,341
How about we catch some fire ants
and sell them?

145
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:56,304
The old guy at the herbal medicine store
said he'd give me money for fire ants.

146
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,471
And where are we
going to find those fire ants?

147
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,933
You know the tiger's cave down there?

148
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,103
There are tons of fire ants there.

149
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,605
Really?

150
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,897
Yeah!

151
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,322
Hey,

152
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,241
what if a tiger
actually comes out of there?

153
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,201
Th-There aren't any tigers in there.

154
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,745
I-It's all a lie.

155
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,539
I'm scared, Moosik.

156
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,000
Be quiet and follow me.

157
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,942
Ah! That stings!
Oh, that stings! That stings!

158
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,697
Come on, hurry up!

159
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,407
Ugh!

160
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,201
Hurry up. Get them in the bag. Hurry!

161
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,082
Hey, move faster! Get them in the bag!

162
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,334
We caught some fire ants.

163
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:09,251
Huh?

164
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,628
Fire ants.

165
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,090
Okay, okay.

166
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,510
My god, you idiots!

167
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,220
You could die from getting bitten
by fire ants!

168
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,721
We're not going to die.

169
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,139
We'll get you some more.

170
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,558
Never mind that. Do you have a death wish?

171
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,518
Hey.

172
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,811
All right.

173
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,104
Next time, bring me some centipedes.

174
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,939
-Centipedes?
-Yeah.

175
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:30,940
Okay.

176
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:31,982
Centipedes?

177
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,401
Let's go.

178
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,610
If you do that...

179
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,196
Hold on a moment.

180
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,366
Let's eat!

181
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,493
See? Believe me now?

182
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,537
Wow, it looks so delicious.

183
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,039
Hey, go away.

184
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:47,957
500 WON
FRIED CHICKEN 500

185
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,166
You'll chase away all my customers.

186
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,001
We can pay for it.

187
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,712
That's not even close to being enough.

188
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,338
-When they're gone, they're gone!
-Get lost.

189
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,132
FRIED CHICKEN

190
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,383
Hey, go away!

191
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,596
Do you guys have any money?

192
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,852
We can't buy one with what we have,

193
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,395
so let's play rock-paper-scissors

194
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,605
and give one person all our money.

195
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,607
Okay, deal.

196
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,317
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock, paper, scissors!

197
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,070
I won!

198
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,698
I already won two rounds!

199
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,200
Give me 100 won.

200
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,745
Next.

201
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,163
I hope you win.

202
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,875
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock, paper, scissors!

203

-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock, paper, scissors!

204
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,797
Give me 100 won.

205
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,342
Here.

206
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:44,805
Let's bet all the money we both have.

207
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,599
How much do you have?

208
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,935
Are you dumb?

209
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,645
I have 400 won.

210
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,022
If I lose...

211
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,566
I'll catch ten centipedes for you.

212
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,277
You can exchange them for 500 won
at the herbal medicine store.

213
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,362
Really? Can you really catch centipedes?

214
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,989
Of course, I can.

215
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,908
Fine. Let's do it.

216
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,076
Please win!

217
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,915
-Rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock, paper, scissors!

218
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,334

HARVEST SEASON DAYCARE

221
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,967
What a pig.

222
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,512
I can't believe he ate
that big chicken all by himself.

223
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,639
You shouldn't have suggested
pooling the money.

224
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,271
Well, if you're going to eat something,
you should have a good meal.

225
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:38,150
It's better to not eat anything
if you can't eat all of it.

226
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,779
Ugh.

227
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,781
There's nothing here.

228
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,252
Jonghyun!

229
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,419
What?

230
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,225
Why is this so hard to chew?

231
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,184
Just eat it.

232
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,940
-And why is it so salty?
-What are you guys doing?

233
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,070
What did you just eat?

234
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,530
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

235
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:27,908
What happened to your face?

236
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,622
Hold still.

237
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:38,335
Those were for the pigs.
Why the heck did you eat them?

238
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:41,171
When is my mother coming back?

239
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,590
Be quiet.

240
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,552
I don't want you to pass this on
to the other kids. Stay right here, okay?

241
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,053
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

242
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,014
My goodness.

243
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,104
This is all because of you!

244
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:58,606
Ugh.

245
00:14:58,689 --> 00:14:59,815
No, it's because of you!

246
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,733
Ugh.

247
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,946
Jonghyun,
I'm going to get out of here.

248
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:07,907
Where will you go?

249
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,867
To a big town.

250
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,369
I bet there's a lot of food there.

251
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,914
Have you ever been to Daegu?

252
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,332
I heard it's huge.

253
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,585
You idiot, Seoul's even bigger.

254
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,170
Seoul?

255
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,256
Hey, I heard that people get mugged
there all the time.

256
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:25,966
Don't lie.

257
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,426
I'm not lying.

258
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,471
They mug everybody who's
from the countryside.

259
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,222
No way.

260

Huh?

262
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,315
Maybe we have a visitor.

263
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,194
I hope it's my mom.

264
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,488
In your dreams.

265
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,039
Thank you.

266
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,707
Oh, no problem.

I'm a bit late, aren't I?

273
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,105
But it's okay. I'm here now.

274

Did you miss me?

275
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,072
I'm sorry.

276
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,616
I'm so sorry, Moosik.

This way.

285

Hold on.

294

Sorry. We don't have a lot of money...

What are you talking about?

324
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,299
If I were having an affair,
I wouldn't be here right now.

325

I would have run away already.

326

Do you have a death wish?
Don't you dare glare at me.

00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,307
The teacher told me
to bring you to school.

329
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,641
Your teacher wants to see me?

330
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:45,767
Did you get into trouble?

331
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,603
No, I didn't.

332
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,979
Then why?

333
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,024
You can go with me.

NEW VILLAGE

335
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,947
So for "diligent," you would say

336
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,407
-"lazy," right?
-Yes, ma'am.

337
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,950
Then what about "mountains"?

338
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,577
"Field."

339
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,953
Very good. How about "in front"?

340
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,538
"Behind."

341
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,706
And what about "narrow"?

342
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,416
"Wide."

343
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,044
Sir, there's just too much

344
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,087
that Moosik doesn't know.

345
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,632
He cannot keep up with the class at all.

346
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:18,800
Come on.

347
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:22,095
Students come to school to learn.

348
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,514
Why would they come here
if they already know everything?

349
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,350
Still,

350
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,268
he's in fourth grade right now,

351
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,395
but he can't even read Korean very well.

352
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,358
Uh, I think he skipped a lot of classes
when he was in first and second grade.

353
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,276
Since we can't teach Moosik

354
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,153
how to read and write Korean

355
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,905
in fourth grade classes...

356
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,199
...the only way he'll be able to catch up

357
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:45,452
is if you and his mother
teach him to read at home.

"A woman's."

What's that mean?

370
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,822
A girl.

371
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,365
Yeah, a girl.

372
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,326
A girl's "life."

373

That's, you know...

374
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,037
Uh...

375
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:33,208
So it's about how girls live,
or something like that, okay?

376
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,376
Uh, "author."

377

"Maupassant."

378
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,255
You need to read more.

379
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,967
You need to read
if you want to be worth anything.

380
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:42,926
Okay?

381
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,094
-Here.
-Okay.

382
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,554
Eat this.

383
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,098
I know you're not educated,

384
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:50,851
but I can't believe
that you never taught him how to read.

385
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,230
Well, uh, I thought he would learn
at school. I didn't know.

386
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,649
My goodness. Damn it.

387
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,401
You're pathetic.

388
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,323
Oh. Hey.

389
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,826
I'm planning on doing
some business in here,

390
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,078
so don't say a word to anybody, all right?

391
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,163
You understand?

392
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,748
Yes.

393
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,917
-Come on, come on, come on.
-Huh?

394
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,085
Just hold on a second.

395
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,045
We're in no rush here, come on.

396

Come on, show us.

-Hey, just hold on a minute.
-Damn.

00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:22,549
Fuck.

400
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:23,508
Okay, okay, okay.
I need some positive energy.

401
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,510
-Come on, send it!
-Good God.

402
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,888
You never know until you do it.

403
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,139
Shuffle them. Come on, pass them around.

404
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,101
I got it, I got it.

405
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,770
Hey, hey, hey. Shut up for a minute.

406
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,229
Send it, hurry up.

407
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,522
Ugh.

408
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,984
-That one's bad. That one's real bad.
-Damn it.

409
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,279
Shit.

410
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,447
You fucking idiot.

411
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,115
I told you to fold on my signal!

412
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,243
-You fucking idiot. I had a pair of aces.
-You fucking idiot.

413
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,412
I had a full house, aces full,
so if you were holding a pair of aces,

414
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,164
that wouldn't have worked, you dumb shit.

415
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,123
Fuck, fine.

416
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,583
Man, you're such a fucking idiot.

417
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,501
Shit.

418
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,920
Damn it, fuck! Don't you know how much
money we could have gotten with that?

419
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,421
Fuck, okay!

420
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,548
I had such a good feeling
about this one, though, you know?

421
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,718
You fucking idiot, you use
your skills to make money, not guts.

422
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:07,719
-Fuck.
-Hey.

423
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:14,810
If you cheat, then I'll cut your
damn hands off.

424
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,021
You understand?

425
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,356
-Yeah.
-Okay.

426
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,982
Now get back in there.

427
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,950
Hey, what are you doing?

428
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,202
This is the right one.
Here. Look, look!

429
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,412
All right, let's do this.

430
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,371
Are you really trying
to pull that right now?

431
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,705
Ouch, that's hot.

432
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:36,915
Look here.

433
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,041
Ugh.

434
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,876
-Here's your ramen.
-Okay.

435
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,086
Is it stove-cooked?

436
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,254
-Yes, it is. Yes.
-Wow, that looks delicious.

437
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,797
-Enjoy.
-Okay, here you go.

438
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,882
Can I get a Bacchus-D?

439
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,217
Do we have any Bacchus-D?

440
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,260
No, we don't.

441
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,139
Hey, Moosik.

442
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:53,640
Don't just watch. Get that out here.

443
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:54,891
Go to Sinjang-ro

444

-and get me two boxes of Bacchus-D.
-All right, all right...

445
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,519
That's more like it.

446
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,937

Who?

You're the General's son!

453
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:16,663
What do you need?

454
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,166
I need two boxes of Bacchus-D.

455
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,459
Bacchus-D?

456
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,043
All right.

457
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,216
My goodness, hey, hey.

458
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,010
I can't believe you're going through
all this trouble so late at night.

459
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,138
Here, take it.

460
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,224
-Thank you, sir.
-Sure.

461

-See? You lost.
-Fuck... I lost.

465
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,328
Come on.

466

-Thank you.
-Here you go.

467

Let's see them.
Come on, come on, come on!

468
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,707
-Damn it.
-You can look at them later.

469
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,083
All right, let's go, let's go.

470
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,460
-Why am I only getting shitty hands?
-Here, you can have them all.

471
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,337
Here it is, here it is.

472
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,588
-You, too.
-Oh, right. Here you go.

473
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,631
Take this around.

474
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,592
I call your 5 million and add another 20.

475
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,801
I got all my money.

476
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,553
It's all right.

477
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,765
Wow, I guess it's my lucky day today.

478
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:17,933
One more.
I'm not getting any good ones.

479
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,394
Huh?

480
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:22,562
Hold on.

481
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,688
Show us, show us, show us...

482

taught me things.</i>

487

<i>But then...</i>

488
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,665
Didn't I tell you to not even

I ran away from the orphanage.

I was too hungry.

Seventy won.

549
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:45,765
Okay. If you bring back 70 won,
I take 50 won,

550

-Do you understand?
-Yes, sir.

552
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,147
But if you sell less than five copies,

553
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,482
then you'll get smacked once
for every copy

554
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,151
that you didn't sell, all right?

555

Yes, sir.

556
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,031
Well, go and sell them, then.

I did. Do you really think that I didn't?

Just don't do business with them.

644

Why? They're dealing
illegal gift cards, too.

646
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,169
Can't you just go bust them?

00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,671
Hey, everyone's doing that nowadays.

648
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:47,048
And how exactly am I supposed
to go after them anyway, huh?

I know you can do it. Come on.

651
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:54,430
Hey!

652
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,431
Yeah?

653
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,891
Do you think I'm your employee?

654
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,852
You little moron.

655
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,397
You think you can act all arrogant now
because you gave me some money?

656
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,148
I'm not trying to act arrogant.

657
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,900
I'm just asking you
to do something about it.

658
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,819
I'm asking you for a favor right now.

659
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,237
How am I being arrogant?

660
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:14,075
If I step in,
then they'll come after you too.

661
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,118
Can you handle that?

662
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,870
No, of course, I can't.
That's why I came to talk to you.

663
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,126
-Chiyoung.
-Yeah.

664
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,335
If you're that desperate,

665
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,964
then you can go talk to Moosik.

666
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,341
Moosik?

667
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,428
Nobody is better than Moosik
when it comes to something like this.

668
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:36,347
We're here, sir.

669
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,099
-Oh, we are?
-Yes, sir.

670
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,690
Sir, you forgot this.

671
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,692
Oh, right. Okay.

672
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,485
-Just wait right there.
-Yes, sir.

673
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,611
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

674
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,071
Don't go anywhere.

675
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,073
Global talent?

676
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:54,991
CHA ENGLISH ACADEMY

677
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,993
"Cha English Academy." Cha...

678
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,582
And don't forget your homework, okay?

679
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,125
-Okay.
-Bye-bye.

680

CHA ENGLISH ACADEMY
"ENGLISH IS EASY!!"

682
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,510
What did you think about the teacher?

683
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:19,557
-Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.
-All right. Thank you so much.

684
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,142
-Of course. Hey, Nayun.
-Bye.

685
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,310
-I'll see you later.
-See you later.

686
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,145
Sure.

687
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,237
You can do it!

688
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:37,825
Moosik,

689
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,744
I can't believe
that you've opened an academy.

690
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,248
This place is the best academy in Daejeon.

691
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,875
We have the highest number
of foreign instructors.

692
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,543
Really?

693
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,630
Wow, this is hard to get used to.

694
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,549
By the way, what are you doing nowadays?

695
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,009
-Me?
-Yeah.

696
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,386
I'm working in IT. You know, computers.

697
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,387
What T?

698
00:34:58,805 --> 00:34:59,806
You're selling T-shirts?

699
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,477
IT, IT. IT is really trending nowadays.

700
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,856
-Hey.
-Hey, there are children here.

701
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,483
Why are you here?

702
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:13,194
Well, I had a favor to ask of you.

703
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,612
But, uh,

704
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:18,157
judging by what you're doing here,
I don't think it'll work out.

705
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:20,785
Moosik.

706
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,915
I have a great opportunity for you.

707
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,960
What the hell are you talking about?

708
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,589
Okay, spill.

709
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,510
Moosik, do you know
how much money we make in a month?

710
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:38,594
How much?

711
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,430
Our net revenue alone
is over 5 billion won.

712
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,891
On top of that, these machines
are worth over 10 billion won.

713
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,228
I mean, these things are so in demand,
they're selling like hotcakes.

714
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,855
Look. You set the profit rate,

715
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,649
and you're guaranteed regular profit.
It's not even illegal.

716
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,401
The government supports
this industry, too.

717
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,986
So, it's perfectly legal.

718
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,363
All right? You don't need to worry at all.

719
00:35:58,364 --> 00:35:59,407
-Chiyoung.
-Yeah?

720
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,577
If I do this,

721
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,704
can you sell me the machines
at their original prices?

722
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,038
Of course.

723
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,915
Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.

724
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,042
I just got this idea.

725
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,753
You know Mangchi, right? In Busan?

726
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:13,713
Mangchi?

727
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:14,881
Yes, yes, yes. Mangchi.

728
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,216
He just opened a casino bar in Busan,

729
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,427
and apparently, it's a huge hit.

730
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,928
-Yeah?
-Oh, right, right, right.

731
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,138
He opened a casino bar?

732
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,473
-Yeah. The idea's from Japan...
-Yeah.

733
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,851
...and apparently,
people can legally gamble there.

734
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:27,977
-Chiyoung.
-What?

735
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,520
I've heard of it, too.

736
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,272
It's pretty nice.

737
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:39,363
Uh, why don't we go down to Busan
for some sashimi, then?

738
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,284
Sure. Let's do that.

740
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,430
Hey, Mangchi!

741
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:07,266
Hey, buddy! I hope the drive
down here wasn't too bad.

742
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,603
Long time no see.

743
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,063
Hey, hey, you asshole.

744
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,482
Huh? What's this?

745
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,441
What?

746
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,569
Wow. Look at this shiny thing.
So you're rich now, huh?

747
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,612
Hello.

748
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:20,738
Yeah, yeah.

749
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,283
Uh, go ahead and introduce yourself.
Uh, this is Moosik. He works with me.

750
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,369
My goodness, hello, Moosik.
I've heard a lot about you.

751
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,286
Oh, hello.

752
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,038
-It's a pleasure to meet you.
-Yeah, nice to meet you too.

753
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,249
Uh...

754
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,291
Let's get you guys inside.

755
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,377
-Follow me.
-Okay, let's go.

756
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,128
Chiyoung, I'll wait here.

757
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,631
Okay, okay.
Don't do anything stupid.

758
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,424
This way. Right this way, please.

759
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,676
This way.

Hey, go somewhere else.
Do you have a death wish?

762
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,347
He said he wants me
to show him some respect.

763
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,935
Chiyoung!

764
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:53,479
This is South Korea's first casino bar.

Hey, I won.

00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:57,984
Do you have any money?

768
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,070
Wow, it's basically
like what I saw in the movies.

769
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,071
Of course!

770
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:05,408
Who ordered the coffee?
I have a coffee delivery!

771
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,702
Hey, you did good.

772
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:08,744
Should we get more money?

773
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:09,704
Hey, don't cry.

774
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:10,997
No.

775
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,498
You little bitch.

776
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:13,666
No means no.

777
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:16,419
Hey, it's looking good today.

778
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,545
No, there's a lot already. It's fine.

779
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,671
It should appear any minute now.

780
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,006
A bank?

781
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,257
This place was a bank before?

782
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,508
Oh, sure.

783
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:23,968
Ugh, don't even mention it.

784
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:27,179
I got screwed over last time,
so I had to redo everything.

785
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,015
I got new tables and chips and everything.

786
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,099
-Hey!
-Hmm...

787
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,852
You know, the permit for this place
says that it's a bar.

788
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,520
We're supposed to be selling alcohol.

789
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:35,604
Isn't this illegal, then?

790
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,064
Hey!

791
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,983
We don't use any cash,
so it's totally legal!

792
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,027
Damn it, today's not a good day.

793
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:43,654
Hey, what's this game supposed to be?

794
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,239
Have you ever heard of Baccarat?

795
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,699
-Baccarat?
-Yeah.

796
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,200
Here, look. It's easy.

797
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,077
-The banker is on this side...
-Yeah.

798
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,495
...and the player is on that side.

799
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,789
One of them wins.

800
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,625
It's odds and evens. Odds and evens.

801
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,044
Odds and evens?

802
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,253
So, how do we play?

803
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,505
Eh, whatever. Just try it.
You'll learn fast.

804
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,965
Moosik, why don't you try it?

805
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,717
-Me?
-Yeah.

806
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,179
Okay. I'll give it a go, then.

807
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,184
15, 15, 15.

808
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,644
-Ah...
-Okay, I'm betting.

809
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:18,939
Banker out!

810
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:19,982
Sorry.

811
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,484
"Sorry."

812
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,488
-Here.
-I got it!

813
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,823
That's right. All right, all right!

814
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,379
That's bad.

815
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,219
Don't you want to take a break?

816
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,804
No, I want to keep playing.

817
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,752
Banker natural nine, banker win.

Did you lose?

821
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,258
No.

822
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,509
-Did you win anything?
-I won.

823
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,510
You won?

824
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,761
Hey, Chiyoung.

825
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,888
I think I got the gist of it.
Let's go now.

826
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,265
Man, I'm tired.

827
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:35,182
Sir.

828
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,230
He'll collect his winnings.

829
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,652
Wow, Moosik. You won something?

830
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,279
How much is it?

831
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,488
1.9 million won, sir.

832
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,990
Holy jeez.

833
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,242
Looks like you played
a good first round.

834
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:55,453
What are these?

835
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,123
They're vouchers. Vouchers for alcohol.

836
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,084
Follow me.

837
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,296
-You want us to follow you?
-Come on.

838
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:10,718
Thank you.

Come on, follow me.

841
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,059
Where did he go?

842
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,897
Uh, right here.

843
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,193
Where is he?

844
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,819
Wake the hell up!

845
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,196
Let's work, let's work!

846
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,113
Oh, hello!

847
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,198
Ugh, Jesus Christ.

848
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,741
My god, you reek of alcohol. Ugh.

849
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,367
You've been drinking!

850
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,787
-Here, exchange these.
-Yes, sir.

851
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,877
You asshole, this thing is worth
800 thousand won. It's 30 years old!

852
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:46,921
How much in total?

853
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,631
1.9 million won, 1.9 million!

854
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,132
Wow, he won a lot.

855
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,509
I'm going to kill you, you little shit.

856
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,640
Here you go.

857
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:58,557
Here.

858
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,061
Follow me.

859
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,021
Goodbye, sir.

860
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,814
All right, right this way.

861
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,779
-Come in.
-Oh, welcome.

862
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,614
Hey. Can you exchange this alcohol for me?

863
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:14,740
Sure.

864
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,493
Wow, you brought a lot today.

865
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,703
Oh, so are you doing it like this
because of the restrictions?

866
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:20,746
Exactly.

867
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,331
If you do it like this, it's all legal.

868
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:23,749
There's nothing illegal about it.

869
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:26,085
This right here
is a completely healthy business.

870
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,587
So the house just takes a ten percent fee,
and that's it?

871
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,505
Oh, yeah.

872
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,298
The customers keep the rest
of the winnings.

873
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,592
But if you lose all your money...

874
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,010
Hey,

875
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:36,554
don't you worry.

876
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,597
The thing about gambling is,

877
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,224
the house will always win.

878
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,059
No matter how hard they try,

879
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,519
they can never beat the house.

880
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:44,812
Here you go.

881
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:45,896
Thanks.

882
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:47,565
Moosik.

883
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,732
Congratulations.

884
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,286
I'm back.

885
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:03,247
Oh, you're back!

886
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,001
Chiyoung.

887
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:10,170
Ask Moosik if he had fun.

888
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,589
Did you have fun?

889
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,556
-Hey. Chiyoung.
-Yeah.

890
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:22,891
Let's do this.

891
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,520
I think we'll need a lot of people, then.

892
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,231
We'll need to change the money outside
and exchange it, too.

893
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,233
There's no need
to make things so complicated.

894
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,776
We can just give it to them in cash.

895
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,738
I'll take care of the cops.

896
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,575
You need to go to Jeongseon
and get me some dealers.

897
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,535
How many do you want?

898
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,706
About 12, and I want the good ones.

899
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:49,293
While you're doing that,
I'll find us a place.

900
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,502
-Okay.
-Hey, Sangchul.

901
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,462
Yes?

902
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:52,463
You know your way around Daejeon, right?

903
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:53,714
Yeah, really well.

904
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,382
Okay, let's take a look around together.

905
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:58,010
NIGHT CLUB
EXTREME

906
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,765
Chest.

907
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:03,849
Head.

908
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:06,894
Stomach, chest, chest, chest!

909
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,897
Huh?

910
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:13,359
Hello.

911
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,152
What are you doing?
Dancing in the moonlight?

912
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:16,904
Where is the place?

913
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,864
It's on the second floor, right up there.

914
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:21,325
They're not getting any business here.
No customers at all.

915
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:24,078
Where should I park?

916
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,121
You can just park right up there.

917
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,290
You want me to park?

918
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,417
No, you can step out. I'll park the car.

919
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,304
LIVE ALL-IN
PULL

920
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:54,817
Hey, why is this place so empty
at this time of day?

921
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,026
Welcome in.

922
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:58,445
How does this place make enough
to even afford the rent?

923
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,947
Yeah, these are pretty rough times.

924
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,073
The economy isn't doing well at all.

925
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,991
-Are you the owner?
-Yeah.

926
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,451
Can I talk with you for a moment?

927
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:10,833
What is it?

928
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,626
Wait, so,

929
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,461
even if you sold this place,

930
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,879
you wouldn't get any entitlement fees,
would you?

931
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,840
Entitlement, my ass.

932
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,883
I just wish somebody would pay
the overdue rent.

933
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:21,760
What about the facility fees, then?

934
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,680
Nobody's paying facility fees right now.
The economy is slower than ever.

935
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:26,306
How much is the deposit for this place?

936
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:27,850
Ten million.

937
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,226
Ten million?

938
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,397
Ma'am...

939
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,233
...hear me out.

940
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,777
I'll give you ten million won
for the deposit

941
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,572
and throw in another 20 million to make up
for the money you've been losing.

942
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:45,409
If you leave everything here
and just walk away,

943
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,744
I'll talk to an acquaintance of mine

944
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:47,870
and make sure that this place gets sold
for a good price.

945
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:48,996
Then we can call it even.

946
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:49,997
How's that sound?

947
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,165
Thirty million won?

948
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,124
Yeah.

949
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:55,252
Well, if you want to take anything
with you, feel free to do that.

950
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:56,253
Oh, my.

951
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:58,213
It's fine. I don't want to take anything.

952
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:01,633
But can you really give me 30 million won?

953
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,305
Ma'am, do I look like I'm joking?

954
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:08,474
If you can't believe me, we can sign
a contract right now. Okay?

955
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,559
I'll give you the money up front. But...

956
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:12,978
you can't complain, no matter
how high of a price I can get

957
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:15,439
for this place through my acquaintance.

958
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:16,398
Okay?

959
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,901
Oh, of course.

960
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,239
Okay, one, two, three!

961
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,244
Fuck, what are we even doing here?

962
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:30,913
Moosik!

963
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,373
We cleaned out the place.

964
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,666
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

965
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:35,834
-Come here.
-Okay.

966
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,631
-Hey, if you're done with that...
-Yeah.

967
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,633
...get me a really good carpenter.

968
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,051
How many carpenters?

969
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:47,304
Well, we'll need about six casino tables.

970
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,306
Uh, just get as many as you can.

971
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:50,265
All right.

972
00:46:58,732 --> 00:46:59,733
Hey, Moosik!

973
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:02,194
I've recruited 12 dealers!

974
00:47:02,277 --> 00:47:03,278
When are they coming?

975
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,947
I told them to come down here
over the weekend.

976
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,907
-Okay. Come over here.
-Okay.

977
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:09,243
-All right, then.
-Yeah.

978
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,619
Now, go and get me

979
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,248
two of the best cooks in Daejeon.

980
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,083
Best cooks?

981
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,336
You know, the ladies who work
at that really famous restaurant.

982
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:20,295
Uh...

983
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,547
Okay, okay.

984
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,840
By the way, we don't have a place
for people to sleep in.

985
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,007
Where are the dealers going to sleep?

986
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,386
We can just rent some rooms
at a motel nearby. Don't worry.

987
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:28,554
Hey,

988
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,639
I think the dealers will all run away
if we make them work 12-hour shifts

989
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:31,932
or something like that.

990
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:39,898
KARAOKE

991
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,192
LIVE ALL-IN

992
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:45,112
Excuse me, sir.

993
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,113
-Hello.
-Hello.

994
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:48,448
-By any chance...
-Yeah?

995
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,410
...do you know anybody who specializes
in temporary buildings?

996
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:53,328
Oh, of course. One of my friends does.

997
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:54,621
-Really?
-Yeah.

998
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:55,998
That's great.

999
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:57,916
I want a sandwich panel dorm
on the rooftop up there.

1000
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,793
-What?
-It should be able to house

1001
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,545
about 12 people.

1002
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,839
-Uh, I'll give him a call, then.
-All right. That'd be great.

1003
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:05,090
Sure, sure.

1004
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:09,386
All righty.

1005
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,932
Fuck it, let's give this a shot.

1006
