1
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:12,721
Any players?

2
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:14,347
I just need a good hand.

3
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,306
Damn it.

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,266
All right!

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,225
-We can do this all night.
-Ugh, fuck.

6
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:21,146
Stay on 20.

7
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,689
Stay on Blackjack. Congratulations.

8
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,738
Wow, just look at the time.

9
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,656
Darn, I could totally win some more.

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,615
I'll see you next time.

11
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:33,783
You're leaving already?

12
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:34,743
Yeah.

13
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,202
-Sir.
-See you later.

14
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:39,748
How much is it?

15
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,124
It's 3.76 million won, sir.

16
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,625
3.76 million won?

17
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,673
-You earned a lot.
-Thank you.

18
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,968
-I hope I'll see you around.
-Sure. I'll see you next time.

19
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:54,804
Hey.

20
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,265
I'm at a funeral right now.

21
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:58,725
I'm on my way now.

22
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,560
Yeah, okay.

23
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,773
Sir, can you ring me up?

24
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,274
-Did you have fun?
-Sure did.

25
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,609
Sir, I have a delivery for you.

26
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:08,902
Okay. Put it right there.

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,030
This place is booming!

28
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,406
Are you guys open on weekends too?

29
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,659
Of course. We don't do any holidays.
We're open 24/7.

30
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:20,246
The dealers here
must have come from real casinos.

31
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,749
And the food is great.
I think this place will be a real hit.

32
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,334
Thank you.

33
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,544
Make sure to tell
all your friends about us.

34
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,254
-Oh, of course.
-Here you go.

35
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,340
Thank you.

36
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,841
-Sure. Have a great day.
-Thanks.

37
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,219
-That'll be 10,000 won.
-10,000?

38
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,762
-Yeah.
-Thank you for coming.

39
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,013
-Sure.
-Hey!

40
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,390
-What the fuck? Who the hell are you?
-All right, stay still, stay still!

41
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:40,850
-Put down whatever you're holding!
-Ugh, I lost.

42
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,019
Hey, you!

43
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,729
You there!

44
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,190
We're from the National Tax Service.

45
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,733
Everybody, stay where you are!

46
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,194
-God damn it.
-Stop right there.

47
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,990
Where's the owner?

48
00:01:56,491 --> 00:02:00,370
Ma'am, put that down.
I can't have you touching that money.

49
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,371
Put it down.

50
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,664
See you later.

51
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,084
-Hey.
-Shh, shh, shh.

52
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,836
-Hey, where are you going?
-Hey, you've got to go. Come on.

53
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,962
Where are you going?

54
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,421
-Shh.
-And what's this?

55
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,923
-Yeah.
-Huh?

56
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,803
Wow, just look at how much food
you're delivering.

57
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,972
Wait, you're...

58
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,557
Oh, shit!

59
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,351
Where's Mr. Ahn Chiyoung?

60
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,310
Who?

61
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,564
Ahn Chiyoung. Your boss.

62
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,336
BIG BET

63
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:36,090
TAX BOMB

64
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,682
-Hold on.
-Okay.

65
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,267
Hello?

66
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:47,310
<i>Moosik.</i>

67
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,145
The NTS enforcement team barged in.

68
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,647
<i>They took everything.</i>

69
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,773
What? When?

70
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:52,857
A while ago.

71
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,238
Okay. I'll call you later.

72
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,406
Hey, Chiyoung.

73
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,699
Yeah?

74
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,409
Let's call it a day.

75
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,203
Why?

76
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,080
How much money do you have
in your car trunk?

77
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,254
MOUNTAIN VALLEY APPLES

78
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,340
This is all the cash that I have.

79
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,717
And where did you put the rest?

80
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,052
They're in the bank...

81
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,845
Goddamn motherfuckers.

82
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,138
It's not like they've ever done
anything for me!

83
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,016
I hate this. This is so annoying! Ah!

84
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,102
You idiot, didn't I tell you
to keep that money out of there?

85
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,311
Huh?

86
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,814
I told you that you'll lose it all
if you keep it in the bank.

87
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,440
What do I do?

88
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,109
That's 60 billion won right there.
60 billion won!

89
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,026
My god...

90
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,152
Hey, be quiet.

91
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,612
Damn it.

92
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:40,655
Hey.

93
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,532
Don't go to the bank.

94
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,242
You'll get caught right away
if you go to the bank, okay?

95
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,035
This is driving me nuts.

96
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,121
Hey, where are you going?

97
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,123
Where are you going, Moosik?

98
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,255
-Give me your phone.
-My phone?

99
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,884
From now on, I'm the only person
that you can call with this phone.

100
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,762
-Don't call anybody else, okay?
-Okay.

101
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,222
Go up to Seoul.

102
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,016
I'm going up there too,
once I'm done cleaning this up.

103
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,100
Can I just go with you?

104
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,351
Then what, you idiot?

105
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,894
Are you insane?

106
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,480
If we're together, they'll track us.

107
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,190
Damn it.

108
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,403
Go up to Seoul
and hide in a motel somewhere, okay?

109
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,946
I'll contact you.

110
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,323
Fine.

111
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,241
You little...

112
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,577
You son of a gun. Oh, also,

113
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,537
you can't call your wife.

114
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,164
Okay?

115
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,794
So five people were involved
in starting the illegal casino bar?

116
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,672
Here. Check these names and see
if they're the people who were involved.

117
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,882
Hold on a minute.

118
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,092
Are you going to keep recording?

119
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,136
I mean, I have my rights, don't I?

120
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,638
Turn it off.

121
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:48,598
Okay.

122
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,644
These are the transaction statements.

123
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,356
Money taken out under the label
of security deposits.

124
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,524
Interior repair costs.

125
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,444
And we don't even know how
some of this money was used.

126
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,820
Listen.

127
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,864
I'm just the figurehead, I swear.

128
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,616
I didn't even make that much money.

129
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,159
Your share was 20 percent.

130
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,369
I really didn't make a lot,

131
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,662
if you subtract the operating expenses
along with everything else.

132
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,165
Come on, you've got the wrong person.

133
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,750
Man, you guys are frustrating.

134
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:16,834
Prove it, then.

135
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:20,296
Prove that you didn't make a lot of money.

136
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,714
How the hell am I supposed to prove that?

137
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,466
How the hell am I supposed to prove
that I didn't make any money?

138
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,302
What do you want me to do?
Go back in time and show you?

139
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:27,887
If you want.

140
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,809
For God's sake.

141
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:38,106
Why are you doing this to me?
Go find the real owner and ask him.

142
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,734
Well, let us meet the real owner, then.

143
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,444
I won't be shy with my questions.

144
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:48,408
If we don't catch Ahn Chiyoung,
then you'll get all the blame.

145
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,909
You can do that if you want,

146
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,286
or take the easier route.

147
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,206
Man, seriously.

148
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,717
-Why did you park in a place like this?
-Hey, be quiet.

149
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,678
Was there anybody following you?

150
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,263
-No!
-Huh? Is this it?

151
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,181
Yeah.

152
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,350
Oh, honey.

153
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,477
I couldn't withdraw any money at the bank.

154
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,271
Those bastards.
They've blocked everything.

155
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,564
What?

156
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,858
What do we do?
Are they going to take all our money?

157
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,900
Hey, where's the contract
for the strip mall

158
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,610
-that you bought under your dad's name?
-Give it here.

159
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,321
-Is it in there?
-Here.

160
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:29,574
-Okay.
-What's going on?

161
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,784
Just go home for now.

162
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,161
I'll call you
when I've taken care of everything,

163
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,620
so don't tell anybody
that you saw me, okay?

164
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,913
What are you going to do?

165
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,248
What do you... Just go home!

166
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,916
-I'll call you. Hurry, go home.
-What do you mean, go home?

167
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,168
I need to go to a wedding. Let's go.

168
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,253
Go where? Get out!

169
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,254
I really need to get going.

170
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:44,589
Don't tell anybody that you saw...

171
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,548
I'm in a hurry right now! Get out!

172
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,133
Ugh, fine, fine, fine, fine.

173
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,385
Go!

174
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,351
Seven billion? That's pushing it.

175
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,730
I bought it for 9 billion.
What do you mean, 7 billion?

176
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:04,484
Well, that strip mall has a lot
of vacancies, and it's pretty big.

177
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,194
That's a pretty reasonable price
if you're looking to sell it so quickly.

178
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,445
Still.

179
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,363
If you're not happy with it,
then give me some more time.

180
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,074
This is driving me up the wall.

181
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,618
Okay, fine.

182
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,370
If you're fine with 7.5 billion,
I'll make sure that it's sold.

183
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,206
You have my word.

184
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,709
You can sell it right away? Immediately?
How long do you think it'll take?

185
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:22,919
No more than a week.

186
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,045
No, I can't do a week.

187
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,880
Three days. Let's do three days,
and I want the balance paid in full.

188
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,215
It has to be within three days.

189
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,424
Oh, come on. That's...

190
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,759
What are you whining about?
I bought it for 9 billion.

191
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,302
You're the one who reduced it
by 2 billion.

192
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,762
How am I supposed to sell this in three...

193
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,555
How? J-Just do it. Do it.

194
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,806
-Do it.
-Mr. An.

195
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,850
I'm from the Daejeon tax office.

196
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,564
Who is this?

197
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,903
He was in charge of everything related
to the funds for Greater Electronics.

198
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,531
He's the real owner
of the casino bar, too.

199
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,658
I'm not sure.

200
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,162
Well, if you want to take responsibility
for everything, have it your way.

201
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,914
The hearing may take place in a courtroom,

202
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,415
but I'm the one
who makes the tax decisions.

203
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,750
Depending on how cooperative you are,

204
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,585
the taxes that you have to pay
could fluctuate by several billions...

205
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,753
Oh, just pick up!

206
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,389
Yeah.

207
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,474
Hello? Where are you?

208
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,101
I got caught.

209
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,477
I think you'll have to run. Sorry.

210
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,521
Hello?

211
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,981
Yeah, hello there.

212
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,818
I'm Kang Minjung of Investigation Bureau 4
at the Daejeon Regional Tax Office.

213
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,821
<i>You're Mr. An's
business partner, right?</i>

214
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,408
-<i>Uh, I have some questions for you.</i>
-Huh?

215
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:37,118
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

216
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,370
Sir.

217
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,206
You really need to pay your taxes.

218
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,128
<i>If you don't pay your taxes,
you can't do anything in South Korea--</i>

219
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,173
Damn it, he hung up on me.

220
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,227
LAW AND ORDER, SINCERITY AND SERVICE

221
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,021
Finally.

222
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,023
What?

223
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,317
Who is it?

224
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,318
Huh?

225
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,194
Hello?

226
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,946
-Hey, Jonghyun. It's me.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

227
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,408
Do you happen to know anybody
at the Daejeon Regional Tax Office?

228
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,910
-No, not really, why?
<i>-Hey.</i>

229
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,871
Can you look into it, then?

230
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:25,374
Chiyoung is being held
at Investigation Bureau 4.

231
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,626
Bureau 4?

232
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:27,752
<i>Yeah.</i>

233
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,545
Dude, that's the central investigation
department of the NTS.

234
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,713
The central one.

235
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,174
<i>Those assholes are really,
really thorough and persistent.</i>

236
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,133
Hey.

237
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,304
Just help Chiyoung
before he loses all his money.

238
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,349
Okay, fine.

239
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,558
By the way, where are you?

240
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,435
I won't be in Korea for a while.

241
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,771
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?

242
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,939
I probably shouldn't tell you
over the phone.

243
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,609
I'll call you when I've settled down.

244
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,202
Here you go.

245
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:29,230
<i>It's nine o'clock on a Saturday</i>

246
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,234
<i>The regular crowd shuffles in</i>

247
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,279
<i>There's an old man sitting next to me</i>

248
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,492
<i>Makin' love to his tonic and gin</i>

249
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,413
That's awesome.

250
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,497
Right?

251
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,417
<i>It's nine o'clock on a Saturday</i>

252
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:56,674
<i>He says, "Son
can you play me a memory?"</i>

253
00:11:56,757 --> 00:12:00,261
<i>I'm not really sure how it goes</i>

254
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,679
You fuckers.

255
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,557
<i>And it's sweet
and I knew it complete</i>

256
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,975
When you see an upperclassman,
you say hello.

257
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,185
Hey, on your feet.

258
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,106
On your feet, you bastards!

259
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,698
Head on the floor, now.

260
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,869
Do it, you punks!

261
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,370
Okay, right away.

262
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,878
Hey.

263
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,671
Got a death wish?

264
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,256
Why are you doing this?

265
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,591
"Why are you doing this"?

266
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,845
I'm going to rip your mouth apart,
you bastard.

267
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,221
Leave it, leave it, leave it.

268
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,851
Hey, Cha Moosik.

269
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,604
I heard you're the toughest
among the second-years.

270
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,606
Is that true?

271
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,149
Yes.

272
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,944
Are you usually this rude

273
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,614
to upperclassmen?

274
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,242
You sure don't act like an upperclassman.

275
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,203
You're just ganging up on me.

276
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,705
You little punk!

277
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,084
What?

278
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,464
You bastard!

279
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,510
Let go!

280
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,387
Bastard.

281
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,149
You asshole!

282
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,404
You freaking dirtbags!

283
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,534
Come at me!

284
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,421
Ma'am, it's good to see you.

285
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,631
Yeah.

286
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,759
So, how's business?

287
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,054
It sure looks like it's doing better
than when I was running this place.

288
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,223
The store's doing well, all thanks to you.

289
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,393
One moment.

290
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,317
Thank you.

291
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,280
You're the owner of this place now.

292
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,740
Try your best to run things smoothly.

293
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,701
Of course, I will.

294
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,245
I'm going now.

295
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,580
-Take care.
-Bye.

296
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,166
Thank you so much.

297
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:38,794
Thank you!

298
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,881
You got beaten up?
How can you call yourself a man?

299
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,924
Forget it, Uncle.

300
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,175
Is this the place?

301
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,136
-Man…
-Follow me.

302
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,767
Where's Cha Moosik's mother?

303
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,644
Let's eat somewhere.

304
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,729
That's me.

305
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:58,898
Hey, come over here.

306
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,858
-Damn it, come on...
-Come here!

307
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,485
I'm this kid's uncle,

308
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,654
and your brat did this to his face.

309
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,031
What will you do about this?

310
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,409
What? My Moosik did that?

311
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,827
He messed up this handsome face!

312
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,413
So what the hell
are you going to do about it?

313
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:16,707
What is this?

314
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,544
-Hey, are you Cha Moosik?
-Wait, hold on a second.

315
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,879
Moosik.

316
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,715
Did you really do that to him?

317
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,676
Can I have one more
bottle of soju, please?

318
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,429
Tell me!

319
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,139
Over here!

320
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,432
Yes.

321
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:35,059
Let's go.

322
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:37,061
Let's go to the police station!

323
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,228
Mom.

324
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,023
Why'd you do it?

325
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,399
Why are you going around picking fights?

326
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,193
Are you trying to be like your father?

327
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,070
Darn you!

328
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,198
People like you should be sent to prison!

329
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,701
-Jesus Christ.
-What are you doing? You have to come too!

330
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,370
I'm sorry.

331
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,747
Why are you apologizing to me?

332
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,040
Apologize to your friend!

333
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:01,627
Go and apologize!

334
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,345
I'm sorry.

335
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,807
You can hit me until you feel better.

336
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,184
Bullcrap. That's not going to cut it!

337
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,478
What are you doing?

338
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,562
Don't do this, please!

339
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,022
Let go of me!

340
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,567
-Mom!
-I'm fine.

341
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,861
-Shit...
-What are you looking at?

342
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,075
What are you doing?

343
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,077
No, don't do this.

344
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,412
Please don't do this, please!

345
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,205
-No, no! Please stop!
-Shit.

346
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,832
Let go of me!

347
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,083
Stop it, Uncle!

348
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,335
I said I can take care of this myself!

349
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,670
You shut the hell up!

350
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,844
What are you glaring at, you bastard?
I'll cut your eyes out!

351
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,014
The hell?

352
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,019
Who the hell are you
to be beating up my kid?

353
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,146
Huh? Do you belong to a gang?

354
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,024
What? Did I piss you off?

355
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,483
You want to fight?

356
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,860
Let's fight, you scumbag.

357
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,903
Get up.

358
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,905
Yeah.

359
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,742
Come on. Stab me.

360
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:16,910
Stab me, you little punk.

361
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,579
Come on, stab me.

362
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,581
You can't do it?

363
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,041
Loser.

364
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,506
Crazy bastard…

365
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,262
Here. Stab me.

366
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,889
Oh, my god.

367
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,307
Oh, no.

368
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,641
Sorry…

369
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,060
Get lost, asshole!

370
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:46,065
What an idiotic loser.

371
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,613
Hey. Forgot to say hello again?

372
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:55,657
Huh?

373
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,997
I've been all over the place,

374
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,416
so I forgot today was the day.

375
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,834
What?

376
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,337
You're too embarrassed
to come to the prison now?

377
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,880
Not at all.

378
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,882
Wow.

379
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,884
You must have gotten rich…

380
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,520
I swear I'll be more polite from now on.

381
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,021
Okay.

382
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,689
I'm sorry too.

383
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,025
Maybe we can be friends.

384
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,443
Okay.

385
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,487
-Here, smoke one.
-Okay.

386
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,494
Shit, man.

387
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,038
My face is so swollen.

388
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,289
Sorry.

389
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,587
MANILA, THE PHILIPPINES, 2001

390
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,964
Wow.

391
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,924
I never thought I'd see you...

392
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,051
...Daejeon country boys here.

393
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,513
You've grown up.

394
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,598
Right.

395
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,143
I heard you're doing
pretty well nowadays, Moosik.

396
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,312
I knew he'd become successful one day.

397
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,314
Even in high school, he was a big spender.

398
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,066
That's true.

399
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,734
Hey, Moosik.

400
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,029
Remember when we made a mess
at your mom's store?

401
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,657
Of course.

402
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,742
My God. You know, back then,

403
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,871
my uncle was so embarrassing.

404
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,373
Sungil.

405
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,587
It's so great to see you here.

406
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,715
Yeah, it is.

407
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,679
So...

408
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,389
how's your father?

409
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,438
I haven't talked to him in a while.

410
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,860
So, what are you going to do now?

411
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,154
I haven't planned anything out yet.

412
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,947
Dongeok, have you found a place for him?

413
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,992
I said he could stay with me,
but he said he'd be uncomfortable.

414
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,036
I'll just look for a villa.

415
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,246
Well, all right.
That's better than a hotel.

416
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,165
Just get some rest first.

417
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,417
Play some golf and some games.

418
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,836
By the way, what do you do here?

419
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,755
He runs a casino.

420
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,051
I'm just a sales agent.
A marketer who finds customers.

421
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,011
Oh, speaking of,

422
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,596
want to go to Sungil's casino
and play a bit?

423
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,181
Can we go, Sungil?

424
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,140
Sure, let's go.

425
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,434
-Let's go.
-Okay.

426
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,357
Cha Moosik. Born in 1965.
From Yeongju, Gyeongbuk.

427
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,983
Used to be an adjunct instructor
at Chungam University,

428
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,693
then started an English academy
in Tanbang-dong, Daejeon.

429
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,112
There are no records after that.

430
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,573
So there are five casino bars?

431
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,116
Yeah.

432
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,119
Two in Daejeon, one in Jochiwon,
one each in Ansan, and Suwon.

433
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:47,663
But, uh,

434
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,748
they only did cash transactions.
They didn't leave a trace.

435
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:51,208
They didn't use any credit cards, either.

436
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,085
How much are the cash transactions worth?

437
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,462
If you combine them all...

438
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,589
...about 10 to 20 billion won.

439
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,719
Hey, let's just quit our jobs
and open a casino bar too.

440
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,762
Yeah?

441
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,389
What are we even doing this for?

442
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,890
Right?

443
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,684
What about Mr. Cha's family?

444
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,354
He has a wife and a son,
who are currently living in Daejeon.

445
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,940
He also has an apartment
under his wife's name.

446
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,193
Yeah? Are they still there?

447
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,291
This is the best hotel in Manila.

448
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,917
It has the biggest casino, too.

449
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,646
These are all table games.

450
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,398
The machines are on the sides.

451
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,984
They have the same thing
on the other side too.

452
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,819
So everything combined,
it's about 180,000 square feet.

453
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,530
Yes. Come on.

454
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,157
Bet.

455
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,200
Give it to me baby!

456
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,994
Give it to me baby, yeah!

457
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:11,288
He's back again
after losing all his money last time.

458
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:17,711
Hey, Moosik.

459
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,380
So are you going to spend
some money here today?

460
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,843
The real thing is somewhere else.

461
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:25,761
You want to go?

462
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,679
Where?

463
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,306
-Come with me.
-Come on, let's go.

464
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,641
Let's go. Let's go.

465
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,569
The VIP casino. The junket.

466
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,696
The one you just saw
is for the common folk.

467
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,198
What's a junket?

468
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:48,742
It's like they're renting the place,
in a way.

469
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,994
An individual or a company pays the casino

470
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,662
a deposit to run this place.

471
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:56,625
Here in Manila, there are junkets run
by Koreans, the Chinese, and the Japanese.

472
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,335
Hello, sir.

473
00:22:58,919 --> 00:22:59,961
Oh!

474
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,255
Wow, this is...

475
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:06,009
This is the guy that I told you about.
My friend from Korea.

476
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,970
I see. Welcome, I'm Min Seokjun.

477
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,305
I'm Cha Moosik.

478
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,141
This guy right here
is the top guy in Manila.

479
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,184
Number one.

480
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,103
Gosh. I think Sungil is up there too.

481
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,437
He's doing pretty well nowadays.

482
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,563
Oh, come on.

483
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,940
I've still got a long way to go.

484
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:24,903
Mr. Min, are you the person
who runs this place?

485
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:25,821
Oh, no.

486
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,490
I'm just a sales agent
who brings over customers.

487
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,409
The owner of the junket is somebody else.

488
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:33,537
But the owner doesn't really
show his face around here,

489
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,122
so Seokjun is basically the owner.

490
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,625
Take a look.

491
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,961
Do you play any games?

492
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,422
Oh, yeah. I know a little bit of baccarat.

493
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,633
Well, that's good.
I'll take good care of you from now on.

494
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,762
It looks like it's pretty packed
even though it's a weekday.

495
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,723
This place is one of the best
in Manila, after all.

496
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,438
Would you like to play a game?

497
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,898
Well…

498
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,359
Thank you.

499
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,117
Who is it?

500
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:16,163
Hello.
This is Mr. Cha Moosik's house, right?

501
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,122
That's right.

502
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,207
Are you his wife?

503
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,292
Yeah, why?

504
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,212
My name is Kang Minjung.
I'm from the Daejeon Regional Tax Office.

505
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,965
Well, I have a few questions
about your husband.

506
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,758
The tax office?

507
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:29,885
Yes.

508
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,179
Do you mind if I step inside?

509
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,557
My husband's not home right now, though.

510
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:40,479
What taxes did he not pay, exactly?

511
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,357
Your husband

512
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:47,235
was running a gambling den.
You know that, right?

513
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,529
-A gambling den?
-Yes.

514
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,866
There are a lot of additional taxes
we need to collect.

515
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:55,952
If he doesn't pay them, he'll get charged,
and his passport will be canceled.

516
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,621
Then...

517
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,955
...he won't be able to return to Korea.

518
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:04,753
We haven't decided to prosecute him yet,
so please let us talk to him.

519
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,088
If he pays his taxes, there are no issues.

520
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:14,179
Do you happen to know Ahn Chiyoung,
the owner of Greater Electronics?

521
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,557
No.

522
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:18,642
Do you know about the casino bars?

523
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:20,727
Oh...

524
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,021
What is that?

525
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,524
Why did Mr. Cha go to the Philippines?

526
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,608
Does he know somebody there?

527
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,986
Yes. He has a friend
who runs a travel agency there.

528
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,489
Betting.

529
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,163
Player wins, natural nine.

530
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,251
Thank you, nice.

531
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,377
Thank you.

532
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,256
Banker, player, banker.

533
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,204
This way, please.

534
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:24,499
As you can see, the unit I'm showing you
is on this floor.

535
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,876
-Its view, and it's really nice and airy.
-All right.

536
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,878
-Hi.
-Hello.

537
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,258
Let's go inside.

538
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,801
This is a one-bedroom unit.

539
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,845
You have your living room.

540
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,639
You have a small kitchen
with its own equipment.

541
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,349
Knives, forks.

542
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,434
Bathroom.

543
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,144
Here's the bedroom.

544
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:45,979
Bed for two.

545
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,564
Cabinet space.

546
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:50,483
Oh, and it also has a balcony
that you can use.

547
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,574
Moosik.

548
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,826
-What do you think?
-I like it.

549
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,119
-Thank you! Okay.
-Thank you. Thank you.

550
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,329
Okay.

551
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,384
It won't be as comfortable as a hotel.

552
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,054
No, I prefer places like this.

553
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,305
Hotels don't suit me.

554
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,850
I live nearby, so let me know
if you ever need anything.

555
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,437
My wife said she'll pack some food
and side dishes for you.

556
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,689
Just put your laundry
in a corner too, okay?

557
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,108
Dude, I can just do my own laundry.

558
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,318
Okay.

559
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,153
You can wash your underwear and stuff.

560
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,364
But I can get you

561
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,158
clean bedsheets and stuff
once every month.

562
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,494
Thanks, you son of a gun.

563
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,579
Don't say I never did anything for you.

564
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,664
-Okay, you jerk.
-I'm so tired.

565
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,207
Maybe I'll just live here instead.

566
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,042
Oh, this is nice.

567
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,796
-Hey.
-Yeah?

568
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,422
How's life these days?

569
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,009
It's just so-so.

570
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,552
My business is tanking,
which stresses me out,

571
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:01,179
but my wife always whines about money.

572
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,349
And my damn son is pestering me
about wanting to study abroad.

573
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,435
-You said your son plays soccer?
-Yeah.

574
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,646
I think he's got some talent...

575
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:10,772
...but I don't know.

576
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,816
Where does he want to go?

577
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:14,859
Europe, of course. The soccer capital.

578
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,153
South America, you idiot.
Don't you know Ronaldinho?

579
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,655
Of course, it's Europe.
Don't you know Cha Bum?

580
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:19,948
You freaking idiot, come on.

581
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:20,949
You're crazy.

582
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,910
-Cha Bum? Ronaldinho is better.
-Forget it.

583
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,884
That's for you.

584
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,304
-What is it?
-Just open it, man.

585
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,688
Use that money to send your son abroad.

586
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,778
Really?

587
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,281
Idiot. You think I'd lie to you?

588
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:02,449
This is...

589
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,951
Oh, my god.

590
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,996
This is… It's all for me?

591
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,289
Yeah, you idiot.

592
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:12,959
I'm saving your face
so that I can save mine too.

593
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:14,878
You…

594
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:16,796
I...

595
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,091
Thank you so much.

596
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,552
Shit, you're a true friend!
Come here, idiot.

597
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,387
-What's with you?
-You won't regret this.

598
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:25,597
Have you lost your mind?

599
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,016
-Thank you, Moosik!
-Back off, dumbass!

600
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,184
It's already hot enough.

601
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,409
PROMISSORY NOTE

602
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:51,247
Banker is a seven, banker wins.

603
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,134
<i>At first, I was winning
as much as 20 billion won.</i>

604
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,221
<i>But as time went on,
I started losing more than I was winning.</i>

605
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:10,141
<i>The money that I had brought with me
was running out too.</i>

606
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,158
How are things looking?

607
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,121
Depressing.

608
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,501
You know, when things aren't going well,
sometimes you need to let go of it.

609
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:38,628
Mr. Min.

610
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,588
Let me borrow some more money.

611
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,340
Greedy pig.

612
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:44,133
Will you raise your bet?

613
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,885
You've already borrowed 10 million pesos.

614
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,805
I'll pay you back within a month.

615
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,306
How much can I borrow?

616
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,769
I shouldn't let you do this,

617
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,313
but you've spent quite a lot
of money here so far.

618
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,732
So I'll let you have one million pesos.

619
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,323
Thank you.

620
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,579
Hey, Jungpal.

621
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:14,789
Yes, sir.

622
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,835
Give him one million pesos.

623
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,461
And don't add on interest in advance.

624
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,797
Yes, sir.

625
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,301
Wow, Seokjun.

626
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,637
It looks like you're super busy.

627
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,598
I need to talk to you for a second.

628
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:48,448
Seokjun, I have something awesome for you.

629
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,616
What is it?

630
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:50,992
You know Mindong Construction, right?

631
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,535
They've built a bunch of apartment
buildings in Jeolla-do.

632
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,037
Mindoong?

633
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,122
No, Mindong! Mindong! Anyway,

634
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,541
they're a big company. And, uh...

635
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,960
I know the owner's only son pretty well.

636
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,588
I told him to come visit me
in the Philippines sometime,

637
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,505
and he said he would.

638
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,423
And?

639
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,008
Jesus, you're slow.

640
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:09,886
His family is rich! Really rich!

641
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,598
Anyway, I'll take care of it all.

642
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:16,351
You just need to provide lots of dough.

643
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,687
Speaking of that,
give me a present, will you?

644
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,773
Hey, don't be like that.

645
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,232
I'm not doing very well nowadays, either.

646
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,902
What do you mean?
You're the ATM of Manila.

647
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,946
I really don't have any money.
It's all in different places right now.

648
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,155
Really?

649
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,366
You really mean that?

650
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,369
You borrowed one million pesos
from me last time, and didn't pay me back.

651
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,748
I'm going to pay you back.
Did I ever say that I wouldn't?

652
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,917
-Come on.
-Mr. Min!

653
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,336
There you are. I'm so sorry.

654
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,171
Come on, you've got to go
take care of this.

655
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,756
There are a lot of people waiting for you.

656
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:49,050
-For goodness' sake.
-Hey, look.

657
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,803
What do you think you're doing?

658
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,764
Oh, I'm sorry.
We were in the middle of a meeting,

659
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:56,391
and Mr. Min disappeared suddenly.

660
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,642
-Okay.
-Everybody's looking for him.

661
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,268
Sorry.

662
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,562
So I get that you came to get him.

663
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,982
But who are you?

664
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,275
Uh...

665
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,154
Well, I'm a…

666
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,865
Could I borrow a light first,
if you've got one?

667
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,826
Please.

668
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,709
Why, thank you.

669
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,670
Mr. Min and I are...

670
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,589
Uh...

671
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,800
I'll tell you next time.

672
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,301
Sorry.

673
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,555
Is that guy crazy or what?

674
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,184
You should really avoid
people like that if you can.

675
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,440
Thank you.

676
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,693
No problem. I'll get going now.

677
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,081
Hey, Moosik.

678
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,167
Do you want to be
business partners with me?

679
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,126
Sungil.

680
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,586
What?

681
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,671
I think we'd work really well together.

682
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,592
You and I are both good
at the exact same thing.

683
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,427
Partners need to have different talents.

684
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,221
Says who? It's great if we're good
at the same thing, isn't it?

685
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:21,100
If we start working together,
there are bound to be problems.

686
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,311
Jesus, come on.

687
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,437
Sungil!

688
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,522
Hey, Sungil. You're early.

689
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,357
Hey, hey. Say hello.

690
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,818
He's my friend from Korea.

691
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,071
Hello. I'm Lee Sanggu.

692
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,700
He's Korean too.
He's the hardest working guy that I know.

693
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:38,618
Oh, hardly.

694
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:39,952
Hey, did you bring me the thing?

695
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:41,954
Give me my bag, Billy.

696
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,628
It's two million pesos, sir.

697
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,345
Hey, Moosik.

698
00:34:57,887 --> 00:35:01,265
I know that you're good,
but don't borrow any more than that.

699
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,476
If you do, you'll get yourself in trouble.

700
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:05,812
Okay.

701
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:07,647
Sir.

702
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,691
Call me anytime. I'm available 24/7.

703
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,319
Are you a gangster or something?

704
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,987
He just has a lot of gangster friends.

705
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,531
Hey.

706
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,907
Be polite to him, okay?

707
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,742
Back in Korea,
he was a really important man.

708
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,620
Sir, I look forward to working with you.

709
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,207
-I'll get going now, Sungil.
-All right, bye.

710
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,333
I'll see you next time.

711
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,043
I'll call you.

712
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:34,590
Hey.

713
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,136
I bet you're thinking he's just a lackey.

714
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,764
Like you can borrow from him
and never pay him back.

715
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,518
Let me tell you just one thing.

716
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,937
You're in the Philippines.

717
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,522
Don't underestimate him.

718
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,440
You can keep the change.

719
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,525
Good.

720
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,434
<i>When I was in Korea, I thought
that I had gotten the hang of things.</i>

721
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,353
<i>But I was losing money left and right.</i>

722
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:38,779
<i>Eighteen billion won.</i>

723
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,992
<i>I worked so hard to save it up.</i>

724
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:46,537
<i>But I freaking lost it all
in less than three months.</i>

725
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:22,406
Dongeok?

726
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,368
Goodness, welcome back.

727
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,414
You look so cool now.

728
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,166
You look all fancy.

729
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,546
You make the clothes look even nicer
because you have a good figure.

730
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,798
Yeah, right.

731
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,675
I'm guessing your travel agency did well?

732
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,594
Travel agency, my ass.
I did find some sucker, though.

733
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,096
A sucker?

734
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,765
I'm planning on taking all his money.

735
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:52,186
There's this really nice guy

736
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,522
who used to do everything
that I told him to do.

737
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,149
A nice freaking guy.

738
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:58,943
Do you have it?

739
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,069
Oh.

740
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,702
You see, this stuff is from Myanmar.

741
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,162
Europeans go crazy for it.

742
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,297
I've repaid all my debt now.

743
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,340
Right?

744
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:27,638
Thank you.

745
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,599
Jeez, you're such a snake.

746
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,520
Have you eaten yet?

747
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:35,980
Yeah, I have.

748
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,773
-Let's go have some tea, then.
-Sure.

749
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:38,899
Shit.

750
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,172
Hello?

751
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,924
<i>You never pick up, do you?
Is this Cha Moosik?</i>

752
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,551
Yeah. Who are you?

753
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,180
I'm Kang Minjung
from the Daejeon Regional Tax Office.

754
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,850
<i>We've actually talked on the phone before.
It was before you left the country.</i>

755
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,687
I'm calling you because
you have some unpaid taxes.

756
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:20,816
It's related to the arcade
and the casino bar you used to run.

757
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,069
<i>When can you come back to Korea?</i>

758
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,447
Why should I go back?

759
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,533
You have a lot of additional taxes to pay.

760
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,203
<i>But you won't pay them
even if we charge you.</i>

761
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,871
I'm...

762
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:36,540
I'm a bit busy over here.

763
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,877
If this isn't taken care of,
you'll be prosecuted.

764
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,587
<i>Then you won't be able
to come back to Korea.</i>

765
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:43,714
<i>Even if you're busy,</i>

766
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,883
<i>you need to come here
and reach an agreement with us.</i>

767
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:50,721
Are you going to rescind my passport
if I don't go over there or something?

768
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,307
Yes, and it won't stop at that.

769
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,643
You'll be wanted by Interpol.

770
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:02,233
Your wife seemed like a nice person.

771
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,693
You have a son too.

772
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,905
<i>Do you plan on ever seeing them again?</i>

773
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,496
God damn it.

774
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,760
Hi, honey. It's me.

775
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,555
Did somebody from the NTS
come to talk to you?

776
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:33,639
Yeah.

777
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,558
Who is she?

778
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:36,600
<i>A woman?</i>

779
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,018
Yeah.

780
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,687
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

781
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,064
Honey.

782
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:45,151
Why don't you just move to the Philippines
with Byungkyu?

783
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,902
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

784
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,279
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

785
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:51,031
Don't you want our family to be together?

786
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,869
Just leave everything in Korea
and come over here.

787
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,204
I'll have somebody take care
of the apartment.

788
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,289
Dear.

789
00:40:58,706 --> 00:40:59,623
<i>Yeah.</i>

790
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,584
Nothing's going on, right?

791
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:05,504
Of course. Everything's going just fine.

792
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,173
Yeah. Don't worry.

793
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:09,842
Okay, I'm hanging up.

794
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,512
<i>Even at that moment...</i>

795
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,932
<i>I was thinking about selling the apartment
so that I could gamble more.</i>

796
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:23,147
The defendant, Ahn Chiyoung,

797
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:27,151
shall be sentenced to five years in prison
and a fine of 500 million won,

798
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,737
Any accounts, movables, and real estate

799
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,115
belonging to the defendant and
his immediate family shall be confiscated.

800
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,577
If the fine and surcharge are not paid,

801
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,206
every 100 thousand won
of the combined fine and surcharge

802
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,708
shall be converted into one day
of detainment in a labor camp.

803
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,753
JUDGE

804
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:50,508
Oh, no. What do I do?

805
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,645
VISITATION ROOM

806
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,273
Thank you
for letting us visit you.

807
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:11,028
You're angry, aren't you?
I mean, you shouldered all the blame.

808
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,617
Just let us get Cha Moosik's taxes.

809
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,702
Then I'll reduce the surcharge for you.

810
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:24,416
You're not being loyal
by shouldering all the blame.

811
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,795
He'll be on the run his entire life.
Don't you feel sorry for him?

812
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,880
Wait, what do you mean by that?

813
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,424
Why should I feel sorry for him?

814
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:35,386
-I thought he was a dear friend.
-I don't like how you're talking to me.

815
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:36,387
Oh, come on.

816
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,348
So, just be honest with us, will you?

817
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,767
How was everything run anyway?

818
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:45,229
Well, what kind of information
do you want from me?

819
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:50,401
I want to know how
the two of you split the profits

820
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,987
between yourselves, okay?
And the roles that you played.

821
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,864
I also want to know
how much money Cha Moosik made.

822
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,992
Why are you doing all this?

823
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:02,788
Do you receive any benefits
for collecting more taxes?

824
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,749
Of course not.

825
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,918
I wish there were, though.

826
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,169
-Hey!
-Yes?

827
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,255
Why don't we have something
like that in Korea?

828
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,048
If there were,
I would work so much harder.

829
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:14,967
That's what I'm saying.

830
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,386
Why don't you just relax a bit?

831
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,930
Don't be like that.
Let's just wrap this up, okay?

832
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:23,100
Man, you guys are persistent.

833
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,519
You guys would put loan sharks to shame.
Seriously.

834
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,521
You're even worse than loan sharks.

835
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,442
My God, why are there so many?

836
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,986
Hey,
that looks delicious. Get it to the table.

837
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,281
All right, I hope you have a blast.

838
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,159
All right!

839
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:41,994
I got it!

840
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:44,788
That's it, that's it! Nice!

841
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,373
That's what I'm talking about!

842
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,294
Hey, miss!

843
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:51,503
I need some beer.

844
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,845
How many?

845
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,941
Hey! It's great to finally
meet you in person.

846
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,735
-Congratulations.
-Hello.

847
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,112
-Congratulations.
-This is nice.

848
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:20,532
Hey, hold on.
I have something to talk to you about.

849
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,868
-Wait, I want to play one game.
-But it's too loud in here.

850
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,912
-Let's step outside for a minute.
-See you soon.

851
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,747
We'll come back inside after we talk.

852
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:28,457
Hey, Moosik!

853
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:31,502
You're going to hurt your hand.
We're not admitting you here, okay?

854
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,879
-You're going to break your hand!
-Please, Moosik!

855
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,174
Moosik. Open the door!

856
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:39,927
Hey.

857
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,347
Didn't I tell you not to let them in?

858
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,891
-Didn't I?
-I won't let them in, Moosik.

859
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:48,477
But isn't it a good thing
to have more customers?

860
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:50,020
Hey, dumbass.

861
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:53,148
Do you think this place
is some neighborhood convenience store?

862
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,441
Huh?

863
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,529
What if they come in here
and pick a fight with other customers?

864
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:00,948
We'd be screwed.

865
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,409
This place is for smart people

866
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:06,412
like directors of academies, heads
of hospitals, and college professors.

867
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:10,332
We make money off of nerds like them.
Okay?

868
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,877
If people like them start coming in here,

869
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,004
people will start
associating them with us.

870
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,341
Remember that.

871
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,509
Okay. I will.

872
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:21,760
Idiot.

873
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,512
It's all business.

874
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:25,013
Business.

875
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,056
Moosik!

876
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,318
This is insane.

877
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,028
We're giving back 10%
of the money they lost,

878
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,072
and yet we're making ten times more
than the arcade.

879
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,534
There are a lot of insane things
out there in the world.

880
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:47,745
Hey.

881
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:50,289
-This is the only thing that we can do.
-Yeah, I agree.

882
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,167
-So let's open a few more.
-A few more?

883
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:54,501
Just think about it.

884
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:55,627
All right.

885
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:01,592
So, we had the dealers stay
in the rooftop apartment

886
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:05,804
and made them work 12-hour shifts a day.
And we made 10 billion won

887
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:07,598
in six months.

888
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:10,350
But when word got around
that we were raking in a ton of money,

889
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,727
gangsters started showing up.

890
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,981
Good work. Come inside.

891
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,151
Good work.

892
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,951
Take a seat over here.

893
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:35,959
Tell me. What is it?

894
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:37,920
What did you want to talk about?

895
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:40,672
Huh?

896
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:42,925
What are you pouting about?

897
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:49,139
Come on, tell me.

898
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:55,521
Hey, you know,

899
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:59,316
I've always thought of you guys
as part of the family.

900
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,985
And that hasn't changed, all right?

901
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,988
But Chiyoung's always
the only one with good ideas,

902
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,991
and I'm Chiyoung's business partner.

903
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:12,412
Then I don't really have a reason
to keep working with you.

904
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,206
Am I right or what?

905
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,124
It's about Sangchul, not Chiyoung.

906
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:17,668
He's our friend too.

907
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,045
But it feels like
you're favoring him over us.

908
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:22,464
What about Sangchul?

909
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,174
Are you talking about the car
that I bought him?

910
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:29,137
Sangchul is running a casino,

911
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:30,848
but we don't have anything like that.

912
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:40,274
Man, you guys are really cute.

913
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:42,776
Okay, fine.

914
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:45,612
You got the money?

915
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,155
What?

916
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,992
I'll let you guys have something too.
Do you have the money for that?

917
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:52,327
How much?

918
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:55,747
You can just give me the amount
I spent to set this place up.

919
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,040
So just this much.

920
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:58,625
Five hundred million?

921
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,378
Five billion?

922
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:03,255
Hey.

923
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:07,676
It cost me 50 million won
to set up one casino.

924
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,596
I spent exactly 50 million won
on facility fees and entitlement fees,

925
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:11,889
so just give me 50 million won.

926
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:15,684
Moosik! Are you serious?

927
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:20,272
Just get me the money,
and I'll give you guys the same share too.

928
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:21,273
Thank you, Moosik.

929
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:22,566
Thank you.

930
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:25,569
Also, you guys can be joint managers.

931
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:26,904
Yes, sir.

932
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,656
But remember this.

933
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,034
If you want to be joint managers,

934
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,828
don't let any gangsters
into this place, okay?

935
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:35,829
-Okay.
-Of course not.

936
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,331
Look, this place is

937
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,000
for the kinds of guys who wear ties
and act all fancy, okay?

938
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,920
This is the kind of place where
those people hang out and play cards.

939
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:47,299
If those gangsters with tattoos
start coming here, you're screwed.

940
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:48,592
Okay?

941
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,218
-Okay.
-Okay.

942
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,511
What will you be?

943
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,680
-Screwed!
-Screwed!

944
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:54,681
That's right.

945
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:58,018
But I don't think you guys can manage it.

946
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,145
You'll just let anybody
in here to make money

947
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:03,649
and let those gangsters in here too.
And this place will become a total mess.

948
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,359
That won't happen. We'll work really hard.

949
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:07,027
-We'll do our best.
-We'll do our best.

950
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,904
We'll do our best.

951
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,740
Now you're all excited.

952
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:15,285
This is great, isn't it?

953
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:18,580
He took only the amount
he'd initially spent and gave it away.

954
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:25,087
So that's how Moosik earned some trust
from the gangsters.

955
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:29,257
"Moosik is not somebody
who cheats his friends."

956
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,217
That was his image.

957
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,844
Is Cha Moosik a gangster?

958
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,054
No.

959
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,555
Then why did those gangsters
seek him out?

960
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,057
Because he knows people nationwide.

961
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,934
So he's a gangster.

962
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:43,188
You clearly don't get how someone
becomes influential nationwide.

963
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:44,856
Huh?

964
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,776
You don't become like him because
you're the best fighter in the country.

965
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:49,736
Okay? To become like him,

966
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:54,533
you need to pay the most
congratulatory money for marriages.

967
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:55,993
Congratulatory money?

968
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,120
Gangsters will call you

969
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:00,664
even when their cousin thrice removed
is getting married.

970
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:05,043
"Sir, my nephew is getting married.
Can you come to the wedding?"

971
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,546
Then you send the money and some flowers,

972
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,381
even if you can't make it to the wedding.

973
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:11,675
If you do that for everybody,
you'll become acquainted

974
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,385
with people all over the country.

975
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,222
And that is what Moosik did.

976
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,266
Then,

977
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,351
exactly how much money did he make?

978
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:24,521
He made about six, seven billion won
from the machines.

979
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,774
He made around that much
from the casinos too.

980
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,235
So, around 15 to 20 billion won.

981
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,031
Then where did he keep all that money?

982
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,283
If he didn't put it in a bank,
and it was all in cash,

983
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,784
it must've been a staggering amount.

984
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,131
CONTRACT FOR ESTABLISHING
COLLATERAL SECURITY RIGHT

985
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,885
<i>I ended up losing the apartment
in Daejeon too. My last property.</i>

986
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:00,807
<i>Fuck, I should just die.</i>

987
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,101
<i>What's the point of living?</i>

988
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,831
<i>Your father's
in critical condition.</i>

989
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,000
<i>The hospital's already given up on him.</i>

990
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:30,879
<i>Your mother and I have been
taking turns staying with him.</i>

991
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,256
I think you should come see him, too.

992
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,174
<i>Hey.</i>

993
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:36,760
Why should I go see that man?

994
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,929
<i>You should at least be here
for his funeral.</i>

995
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:41,681
You're his only child.

996
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,935
Okay. Let's talk about this later.

997
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:55,779
Hey, Jonghyun.

998
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:57,322
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

999
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:58,949
They're not prosecuting you right now.

1000
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:02,661
Really? Then, can I go back to Korea now?

1001
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:04,579
<i>Of course you can.</i>

1002
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,706
Hey,

1003
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,834
what if I go to Korea
and get screwed over?

1004
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,586
<i>That probably won't happen. Hey!</i>

1005
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,131
Your only issue has to do with your taxes,
so just call the NTS.

1006
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:17,092
I mean, what are they going to do
if you promise them that you'll pay?

1007
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,803
<i>Hey, by the way,</i>

1008
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:22,055
I heard that you got totally screwed over.

1009
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,890
<i>I heard you lost all your money
at a casino.</i>

1010
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,560
Hey, man. What are you talking about?

1011
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,478
Who told you that bullcrap? Who was it?

1012
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:31,022
Hey, no big deal if it's not true.
No need to get mad.

1013
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:33,692
Just tell me when you're coming.
I'll meet you at the airport.

1014
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:44,369
Who is it?

1015
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,330
Sorry to disturb you at such a late hour.

1016
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:49,708
What is it?

1017
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:54,254
I was in the area,
so I just wanted to say hello.

1018
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:55,672
These are my friends.

1019
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,007
Come say hello.

1020
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,636
Can we come inside and talk for a bit?

1021
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,221
Whoa, whoa.

1022
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,436
What do you think you're doing?

1023
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,437
Oh!

1024
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:15,025
I heard that you gambled
all your money away.

1025
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,568
I dropped by because I was worried.

1026
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,447
You freaking bastard.

1027
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,573
Hey, you.

1028
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,701
So you're here to intimidate me
because you think

1029
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,536
I'll run away without paying you back?

1030
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:32,417
Hey, Sanggu.

1031
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:36,379
I'm going to pay you back.
With interest too.

1032
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:37,923
Moosik.

1033
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:42,219
You know, that money
is very important to me.

1034
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,346
Of course you need to pay me back.

1035
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,932
Do you really think you can handle me?

1036
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:50,769
Yes.
