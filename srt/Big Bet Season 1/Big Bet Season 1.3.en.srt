1
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,302
Sorry to disturb you at such a late hour.

2
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,513
What is it?

3
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:18,059
Oh, I was nearby,
and I just wanted to say hello.

4
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:19,602
SANGGU: These are my friends.

5
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,854
(in Tagalog)
Come say hello.

6
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,442
(in Korean)
Can we come inside and talk for a bit?

7
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,902
Whoa, whoa.

8
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:28,862
(door slams)

9
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,697
(dog barking in distance)

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,781
(angrily)
What do you think you're doing?

11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:32,782
Oh!

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,704
I heard that you lost all your money
while gambling.

13
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,039
I was so worried, so I decided to drop by.

14
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,085
You fucking asshole. Hey!

15
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,170
(angry breathing)

16
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:46,963
So you're here to intimidate me

17
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,007
because you think I'll run away
without paying you back?

18
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:52,552
(sighs)

19
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,721
Hey, Sanggu.

20
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,599
Hey. Do you really think
that you'll get away with this?

21
00:00:58,516 --> 00:00:59,559
Moosik.

22
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,688
You know, that money
is very important to me.

23
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:05,648
Of course, you need to pay me back.

24
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,275
I'll pay you back!

25
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,236
I'll pay you back.
I'll pay you the interest, too.

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,404
But...

27
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,825
think twice before messing with me.

28
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,327
Okay?

29
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,914
You asshole. I said that I'd pay you back,
so I'll pay you back.

30
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay?

31
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:25,835
(in a half-hearted tone)
Sure.

32
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,420
(dog barking in distance)

33
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:30,799
(in Tagalog)
Lower the gun.

34
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:31,841
(annoyed sigh)

35
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,551

36
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,012
(sighs lightly)

37
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,097
(in Korean)
I'll get going, then.

38
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,644
(thunder rumbling)

39
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:46,981

41
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,751
(gunshot)

42
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,088
BIG BET

43
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,718
THE TEN-YEAR DEBT

44
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,682
(sighs)

45
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,398
(smacks lips)

46
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,108
SEOKJUN: You seem like

47
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,319
you've got a lot on your mind today.

48
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,778
(sighs lightly)

49
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,071
(loud indistinct talking)

50
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,031
Yeah.

51
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,073
(inhales)

52
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,366
(sighs)

53
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,662
You know, when I started making money,
it wasn't really planned out.

54
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,665
(smacks lips)
Well, now I've lost it all.

55
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,626
Feels pretty awful, doesn't it?

56
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,752
(disbelieving laughter)

57
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,711
(inhales)

58
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,213
Yeah. Really awful.

59
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,215
What are you planning on doing now?

60
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,218
Well, since I'm penniless now,

61
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,470
I'll just have to look
for something else to do.

62
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,681
I mean...
(sighs, smacks lips)

63
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,017
...I'm pretty good
at starting from scratch.

64
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:50,146
(breathes deeply)

65
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,356
(smacks lips)

66
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,150
In that case,

67
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,152
do you want to be my business partner?

68
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,281
(sighs)

69
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,116
(smacks lips)
Don't worry.

70
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,536
I won't ask you to pay me.

71
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:07,997
(inhales)

72
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,208
I've been watching you for a while now,

73
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,752
and you seem like a very firm man.

74
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,422
You know, I've never been business
partners with anybody before.

75
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,632
(inhales sharply through teeth)

76
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,841
But...

77
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,887
I think that I could work with you.

78
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,430
(smacks lips)

79
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,517
Thank you for thinking so highly of me.

80
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,811
I've been acting so arrogantly
all this time

81
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,187
because I had some money in my pockets.

82
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:35,191
(breathes deeply)

83
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,988
You know, you can start speaking
more casually to me now.

84
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,197
You're older than me after all.

85
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,491
(laughing)

86
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,534
If you say so.

87
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,743
Thank you, Mr. Min.

88
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:50,039
I promise you that no matter what
I have to do, I'll give it my all.

89
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:50,999
(smacks lips)

90
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,125
All right.

91
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,876
That makes me feel a lot better.

92
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,422
(Seokjun laughing)

93
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:58,673

Fuck, that's awesome.

101
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,859
(sniffs, smacks lips)
Yeah?

102
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,110

103

(clears throat, sniffs)

104
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:22,864
Dongeok.

105
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,200
What did your friend do in Korea?

106
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,494
-Who? Moosik?
-Yeah.

107
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,579
He was in the HID.

108
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,663
He used to be one of those agents
that they send to North Korea.

109
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,790
Wow, he was an agent?

110
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,210
I'm pretty sure he went
to North Korea a couple of times.

111
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,671
(smacks lips)

112
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,256
Dongeok.

113
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,552
Didn't you say
that he used to operate an arcade?

114
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,263
Yeah. He made
a shit-ton of money doing that.

115
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,349
It all fell apart, though.
(laughs)

116
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,309
(laughs in disbelief)
Hey.

117
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,728
Fuck, he's just another lackey
of mine anyway.

118

-What?
-No, nothing.

123

Hey!

124
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,906
-Give me another one of those.
-I think you should stop, Dongeok.

125
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,700
You fucker! Who do you think you are?

126
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,453
Hey!

127
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,164
You think I'm an idiot? Huh?

128
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,918
You might die.

129

You fucking druggie.

(disbelieving laughter)

131
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,964
I told you to give me more,
so give it to me.

132
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,549
Give me all of them! Fuck!

(sighs lightly)

134
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,056
Fuck.

135
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,892
Don't you know how to respect your elders?

Hey, what's up with your face?

140

Are you sick or something?

141

No.

142
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,701
Don't give me that.
Your dark circles look like mascara.

143
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,162
What?

144
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,790
Hey, if you're not feeling well,
go to the hospital.

145

How are the side dishes?

All right. Don't worry about it, then.

171
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,433
JONGHYUN: I looked into it,
and the NTS was hell-bent

172
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,685
on getting some information
about you guys.

173
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,562
Your operation was pretty big, you know?

174
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,022
Apparently, the director
of Bureau 4 used to work

175
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,482
at the NTS branch in Seoul or something.

176
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,401
Ever since he came down here,
he's been anxious to show some results.

177
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,654
Hey, you know their female team leader?
What's up with her?

178
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,198
She's always calling me,
trying to intimidate me.

179
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,115
(Jonghyun laughs)

180
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,160
She's really something else.
See, I called her this one time.

181
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,454
Dude, she's a bitch. A bitch.
She's a huge bitch.

182
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:19,749
I hope that I don't have to talk
with that crazy bitch ever again.

183
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,793
Moosik, don't try to fight them.

184
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,296
If the NTS really starts tearing into you,
there's no way to escape that.

185
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,590
You can either go to prison
or pay your taxes.

186
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,843
Wait, hold on.
Why haven't they prosecuted you yet?

187
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,346
It's probably not that easy
for them to prosecute.

188
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,806
Hey, by the way,
what is Chiyoung's sentence?

189
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,059
(laughs)
Shit, he's so fucked.

190
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:38,976
(inhales)

191
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,523
He got five years in prison
and a surcharge of 45 billion won.

192
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,193
Wow, so he's screwed.

193
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,820
So don't try to fight them.
If you do, you'll get screwed over too.

194
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,406
Just plead with them and say that
you don't have any money, okay?

195
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,783
I talked to a tax accountant,

196
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,451
and he said that they might reduce
your charges if you play nice.

197
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,036
Okay? You can't get away
with not paying them.

198
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,247
So just beg.
Ask them to reduce your taxes. Fuck.

199
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,123
Okay? "Please reduce my taxes."

Hey, you should go home now.

331
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,119
-Okay.
-By the way, how did you get here?

332
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,078
I walked.

333
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:32,788
What? You walked all the way over here
from Daejeon?

334
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,623
Yeah. It didn't take that long.

335
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,001
What are you talking about?
It takes an hour even when you're driving.

336
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,295
Well, I just walked along
the train tracks.

337
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,130
It didn't take that long.
(inhales)

338
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,508
(in a surprised tone)
Oh, uh, Mr. So, I'm going home now.

339
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,927
(teen Moosik breathes hurriedly)

340
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,512
(door opens)

341
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,097
JINSEOK: Hey, Moosik.

342
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,017
(breathes rapidly)

343
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,852
(smacks lips, inhales)

344
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:59,023
You're smart enough for college.
So study, and go to college.

345
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,901
I'm not interested in college.

346
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,611
Uh, I'm going to go to Saudi Arabia
and make some money.

347
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,404
You don't know what the world is like yet.

348
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,573
(coughing)

349
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,451
(inhales)
Is your mother doing well?

350
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:11,911
Yeah.

351
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:12,870
JINSEOK: All right.

352
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,748
You should go to college.
You'll make your mother happy. Okay?

353
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,124
You need to study.

354
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,417
(teen Moosik sighs)

355
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,335
TEEN MOOSIK: Mr. So.

356
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,087
(smacks lips)
I'm not in a situation to go to college.

357
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,382
You must know this too
since you visited my place,

358
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,677
but I can't study there.

359
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,887
Then go study in a study room.

360
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,349
If you just try hard enough,
then you can do anything.

361
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:35,768
(in a half-hearted tone)
Sure.

362
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,686
Hey.
(coughs)

363
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,732
Take this.

364
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,944
(Jinseok inhales)

365
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,863
Study hard, and dream bigger.

366
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,326
You're definitely talented enough
for that, all right?

367
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,538
(dramatic music)

368
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,708
(teen Moosik exhales)

369
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,585
(teen Moosik sighs)

370
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,587
(teen Moosik breathes out)

371
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,760
(teen Moosik exhales deeply)

372
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,642
MOOSIK: <i>There was 100 thousand won
in the envelope.</i>

373
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:17,851
(breathing shakily)

374
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,813
<i>Back then, Mr. So's monthly paycheck
was 200 thousand won.</i>

375
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,356
(exhales deeply)

376
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,274
<i>Why did he do that for somebody like me?</i>

377

(smacks lips, inhales)

(Kyungduk grunts angrily)

381
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,007
Hey, you bitch!

382
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,010
Where did you get the money
to buy this with?

383
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,386
-(surprised breathing)
-Hey!

384
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,512
Kyungduk.

385
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,723
(in a shaky voice)
Please, please don't take this.

386
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,349
Not this one.

387
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,642
(angrily)
Don't take this, my ass!

388

-(screams)
-(grunts)

389
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,855
Hey, give it here.
Give it here. Give it to me!

390
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,023
(Sukja grunts)

391
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,274
SUKJA: No! Don't!

392
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,650
-KYUNGDUK: Give it to me!
-(Sukja shouts)

393
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:07,735
Kyungduk.
(breathing heavily)

394
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,279
SUKJA: I bought this for Moosik!

395
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,364
I'm going to give it to him
when he's older!

396
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,949
You fucking bitch!

397
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,492
We don't even have the money
for food right now.

398
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,620
You're dead. Come here!

399
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,414
-(Sukja crying)
-(huffing angrily)

400

-Hey, come here!
-(huffing angrily)

401
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,626
Stop it! Stop hitting Mom!
(breathing heavily)

402
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,128
Wow. You son of a bitch!

403
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,212
(Sukja grunts)

404
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,922
Hey, you little piece of shit.

405
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,550
-Come over here.
-Stop it, you fucking bastard!

406
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,468
Come here!

407
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,679
If you touch Mom again,
I'm going to kill you.

408
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,972
What are you doing?

409
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,850
-(breathing heavily)
-Moosik, it's my fault.

410
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,977
Come here. Come right here.

411
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:42,936
-(teen Moosik huffing angrily)
-(Sukja sniffles)

412
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,772
Come here, you little shit!

413
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:46,899
(door creaks close)

414
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:47,983
(clatters)

415
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:49,443
(sighs)

416
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,821
(in a strained voice)
Come here.

417
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,740
That son of a bitch.

418
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,158
(sighs)

419
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,369
YEONGSEOK: Shouldn't I have gotten
the call first? What the hell is this?

420
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,622
Did I really have to hear about
this from somebody else?

421
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,624
I'm still the eldest son, aren't I?

422
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,126
How was I supposed to know
your phone number?

423
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,630
You know Yeongsuk's number, don't you?
You could have asked her.

424
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,758
You didn't even try to look into it.

425
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,093
(sighs lightly)

426
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,220
YEONGSEOK: Hey, are you Moosik?

427
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:18,764
My name is Yeongseok.
I'm your older brother.

428
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,767
I've heard a lot about you from Father.

429
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,560
What older brother?

430
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,521
(inhales)

431
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,523
We have different mothers.

432
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,317
Father probably never told you about it.

433
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,486
-(deep breathing)
-You know how he was, right?

434
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,532
So what?

435
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,158
(in a surprised tone)
Huh?

436
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,410
What do you want me to do about it,
you fucking asshole?

437
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,329
Wow, look at you. Where are your manners?
You're talking to your older brother here.

438
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,247
Older brother?

439
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,040
Fuck, I don't remember having
a brother like you!

440
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,959
Hey, if you're hungry, just go
and stuff your face.

441
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,001
Get out.

442
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,964
Hey, don't be stubborn.
Leave while you still can, all right?

443
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,048
(in a small voice)
Honey.

444
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,468
Fucking bastard! He's still giving me
trouble even after he's dead!

445
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,469
(grunts in frustration)

446
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,387
Fuck!

447
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,847
(annoyed breathing)

448
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,014
(in a small voice)
Calm down.

Wow! H-He's a piece of work!
He's a real piece of work!

453
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,024
I'm going to... Damn it!

454
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,609
(gulps)

455
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,073
(sighs)

456
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,828
Do you have any cigarettes?

457

CEO KIM JAEYEONG

461
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,654
(smacks lips, breathing tensely)

462
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,657
What? A surcharge of 8 billion won?

463
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,160
Your friend got charged
with 45 billion won.

464
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,536
You're not paying that much.

465
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,414
Hey, you shouldn't be
comparing me with him.

466
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,750
Look, I never made that kind of money.

467
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,919
That surcharge doesn't take
the gaming machines into account.

468
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:16,298
Look, the casino bar that you operated
got more than 30 billion won in sales.

469
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,092
What exactly makes you say
that I got 30 billion won in sales?

470
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,802
Oh, well.

471
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,222
I just did a lot of research.

472
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,725
Your personal income alone
was well over 20 billion won.

473
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,685
I didn't make that much money.

474
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:29,603
(sighs lightly)

475
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,481
And I really don't have a lot
of money right now.

476
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,400
MOOSIK: I've given it away. All of it.

477
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:36,526
(sighs lightly)

478
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,530
You changed all the cash to certificates
of deposit and bearer bonds, didn't you?

479
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,782
Who, me?

480
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,909
Yes, you.

481
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,703
How on earth would I have changed that?
Where could I have done it?

482
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,998
Well, you probably changed it at the place
where you conducted your business.

483
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,502
And where would that be?

484
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,587
(inhales)

485
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,757
You probably know that better than me.

486
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,262
(sighs)

487
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:04,763
(inhales)

488
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,432
We're being nice with the 8 billion won.

489
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,726
The 20 billion won is based
on the very minimum amount of profit.

490
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,561
I keep telling you,
I never made that much money.

491
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,855
And, if I'm being honest,

492
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,191
I just did everything
that Chiyoung told me to do.

493
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,609
I liked the plans that he had.

494
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,610
(inhales)

495
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,447
If you keep playing dumb,

496
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,075
then we'll have no choice
but to formally file a lawsuit.

497
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:25,993

Ms. Kang.
(smacks lips)

500
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,497
Why are you doing this? Huh?

501
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,250
I mean, I'm just saying this
because you apparently did some research.

502
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,877
So I don't know why you didn't look
into the other stuff.

503
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,798
I've been giving out donations
for our society,

504
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,175
and I've been helping some people
who are not so well off.

505
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,511
Just ask my acquaintances. They all know.

506
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,597
(sniffs)

507
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:51,893
Your wife seems like
a very innocent woman,

508
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,061
don't you think?

509
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,896
(deep breathing)

510
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,648
(sighs)

511
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,568
Could you please stop going
to my family's apartment?

512
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,777
Just talk to me.

513
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,612
I saw that you sold your apartment
in a hurry.

514
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,780
Are you going to the Philippines?

515
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:04,698
Yeah.

516
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,242
I'm going to live with my family now.

517
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,202
So, you're not coming back?

518
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,120
MOOSIK: That...

519
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:13,373
would depend on how you treat me.

520
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:17,127
I'm not saying
that I'm not going to pay my taxes, okay?

521
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,670
I'm just asking you to reduce it
by a little bit.

522
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,465
I really can't pay that money right now.

523
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:25,052
If you keep telling me to pay that money,
then I can't come back to Korea.

524
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,264
Fine, then.

525
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,940
Honestly, I can't even pay that much.

526
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:43,111
But if you keep doing this,
then I guess I'll just have to go to jail.

527
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:46,073
Right? I'll just go to jail.
There's nothing else that I can do.

528
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,240
(frustrated sigh)

529
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,575
(inhales)

530
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:49,659
Please.

531
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:50,702
(smacks lips)

532
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,913
Please help me out with this. Yeah?

533
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,499
If you reduce the amount
by just a little bit,

534
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,042
I'll try my hardest to pay you.

535
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:58,543
(thoughtful breathing)

I took 80 percent off.

539
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,977
You've got to pay this much
at the very least.

540
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,687
(angrily)
Come on. You can pay this much, right?

541
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,022
-(Moosik sighs)
-Right?

542
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:20,941
Don't do this.

543
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,902
Please reduce it by 90 percent.

544
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,445

I'm begging you.

550
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,540
Please trust me, okay?

551
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,419
I can beg on my knees if you want.

552
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,461
(sighs)

553
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,422
Please just trust me this once! Please!

Please have some mercy.

Minjeong, why did you reduce it

568
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,040
(smacks lips)
We don't have enough data,

and if this turns into a lawsuit,
we won't have a good chance to win.

570
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,502
It's better to just reduce the fines

571
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,129
and get a portion
of what we were supposed to get.

Yeah.

I'm telling you this because
you're somebody who does business, okay?

Here's the thing about doing business.

You shouldn't be using guns for it.
It's all about trust.

So, from now on, don't act so arrogant

Yeah. I felt uneasy about that, too.

(inhales)
Let's talk business.

601
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,589
By the way, do you only deal with money?

602
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:54,010
Well, I'm an expert
at doing money transfers.

603
00:25:54,094 --> 00:26:00,183
I launder the money that's moving
in-between the casino and Korea

604
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:03,061
and move it around a couple of times
so that everything's nice and clean.

605
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:04,646
In that case,

606
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,191
do you want to work with me on something?

607
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,192

W-What is it?

609
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:14,364
I'm going to run a junket,
so there will be a lot of money transfers.

610
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:16,324
Well, where are you going to do them?

611

Have you been friends with Dongeok
for a very long time?

631
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:23,308
Of course. He's my best friend.

632
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,976
We've been friends since high school.

633
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,022
You should distance yourself from him.

634
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:31,900
What?

635
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,611
Dongeok doesn't think of you as a friend.

636
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:37,906
He said, "Moosik, that sucker."

637
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,533
"He's a dumbass. I have him
in the palm of my hand.

638
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,951
I'm just taking all his money."

639
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,287
"He'll be penniless soon enough."

640
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,623
That's what he goes around
telling everyone.

641
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:51,461
Even to me, he said, "Get Moosik's money
before he runs away to Korea."

642
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,714
That's why I went to you
with my boys back then.

643

(sighs lightly)

652
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,657
Hey, you son of a bitch!

653
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,702
Are you trying to drive us apart?

654
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,912
Dongeok is my friend.

655
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,373
You've worked with him, right?

656
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,208
Haven't you?

657
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:32,877
I have.

658
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,629
So, how come you're calling
a business partner "a piece of garbage"?

659
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:35,755
You know how that makes you look?

660
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,300
Don't do that.

661
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,637
And if you tell me
something like that again,

662
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,055
I'll rip your mouth open from ear to ear.

663
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,892
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
You can go.

664
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:52,772
(Moosik sighs)

665
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,482
I'll be going now, then.

666
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,991
(breathes in frustration)

Hey, it's me.

671
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,489
(Dongeok sniffs)

672

(sighs deeply)

679
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,253
Dongeok.

680
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,547
(munches)

681
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,841
Now that I think about it...

682
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,551
(inhales)

683
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:07,514
I came to the Philippines
because I'm friends with you, you know?

684
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,265
And I'm grateful
for all you've done for me.

685
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,642
-(smacks lips)
-Oh, man.

(inhales)

688
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:18,233
And I feel bad for all the trouble
your wife had to go through, as well.

689
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,150
Oh.

690
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,443
-I'm thankful to her, too.
-(smacks lips)

691
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,945
What's gotten into you?

692
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,363
(laughs)

693
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,573
I'm just being honest, dumbass.

694
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:26,574
(exhales awkwardly)

695
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,451
-But...
-(inhales)

696
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,662
...it all ends here.

697
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,917
From now on, I'm not going
to accept any more of your help.

698
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,255
And I won't be...

699
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,714
(breathing shakily)

700
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:42,841
...drinking with you anymore, either.

701

(smacks lips)

703
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,388
Hey.

704
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,140
Is this because I didn't lend you money?

705
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,226
(inhales)

706

(inhales)

713
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:12,370
Wow, you fucker really think
that I'm a fucking joke, don't you?

714
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,498
(inhales)
Well, you should know this better than me.

715
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,834
Even if you think
that I'm a lackey of yours...

(inhales)

717

...I'm not a total sucker
in the palm of your hand

(Moosik inhales)

720
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:29,470
Hey! Did you really think
that I was some piece of shit

721
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,556
who would steal Sanggu's money
and run away with it?

722
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,392
You asshole.

723
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,394
(breathing shakily)

724

(in a calm tone)
Hey, you idiot.

727

You're bleeding. You should wipe that.

You fucking bastard!

Are you trying to make me
look like an idiot?

731
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,323
Dongeok.

732

(Dongeok breathing heavily)

733
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,409
You think you can beat me?

You fucker. I'm going to kill you.

I'll give you five seconds.

741
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,722
If you can't stab me
with this in five seconds,

742
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,515
I'm going to put a hole in your belly.

743
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,184
I'm going to start counting.

I'm sorry.

MOOSIK: You can talk shit

772

Well, it took a little bit of effort
to reduce the amount.

790

But I'm going to pay them.

If I'm being honest, I made
300 million pesos thanks to you.

So I'll give you 50 million pesos

What... is this?

810
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,109
SEOKJUN: They're debts to be collected.

811

They're a decade old.

812

00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,952
Honestly, it'll be hard
to get the money back from them.

816
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,620
I want you to go and collect the money.

817
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,081

819
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,128
All right.

820
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,131
MOOSIK: <i>He's not someone
to be underestimated.</i>

821
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,049
<i>He wants me to go and recover bonds</i>

822
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,009
<i>that have been rotting in the safe
for a decade?</i>

823
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,474
<i>After I lost an old friend,</i>

824
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,727
<i>I went back to Korea
to collect Mr. Min's crap bonds.</i>

825
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:57,947
Hello.

826
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,198
MALE OWNER 1: Oh, welcome in.

827
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,005
MOOSIK: <i>The first debtor
that I went to meet</i>

828
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,590
<i>was a gangster in Samcheok
named Park Iseong.</i>

829
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,591
Okay, drink.

830
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,551
MOOSIK: <i>As the president
of the Korean beef association,</i>

831
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:19,802
<i>he held some power in his community.</i>

832
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,596
-Mr. Park Iseong?
-(soft gasp)

833
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,223
Who's Mr. Park?

834
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,142
Me.

835
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,312
Who are you?

836
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:32,356
My name is Cha Moosik.

837
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,233
MOOSIK: You know Mr. Min, right?
From the Philippines?

838
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:35,693
(sighs)
Yeah.

839
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:39,238
You borrowed 30 million won
of Mr. Min's money and ran away, right?

840
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:40,740
Well, I'm here to collect that money.

841
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,783
-(laughs in disbelief)
-You little shit.

842
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,369
(inhales)
Don't you know who I am?

843
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:48,247
Hey, what the hell do you think
you're talking about?

844
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:49,832
Didn't we just meet?

845
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,668
I wasn't aware that we're friends,
but you're talking to me like we are.

846
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,003
(scoffs)

847
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,504
MOOSIK: Anyway,

848
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:59,800
if you don't pay back Mr. Min's money,
then I'm going to kill you.

849
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,594
(gangsters laugh)

850
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,137
ISEONG (laughing):
He's going to kill me.

851
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,555
That little sack of shit.

852
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,556
-(laughs)
-Wow.

853
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,975
Hey, hey, he's lost his mind.
Hey, give him a nice beating.

854
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,477
(Iseong laughing)

855
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,519
Beat him up.
(laughs)

856
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,355
Hey, I don't want
to talk about this with him.

857
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,648
I need to talk with you, Mr. Park.

858
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,108
(inhaling)
Shit, man. Just get lost.

859
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,151
Huh.

860
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,028
Ugh, that moron.

861
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,947
(in a strained voice)
I said, go!

862
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,367
What? Did I hurt your little feelings?

863
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,786
-Don't do it.
-You little shit!

864
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,246
(screams)

865
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,413
Stop it!

866
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,874
-(gangster 1 grunts painfully)
-Getting handsy, huh?

867
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,334
Do you usually go around
beating people up?

868
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,585
-MOOSIK: Huh?
-(gangster 1 grunts)

869

(gangsters gasp)

870
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,588
Don't move. Don't move.

-(gangster 1 grunts painfully)
-You'll get hurt if you do.

872
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,259
(grunting painfully continues)

873
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,802
(gangster 1 groaning painfully)

874
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,262
-What?
-(pained scream)

875
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,513
-Damn it.
-(gangsters gasp)

(gangster 1 screaming painfully)

878
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,059
MOOSIK: Take him and get out.

879
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:52,019
-(grunts in pain)
-Go to the hospital.

880

-All right.

881

(soft thud)

883
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,151
What are you doing?

884
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,486
MOOSIK: Aren't you leaving too?

885
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:01,654
You rude brat.

886
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,781
The adults are talking.

887
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,575
(sighs lightly)

888
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:07,743
Mr. Park.

889

(Moosik smacks lips)

890
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:12,373
Let's talk like civilized people.
I don't want to do this either, okay?

891
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,208
(inhales)
Damn it.

892
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,127
Look at all this blood.

893

(sighs lightly)

894
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,256
Make the deposit by the end of today.

895

(thuds)

896
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,723
MOOSIK (inhales):
Is this Mr. Park Wonyong's number?

897
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:29,640
WONYONG: <i>Who are you?</i>

898
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:33,394
Right, hello. I'm Cha Moosik.

899
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,562
Who?

900
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,938
MOOSIK: <i>Cha Moosik.</i>

901
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,106
And who's Cha Moosik?

902
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,316
(smacks lips)
You know Mr. Min

903

from the Philippines, right?

904
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,319
Mr. Min from Purvio Hotel.

905
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:44,196
Well, I'm one of his friends.

906
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,325
(sighs)
It looks like you borrowed 60 million won

907
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,659
from him a while ago.

908
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,994
MOOSIK: <i>You need to give me
that money now.</i>

909
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,913
What the hell? Are you crazy?

910
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,874
WONYONG: <i>Hey, you fucking bastard!</i>

911
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:57,126
<i>Who do you think you're talking to, huh?</i>

912
00:38:57,209 --> 00:39:00,171
I know that we're talking on the phone,
but let's not start cussing yet.

913
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,672
We're just getting acquainted.

914
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,299
We're both educated, right?

915
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,717
Let's try to hold
a civilized conversation.

916
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,594
And cussing won't do you any good,

917
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,346
because I'm going to collect
that money no matter what.

918
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,431
WONYONG: <i>Hey, do you think you're
in the Philippines?</i>

919
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,808
Do you have a death wish or what?

920
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,143
Where are you, you little shit?

921
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:15,353
Oh, so you're coming to me?

922
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,521
There's no need for that.

923
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,649
Just give me a place,
and I'll go meet you there.

H-How can I help you?

Your husband is Mr. Park Wonyong, right?

Yeah, that's right.

I'm here to get a perm, of course.

I told you, I'm here to get a perm.
Let's talk after that.

Wait, I'm sorry, but...

Uh, can you... can you put out
your cigarette? You can't smoke in here.

DETECTIVE 2: Hey, I told you
to stop protesting! Didn't I?

1296
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:01,118
DETECTIVE 3: You're really something else.

1297
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:04,079
I'm telling you, I didn't do anything.
I swear I don't do protests.

1300
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,000
DETECTIVE 3:
Then what are they doing outside? Huh?

1301
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,168
They're doing all that
because you're somebody important to them,

1302
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:11,253
you little brat!

1303
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,963
I told you, that's not true!
Seriously, I was just in the wrong place--

-You crazy asshole!
-(grunts in pain)

1305
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:15,841
Damn it, you startled me.

1306

-Huh?
-(pained breathing)

1308
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:20,053
You want another beating? Huh?

1309

-Hey, stop slacking off!
-(groans)

1310
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:22,264
Don't you dare move!
Don't even think about it!

1311

Don't move, you little brats!

When did you become a communist?

1317

Mom, it's not like that.

How's the shop?

1328
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:51,710
I closed the shop.

1329
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:56,006
(smacks lips)
Because things were getting tough.

1330

Why?

1331
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,051
Was it because of Dad?

(sighs)

1333

(angrily)
I mean, why?

1335
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,435
Why do you care about that man so much?

He's still your father.

That man isn't my father!
(huffing angrily)

1340
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:17,652
Is he still doing drugs with your money?

1341
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:20,363
(inhales)
That's how he took all your money!

visiting her son in jail.</i>

because of her husband,</i>
