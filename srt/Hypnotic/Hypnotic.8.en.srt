00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,200
THIS DRAMA IS CREATED
FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,800
ALL CHARACTERS, SETTINGS
AND EVENTS ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,200
THERE IS NO INTENT TO REFERENCE
ANY REAL INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,920
NOR TO PROMOTE INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR
OR UNDERMINE MORAL STANDARDS

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,120
I want you to try
and think back to that day.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,120
The memory isn't gone.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,880
It's just buried deep inside.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,800
Now,

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,440
slowly sink in.

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,800
Sink deeper into it.

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,120
Five, four,

12
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,400
three, two, one.

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,880
Mom, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,800
Then say it out loud.

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,120
Tell me what happened to Kamon.

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,040
Tell me!

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,040
Where's the clip?

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,720
Where's the clip?!

19
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,519
Where's the evidence?! Tell me!

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,040
<i>What are you planning to do?</i>

21
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,080
Was the Bua Loy…

22
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,160
good?

23
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,080
I remember now.

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,280
Sara.

25
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,840
How's my recipe? Good?

26
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,720
It's really good.

27
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,680
Was this really your first try?

28
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,760
At first, I thought
it'd be harder than this.

29
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,760
But it's not as hard as I expected.

30
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,440
Just chop everything up,
put it all together,

31
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,960
and let it simmer for a long time.

32
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,800
Well…

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,240
Should I steal your recipe and open
a restaurant to compete with you?

34
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,360
Whoa.

35
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,640
No need for that.

36
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,840
You should stick to being a psychologist.

37
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,480
Leave the cooking to me.

38
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,200
How's it been living there?
Did they do anything to you?

39
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,200
Well, not yet.

40
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,880
Not yet? So, that means
something's bound to happen?

41
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,120
PEN TOR

42
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
<i>Take it.</i>

43
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,200
<i>I scolded and warned you all</i>
<i>to make you realize your mistakes,</i>

44
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,200
<i>not so you could twist</i>
<i>my words around like this.</i>

45
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,400
I'll go outside for a bit.
I'll be right back.

46
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,920
Yeah.

47
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,800
Bua.

48
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,880
Bua.

49
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,000
Bua.

50
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,000
Bua, where are you?

51
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,040
Bua?

52
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,240
Bua?

53
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,400
Bua?

54
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,400
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

55
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,280
Happy birthday, Dad.

56
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,560
It's my birthday today, Kram?

57
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,640
Of course.

58
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,040
Everyone, smile. One, two, three.

59
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,760
Mini-heart, please.

60
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,440
One, two…

61
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,840
Here, like this, Dad.

62
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,080
- Ah.
- Alright.

63
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,280
Okay, mini-heart.

64
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,000
One, two, three.

65
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,520
- Okay.
- Okay.

66
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,600
Come on.

67
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,640
- Yudo.
- Hm?

68
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,360
Take one more picture for me.

69
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,000
With your dad?

70
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,240
No. Hey.

71
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,920
With Sara.

72
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,920
Please. We still
don't have a picture together.

73
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,000
Please.

74
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,920
Yes!

75
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,960
Alright, I'll take it.

76
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,480
Look at the camera.

77
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,440
One, two, three.

78
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,000
Let me see.

79
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,360
I think

80
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,680
you two

81
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,080
really look good together.

82
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,840
Bua. I like that.

83
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,800
Can I see it?

84
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,880
Do you like it?

85
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,600
Send it to me.

86
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,680
Thought you weren't gonna give it back.

87
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,560
Hm.

88
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,200
Is something wrong?

89
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,360
My wallet's missing.

90
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,480
Maybe you left it at the restaurant?
Want to go check?

91
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,240
I'm heading there anyway.
What should we do?

92
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,960
Maybe

93
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,480
you can take Yudo to the restaurant first.

94
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,800
I'll stay here

95
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,960
and help Bua look after your dad.

96
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,000
That works.

97
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,240
Please take care of him for me.

98
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,040
Who's driving?

99
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,520
- You are.
- Alright.

100
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,280
The cake's here.

101
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,480
One sec.

102
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,880
Perfect.

103
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,039
This is it. Looks so good.

104
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,480
Pretty pricey, right?

105
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,440
The cake's for your dad's birthday?

106
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,080
Yeah, how'd you know?

107
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,160
Just a guess.

108
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,520
You guessed right.

109
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,400
Do you need any help?

110
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,800
You've got a surprise planned already?

111
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,560
I'll help.

112
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,640
It's okay. You can rest.

113
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,280
Ouch, sorry.
I didn't see the trash bin there.

114
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,040
It's okay.

115
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,120
Oh, no, you don't need to.

116
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,640
I'll do it.

117
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,360
- Sorry to trouble you.
- Not at all.

118
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,000
Then maybe I'll take him to rest upstairs?

119
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,800
Sure, please take care of him.

120
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,920
- Uncle.
- Hm?

121
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,040
Let's go rest.

122
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,120
Alright.

123
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,600
I'm alright now.

124
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,680
NEW RECORDING 1

125
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,160
Kamon.

126
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,440
Kamon.

127
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,320
Are you alright?

128
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,920
Yes.

129
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,120
It's me, Kamon.

130
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,680
You remember me.

131
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
What about this person?

132
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,760
Chai.

133
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,840
That's right.

134
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,640
Chai is Kamon's father.

135
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,840
You know what happened to Chai, don't you?

136
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,400
<i>Memory stimulation?</i>

137
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,360
Yes.

138
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,120
An Alzheimer's patient's memories
never truly disappear.

139
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,680
They're just buried deep inside.

140
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,920
All we have to do is stimulate them,
help those memories come back.

141
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,840
And then?

142
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,320
Remember that day at the hospital?

143
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,200
Just a small cut from the glass,
but Uncle Chayut recognized me as Kamon.

144
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,080
That's a good sign.

145
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,880
It means he still retains
those memories from back then.

146
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,560
And with evidence this important,

147
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,240
I'm sure he remembers.

148
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,240
Chai is dead.

149
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,400
Yes.

150
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,480
Chai is dead.

151
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,840
You know why he died, don't you?

152
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,160
Yes.

153
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,560
Someone…

154
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,240
pushed Chai off the building.

155
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
Kulnaree did.

156
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,200
You have the evidence, don't you?

157
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,040
Who did you

158
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,200
give it to?

159
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,680
I…

160
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,840
already gave it to them.

161
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,000
Kamon, I'm sorry.

162
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,040
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

163
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,080
- I'm sorry, Kamon.
- It's okay, Uncle.

164
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,040
It's alright.

165
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,200
You can still help me.

166
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,360
You want to help, don't you?

167
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,280
Yes. I want to help you.
I want to help you, Kamon.

168
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,080
Come on, Uncle.

169
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,760
I know you have the evidence.

170
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,880
Can you tell me where it is?

171
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,400
Please, Uncle, help me.

172
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,320
Please help me.

173
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,720
Please help me.

174
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,680
I have the evidence.

175
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,560
I kept it.

176
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,320
I really want to help you.
I really do, Kamon.

177
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,240
- Yes, Uncle.
- I want to help you.

178
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,520
If you want to help,

179
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,160
you need to tell me where it is.

180
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,400
Take your time, Uncle.

181
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,520
Take your time.

182
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,160
Is it at your house,

183
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,080
at your workplace,

184
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,840
or somewhere else?

185
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,880
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

186
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,000
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,680
TO PAY THE INFORMATION DISCLOSER
A COMPENSATION

190
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,600
OF 1,500,000 THB PER YEAR

191
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,640
INFORMATION DISCLOSER

192
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,320
Where is it, Uncle?

193
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,840
At home?

194
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,120
At work?

195
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,280
Or somewhere else?

196
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,320
Please tell me. Help me.

197
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,520
Please help me.

198
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,200
Uncle, where are you going?

199
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,200
Didn't you say you wanted to help me?

200
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,000
Yes, I want to help.

201
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,640
If you want to help…

202
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,560
Ugh.

203
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,400
…you have to tell me
where the evidence is.

204
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,720
Is it in here?

205
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,680
There's nothing here, Uncle.

206
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,880
Is it up there?

207
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,000
A box.

208
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
A box?

209
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,200
What box?

210
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,040
Evidence.

211
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,960
Yes. Evidence.

212
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,560
What are you doing?

213
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,240
So…

214
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,280
He said he wanted to use the restroom,

215
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,120
but I saw a bee flying around,
so I came to help chase it away.

216
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,920
It's gone now, I think.

217
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,720
Did you find your wallet?

218
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,600
Yes, it was by the flowerpot.

219
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,560
Walk slowly.

220
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,400
Well then, I'll be going now,

221
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,520
so Uncle can rest.

222
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,400
You want me to drive you?

223
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
No, it's alright

224
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,040
It's your dad's birthday.
You should spend time with him.

225
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,400
I'll head out now, Uncle.

226
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,040
Goodbye.

227
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,400
Kamon, are you leaving already?

228
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,440
I'm Sara,

229
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,120
not Kamon.

230
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,440
I'm leaving now.

231
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,680
I'll visit again.

232
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,320
Dad, what were you looking for?

233
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,440
Looking for…

234
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,640
Looking for…

235
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,360
Hasn't Mom come back yet, Kram?

236
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,080
Hm.

237
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,760
Ugh,

238
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,320
you almost had it.

239
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,960
You're sure Kram
didn't suspect anything, right?

240
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,520
Not entirely sure.

241
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,320
But I have to go back again.

242
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,840
I need to find out
what evidence Uncle Chayut hid.

243
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,320
So, if we can get that evidence from him,

244
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,880
and Aunt Sampao agrees to talk,

245
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,040
we can reopen the case.

246
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,880
I'll talk to you later, Plang.

247
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,920
Oh, wow.

248
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,200
Hello, Mother.

249
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,120
Have you missed your dearest son-in-law?

250
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,080
How did you get out?

251
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,560
Oh, come on, Mother.

252
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,480
Don't think that you're
the only one with connections.

253
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,600
I've lived with you long enough.

254
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,600
Of course,
I've picked up a few bad tricks…

255
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,760
I mean, good tricks.

256
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,680
Phathee.

257
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,600
Yes, dear?

258
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,600
Yes, my dear wife. What is it, sweetheart?

259
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,680
You miss me?

260
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,120
Because this husband of yours

261
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,920
missed you so much, he could die.

262
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,800
He missed you every damn day,

263
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,000
especially when your men

264
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,280
nearly beat me to death in prison.
I missed you so bad.

265
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,840
You know what I kept thinking?
If I had to rot in there,

266
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,160
then everyone in this family
would rot and die with me.

267
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,760
- Throw him out.
- Yes, Madam.

268
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,240
Don't you dare touch me, you servant.

269
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,400
Step aside.

270
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,880
Think it through, Mother.

271
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,440
Use your brain and think about…

272
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,160
what I have

273
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,480
in my hands

274
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,760
right now.

275
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,400
<i>If I'd known helping a murderer</i>

276
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
<i>and all the accomplices</i>

277
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,320
- Phathee. You mangy dog.
- <i>in this room…</i>

278
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,240
You worthless son-in-law.

279
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,400
Oh, oh.

280
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,440
Whoa.

281
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,520
- Mom.
- Woo!

282
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,480
Excellent as always, Mother.

283
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,000
Great!

284
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,360
I'm only gone for a while
and you're giving me the honor

285
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,560
to be your nemesis reincarnated?

286
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,840
I'm so proud.

287
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,200
Everyone, don't worry.

288
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,920
I won't let you down.

289
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,760
Because I

290
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,000
will bring karma
to everyone in this house.

291
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,600
What are you staring at?
Pick it up, you servant!

292
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,240
Now!

293
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,200
Move aside.

294
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,200
You're in the way, Mother.

295
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,040
Ha.

296
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,280
Wow.

297
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,120
Soft sofa. Cool AC.

298
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,400
There's nowhere better than this house!

299
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,800
What are you standing there for?

300
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,840
Go get some booze.

301
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,000
Yes, sir.

302
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,000
What the hell?

303
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,400
Oh, you're here. Missed me, darling wife?

304
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,120
Get out of this house right now.

305
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,120
Alright, shoot.

306
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,720
Shoot.

307
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,080
Shoot now.

308
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,800
I've been through worse.

309
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,320
Gotta thank you, though.

310
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,200
You made my prison life lively.

311
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,920
My days in there

312
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,800
never bored me.

313
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,320
Please don't hurt me!

314
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,720
Please don't! Please.

315
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,440
Ugh.

316
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,120
Please. No.

317
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,960
- I'm scared.
- What's up.

318
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,360
Please don't hurt me.

319
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,880
Please don't hurt me.

320
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,240
Your wife's a real pain.

321
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,400
She pays to have you beaten whenever.

322
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,400
But if you cooperate,

323
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,040
I'll treat you well.

324
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,480
Alright?

325
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,400
Your wife's money's mine,

326
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,440
and I also get to make you mine.

327
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,000
Right?

328
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,640
What do you say? You can choose

329
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,480
between my feet

330
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,280
and my stick.

331
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,480
Ah.

332
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,280
Alright.

333
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,680
How's that? Comfy?

334
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,200
Very comfy?

335
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,920
My boy. My lovely boy.

336
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,120
That was the real deal.

337
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,440
You're shaking now?

338
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,520
Go take a shower and rest, Phathee.

339
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,520
Being in there,

340
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,920
you probably didn't sleep well.

341
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,640
You're the best.

342
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,080
Oh, I forgot one thing.

343
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,720
After this,

344
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,080
don't try to kill me anymore.

345
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,200
Because if I die,

346
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,280
those clips on my phone
will leak for sure.

347
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,080
I've prepared everything.

348
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,440
I won't go to hell alone.

349
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,160
I'd be lonely.

350
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,600
CHOKE DEE ORANGE ORCHARD

351
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,240
Aunt Sampao.

352
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,400
Oh, Bank, are you passing by?

353
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,440
Not passing by. I came on purpose.

354
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,280
I need some help from you.

355
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,760
ROYAL THAI POLICE

356
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,320
I'm a cop now.

357
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,320
I remember you had evidence
about Uncle Chai's case.

358
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,360
But now I don't have it anymore.

359
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,440
Even if you don't have it,

360
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,880
you can still testify.

361
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,400
<i>I think Aunt Sampao is mentally ready.</i>

362
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,520
It's time we asked her to help.

363
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,440
What if she hesitates
and doesn't want to talk?

364
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,560
We must make her want to tell the truth,

365
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,280
reinforce her belief.

366
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,480
But don't pressure her too hard.

367
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,880
Just make her feel that telling the truth

368
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,320
is the right thing.

369
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,040
Auntie,

370
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,440
I believe that
if you could turn back time,

371
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,240
you'd help Kamon

372
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,320
and tell the truth.

373
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,720
Will telling the truth

374
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,320
help me?

375
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,120
Tell the truth.

376
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,720
Telling the truth is the only way.

377
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,880
Yes.

378
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,560
I know you feel guilty.

379
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,600
Only telling the truth will free you.

380
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,800
Please help us.

381
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,400
Mother, I want some clams.

382
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,240
Can you get them for me, please?
I can't reach.

383
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,080
Butt out.

384
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,320
I asked your grandma, not you, Panter.

385
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,880
Hurry up, Mother.

386
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,280
Please get them for me.

387
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,000
If you can't reach, then don't eat.

388
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,840
Everyone's eating so little today.

389
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,520
There's a lot of delicious food.

390
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,160
If you go to prison,

391
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,880
you won't get to eat like this.

392
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,840
Think before you speak.

393
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,560
This isn't only our family.

394
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,640
Come on, Mother.

395
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,800
Stop pretending.

396
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,080
Things have come this far.

397
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,080
You think the kids don't know?

398
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,160
Even when I was in jail, I knew

399
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,920
you caused Sydney to jump off the balcony

400
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,200
and you hit Sol.

401
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,160
Phathee, that's enough.

402
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,680
Why make the kids worry?

403
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,560
Why did he have to came back?

404
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,040
Oh.

405
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,880
You sure have a way with words.
You're really my son.

406
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,680
I'm so proud.

407
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,320
Hey, Ms. Sara.

408
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:24,240
Since we're already
living under the same roof,

409
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,600
if you're curious about anything,

410
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,720
you can ask me directly.

411
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,800
I know their true colors…

412
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,760
I mean,

413
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,480
I know the nature

414
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,920
of everyone in this house, inside out.

415
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,400
Oh? Why so quiet?

416
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,960
Did I say something wrong?

417
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,760
Well, I just thought maybe Ms. Sara
could evaluate the behaviors

418
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:55,160
and use it to treat
the crazies in this house.

419
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,000
Right, Ms. Sara?

420
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,080
Oh, by the way, Ms. Sara,

421
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,080
I've got an audio clip.

422
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,440
Something fun.
I thought you might want to hear it.

423
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,720
Would you like to listen?

424
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,800
What kind of audio clip?

425
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,440
It's an audio clip of…

426
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,000
Phathee.

427
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,520
What are you doing? Think of the kids.

428
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,120
What clip is it? May I see it?

429
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,800
Found it.

430
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,320
What do you want to eat?
I'll get it for you.

431
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,840
Maybe I'll show you later.

432
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,520
I want clams, Mother.

433
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,640
I just said that a moment ago.
You already forgot?

434
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,800
Are you out of it or what?

435
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,160
Hurry, please.
I want clams. Get some for me.

436
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,520
Mother.

437
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,360
I also want Chinese sausage.

438
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,000
They don't serve that in jail.

439
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,280
Sol, what do you want?
Grandma will get it for you.

440
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,560
YOU STUPID BITCH

441
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,679
<i>You stupid bitch.</i>

442
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,600
You think I'm stupid?

443
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,639
Good. You're now a bit smarter.

444
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,800
Then just tell me. How much do you want?

445
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,719
Or do you want help with the case,

446
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,960
so we can just finish this?

447
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,280
That's so easy to talk.

448
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,600
Let me think about what I want.

449
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,400
I know what I want now.

450
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,840
There's only one thing I want.

451
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,400
<i>I want to see you put in jail.</i>
<i>Is that doable?</i>

452
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,920
<i>Phathee's back,</i>
<i>and I can't read him at all.</i>

453
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,000
<i>Do you think</i>
<i>he'll hand that clip to the police</i>

454
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,880
<i>to investigate this family?</i>

455
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,160
Right now, he's enjoying
messing with everyone's heads,

456
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,720
making the whole family paranoid.

457
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,720
<i>I'll take this chance to get his phone.</i>

458
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,120
<i>I want to see you, your mother,</i>

459
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,160
<i>and your family all behind bars,</i>

460
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,000
<i>so you'll understand me.</i>

461
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,960
Don, help however you can

462
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,440
to get Phathee back in jail soon.

463
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,280
I've already rushed them.

464
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,440
But now it's in the court process,
we have to wait for the court to rule.

465
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,000
Do we just have to let him
get on our nerves like this every day?

466
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,200
And what if he digs up

467
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,480
Naree's old case and exposes it?

468
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,760
At first, I didn't believe in karma,

469
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,040
but now I do.

470
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,040
Maybe karma comes back as Phathee.

471
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,880
Nun.

472
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,360
If you don't say anything,
no one will think you're mute.

473
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,680
Mom, why is it
we end up acting crazy like this?

474
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,840
Isn't this the consequence of our actions?

475
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,720
You can think however you want,

476
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,360
but I'll prove

477
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,920
that we can control everything.

478
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,680
Your arm's all bruised now.

479
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,840
I told you,

480
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,400
the situation with Phathee
is being handled. Don't stress.

481
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,880
It's not about Phathee.

482
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,040
Then what is it?

483
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,560
Three or four days ago,
Sara did something to me.

484
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,080
What did she do?

485
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,960
She drugged me, put me under hypnosis,

486
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,320
and asked me
about the case from 19 years ago.

487
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,760
Huh?

488
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,800
I slipped up.

489
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,760
She got information

490
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,120
about what happened that day.

491
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,880
But after that day,
I didn't see her do anything else.

492
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,920
I want to know what she's thinking now

493
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,240
and what she'll do next.

494
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,480
Yes, Bank?

495
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,160
I'll head there now.

496
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,160
MIND BALANCE

497
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,960
Do you have something to explain?

498
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,640
That's my prescription.

499
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,920
I never prescribed this medicine for you.

500
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,720
You went to the hospital,
and while I wasn't looking,

501
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,480
you logged into the system
and prescribed it to yourself.

502
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,800
This is serious, Sara.

503
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,800
That medication is dangerous.

504
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,080
I just kept it just in case.

505
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,240
Do you know how unethical this is?

506
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,880
And if you're caught,

507
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,880
you know how severe
the punishment will be.

508
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,440
This is like you betrayed me.

509
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,640
After all this time,

510
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,600
you've approached
that family in many ways.

511
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,120
I can tolerate that,
but I cannot tolerate this.

512
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,560
You've crossed the line.

513
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,280
You've crossed lines before too, right?

514
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,480
Or will you claim that what you did

515
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,160
wasn't wrong?

516
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,960
I did it to protect you, Sara.

517
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,960
It was a decision made
because someone said

518
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,640
you were in danger.

519
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,360
That's why I broke the rules

520
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,960
and switched the documents
and helped you become Sara.

521
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,520
It was for your safety.

522
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,240
Now I'm doing it for my safety too.

523
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,320
Sometimes,

524
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,480
you must cross the line
you set for yourself

525
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,040
to achieve better results, right?

526
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,440
No, this is different.

527
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,400
What you did is wrong,

528
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,160
and it harms others.

529
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,480
As a doctor, I cannot allow it.

530
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,880
If you don't stop,

531
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,680
I will stop you.

532
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,520
Just know

533
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,240
that I used it on someone who deserves it.

534
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,720
And just in case you don't realize,

535
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,640
you're already crossing my line too.

536
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,120
Yes, Plang?

537
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,320
I'm going now.

538
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,880
The undertaker said

539
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,960
everything was fine this morning.

540
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,240
But now, it's like this.

541
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,840
Your parents' urns are gone too.

542
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,160
Do you know who did it?

543
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,160
They said some teenagers have been
breaking the urns at temples

544
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,960
and selling the bronze urns.

545
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,760
Why did it have to be my parents' urns?

546
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,680
This is all I have left of them.

547
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,280
I…

548
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,960
Excuse me.

549
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,640
Mr. Kram?

550
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,600
What are you all doing here?

551
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,160
Sara and I just came to the temple,
so we stopped by to check.

552
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,840
I'm working on a case.

553
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,160
Someone at the temple
reported vandalized urns.

554
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,320
What a coincidence.

555
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,480
And why are you here?

556
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,920
The damaged urns
belong to a family friend of my dad's.

557
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,760
I help take care of them.

558
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,520
They have no relatives.

559
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,640
Excuse me, then.

560
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,080
Thanks for coming to look out for them.

561
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,120
I'll handle the rest.

562
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,200
There.

563
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,720
Are they Uncle Chai and Aunt Napa?

564
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,400
Yes, yes.

565
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,680
These two are great workers.

566
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,240
They're so hardworking.

567
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,320
At the end of the year,
I think I'll give them a bonus.

568
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,520
So they can buy something for Kamon.

569
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,440
Kamon?

570
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,040
Is that their child?

571
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,360
Yes.

572
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,400
Ms. Sara, you're here to make merit too?

573
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,360
It's my birthday today.

574
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:26,920
MR. CHAI TIDRAKSA

575
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,840
MRS. NAPA TIDSAKSA

576
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,440
Why did it have to be my parents' urns?

577
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,840
This is all I have left of them.

578
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,160
She's around your age.

579
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,720
What about these two kids?

580
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,280
Who are they?

581
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,720
They're Kamon's close friends.

582
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,040
Do you remember their names?

583
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,160
This girl

584
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,080
is Plang.

585
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,360
This boy is Bank.

586
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,280
<i>Is this a coffee date or what?</i>

587
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,080
- Just a meetup.
- Coincidence.

588
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,440
Did you deliberately approach
the Lerthanakul family

589
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,520
for some specific reason?

590
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,440
Yes.

591
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,240
What are you doing?

592
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,800
Their wedding anniversary?

593
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,280
Yes, Plang?

594
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,360
<i>Chawadon just left the house.</i>

595
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,320
<i>You've got less than an hour.</i>

596
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,600
<i>Check the cabinet.</i>

597
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,560
<i>He likes spending a long time</i>
<i>near that one.</i>

598
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,760
<i>There must be something there.</i>

599
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,160
LAND TITLE DEED

600
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,160
LAND TITLE DEED

601
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:06,960
LAND TITLE DEED

602
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,040
GRANT OWNERSHIP

603
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,160
FROM MRS. JIRA LERTHANAKUL

604
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,280
TO MR. CHAWADON LERTHANAKUL

605
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,880
FROM MRS. JIRA LERTHANAKUL

606
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,480
We're closed now.

607
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,720
I'm delivering a package.

608
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,560
- It's for Mr. Kram.
- That's me.

609
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,440
- Thank you.
- Alright.

610
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,720
DVD PLAYER

611
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,720
DVD PLATER

612
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,520
Yudo, finish up the accounting, okay?

613
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,400
- I'm heading home.
- Huh?

614
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,600
Hey.

615
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,400
Why is he in such a hurry?

616
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,760
<i>What are you doing up here? Go down.</i>

617
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,440
<i>No, I made money myself.</i>

618
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,720
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

619
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,480
<i>I told you I'd stay out of your business.</i>

620
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,640
<i>Don't!</i>

621
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,520
<i>Just staying out of it isn't enough.</i>

622
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,240
<i>Ah!</i>

623
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:02,000
<i>Ah!</i>

624
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,680
So, the reason
why Sara entered that house…

625
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,240
Everything seems normal.
Looks like no one suspects anything yet.

626
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,880
<i>I'm on my way to pick up Aunt Sampao.</i>

627
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,760
Once we have
all the evidence and witnesses,

628
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,000
we can finish this.

629
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,200
Do you miss me?

630
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,480
Naree?

631
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,720
Looking for evidence, Sara?

632
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,560
Or should I call you Kamon?

633
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:47,920
Hello, Uncle.

634
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,480
<i>Are you trying to reopen the case?</i>

635
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,840
You're about to join your parents soon.

636
