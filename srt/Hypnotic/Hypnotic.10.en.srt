ALL CHARACTERS, SETTINGS

THERE IS NO INTENT TO REFERENCE

NOR TO PROMOTE INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,600
I know you might not believe it

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,960
because your father's unwell.

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,120
But after staying in that house,

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,200
I believe Uncle Chayut
was telling the truth.

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,480
I don't even know what to say.

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,800
This is…

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,440
even more shocking than what you told me.

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,200
I've always wondered
why they had to kill my father.

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,240
Did he really have to die for this?

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,640
My family was torn apart…

15
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,040
because of how disgusting they were.

16
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,480
It's okay.

17
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,160
So…

18
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,160
Are you going to tell Nan?

19
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,160
Of course.

20
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,760
I'll find a way to tell her.

21
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,800
Panter…

22
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,600
You're back, Dad?

23
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,200
Why didn't you say you'd be late?

24
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,080
Why did you wait for me today?

25
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,480
Because today's your birthday.

26
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,400
I had a client meeting,

27
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,640
so I came back late.

28
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,360
Our son saw that

29
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,720
our family's been so tense lately.

30
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,760
So, he wanted us
to be happy again, like we used to.

31
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
Thank you, son.

32
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,400
I'll take this to my study room.

33
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,880
I still have some work to finish up.

34
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,320
Then go ahead and finish it up.

35
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,600
We can celebrate some other time, right?

36
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,280
Sure.

37
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,680
HAPPY

38
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,400
Busy?

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,040
Nan.

40
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,360
I'm not in the mood.

41
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,959
Nan.

42
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,800
I finalized the transfer
for the Ratchapruek plot your mom gifted.

43
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,360
It's now under your name.

44
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,680
I'll show you the documents.

45
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,920
No need.

46
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,800
I always trust you with these things.

47
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,680
Shouldn't be any problem.

48
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,240
I'll go to bed, then.

49
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,680
Is something wrong, Ter?

50
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,760
Hm?

51
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
Mom.

52
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,120
There's something
I think I should tell you.

53
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,000
Sara?

54
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,160
The other day, I saw her
doing something in Dad's study.

55
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
It didn't seem right.

56
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,600
<i>Sara is Kamon.</i>

57
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,200
She's been living
under a dead person's name.

58
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,160
Everything that's happened to us

59
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,880
is all her plan.

60
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,840
Mom.

61
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,560
I'm just confused now.

62
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,280
I don't know
if we can still trust Sara anymore.

MR. CHAWADON LERTHANAKUL

65
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,120
Another piece of land

66
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,080
and it's Ratchaphruek.

67
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,880
Thanks for trusting me, Nan.

68
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,360
I tasted it.

69
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,560
I think the cake from this shop
is not that good.

70
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,160
Let's go back
to our usual place next time, okay?

71
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,040
I made it myself, Dad.

72
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,120
I took a baking course at a studio.

73
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,760
I wanted to bake one for your birthday.

74
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,160
But we can still go
to our usual place too.

75
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,960
Ter.

76
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,800
Are you okay?

77
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,480
You look kind of stressed.

78
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,960
If there's anything, just tell us.

79
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,520
It's nothing.

80
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,400
Even if we're younger

81
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,960
and can't do much,

82
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,640
we can still listen,

83
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,840
like you always listen to us.

84
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,000
Remember what Sara told us?

85
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,720
If we stick together,

86
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,720
no matter what happens,

87
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,760
no one can hurt us.

88
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,800
Thank you, Sydney, Seoul.

89
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,280
If there's anything, I'll tell you guys.

90
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,120
Wait.

91
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,040
Are you leaving without saying goodbye?

92
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,880
Let me give you a ride.

93
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,440
It's okay.

94
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,280
I called Phleng to pick me up.

95
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,080
Alright.

96
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,880
Kram.

97
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,440
Can I ask you something?

98
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,320
Can you please stay out of this?

99
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,080
How can I, Sara?

100
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,760
My father's actions played a part
in what happened to you.

101
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,280
So, I should help you as much as I can.

102
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,680
But everything I'm doing

103
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,680
has been going against you
from the beginning.

104
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,560
And I've thought about this.

105
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,320
Even if I don't hurt the kids,

106
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,800
they'll still suffer

107
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,440
because their parents will be punished.

108
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,720
And when that time comes,

109
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,920
if you stop me,

110
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,240
I might get killed.

111
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,200
But if you let me do what I have to do,

112
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,400
the kids will suffer. They'll be in pain.

113
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,680
So, the best way

114
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,040
is for you to stay out of this.

115
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,240
No need to take responsibility
for your father.

116
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,560
Because if you keep
pushing forward like this,

117
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,560
you'll be the one who has to carry it all.

118
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,400
Sara.

119
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,840
I've been a part of this
just by being my father's son.

120
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,840
And from now on,

121
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,480
even if I have to carry everything,

122
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,280
I will.

123
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,800
Then what will you choose to carry?

124
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,480
Between the pain the kids will suffer

125
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,280
and my death?

126
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,160
I won't let you die, Sara.

127
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,000
And no one else has to die either.

128
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,120
I'm glad that there are
people like you in this world.

129
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,840
If someone is drowning in despair,

130
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,320
and you're in their life,

131
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,000
they'd find a way out a lot easier.

132
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,160
You have me too.

133
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,840
We'll find a way.

134
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,000

Sara.

138
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,120
You didn't tell me you wouldn't be back.

139
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,360
There was a little issue last night.

140
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,520
Does it have anything to do with you
sneaking into my husband's study?

141
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,240
I can explain.

142
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,080
Then explain.

143
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,680
I suspected that Mr. Chwadon

144
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,320
was taking your land for himself.

145
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,840
I'm starting to wonder

146
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,760
if I've helped the wrong person…

147
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,600
Kamon.

148
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,200
The only reason I helped you

149
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,840
was because I didn't want
my little sister sinking deeper into sin.

150

I wanted you to run away

151

and start a new life.

00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,800
Why did you come back?

153
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,480
To tear our family apart?

154
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,680
No, I didn't.

155
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,560

But you approached me

159

You're the one behind
all the chaos in this house.

turn us against each other,

No matter how far you run,

187
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,200
I'll find you.

188
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,920
I'll drag you back
and watch you die in front of me.

189
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,720
And this time,

190
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,720
I won't miss.

191
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,000
You'll die for sure.

192
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,440
Very determined, aren't you?

193
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,480
I'm not stopping either,

194
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
not until I see you

195
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,960
and your family
being destroyed right before my eyes.

196
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,080
It won't be long now.

197
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,920
Ugh.

198
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,920
What? I told you Sara isn't here.

199
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,480
Don't lie, Phleng.

200
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,080
The kids told me she left the house.

201
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,080
I checked the condo.
She's not there either. Where is she?

202
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,240
Bali, maybe.

203
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,600
- Not funny.
- I'm not joking.

204
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,720
If you don't know where she is,

205
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,120
that means she doesn't want you to know.

206
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,760
Phleng, please.

207
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,080
I'm going inside.

208
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,680
And don't ring the bell.

209
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,680
My mom needs rest.

210
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,680
Phleng, wait.

211
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,440
Phleng.

212
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,400
I made your favorites.

213
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,520
Here,

214
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,880
sea bass congee without skin.
Your favorite, Sydney.

215
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,840
And avocado toast
without tomatoes, Seoul's favorite.

216
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,000
Eat up.

217
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,440
Seoul?

218
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,880
Why aren't you eating?

219
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,280
You want something else?

220
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,280
There's nothing here that you like, Mom.

221
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,520
Aren't you eating with us?

222
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,160
I know you two stayed
with Aunt Nan for several days.

223
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,800
You probably
didn't get to eat these things.

224
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,640
I promised myself that when you came back,
I'd cook them for you.

225
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,800
Just seeing you eat your favorite food
and being happy

226
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,520
makes me happy.

227
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,800
I missed you both so much.

228
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,840
From now on,

229
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,640
I will do my best.

230
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,280
I promise.

231
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,080
Well, eat up.

232
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,760
<i>See you at 8 p.m. tonight.</i>

233
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:06,120
<i>The communities along the Trang River</i>
<i>are flooded year-round…</i>

234
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,560
Dear.

235
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,400
Don't wait for me tonight.

236
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,640
I'll be working late with a client.

237
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,120
Dear.

238
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,320
There's no issue with the land transfer

239
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,400
you did last time, right?

240
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,400
All good, like always.

241
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,320
Mom has another piece of land
she wants to transfer to me.

242
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,600
Can you handle it too?

243
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,920
<i>Last year, a new water diversion channel</i>
<i>for the Trang River was built…</i>

244
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,240
I'd like to pick up
the keycard for room 1023,

245
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,080
under the name Chawadon.

246
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,920
Naree.

247
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,680
Naree.

248
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,480
Taking a shower while waiting for me?

249
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,680
Hm?

250
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,240
Why so surprised, honey?

251
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,760
It's done. They should be meeting by now.

252
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,960
Now there's only one last guest left.

253
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,480
Your husband cheats on you.

254
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,440
Mr. Chawadon

255
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,680
has been having an affair
with your sister Naree.

256
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,920
Tomorrow night, go to room 1023

257
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,200
at this location.

258
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,920
I'll prove to you

259
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,440
that your husband isn't faithful to you.

260
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,520
<i>I managed to get into their IG accounts.</i>

261
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,960
<i>Now we send secret DMs</i>
<i>and let the plan play out.</i>

262
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,280
<i>We'll lure each cheater</i>
<i>into different rooms</i>

263
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,480
<i>and send their spouse into their rooms.</i>

264
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,280
<i>I have a surprise tonight.</i>

265
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,000
<i>You'll love it.</i>

266
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,960
<i>See you at the same place at 8 p.m.</i>

267
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,320
<i>Room 1024. I already booked it.</i>

268
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,560
<i>Your wife slept with her sister's husband.</i>

269
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,240
<i>If you want to have some fun,</i>
<i>go deal with your wife.</i>

270
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,200
<i>Come to this room tonight.</i>

271
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,880
Hey.

272
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,680
Why put that robe on?

273
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,560
Well…

274
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,920
This hotel is so nice.

275
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,200
- Hey!
- Enjoy the bath

276
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,760
- No!
- a bit more! Go ahead!

277
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,560
Dear.

278
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,120
Your client
has the same name as my sister?

279
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,320
And when you meet your client,

280
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,840
you need to take off your tie

281
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,440
and your shirt too?

282
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,480
Calm down, Nan.

283
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,640
- How did you get here?
- Let go.

284
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,480
- How did you get here?
- Let go!

285
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,800
You did this to me?

286
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,640
- You cheated on me?!
- Let go!

287
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,040
- Huh?!
- Stop!

288
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,040
You bitch! That hurts!

289
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,640
Arrgh! You!

290
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,520
Come back. Where are you going?

291
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,560
Where are you going?

292
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,240
Get back here!

293
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,640
How did you get here?

294
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,000
I drove here, duh.

295
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,320
I drove here to see my filthy wife

296
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,240
who's been sleeping
with her sister's husband!

297
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,520
How long have you been doing this?

298
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,960
Doing what, Nan?

299
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,520
What are you talking about?

300
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,200
I think it's just a misunderstanding.

301
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,040
Stop lying.

302
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,680
Don't disgust me more than this.

303
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,840
I was stupid

304
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,440
to ever believe
you were the perfect husband.

305
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,800
All this time,

306
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,880
you weren't defending Naree

307
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,960
because you were neutral.

308
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,680
But it was because

309
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,720
you were sleeping with my sister.

310
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,880
Let go! Let go of me.

311
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,240
Who told you to come here?

312
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,600
Someone told you to come, right?

313
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,680
They wanted us to fight.

314
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,960
Who sent you?!

315
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,360
It doesn't matter who sent me!

316
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,040
You arrived just in time.

317
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,680
- Who told you to come?!
- Why do you need to know?!

318
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,640
You slutty wife!

319
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,800
You…

320
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,360
Hey!

321
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,600
- Let go!
- You acted

322
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,840
like I'm the only sick one here.

323
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,840
You're no better.

324
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,320
Sleeping with your own sister's husband?

325
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,840
You and I are perfect for each other!

326
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,920
A match made in hell.

327
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,800
Bitch, did you knee my balls?!

328
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,320
I want a divorce.

329
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,720
Nan, wait. Listen to me.

330
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,560
- Let go!
- Nan.

331
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,160
- Nan, let me explain.
- Let go of me!

332
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,360
- Let go!
- Nan.

333
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,120
- Nan.
- Let go!

334
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,520
- Let go of me!
- Nan.

335
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,400
- Nan.
- Let go. I don't have anything to say!

336
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,880
- Listen to me.
- Neree, get back here!

337
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,200
- Nan.
- Naree!

338
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,400
- Come here, Naree!
- Let go!

339
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,320
Ow.

340
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,480
So, it wasn't just me.

341
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,840
You got called here too, Nan?

342
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,960
Why did you do this?!

343
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,120
Now you've seen it, right?

344
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,480
You're no better than me.

345
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,320
You might think you won

346
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,280
because Mom gave you more at the company.

347
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,520
But in everything else, you lose to me.

348
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,240
Especially when it comes to your man.

349
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,040
I never cared about winning or losing!

350
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,040
I don't believe you!

351
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,520
If you want to blame someone,

352
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,280
blame yourself

353
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,560
that your husband didn't want you!

354
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,480
Naree!

355
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,920
Let go!

356
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,640
- Naree!
- Go on! Fight!

357
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,760
- Let go!
- Naree!

358
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,320
Stop right now!

359
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,720
- Mom.
- Don't call me Mom.

360
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,800
I know all the filthy things
you two have done.

361
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,240
Sara…

362
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,160
This is because of you, isn't it?!

363
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,640
Stop right now, Naree!

364
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,880
Stop, Naree!

365
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,480
- Ouch!
- Wow.

366
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,320
- Let go!
- Let go of me!

367
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,640
Oh shit!

368
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,640
My EM tag battery is dead.

369
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,040
The police will be here soon.

370
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,800
We'll talk at home.

371
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,760
- Hit it.
- It's attacking us!

372
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,520
- Help. Help.
- What?

373
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,040
How could I help?

374
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,680
Hurry. It's coming.

375
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,600
- I'll die.
- Which side?

376
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,520
Right side.

377
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,880
- It's the red flag.
- Look.

378
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,040
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

379
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,720
- We won.
- Our team rocks.

380
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,240
Master Panter.

381
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,560
Mrs. Nan said
you all must stay in this room.

382
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,200
Don't come out.

383
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,240
Why?

384
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,400
- What happened?
- I'm not sure either.

385
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,720
But you need to stay inside.

386
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,360
Mom?

387
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,880
What the hell?

388
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,800
Answer me.

389
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,160
Since when have you been this disgusting?

390
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,360
What did she tell you?

391
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,680
She didn't tell me anything.

392
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,160
I saw.

393
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,840
I heard with my own ears how vile you are.

394
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,280
Tell your mother

395
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,120
that you've been acting like this

396
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,200
since 19 years ago.

397
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,000
The day everything happened 19 years ago,

398
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,520
you went to meet Don for sex.

399
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,760
And someone happened to see you.

400
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,800
Don!

401
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,720
You've been banging my wife for 19 years?

402
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,960
That man…

403
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,920
Is that why

404
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,240
you killed him? To silence him?

405
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,840
He shouldn't have meddled.

406
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,920
Since we're mentioning that,

407
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,800
why don't you tell everyone

408
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,800
that the man

409
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,680
was your father, Kamon?

410
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,240
That girl should've been dead.

411
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,720
But your precious eldest daughter

412
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,400
secretly warned the caretakers,

413
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,400
so she could switch names
with a dead child and deceive us all.

414
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,440
I didn't want this house

415
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,360
to be stained with blood again.

416
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,680
But thanks to her,

417
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,200
I've finally stopped being stupid.

418
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,680
Stopped being stupid?

419
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,880
The reason we're standing here like this

420
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,000
is because you're stupid
and let yourself be used.

421
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,960
You helped her come back and destroy us.

422
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,680
So, you planned all this
to turn us against each other?

423
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,240
Dammit, Don!

424
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,080
You're goddamn stupid.

425
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,960
Everyone knows this.

426
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,240
But the real issue here
is you actually banged my wife.

427
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,800
Otherwise, how would Kamon
be able to plan this? Idiot.

428
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,360
You knew and you didn't tell me?

429
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,120
Mom.

430
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,920
You told me to handle it.

431
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,520
Useless.

432
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,000
If we know all this already,

433
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,560
don't play her game.

434
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,840
Just get rid of her.

435
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,280
Nuh-uh.

436
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,400
Stop being sneaky, Don.

437
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,360
The laborers' kid is one thing,

438
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,800
but you banging my wife
is a whole other thing. Idiot.

439
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,600
You idiot!

440
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,480
Oh?

441
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,360
The reason you have to wear an EM bracelet

442
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,680
and the reason you went to jail

443
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,360
was because of her. Dumbass!

444
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,640
Mother.

445
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,920
The real idiots

446
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,280
are the two of you who created this mess.

447
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,040
Otherwise, how would she
be able to destroy us

448
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,239
if you hadn't been so disgusting?!

449
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,719
I will…

450
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,120
handle this myself.

451
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,199
Mom!

452
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:25,920
Is Sara alright?

453
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,199
If something happened,
she would've signaled us already.

454
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,159
Please don't, Mom!

455
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:40,480
The kids are here.
Don't let this turn into a bigger mess.

456
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,360
Let me go. I'm going to deal with her.

457
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,920
Let go. I said let go.

458
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,280
I understand

459
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,719
if you see me as your enemy.

460
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,400
But your true enemy
is much closer than you think.

461
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:09,280
MR. CHAWADON LERTHANAKUL

462
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,040
The land that was supposed
to be under Nan's name…

463
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,880
MR. CHAWADON LERTHANAKUL

464
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,160
…was all transferred to Mr. Chawadon.

465
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,840
But as far as I know,

466
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,280
Nan never transferred
any land to Mr. Chawadon.

467
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,480
Wow, Don.

468
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,880
You stole your own wife's land too?

469
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,440
Now I feel like I'm a good husband.

470
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,680
That's not true.

471
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,640
I didn't do it.

472
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,160
She's lying.

473
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,440
The evidence is right here.

474
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,320
He's a son-in-law

475
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,560
and a family lawyer
that you trust, Mrs. Jira.

476
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,880
And he stabbed you in the back
like it's nothing.

477
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,600
The one you should be getting rid of

478
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,680
is probably not me.

479
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Mother. Mother. Ah!

480
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,600
I'll kill you!

481
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,760
I'll kill you! Don!

482
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,600
Enough, you old hag!

483
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,840
Mom!

484
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,040
Mom.

485
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,480
Why did you do this?!

486
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,480
I've taken enough.

487
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,560
And I'm not Seoul or Ter.

488
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,520
I'm not your mom's emotional punching bag.

489
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,480
Give it to me.

490
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,800
- Let go!
- Give it to me.

491
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,120
Let it go.

492
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,320
You're doing all this…

493
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,160
to reopen your parents' case, aren't you?

494
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,280
Well then,

495
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,480
you should be thanking me.

496
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,200
Because every piece
of evidence you'll need,

497
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,840
I've got it all.

498
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,160
What do you mean?

499
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,600
The documents

500
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,680
about your worker father's death.

501
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,520
The autopsy report,

502
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,080
showing your mom was poisoned.

503
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,800
The evidence

504
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,640
of money transferred to that Sampao woman.

505
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,120
Evidence from Chayut.

506
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,360
I kept everything.

507
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,840
What?

508
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,040
Don't be mad, Naree.

509
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,680
You know this house is full of snakes.

510
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,120
You can't trust anyone.

511
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,560
I needed something to protect myself too.

512
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,040
You…

513
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,320
You have evidence?

514
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,360
Don't think
you'll get away with this, Don.

515
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,520
I've seen every piece of the evidence.

516
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,640
And I've never

517
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,000
involved myself with any of it.

518
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,040
The ones who were involved…

519
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,040
are you, Nan,

520
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,040
Naree,

521
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,960
and Phathi.

522
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,120
Don!

523
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,480
You… How could you do this?! Don!

524
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,400
If you want the evidence,

525
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,720
I'll sell it to you.

526
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,520
But if this family offers more,

527
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,360
they'll get it.

528
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,080
I'll give you time to think.
I'll be in touch.

529
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,680
- Hey, stop right there.
- Don't follow me!

530
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,080
Or I'll release all the evidence tonight.

531
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,520
Hey, Don!

532
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,840
You ruined everything!

533
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,560
You dare slap me, Kamon?!

534
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,680
Yeah!

535
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,640
What are you gonna do?!

536
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,360
What's your problem, huh?!

537
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,320
Stop! Cut the crazy shit!

538
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,240
Call an ambulance!

539
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,200
What's going on, Dad?

540
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,240
Where are you going?

541
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,800
I'm in a hurry.

542
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,640
What's wrong, Dad?

543
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,200
MAE SOT INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

544
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,360
I never wanted it to be like this.

545
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,880
Where are you going?
Are you leaving me and Mom?

546
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,960
It's because of your Grandma and your mom.

547
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,160
Dad. Dad.

548
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,000
Dad. Dad! Dad!

549
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,920
Dad!

550
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,480
Dad!

551
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,160
Ter.

552
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,720
Master Panter!

553
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,200
Master Panter!

554
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,760
Ter.

555
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,200
Shit.

556
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,560
Mrs. Nan.

557
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Mom.

558
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,360
Mom.

559
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,120
- Ter!
- Grandma!

560
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,600
Grandma.

561
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,720
Mom.

562
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,360
Sara, Chawadon ditched all his devices.

563
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,960
We've got no way to track him.

564
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,480
Dammit.

565
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,600
He's the worst one of all.

566
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,320
How did it turn out like this?

567
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,800
Bank, can we track
Chawadon's license plate?

568
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,520
Yes, I'll have people set up roadblocks.

569
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,560
- Grandma. Grandma.
- Mom.

570
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,320
- Grandma.
- Mom…

571
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,960
Mom.

572
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,480
Grandma.

573
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,160
- Grandma!
- Mom…

574
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,120
Grandma.

575
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,840
Mom…

576
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,200
Mom.

577
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,760
Mom.

578
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,440
Dad…

579
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,400
Dad left the house.

580
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,520
Why did it end up like this?

581
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,760
I saw Sara. What was she doing?

582
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,000
I'm sorry, Ter…

583
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,240
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry…

584
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,080
I'm so sorry, Ter. I'm so sorry…

585
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,800
I'm sorry, Ter.

586
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,680
- Kitti.
- Yes?

587
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,280
Find Don

588
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,240
and bring me every piece of evidence.

589
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,600
Sara swapped my phone.

590
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,160
There's a clip of all of us on there.

591
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,080
Huh?

592
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,040
And look at this.

593
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,240
She gave me a cheap mock-up phone.
Didn't even bother spending money on it!

594
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,120
Damn.

595
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,480
Goddammit!

596
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,880
Yes. Thank you.

597
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,560
Checkpoints are set.

598
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,960
If they spot Chawadon,
they'll call me right away.

599
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,000
Hey! Go back.

600
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,400
- I'm busy.
- Sara.

601
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,240
I know you're in there.
I know everything now.

602
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,840
What are you doing here? Go back.

603
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,680
Hey.

604
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,160
Sara. Sara.

605
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,560
Sara.

606
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,440
I choose to stand by you.

607
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,320
Seoul,

608
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,760
Sydney,

609
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,600
Panter.

610
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,200
They're just like me.

611
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,680
Children of the people
who destroyed your family.

612
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,080
But I only found out when it was too late.

613
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,080
And it hurts like hell.

614
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,160
I don't want them
to go through the same thing.

615
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,880
I told you

616
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,880
it's not the kids' fault.

617
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,680
And they don't need to pay
for what their parents did.

618
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,800
You're right.
It's not their responsibility.

619
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,320
But they still have to live with it.

620
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,320
The last name. The bloodline.

621
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,760
If those kids help you
do the right thing today,

622
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,160
then they'll grow up

623
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,320
without guilt for the rest of their lives.

624
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,000
Are you sure?

625
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,240
I remember Don
has a vacation home somewhere.

626
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,440
Dad took me there when I was a kid.

627
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,840
If that's where he's hiding,

628
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,400
we might be able to track him down.

629
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,920
Alright.

630
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,080
Nan, I got
Ter's phone location from Seoul.

631
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,280
I'm almost at his location.

632
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,040
What exactly is going on?

633
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,600
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

634
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,200
Ter said he was coming
to the hospital to see me.

635
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,320
Then he just disappeared.

636
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,120
I haven't been able
to reach him for a while.

637
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,840
I'm scared something's happened to him.

638
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,760
Nan,

639
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,600
try to stay calm.

640
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,480
I'll find him.

641
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,520
<i>You should go home for now.</i>

642
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,320
It says he's somewhere around here.

643
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,280
Why would he come to a place like this?

644
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,080
Let's split up.

645
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,800
I'll go this way, you go that way.

646
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,560
Okay.

647
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:37,200
- Ter!
- Ter!

648
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,480
- Ter!
- Ter!

649
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,280
Panter!

650
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,160
Ter!

651
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,000
Ter! Ter!

652
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,080
Ter! Ter!

653
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,960
Hey, Ter! Ter!

654
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,720
Ter. Ter.

655
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,600
What happened, Ter?

656
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,280
What happened?

657
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,880
How did I even end up here?

658
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,000
Aunt Naree told me to go see her…

659
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,800
And then…

660
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,600
Sara.

661
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:45,880
You…

662
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,520
What are you doing?

663
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,840
I used Panter as bait to lure you here,

664
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,720
to make up for the way
his father betrayed me.

665
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,600
As for you,

666
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,480
congratulations

667
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,680
for getting to live again…

668
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,520
for the last time.

669
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,080
You really think
you'll get away with this?

670
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,600
I'll get away for sure.

671
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,520
But you,

672
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,360
you'll suffer before you die.

673
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,000
I remember now.

674
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,320
That night, it was New Year's Eve.

675
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,400
You weren't afraid of loud noises.

676
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,960
You were afraid of fireworks.

677
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,280
No! No!

678
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,920
Stop! Enough!

679
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,120
Just the sound of fireworks is enough
to turn you back into that stray dog!

680
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:24,520
Mom!

681
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,680
Mom!

682
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,360
Help me!

683
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,080
Dad, help me.

684
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,240
Dad… Mom…

685
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,200
Don't come closer…

686
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,120
You're dying too easily.

687
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,160
I'm still having fun.

688
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,920
You street dog.

689
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:21,920
Hey!

690
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,560
Stop! I said stop!

691
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,440
I won't stop until you're dead!

692
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,040
You!

693
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,520
Die, you bitch!

694
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,560
What the hell?

695
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,440
Did I miss?

696
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,120
Maybe because
I haven't held a gun in a while.

697
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,480
I was wondering

698
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,120
who was setting off
these crazy loud fireworks.

699
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,520
Turns out it's just you.

700
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,520
Here's how it's going to go.

701
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:55,720
You were trying to kill Sara.

702
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,520
But then you two started fighting

703
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,160
and ended up killing each other.

704
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,000
What the hell was that? What do you want?

705
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,360
I'm going to jail anyway.

706
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,280
And you,

707
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,440
you're no help to me.

708
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,160
But if you die, at least

709
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,600
when I'm out of prison,

710
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:26,960
every last dime of the marital assets
will be mine, my dear wife!

711
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,240
Hey! Where are you going?!

712
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,400
No! Phathi!

713
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,200
As for you, you little bitch! Don't move!

714
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,120
You're the reason
I have to wear this damn EM tag.

715
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,080
If you hadn't brought in
someone to blackmail me

716
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,120
to be your witness,

717
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,720
none of this would've
happened to me, you bitch!

718
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:52,800
What the hell?

719
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,040
Let go of me! You bitch! Let go!

720
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:05,960
What the hell's wrong with you?

721
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,120
Let go! I said let go!

722
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,360
- Let go.
- No.

723
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,640
- Phathi! No!
- Let go!

724
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,360
Let go!

725
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,120
Let go!

726
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:37,680
Shit!

727
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,200
- Seoul!
- Seoul!

728
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,080
- Seoul!
- Seoul!

729
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,480
- Seoul. Seoul.
- Seoul.

730
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,200
Seoul!

731
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,040
- Seoul.
- Seoul!

732
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,160
Seoul!

733
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,080
Seoul!

734
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,440
Stay with me, Seoul.

735
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,160
Seoul, please be okay.

736
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,920
Please.

737
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,760
Seoul…

738
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:41,760
Seoul!

739
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,120
Stay with me, Seoul.

740
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,600
Seoul!

741
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,120
You made my son end up like this!

742
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,080
You're dead!

743
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,800
Right now, Naree has people
watching outside Sara's condo.

744
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,160
Kulnaree won't stop hunting her down.

745
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,240
Then please be
extra careful right now, everyone.

746
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,880
We absolutely can't let anyone know

747
00:57:58,960 --> 00:57:59,720
where Sara is.

748
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,560
Mr. Don left his car and disappeared.

749
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:02,640
And that bitch Sara?

750
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,600
I still haven't found her yet.

751
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,440
Where could someone like her
possibly run to?

752
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:10,880
