1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,840
THIS DRAMA IS CREATED
FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,080
ALL CHARACTERS, SETTINGS
AND EVENTS ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,920
THERE IS NO INTENT TO REFERENCE
ANY REAL INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,200
NOR TO PROMOTE INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR
OR UNDERMINE MORAL STANDARDS

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,400
Even when the killer
is standing right in front of you,

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,200
the police still can't do a damn thing.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,480
Shoot her, Bank.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,840
Hey, wait.
We don't know where Kitti is hiding.

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,640
Captain.

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,640
When are you going to arrest me?

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,640
You want to arrest me?

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,120
There he is!

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,920
- Hey, Phleng.
- Phleng!

14
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,440
Ah!

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,920
Kitti!

16
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,080
Huh? Kitti.

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,840
Kitti!

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,120
Kitti.

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,240
Kitti!

20
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,640
Naree!

21
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,000
What happened?!

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,920
Aunt Nan, what happened to Mom?!

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,760
Tell me!

24
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,800
- Panter, get her out of here.
- What's wrong with my mom?!

25
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,920
What happened to her?!

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,840
Aunt Nan, what happened to her?!

27
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,720
Kram, take Sara and run.

28
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,960
Go.

29
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,240
Go.

30
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,720
Captain!

31
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,680
- <i>Let's hide.</i>
- <i>Bank!</i>

32
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,600
SHE'S CRAZY

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,000
<i>It was self-defense.</i>

34
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,040
<i>You saw I was injured, right?</i>

35
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,240
Ugh!

36
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,600
Naree, please surrender.

37
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,800
Stop.

38
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,600
Drop the gun.

39
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,240
Drop it!

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,320
- Phleng, come here!
- Hey!

41
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,280
Ma'am, watch out.

42
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,080
- Phleng, get Sara out of here!
- Go now.

43
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,280
Where are you running to?!

44
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,800
Let go!

45
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,280
Go!

46
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,280
Hurry up.

47
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,640
- Come on.
- Sara, hurry.

48
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,760
Stop!

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,840
Phleng!

50
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,160
Sara, go! Run!

51
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,160
Sara.

52
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,240
ARE THEY GOING TO SURVIVE?

53
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,560
I CAN'T WATCH IT ANYMORE

54
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,880
SHE'S CRAZY

55
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,480
Where are you going?

56
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,600
HIT HER MORE

57
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,760
<i>Phleng, get up.</i>

58
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,720
Let's go.

59
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,720
HIT HER AGAIN

60
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,120
SHE GOT UP

61
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,640
KILL HER

62
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,040
WHY IS SHE SO TOUGH?

63
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,480
SHE'S CRAZY

64
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,240
CRAZY

65
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,680
SHE'S SCARY

66
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,080
KILL HER

67
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,440
SHE'S SO DAMN CRAZY

68
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
SHE'S A PSYCHOPATH

69
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,600
<i>Kamon.</i>

70
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,520
CRAZY

71
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
<i>Phleng.</i>

72
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,240
SHE'S CRAZY

73
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,080
<i>Where are you?</i>

74
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,040
CRAZY PSYCHOPATH

75
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,800
<i>Let's guess, you all.</i>

76
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,000
SHE'S A PSYCHOPATH

77
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,280
CRAZY WOMAN

78
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,520
Phleng IS PRETTY, DON'T DIE

79
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,720
MURDERER

80
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,400
Look, Kamon.

81
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,600
The viewers are reacting
with so much anger.

82
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,800
Come out.

83
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,560
PSYCHOPATH

84
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,920
CRAZY

85
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
CRAZY

86
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,600
Careful. This madwoman
might be waiting outside your house.

87
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,000
Stop!

88
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,640
Clear.

89
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,360
Spread out and search for Sara. Now!

90
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,360
- Yes, sir. Let's go.
- That way, Officer.

91
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,680
Are you okay?

92
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,240
Let's go, Sara.

93
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,440
You!

94
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,960
Do it.

95
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,799
Shoot her, Sara.

96
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,280
Do it. Shoot me.

97
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,240
Shoot.

98
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,080
Shoot!

99
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,000
- It's from upstairs.
- Let's go.

100
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,760
Kulnaree, you crazy bitch!

101
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,160
Sara, shoot her again!

102
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,680
SHE'LL DIE FOR SURE

103
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,080
Ugh!

104
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,160
Ugh!

105
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,360
You wanna fight?!

106
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,920
Phleng!

107
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,840
LIVE

108
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,560
Let go of her!

109
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,480
NOW SHE'LL DIE

110
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,600
DIE

111
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,680
DIE

112
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,400
Is Mom okay?

113
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,480
Phleng.

114
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,480
Stay awake.

115
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,600
Look at me.

116
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,880
Do you hear me?

117
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,200
Do you hear me, Phleng?

118
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,920
Sara. Phleng.

119
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,000
Sara.

120
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,000
Hold on, Phleng.

121
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,120
One suspect has fallen.

122
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,040
Presumed dead.

123
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,920
I was the one…

124
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,600
who pushed her.

125
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,480
Phleng.

126
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,840
Hello? Someone's severely injured.
Please send an ambulance now.

127
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,080
Keep on living
and see this all through with me.

128
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,680
They'll all pay.

129
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,680
You hear me?

130
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,560
I've seen it.

131
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,480
I saw you seek justice…

132
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,680
with your own hands.

133
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,720
No, you have to see this through.

134
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,600
I'm so tired…

135
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,120
No, Phleng! No, don't.

136
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,160
No. Don't go, Phleng.

137
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,880
- Let me rest.
- No, you can't.

138
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,400
No, Phleng.

139
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,240
Phleng, wake up!

140
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,560
Phleng! Wake up!

141
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,280
Phleng!

142
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,880
Phleng, wake up!

143
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,680
Phleng, no!

144
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Phleng, no! Wake up!

145
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,440
Phleng! Wake up!

146
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,800
From last night's shocking incident
that went viral online,

147
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,560
a female suspect
in a 19-year-old murder case

148
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,360
went on a rampage with a firearm,

149
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,480
hunting down a survivor
and whistleblowers of the case.

150
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,040
<i>They had a severe fight.</i>

151
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,640
<i>The suspect is Mrs. Kulnaree Lerthanakul,</i>

152
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,560
<i>heiress to a well-known</i>
<i>real estate empire.</i>

153
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,680
<i>The incident resulted</i>
<i>in injuries and casualties.</i>

154
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,880
<i>Initial reports confirm</i>
<i>that Mrs. Kulnaree has died.</i>

155
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,640
This is also connected to many
other people involved in the case.

156
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,360
And the case has now
entered court proceedings.

157
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,880
Seoul?

158
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
- Seoul's awake. Seoul.
- Seoul.

159
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,840
Seoul, are you okay?

160
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,160
Where is everyone?

161
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,040
Where's Mom?

162
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,680
What happened?

163
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,360
What happened to Mom?

164
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,400
Your mom…

165
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,720
is no longer with us.

166
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,400
Today,

167
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,040
I brought your favorite food, Mom.

168
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,720
I don't know

169
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,080
where you are now,

170
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,440
but don't worry.

171
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,960
We're not fighting anymore.

172
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,560
From now on, I'll take care of her.

173
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,760
<i>The patient has passed the critical stage.</i>

174
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,920
<i>Her body is recovering</i>

175
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,440
<i>faster than we expected.</i>

176
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,160
<i>From what I can tell,</i>
<i>she'll definitely regain consciousness.</i>

177
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,000
<i>Just wait a little longer.</i>

178
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,360
How are you today?

179
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,480
Today, Sara and I

180
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,880
picked out flowers for you.

181
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,880
You hate them, right?

182
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,800
Then just wake up and scold me.
I'm waiting.

183
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,640
It's tomorrow, isn't it?

184
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,160
Are you ready?

185
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,400
Yes.

186
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,000
Don't worry.

187
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,440
The evidence is solid.

188
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,280
How do you feel now that you've succeeded?

189
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,760
A sense of relief…

190
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,920
comes hand in hand with pain.

191
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,720
Not just mine,

192
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,680
but everyone's involved in this.

193
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,760
There's no use sitting here regretting
what we already decided to do.

194
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,440
At best, what we can do

195
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,240
is accept it.

196
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,400
Learn from it.

197
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,840
You can move forward now.

198
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:18,960
Nin.

199
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,200
Thank you for everything.

200
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,160
Thank you.

201
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,240
<i>Kamon deserves justice!</i>

202
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,280
Save Kamon! Save Kamon!

203
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,320
- Louder, everyone.
- Save Kamon! Save Kamon!

204
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,280
Save Kamon! Save Kamon!

205
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,960
- Save Kamon! Save Kamon!
- Right now,

206
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,800
the court is reading the verdict
of a high-profile case

207
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,120
that's been buried for 19 years.

208
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,040
- Today marks an important step
- Save Kamon!

209
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,400
- in restoring dignity to the victims
- Save Kamon!

210
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,720
- and reminding us all that justice
- Save Kamon!

211
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,440
- still exists in Thai society.
- Save Kamon!

212
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,200
- We'll continue following the verdict
- Save Kamon!

213
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,720
- and report it to you
- Save Kamon!

214
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,160
- after the court announces its decision.
- Save Kamon!

215
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,360
Save Kamon!

216
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,880
Criminal case

217
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,640
between the public prosecutor
and Ms. Kamon Tisraksa

218
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,320
as joint plaintiffs

219
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,520
and Mrs. Jira, first defendant,

220
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,160
Mr. Phathi, second defendant,

221
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,000
Mr. Chawadon, third defendant,

222
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,800
Mrs. Woranan, fourth defendant,

223
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,960
and Mr. Chayut, fifth defendant.

224
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,440
After reviewing
all evidence and testimony,

225
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,800
the facts accepted are as follows.

226
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,280
Today on <i>Daily Big Issues</i>,
we're joined by Mr. Sura, attorney at law,

227
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,160
to discuss the trending case

228
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,320
involving the Lerthanakul family.

229
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,720
- Welcome, Mr. Sura.
- Hello.

230
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,960
Let me ask this first.
Now that the verdict is out,

231
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,400
what are the penalties for each defendant?

232
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,520
As we all know,
the main perpetrator, Mrs. Kulnaree,

233
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,160
has passed away.

234
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,840
So, only those who helped
conceal the crime remain.

235
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,160
The evidence
clearly proves that Mrs. Kulnaree

236
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,040
did commit the crime.

237
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,200
Therefore, the remaining defendants

238
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,960
each face different sentences.

239
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,360
<i>Mrs. Jira, though paralyzed,</i>

240
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,800
<i>committed a serious offense</i>

241
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,720
<i>and will be transferred</i>
<i>to the Correctional Hospital.</i>

242
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,280
Mr. Phathi and Mr. Chawadon

243
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,440
also face additional charges.

244
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,280
<i>Mm.</i>

245
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,240
<i>There is child molestation and fraud.</i>

246
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,600
- <i>They'll serve sentences for all offenses.</i>
- Are you messing with me, you jerk?!

247
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,640
- <i>All offenses combined,</i>
- Huh?!

248
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,760
<i>both Mr. Phathi and Mr. Chawadon</i>

249
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,360
- <i>are sentenced to ten years in prison.</i>
- Shut your damn mouth!

250
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,280
<i>Ten years?</i>

251
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,560
- <i>Will it really be ten years?</i>
- Damn you! Hey!

252
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,880
<i>Not some</i>

253
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,120
- <i>reduced sentence scheme?</i>
- They'll get you inside, I swear!

254
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,440
We hope that's the case.

255
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,120
How about Mrs. Woranan, who turned
state witness for the victims?

256
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,640
Despite her involvement,

257
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,480
her testimony benefited the case,

258
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,160
so the court decided
to suspend her sentence.

259
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,480
And Mr. Chayut has Alzheimer's.

260
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,200
<i>Though his symptoms occasionally improve,</i>

261
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,600
<i>the disease is incurable</i>

262
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,800
<i>and still requires ongoing medical care.</i>

263
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,160
<i>The court ruled he be placed</i>
<i>under supervision at a hospital</i>

264
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,000
<i>or suitable facility.</i>

265
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,360
WE BELIEVE IN THE TRUTH

266
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,480
NINETEEN YEARS OF WAITING

267
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,480
JUSTICE EXISTS

268
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,400
WE FIGHT TOGETHER

269
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,280
DON'T LET INJUSTICE WIN

270
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,240
MR. CHAI TISRAKSA
MRS. NAPHA TISRAKSA

271
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,520
It's over now…

272
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,320
Dad…

273
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,840
MR. CHAI TISRAKSA
MRS. NAPHA TISRAKSA

274
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,760
Mom.

275
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
I've won…

276
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,000
justice…

277
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,880
for our family.

278
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,680
They've all received punishment.

279
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,480
I wish you both could be here with me.

280
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,880
I'll try

281
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,760
to live happily.

282
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,320
No.

283
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,200
I will live happily.

284
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,880
Please don't worry anymore.

285
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,480
MR. CHAI TISRAKSA
MRS. NAPHA TISRAKSA

286
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,320
Mom, since you're out
for specialized physical therapy today,

287
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,000
I brought the kids to visit you.

288
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,040
We wanted to visit you, Grandma.

289
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,800
I'll ask Aun Nan to bring us here often,

290
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,680
so you won't feel lonely.

291
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,760
I was angry about what you did to me.

292
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,040
But I've decided.

293
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,920
I forgive you.

294
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,720
And I hope you'll forgive me

295
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,680
for being such a disappointment.

296
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,320
Don't worry, Grandma.

297
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,240
We've learned from our mistakes.

298
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,520
And we won't repeat them.

299
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,240
Hey.

300
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,440
I made a new one for you.

301
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,520
Thank you.

302
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,720
You'll be abroad for treatment

303
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,640
for how long?

304
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,120
I'm not sure yet.

305
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,680
Keep in touch, okay?

306
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,160
Why?

307
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,400
Looking to buy anything from the US?

308
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,560
Oh, Kram.

309
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,320
- Coming to send her off too?
- Uh…

310
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,760
You stay with the kids.

311
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,040
I have Nin with me. I'll be fine.

312
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,720
Well then…

313
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,440
Safe travels.

314
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,000
Let me know when you land.

315
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,600
Here you go.

316
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,640
Enjoy your meal.

317
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,960
- Can I take a photo with you?
- Of course.

318
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,160
Enjoy your meal.

319
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,320
<i>Time cannot turn back</i>

320
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,480
<i>Our clock stopped</i>

321
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,240
<i>On the day you said goodbye</i>

322
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,560
<i>I understand you had your reasons to leave</i>

323
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,880
<i>And I respect your decision</i>

324
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,960
<i>Even if it broke my heart</i>

325
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,840
<i>No matter how long it's been</i>

326
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,760
Phleng?

327
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,280
<i>Nurse.</i>

328
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,880
<i>The patient is awake.</i>

329
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:38,720
<i>I still want to tell you that to me</i>

330
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,520
<i>You're still an important part</i>

331
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,720
<i>Of my everyday life</i>

332
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,000
<i>No matter how long it's been</i>

333
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,760
- <i>You are still…</i>
- It hurts.

334
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,720
Oh! Did that hurt?

335
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,760
Sorry.

336
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:02,600
<i>It still feels like you're right beside me</i>

337
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:07,480
<i>No matter how much time passes</i>
<i>I still miss you</i>

338
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,920
<i>I wonder how you're doing over there</i>

339
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,560
<i>Do you ever think back</i>

340
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,760
<i>To our old memories?</i>

341
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,920
<i>Because I think about us every single day</i>

342
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,320
<i>The time we had together</i>

343
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,200
<i>Still feels so vivid</i>

344
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,920
<i>No matter how long it's been</i>

345
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,960
<i>Or how far we are</i>

346
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:48,600
<i>I still want to tell you that to me</i>

347
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,120
<i>You're still an important part</i>

348
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,080
<i>Of my everyday life</i>

349
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,760
<i>No matter how long it's been</i>

350
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,040
<i>You're still a part of my everyday</i>

351
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:11,760
<i>As if you were still by my side</i>

352
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,600
THREE YEARS LATER

353
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,680
Here.

354
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,400
Here you go. Please enjoy.

355
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,560
Is table five's almost done?

356
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,600
- Almost. Give me a sec.
- Okay.

357
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,840
Here you go.

358
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,080
<i>I wonder how you're doing over there</i>

359
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,320
<i>Do you ever think back…</i>

360
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,360
Chai.

361
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,840
Napha.

362
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,240
Kamon.

363
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,680
<i>An important part</i>

364
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,200
- Kram.
- Yes?

365
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,520
Don't forget to dedicate merits
to Chai and Napha.

366
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,120
I always do, Dad.

367
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,480
And where's Mom?

368
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,280
She's at work.

369
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,440
Oh.

370
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,920
Well, when she gets back,
let's go have barbecue together.

371
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,960
Okay, Dad.

372
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,840
Sure.

373
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,280
Let me see what you've done.

374
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,720
Here.

375
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,240
Here.

376
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,120
Well,

377
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,920
let's go get a PS5.

378
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,920
- Okay?
- Sure.

379
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,760
Are you okay?

380
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,320
Be more careful next time.

381
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,040
And if it was an accident,

382
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,080
you should say sorry.

383
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,920
I'm sorry.

384
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,800
It's okay. This shirt can be washed.

385
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,320
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

386
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,760
<i>Today I tried making a new dish.</i>
<i>The customers loved it.</i>

387
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,000
<i>And I also went to the temple</i>
<i>to make merit for your parents.</i>

388
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,960
<i>How are you?</i>
<i>What's the weather like over there?</i>

389
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,800
<i>I miss you.</i>

390
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,200
<i>I saw the news.</i>
<i>There's a storm over there.</i>

391
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,360
<i>Are you okay?</i>

392
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,440
That's a lot. Why don't you just call her?

393
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,960
I'm not as rude as you.

394
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,560
Maybe she just

395
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,719
doesn't have time to read it.

396
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,679
Three years and she hasn't replied.

397
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,800
Guess she really doesn't have time.

398
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,440
No need to be sarcastic.

399
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,800
I'm doing it because I want to. Look.

400
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,440
She started a new IG account
and posted pictures. See?

401
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,440
She keeps posting
but won't respond to you.

402
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,960
What's there to be happy about?

403
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,840
You just don't get it, do you?

404
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,480
The fact that she's posting
means she's safe and doing well.

405
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,800
She probably just
wants to settle everything first.

406
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,960
But she needs more time.

407
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,239
I'll say it again.

408
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,000
It's been three years.

409
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,960
Judo.

410
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,400
You're fired.

411
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,120
I won't leave.

412
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,640
Hey.

413
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,440
Come on. It's almost New Year's.

414
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,840
Why joke like this? It's not April Fools'.

415
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,760
Fired? Come on.

416
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,200
I'll go take the trash out.

417
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,840
You idiot.

418
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,400
Who are you visiting?

419
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,760
Hope I'm not intruding.

420
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,840
You never texted me back.

421
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,680
Are you upset?

422
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,040
I saw you liked my pictures all the time.

423
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,880
I liked all of them nonstop,
hoping you'd notice and text me back.

424
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,640
I'm sorry.

425
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,840
I just wanted to really
settle everything first.

426
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,640
Why are you laughing?

427
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,160
I just said the exact same thing to Judo,

428
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,400
that you probably wanted
to settle everything first.

429
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,320
See? Even from afar,
I still know you well.

430
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,160
Hm. If you really knew me,

431
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,280
you'd know standing here talking

432
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,120
is super hot.

433
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,760
Of course I know.

434
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,960
Why don't I? I know it's hot outside.

435
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,640
Let's talk inside, shall we?

436
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,840
Let's go.

437
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,880
Actually,

438
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,280
I've been back for two weeks.

439
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,160
But I visited Phleng and Bank,
took care of some things,

440
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,040
and just had free time now.

441
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,320
And are you okay?

442
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,040
I mean, with the treatment.

443
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,240
Yeah, I'm fine.

444
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,840
Right now,

445
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,280
I'm doing really well.

446
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,800
That's good.

447
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,320
And I'm happy for you.

448
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,760
I heard the restaurant won
several awards. You're blowing up.

449
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,920
Well, it's all thanks
to the stir-fried tofu and miso soup

450
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,520
I taught you to make back then.

451
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,440
Let me know when you're free again.

452
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,520
I'll cook it for you.

453
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,000
Sure.

454
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,640
- This time, I promise I'll eat it.
- Perfect.

455
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,440
And Uncle Chayut…

456
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,080
How is he?

457
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,960
He's stable.

458
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,840
He's in the hospital,

459
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,600
but I visit often.

460
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,080
Next time, can I come along?

461
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,600
Of course.

462
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,560
He'd be happy to see you.

463
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,040
Kamon.

464
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,600
I missed you.

465
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,840
Hang on a sec.

466
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,000
Guess who's here?

467
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,520
Sara.

468
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,200
Sara.

469
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,360
Nan.

470
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,720
How are you?

471
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,320
Here.

472
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,800
Need help picking?

473
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,840
- This one too.
- This one.

474
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,760
Hi there.

475
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,480
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

476
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,920
The traffic was insane.

477
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,920
- Really?
- But wow, you got here fast.

478
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:17,040
You missed someone so much,
you rushed over?

479
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,120
What?

480
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,040
<i>Even though we've been through</i>
<i>so much pain,</i>

481
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,920
<i>in the end,</i>

482
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,800
<i>to live is to keep moving forward</i>

483
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,720
<i>and growing every day.</i>

484
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,840
<i>Someone once said</i>

485
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,600
<i>growing up</i>

486
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,480
<i>doesn't mean hurting less.</i>

487
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,360
<i>It means understanding</i>

488
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,480
<i>that pain,</i>

489
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,160
<i>no matter how bad,</i>

490
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,000
<i>will pass.</i>

491
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,720
<i>And today I'm starting to understand that</i>

492
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,720
<i>a little more.</i>

493
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,520
Your food's ready.

494
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,320
Stir-fried tofu and miso soup,

495
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,400
made by me.

496
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,800
Is it not good?

497
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,920
It's the same recipe I once taught you.

498
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,960
It's delicious, Kram.

499
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,800
I missed…

500
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,640
your cooking.

501
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,200
Now,

502
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,320
I can eat

503
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,840
without looking around

504
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,440
or feeling paranoid

505
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,920
that someone might put
something into my food.

506
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,600
Thank you

507
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,120
for trusting me.

508
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,080
<i>The moment we've all been waiting for</i>
<i>is just seconds away.</i>

509
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,560
- <i>We're about to enter a new year</i>
- Oh.

510
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,040
- <i>together.</i>
- Are they setting off fireworks?

511
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,680
- <i>Are you ready to celebrate?</i>
- Wanna go watch the fireworks?

512
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,840
Oh.

513
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,040
Five.

514
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,160
Four.

515
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,880
Three.

516
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,440
Two.

517
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:05,720
One.

518
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,920
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

519
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,920
