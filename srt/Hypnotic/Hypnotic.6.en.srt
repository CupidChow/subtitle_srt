00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,200
THIS DRAMA IS CREATED
FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,240
ALL CHARACTERS, SETTINGS
AND EVENTS ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,600
THERE IS NO INTENT TO REFERENCE
ANY REAL INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,920
NOR TO PROMOTE INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR
OR UNDERMINE MORAL STANDARDS

5
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,120
<i>Start a new life.</i>

6
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,280
<i>From now on, your name is…</i>

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,080
<i>Sara.</i>

8
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,160
Hypnosis

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,320
is the gradual transformation of thought

10
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,320
within the subconscious mind,

11
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,400
guiding one to see pain
from a new perspective

12
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,160
to change their life.

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,520
Our duty

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,240
is to bring this understanding

15
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,240
to those who never had
the chance to be cared for,

16
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,720
those no one notices

17
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,000
that they're slipping away from this world

18
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,160
without even a sound to be heard.

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,120
I'm glad

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,560
you chose this path

21
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,720
and found a new purpose in life.

22
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,880
Move forward

23
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,920
and help others.

24
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,600
<i>Dad! Mom!</i>

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,080
Dad!

26
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,720
Dad!

27
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,640
Mom! Dad!

28
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,440
Mom!

29
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,160
Dad!

30
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,240
Dad!

31
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,520
<i>I've tried to live the way Nin told me to.</i>

32
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,480
<i>Living for myself and for others.</i>

33
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,400
<i>But in the end,</i>

34
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,640
<i>I learned that our purpose in life</i>

35
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,960
<i>can always change.</i>

36
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,560
What?!

37
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,640
What?!

38
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,200
You sent Dad to prison.

39
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,520
I'm ashamed.
Everyone hates our family now.

40
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,480
You traitor.

41
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,400
I should've killed you.

42
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,840
I'll kill you.

43
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,520
- I'll kill you.
- You sent Dad

44
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,960
- I'll kill you.
- to prison.

45
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,640
- You sent Dad to prison.
- No. Go away.

46
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,120
- You sent Dad to prison.
- You traitor.

47
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,560
- You traitor!
- Go away. No!

48
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,959
- You sent Dad to prison!
- Get away from me!

49
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
Let go of me!

50
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,920
Let go of me! No!

51
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,720
<i>Breathe in.</i>

52
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,160
<i>Breathe out. Breathe in.</i>

53
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,800
<i>Breathe out slowly.</i>

54
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,440
<i>This is a safe space.</i>

55
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,360
<i>Only you and me here, Seoul.</i>

56
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,800
<i>You've done your best.</i>

57
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,320
<i>You've helped so many kids.</i>

58
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,560
<i>They're all thankful for your courage.</i>

59
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,560
<i>From now on, everything will feel lighter.</i>

60
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,720
<i>You'll slowly realize</i>

61
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,320
<i>there's nothing to fear anymore.</i>

62
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,760
<i>Trust me. You can trust me.</i>
<i>I'll always be here.</i>

63
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,120
LISTEN TO THIS BEFORE BED

64
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,560
<i>Listen to this before bed.</i>

65
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,320
Ah.

66
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,920
All set.

67
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,880
Are you ready, Masters?

68
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,000
Let's go.

69
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,480
You need to pick up Sydney's things
from her friends first, right?

70
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,000
You want us to get them for you?

71
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,200
It's alright. I'll bring them home
to Miss Sydney myself.

72
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,560
- Please don't worry.
- Okay.

73
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,000
"I'm Sydney,
and I didn't do anything wrong."

74
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,240
Ah!

75
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,320
"I'm Sydney,
and I didn't do anything wrong."

76
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,160
Liar! Psycho!

77
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,120
How are you not wrong?

78
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,240
You're the real problem, girl.

79
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,800
Let's see.

80
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,720
Is it okay?

81
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
Wow, so many people
are laughing in the comments.

82
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,400
This time, Sydney's
definitely resigning, right?

83
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,120
Good. Now no one
can take our number-one spot.

84
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,200
- Yes, girl.
- Yes, girl.

85
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,160
Sherbet!

86
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,520
Sydney. Are you hurt anywhere, honey?

87
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,840
Thank goodness no one got seriously hurt.

88
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,000
Thank you so much

89
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,320
for not making this a big issue.

90
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,200
What did you do?

91
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,960
Why didn't that mother press charges?

92
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,000
Sherbet!

93
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,680
- Hey!
- Hey!

94
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,480
I'll take this as far as it goes.

95
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,720
That girl must go to juvy

96
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,360
or prison, whatever it takes!

97
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,200
And I'll sue the school too

98
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,160
for letting a suspended student

99
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,960
barge into the campus like this!

100
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,520
<i>Ah!</i>

101
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,520
<i>"I'm Sydney,</i>
<i>and I didn't do anything wrong."</i>

102
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,280
<i>Liar! Psycho! How are you not wrong?</i>

103
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,600
<i>You're the real problem, girl.</i>

104
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,480
Are you seriously taking this kid's side?

105
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,200
Sydney tried to commit violence.

106
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,200
But the action wasn't completed yet.

107
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,840
Sherbet's actions weren't right either.

108
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,720
That's cyberbullying.

109
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,720
In some countries,
they can even sue for that.

110
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,960
I was just trying
to find a peaceful solution,

111
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,440
without making this a scandal.

112
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,600
But if you'd rather wait
for Sydney's mother to arrive,

113
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,840
I'm sure she'll turn it
into a headline story.

114
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,960
Sydney's action hasn't been done,

115
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,520
but Sherbet's wrongdoing
has already been done.

116
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,720
Both kids made mistakes.

117
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,080
But to teach them what's right and wrong

118
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,120
is up to us adults.

119
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,240
Sydney.

120
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,240
Even if your friend didn't press charges,
what you did was still wrong.

121
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,040
If I hadn't stopped you,

122
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,680
this might not have ended so well.

123
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,560
But she was mocking me.

124
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
She deserved it.

125
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,000
Even if someone upsets us,

126
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,720
we don't have the right to hurt them.

127
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,200
Then, if you were
the one bullying a friend,

128
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,880
would that friend
have the right to hurt you too?

129
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,280
My girl was just defending herself.

130
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,720
You're not wrong.

131
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,000
You don't need to apologize to anyone.

132
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,120
Go wait in the car.

133
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,240
Thank you for your concern

134
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,080
and for trying to guide my daughter,

135
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,280
but that won't be necessary.

136
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,280
Sydney is still my responsibility.

137
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,600
I can't just ignore this.

138
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,320
You seem frustrated, Mrs. Naree,

139
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,320
because everything
isn't under your control, right?

140
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
Oh, really?

141
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,840
Do you love Sydney?

142
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,840
What mother wouldn't love her child?

143
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,200
But what you're doing right now…

144
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,360
is hurting her.

145
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,600
You might think you're protecting her,

146
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,080
but refusing to teach her to apologize

147
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,080
when she's wrong

148
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,200
only stops her from developing empathy.

149
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,680
Empathy?

150
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,240
That girl should be the one feeling sorry.

151
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,040
She had no right
to treat Sydney like that.

152
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,280
And you shouldn't have stepped in either.

153
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,560
A kid like that deserves a lesson.

154
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,880
If I heard those words from anyone else,

155
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,600
I'd be shocked.

156
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,640
But coming from you,

157
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,600
I'm not surprised.

158
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,880
You sound like you know me well.

159
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,840
I know some people

160
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,520
better than they know themselves.

161
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,440
We're quite alike, aren't we?

162
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,040
I can also tell

163
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,120
there's someone trying
to do things behind my back,

164
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,640
like you're doing.

165
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,560
You intended to get close
to my family from the start,

166
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,480
didn't you?

167
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,720
Of course.

168
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,000
I have to get to know
everyone around Sydney

169
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,480
to ensure the best therapeutic outcome.

170
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,960
Quite determined.

171
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,400
If you were a mountain climber,

172
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,600
you'd probably reach the highest peak.

173
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,480
But you should be careful.

174
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,040
One wrong step

175
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,280
and you could fall. And die.

176
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,040
Anyone who chooses to climb that high

177
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,800
must already be prepared
for the fall, right?

178
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,480
It's fine. Don't worry.

179
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,280
Because I'm sure
I won't be the only one who falls…

180
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,480
and dies.

181
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,160
Could the bug's signal disappear

182
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,520
because they found it?

183
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,120
If that's the case, what do we do next?

184
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,680
They might've found it,

185
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,000
but they still don't know our real goal.

186
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,160
Someone like Kulnaree would gather as much
as she could before making her move.

187
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,080
Then, I think
while she's collecting information,

188
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,280
we should end it all.

189
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,520
About Patee's phone,

190
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,680
I've submitted a request to retrieve
the evidence from the station.

191
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,960
I'll let you know once there's progress.

192
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,560
Thanks, Bank.

193
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,240
And about the other witness
that Aunt Sampao mentioned,

194
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,120
no new lead yet. We'll have
to keep an eye on Kitti for now.

195
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,280
What about you?

196
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,080
What are you gonna do about Aunt Sampao?

197
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,640
Hey, Kram.

198
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,360
- Look.
- What?

199
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,760
Come here.

200
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,600
Aren't you curious what they're doing?

201
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,880
Or maybe

202
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,040
Captain Bank's hitting on your Sara.

203
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,600
Shut your mouth.

204
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,680
Maybe they're just having coffee.
Talking business or something.

205
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,480
If he's really flirting,

206
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,600
why would Plang be there too?
They would come alone.

207
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,160
Hm.

208
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,600
- Such a naive little boy.
- What?

209
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,520
The three of them would meet first,

210
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,920
and then just two.

211
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,920
Hey.

212
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,680
Oh.

213
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,120
They even looked startled
when they saw us.

214
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,040
Hello.

215
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,080
Hello.

216
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,400
Hey, Captain.

217
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,400
Hello.

218
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,520
Wow, it's so quiet here.

219
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,760
Is this a coffee date or what?

220
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,440
- Just a meetup.
- Coincidence.

221
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,760
So, it's…

222
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,080
Sydney had a little trouble at school,

223
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,640
so I asked the officer to meet
for some legal advice.

224
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,680
Wait. Wasn't Sydney suspended?

225
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,640
She was.

226
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,400
But she secretly followed
the boys to school

227
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,040
and tried to hurt a classmate
who mocked her.

228
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,000
I stopped her in time,
so it didn't turn into an issue.

229
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,000
That's why I asked him to find out

230
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:10,520
if Sydney might still face charges.

231
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,400
Well…

232
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,880
Since the act wasn't completed,
she's fine.

233
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,680
And Sara already cleared things up.

234
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,960
I see.

235
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,480
So, was it really a coincidence?

236
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,960
Ow.

237
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,079
Hm?

238
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,960
I'll go to the restroom.

239
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,040
I just wanted to thank you

240
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,640
for the dorayaki

241
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,440
and the ointment you gave me.

242
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,800
I actually used it.

243
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,080
You didn't have to tell me.

244
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,440
Yeah, true.

245
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,160
I just wanted you to know.

246
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,520
Thank you.

247
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,760
For what?

248
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,760
For helping me.

249
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,200
Actually,

250
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,080
you've helped me a lot.

251
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,880
So, I wanted to return the favor.

252
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,600
Actually, I don't need anything in return.

253
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,600
As long as you are who you are

254
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,280
and you're okay, then I'm okay too.

255
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,840
Kram.

256
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,760
Hm?

257
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,640
What kind of person do you think I am?

258
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,640
Honestly, I'm not in a hurry
to define that yet.

259
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,440
But I do want to keep getting to know you,

260
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,920
in case one day, you want to see
yourself from a new perspective.

261
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,080
And I'll be there with you.

262
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,360
Give it to me!

263
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,600
- It's mine!
- You can't.

264
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,320
Give it to me!

265
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,760
You can't.

266
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,840
I'm sorry, Mrs. Jira,
but Miss Sydney refuses to hand it over.

267
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,840
Does my granddaughter pay your salaries?

268
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,480
If I give an order, you follow it.

269
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,400
Otherwise, pack your things and leave!

270
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,680
I'm sorry, miss.

271
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,600
Give it to me!

272
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,160
It's mine!

273
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,640
Hey.

274
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,320
- You'll hurt my daughter.
- Hey.

275
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,280
Mom. You didn't have to go this far.

276
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,400
If you can't keep your daughter in check,

277
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
then I will.

278
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,840
Sydney.

279
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,640
- My iPad!
- Sydney.

280
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,400
Sydney.

281
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,200
Give back what's mine!

282
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,240
Give it to me!

283
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,640
No more sessions with Sara!

284
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,120
Just send her to a mental hospital!

285
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,440
I hate you, Grandma!

286
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,480
Sydney.

287
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,440
Sydney.

288
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,160
Sydney, sweetie.

289
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,480
Sydney.

290
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,560
- Sydney.
- Sydney.

291
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,720
What are you doing?

292
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,640
The hell are you doing?

293
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,840
Everyone hates me.

294
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,760
I don't want to live anymore.
I'm going to die.

295
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,480
Sydney, no.

296
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,160
I love you.

297
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,280
If you love me,

298
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,760
then give me back what's mine.

299
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,360
Mom, if you let this continue,

300
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,560
the blame will fall on all of us,

301
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,920
especially you.

302
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,520
I don't care.

303
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,480
Grandma, why would
you say something like that?

304
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,520
She's never once shown remorse,

305
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,520
and now she's pulling this stunt
just to get attention.

306
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,920
Do it. Then you'll finally learn

307
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,480
that no one will indulge you forever.

308
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,000
Sydney, wait.

309
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,120
Sydney, no.

310
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,680
You want your granddaughter to die?!

311
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,000
Is that what you want?

312
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,760
Sydney.

313
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,760
Sydney.

314
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,680
Sydney, don't.

315
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,160
Jumping won't make anything better.

316
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,840
It'll only break my heart.

317
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,480
Mom.

318
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,360
Please give back what's hers.

319
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,520
I'll personally supervise
her social media use from now on.

320
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,600
Please, Mom.

321
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,200
What's going on?

322
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,280
What?! Sydney!

323
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,200
Hey.

324
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,360
What's going on here?

325
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,200
Sydney's upset
that Grandma took away her iPad.

326
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,600
Hurry up.

327
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,160
- Sydney!
- Sydney.

328
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,280
I hate Grandma!

329
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,120
- Hurry.
- I hate Grandma!

330
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,240
Ah!

331
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,560
Sydney.

332
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,560
- Sydney!
- Don't do it!

333
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,520
- Sydney!
- Sydney!

334
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,880
Sydney, don't.

335
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,360
No, Sydney.

336
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,360
- No.
- Sydney.

337
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,520
No!

338
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,000
Hey!

339
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,200
Sydney!

340
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,760
- Sydney.
- Sydney.

341
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,200
Sydney.

342
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,280
Sydney.

343
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,960
Hello, Mrs. Waranun?

344
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,000
Yes, I'll be right there.

345
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,080
Why did Nun call you?

346
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,200
If something happens to Sydney,

347
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,400
it's on you, Mom.

348
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,440
Hello?

349
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,720
What?

350
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,440
Text it to me.

351
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,760
My team said they've just found

352
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,200
the owner of the number
that sent the clip to Nun.

353
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,040
Is this

354
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,080
the one who sent Patee's video to Nun?

355
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,920
He's a decoy for sure.

356
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,800
Someone must've paid him
to activate this number and use it.

357
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,280
Whoever's behind reopening this case

358
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,800
has planned it all meticulously.

359
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,880
What plan?

360
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,760
How's Sydney doing?

361
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,560
How did you know she was here?

362
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,200
You got here awfully fast,

363
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,240
almost like you were waiting.

364
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,720
I told her to come.

365
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,200
We need Sara now.

366
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,600
Sydney's situation

367
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,800
is beyond what we can handle.

368
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,720
Aren't you blowing this out of proportion?

369
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,840
Why drag Sara and Kram into this?

370
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,280
Our niece jumped off a balcony.

371
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,000
Isn't that big enough already?

372
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,600
We can't keep pretending
nothing's happening.

373
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,120
Sydney is seriously ill.

374
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,040
She needs professional care.

375
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,920
How dare you say your niece isn't normal.

376
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,880
Your daughter isn't normal, Naree.

377
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,960
I raised my daughter well.

378
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,800
There's nothing wrong with her.

379
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,520
Stop lying to yourself.

380
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,600
Sydney is not your daughter.
Stay out of this.

381
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,040
But she's still my niece.

382
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,320
I don't care if you're sick or crazy,

383
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,240
but I won't let this happen to my niece.

384
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,600
I feel sorry for her.

385
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,200
Dear, calm down.

386
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,520
Have you even talked to your daughter

387
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,600
since Patee was arrested?

388
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,680
Have you ever thought about how she feels?

389
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,760
You keep saying you can handle it,

390
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,880
but your way of handling things is wrong.

391
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,600
That's why everything's falling apart.

392
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,560
Do you even feel anything?

393
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,920
All you ever do is say,

394
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,360
"If anything happens to Sydney,

395
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,640
it'll be Mom's fault." You're wrong.

396
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,440
If something happens to Sydney,

397
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,760
it'll be your fault.

398
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,640
Does she have to kill someone first

399
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,360
for you to admit she's not okay?

400
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,160
Stop blaming everyone else
and look in the mirror.

401
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,280
Both you and Patee

402
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,880
raised your kids terribly.

403
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,880
Hey.

404
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,120
Nun.

405
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,360
Please stop.

406
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,160
If you're going to blame someone,

407
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,760
don't blame me.

408
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,480
Blame her.

409
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,440
She's the reason
this family is such a mess.

410
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,880
If she hadn't come in
and tried to fix everything,

411
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,040
none of this would've happened.

412
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,680
Right, Ms. Sara?

413
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,360
I suppose my answer

414
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,480
doesn't matter anymore,

415
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,280
since you've already judged me.

416
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,480
I judged you?

417
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,160
You once volunteered

418
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,480
as a helper at Patee's Foundation.

419
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,720
Then you applied for a job
at Le Thana Group.

420
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,200
And later, you volunteered again
to counsel Sydney.

421
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,120
All of that was just coincidence, right?

422
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,880
But wait.

423
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,040
That's not all.

424
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,560
This brilliant psychologist here

425
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,640
also hid a bug
inside the doll she gave Sydney.

426
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,080
This woman who pretends to care

427
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,680
has been around
our family for a long time.

428
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,240
I'm sure she already knows
plenty of our secrets.

429
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,120
That might just be a misunderstanding.

430
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,320
Everything she said is true.

431
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,040
I graduated

432
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,800
wanting to use my knowledge

433
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,320
to work in reputable organizations

434
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,360
and gain experience.

435
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,240
Does anyone believe that?

436
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,760
Anyone? Raise your hand if you do.

437
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,160
Anyone?

438
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,840
No one.

439
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,760
The first two times
were just coincidences.

440
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,120
But they showed me how people like you

441
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,960
raise your children.

442
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,920
The third time,

443
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,200
I decided

444
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,840
I was going to help Sydney for real.

445
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,120
Do you really think

446
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,400
I can control Sydney's behavior?

447
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,440
Not at all.

448
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,960
If she didn't behave the way she did,

449
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,240
I wouldn't even be here.

450
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,720
And this bug.

451
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,240
Why did you plant it?

452
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,280
Because I can never know

453
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,560
whether the people who come to me for help

454
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,440
are telling me the truth.

455
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,400
And especially for children,

456
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,960
sometimes,

457
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,120
they don't even realize
what they're facing.

458
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,320
They don't know what their family thinks

459
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,040
or what's really happening.

460
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,480
Liar.

461
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,000
If I just wanted an easy job,

462
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,440
I could've followed the textbook,
never taking risks.

463
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,040
Just following protocol.

464
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,960
I wouldn't need to care
whether I could help or not.

465
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,160
I could attend the therapy sessions,

466
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,960
signed the reports,

467
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,680
and collected my pay.

468
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,200
No need to rush over here
just to get slapped.

469
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,280
I admit

470
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,560
what I did was wrong.

471
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,440
But if I had to choose again,
I'd still do it.

472
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,160
No,

473
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,120
I'd do it better.

474
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,840
So that what happened today

475
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,160
would never happen again.

476
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,600
Everything I've done

477
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,320
was for Sydney's own good.

478
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,680
But if what I did

479
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,440
offended everyone,

480
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,120
then I'm sorry.

481
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,720
She's been discharged from the ER.

482
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,280
Only the family members.

483
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,280
It didn't hurt, right?

484
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,600
The patient is safe now.

485
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,680
She has a simple left-arm fracture,
no displacement,

486
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,400
no complications.

487
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,680
There's no injury to the head or spine.

488
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,320
We've already applied a cast.

489
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,360
She'll need some time to recover.

490
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,280
I'll be going now.

491
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,000
Thank you.

492
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,120
Dear.

493
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,400
Go get your wound treated.

494
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,520
It's not that bad.

495
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,960
If you want to ask something, just ask.

496
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,320
If I ask, will you tell me the truth?

497
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,440
Depends on what you want to believe.

498
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,960
Then, if I ask and you lie,

499
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,680
I think silence would feel better.

500
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,920
Why does it matter so much to you?

501
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,280
Because I want to trust you.

502
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,080
Ever since you started treating Sydney,

503
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,480
I've seen changes in her.

504
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,600
Sure, she still acts out sometimes.

505
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,480
But at least, when she talks to me now,

506
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,600
she doesn't only talk about her pain.

507
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,120
Because she has you to talk to.

508
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,600
That's what I think.

509
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,400
And as for what Naree said,

510
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,040
even if it's true,

511
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,679
I don't think you have any ill-intent.

512
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,560
Because ever since I've known you,

513
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,840
I've never seen it.

514
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,880
So…

515
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,320
are you going to ask or not?

516
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,360
Did you deliberately approach
the Lerthanakul family

517
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,000
for some specific reason?

518
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,040
Yes.

519
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,800
What reason?

520
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,200
I won't answer that

521
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,320
because I don't want to lie to you.

522
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,480
But it's not something bad, right?

523
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,920
Like I said,
that depends on how you see it.

524
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,920
So,

525
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,240
are you going to tell them?

526
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,280
I…

527
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,200
I don't know yet.

528
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,960
Yes, Bua?

529
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,960
Huh? What happened to Dad?

530
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,160
Bua, how's Dad?

531
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,040
I'm so sorry, Mr. Kram.

532
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,360
I was busy calling the ambulance
and didn't have time to tell you.

533
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,040
But the doctor said
your father's safe now.

534
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,800
- Alright.
- This way, please.

535
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,360
MR. CHAYUT CHAROENPAKDEECHAI

536
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,920
Dad, how are you feeling?

537
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,120
Does it hurt?

538
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,520
Stay strong, okay?

539
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,680
Ouch!

540
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,880
Ouch! Ow!

541
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,000
Kamon.

542
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,680
Kamon, are you alright?

543
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,560
Kamon.

544
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,520
Kamon.

545
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,600
Kamon, are you alright?

546
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,120
Kamon, are you alright?

547
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,120
I'm sorry, Kamon.

548
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,120
I'm sorry, Kamon.

549
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,920
I'm sorry.

550
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,160
Please forgive me.

551
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,160
Please forgive me, Kamon.

552
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,320
I'm sorry.

553
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,560
I'm sorry, Kamon.

554
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,560
Please forgive me. Please.

555
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,080
Dad.

556
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,360
Dad.

557
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,400
Dad, let go of her.

558
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,400
Dad.

559
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,400
Her name is Sara, not Kamon.

560
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,520
Could you wait outside for a moment?

561
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,360
Hey, I'm sorry.
My dad's symptoms are flaring up again.

562
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,640
- Mr. Kram.
- Yes?

563
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,640
I downloaded footage
from the front security camera.

564
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,120
Here.

565
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,240
I'm not sure who he went to meet.

566
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,120
But I only went inside
to grab his medicine,

567
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,320
and the next thing I knew,

568
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,280
he was shouting.

569
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,600
<i>Get out!</i>

570
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,920
<i>I've already talked to your boss!</i>

571
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,120
<i>I gave them all the evidence! Now leave!</i>

572
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,480
<i>And don't come back!</i>

573
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,080
Isn't that Kitti?

574
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,240
Why would he come to see my dad?

575
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,920
<i>If no one comes, then fine.</i>

576
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,120
<i>But if anyone contacts you or your nephew</i>

577
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,040
<i>about that case from 19 years ago,</i>

578
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,720
<i>call me right away.</i>

579
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,720
<i>Okay.</i>

580
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,800
Have you spoken to the other person yet?

581
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,360
The other one shouldn't be a problem.
I'll talk to him.

582
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,120
Plang, I know now

583
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,440
who the other witness is.

584
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,560
EVERYONE KNOWS SARA

585
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,600
APPRECIATION
FOR THE YOUNG PSYCHOLOGIST IS GOING VIRAL

586
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,440
#MINDBALANCECLINIC
#SARATHEPSYCHOTHERAPIST

587
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,800
<i>Everyone, don't be alarmed.</i>
<i>I'm just happy.</i>

588
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,840
<i>My little one can now go to school</i>
<i>without crying.</i>

589
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,640
<i>She looks so much happier.</i>

590
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,960
<i>I took her to see Ms. Sara,</i>
<i>a child psychologist,</i>

591
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,080
<i>and honestly,</i>

592
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,600
<i>it helped so much.</i>

593
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,880
<i>I just wanted to share this</i>
<i>with other parents out there.</i>

594
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,040
<i>If you're tired,</i>

595
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,640
<i>open your mind and get someone to help</i>
<i>fix your child's behavior.</i>

596
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,000
<i>So, what are we eating today, Lego?</i>

597
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,080
<i>Anything you cook, Dad.</i>

598
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,560
LUCIA IS SAYING GOODBYE TO MS. SARA
TO GO STUDY ABROAD

599
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,040
Did you deliberately approach
the Lerthanakul family

600
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,520
for some specific reason?

601
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,760
Yes.

602
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,160
What reason?

603
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,920
I won't answer that

604
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,040
because I don't want to lie to you.

605
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,560
What exactly are you planning to do?

606
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:15,600
CHOKE DEE ORANGE ORCHARD

607
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,400
CHOKE DEE ORANGE ORCHARD

608
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,960
Excuse me.

609
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,000
My car broke down
right in front of your farm.

610
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,120
I couldn't get it started.
Do you know any local mechanics nearby?

611
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,120
Uh. So,

612
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,440
go take a look at his car, will you?

613
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,480
- Sure, Auntie.
- Thank you.

614
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,000
Your oranges look really good.
Are they from your orchard?

615
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,120
Yes.

616
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,720
It's just me

617
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:26,040
and my nephew taking care of this place.

618
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,920
I see.

619
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,280
My name's Bank.

620
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,360
Call me Aunt Sampao.

621
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,480
- Aunt Sampao?
- Mm.

622
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,560
The one who ran
the small grocery in Bangkok, right?

623
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,280
I'm Bank, one of the kids from
the construction site. I'm Na's son.

624
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:53,000
Oh. Ah.

625
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,200
Yes.

626
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,120
Oh, yeah.

627
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,200
- Here, have some water.
- Thank you.

628
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,800
What a small world.
I never thought I'd see you again.

629
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,720
So, what brings you here?

630
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,840
I had some errands nearby.

631
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,640
But I'm really glad I ran into you.

632
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,640
When you moved,
I didn't know where else to buy snacks.

633
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,920
So, why did you suddenly move out here?

634
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,440
There were a few problems back then.

635
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,160
- Bank.
- Hm?

636
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,560
The mechanic's checking your car.
They'll drive it back here.

637
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,120
Alright, thank you.

638
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,320
Long time no see. How have you been?

639
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,480
I'm fine. Lucky the car broke down here.

640
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,640
If not, you'd be in trouble.

641
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:39,680
Yeah.

642
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,760
So, go finish juicing those oranges.

643
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,160
- Yes, Auntie.
- Right.

644
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,760
- Aunt Sampao.
- Yes?

645
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,640
Your house looks so peaceful.

646
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,280
You mind if I take a walk?
I need to use the restroom too.

647
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,200
Of course, go ahead.

648
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,520
If you'd like a tour around the orchard,

649
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,040
have So take you

650
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,320
while you're waiting for your car.

651
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,680
Just tell So if you want to.

652
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,600
- Thank you.
- Sure.

653
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,920
I'll go check the setup real quick.

654
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,680
Okay. Video and audio, both clear.

655
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,000
You did it so smoothly, Officer.

656
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,640
You said it like I'm a con artist.

657
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,480
Hello, test.

658
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,240
<i>Hello, test.</i>

659
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,840
You guys told me to hide a small camera

660
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:23,000
and a tiny speaker
inside Aunt Sampao's room.

661
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:25,960
You're not monitoring her
or eavesdropping on her.

662
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,240
So, what exactly are you guys doing?

663
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:30,280
Yeah, exactly.

664
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,000
What are we supposed to get from her?

665
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,680
Right now, she's still scared.

666
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,240
She's afraid of facing
the consequences of what she did.

667
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,640
If we pressure her too hard,
she might run again.

668
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:46,120
What we need to do
isn't to force her to talk,

669
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,120
but to change her mindset.

670
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,680
Make her believe that standing with us

671
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,880
is the right thing to do.

672
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,840
And you think you can really change her?

673
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,960
If she could've come to her senses,

674
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,560
she would've done it a long time ago.

675
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:06,000
With this method, she won't even realize
her thoughts are slowly shifting.

676
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,800
<i>She'll feel that telling the truth</i>

677
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,400
<i>is her way to free herself.</i>

678
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,200
We'll plant that idea

679
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,720
deep in her subconscious,

680
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,560
the guilt she's carried all these years.

681
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,800
Will it even work?

682
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,800
That subconscious-shifting thing
you talked about.

683
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,920
She will believe that telling the truth
is the only way

684
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,320
to free her from her nightmare.

685
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,160
<i>Aunt Sampao, it's me, Kamon.</i>

686
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:50,400
Tell the truth.

687
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,920
<i>Those three seem unusually close.</i>

688
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,360
So, you're not going
to do anything about it?

689
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,320
I already did everything I had to.
It won't be long now.

690
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,960
They'll pay for what they did to us.

691
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,640
I'm thinking of letting Sara
move into the house,

692
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,040
to help care for the kids.

693
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,840
If you live with them,

694
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,920
we might uncover even more clues.

695
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:17,440
What are you planning to do?

696
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,960
I've got something to take care of.

697
