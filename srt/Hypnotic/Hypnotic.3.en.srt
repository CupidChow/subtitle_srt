PURPOSES. CHARACTERS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,920
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS. THERE'S NO INTENT

TP 3443

6
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,400
Alright!

7
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,440
And who the hell was following you?

8
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,720
Why were you so careless?

9
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,880
Idiot.

10
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,800
I'm sorry.

11
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,800
Every time Kitti brings him the money,

12
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,080
he never picks the same location.

13
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,480
That's already very cautious.

14
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,840
- So, someone must know what we're doing.
- Quiet.

15
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,840
You always tremble
when you talk about this.

16
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,040
You can tremble till you die,
I don't care.

17
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,960
Just don't make it worse
for the rest of us.

18
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,440
I'll ask a friend to help check
the security cams nearby.

19
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,120
If the license plate is caught,

20
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,240
we might know who it is.

21
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,400
I checked my dashcam.

22
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,000
It was a fake plate.

23
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,560
They came well-prepared.

24
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,680
I'm sick of this already.

25
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,960
There's only a few months left before
the statute of limitations runs out.

26
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,840
We can't afford to screw up now.

27
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,440
Understood?!

28
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,360
I'll try tracking from this logo.

29
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,720
Maybe it'll tell us who that person is.

30
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,640
Why does Kitti have to keep
sending money all the time?

31
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,120
You sure you weren't injured?

32
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,320
Yeah, totally fine.
No need to worry about me.

33
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,040
But that plan…

34
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,360
You're really going through
with it, aren't you?

35
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,040
Hello.

36
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,400
Is this Mr. Kram?

37
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,080
FRIENDS OF PATEE FOUNDATION

38
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,080
Come on, kids.

39
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,000
- Let's take a picture together. Come on.
- Look here. One, two, three.

40
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,000
One more.

41
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,920
- Smile.
- One, two, three.

42
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,880
ARE YOU HAPPY, PIA?
UNCLE PATEE BROUGHT YOUR FRIENDS TO YOU

43
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,960
Well…

44
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,760
You must miss your friends so much.

45
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,120
Um…

46
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,600
Wanna go play with them already?

47
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
How about this?

48
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,600
Next time,
let's come visit Pia again, okay?

49
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,000
- Yes.
- Okay.

50
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,640
But you'll have to promise me

51
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,440
you'll always play safely.

52
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,760
So no one falls off balconies
like Pia did. Understood?

53
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,040
- Understood.
- Understood.

54
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,000
Good. Right, Pia?

55
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,960
Let's take another photo, shall we?

56
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,320
- Alright.
- Okay, look at the camera. Smile.

57
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,840
One, two, three.

58
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,600
PRAMOON KONGSATIDKUL, M.D.
PSYCHIATRIST

59
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,800
Who drew this picture?

60
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,400
My daughter.

61
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,200
Her therapist asked her
to draw it during a session.

62
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,040
That's quite the depiction
of a broken family.

63
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,920
It doesn't match
the public image you put out at all.

64
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,920
Everyone's so distant.

65
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,840
There are problems,

66
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,280
both in and out of the house.

67
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,440
What does that mean?

68
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,040
The picture,

69
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,080
the lines,

70
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,120
the colors,

71
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,080
and the shapes…

72
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,120
They all tell a story.

73
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,480
If your daughter really drew this,

74
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,240
then this is how she sees her family

75
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,080
in her mind.

76
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,000
If you want a deeper analysis,

77
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,880
I'll need some time.

78
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,520
But I can already say this.

79
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,240
If a therapist told her to draw this,

80
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,000
they probably know more
about your family than you think.

81
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,840
Just from one picture?

82
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,920
If they're really skilled,

83
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,600
they might even know
each person's deepest secrets.

84
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,520
That's the power of the human psyche.

85
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,720
You really do live up
to your reputation, Dr. Pramoon.

86
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,080
<i>It's not just a simple drawing after all.</i>

87
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,760
But why would she want
to know about your family?

88
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,760
Could she be

89
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,360
Mrs. Jira's enemy?

90
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,360
I'm not sure.

91
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,960
But to be honest,
our family has plenty of enemies.

92
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,640
But if Sara really is one of them,

93
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,240
and she managed to get this close，
she's no ordinary person.

94
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,600
Don't tell anyone about this yet.

95
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,960
Go investigate everything
about Sara for me.

96
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,440
Yes, ma'am.

97
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,000
Will you be heading home now?

98
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,039
<i>Thank you for coming to cook</i>
<i>for the children.</i>

99
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,840
Sure.

100
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,440
They'll be so happy to eat
delicious food from your restaurant.

101
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,280
Mr. Patee's foundation seems warm
and welcoming toward the children.

102
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,800
But what you see
might not be what it really is.

103
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,760
We've seen his livestreams before,

104
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,760
and it looked like Mr. Patee

105
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,680
didn't treat all the kids equally.

106
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,480
The whole atmosphere felt off.

107
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,280
It's like the kids
were being forced to join activities.

108
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,680
And after the livestream ended,

109
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,520
it was deleted right away.

110
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,400
What were they doing
during the livestream?

111
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,040
They were drawing.

112
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,040
Thank you again for hosting a meal
for the children, Ms. Sara.

113
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,920
I wish I could do it more often myself,

114
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,680
but honestly, I barely make ends meet.

115
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,480
I just make enough to get by each day.

116
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,000
How much are you planning to donate?

117
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,680
Wow, with all that gold,

118
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,240
you only "get by"?

119
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,280
Whose drawings are these two?

120
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,080
This one's by Kie.

121
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,160
And this one's Pia's.

122
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,800
That day, Mr. Patee
came to run activities with the kids,

123
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,920
so they drew pictures together.

124
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,120
These two are close friends,

125
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,440
so they drew funny pictures of Mr. Patee.

126
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,440
So, where are they now?

127
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,840
Pia's in the hospital.

128
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,400
She fell off the balcony
and is still recovering.

129
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,000
And Kie's at the playground in the back.

130
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,000
She's only close to Pia.

131
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,120
So, without her around,
she doesn't really play with the others.

132
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,640
Are you not joining the others?

133
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,360
Your name is Kie, right?

134
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,360
You must be lonely without Pia around.

135
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,440
I saw the picture you drew earlier.

136
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,880
It's beautiful…

137
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,120
and very unique.

138
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,800
- Pick whichever one you want.
- Here you go.

139
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,040
Okay.

140
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,200
- Alright.
- Here.

141
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,440
Take it.

142
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,320
Which one?

143
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,600
- Here you go.
- Here.

144
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,600
- Which one?
- Here.

145
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,160
Here.

146
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,040
- This one too.
- Which one do you want?

147
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,320
This one? Okay.

148
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,560
- Here you go.
- Alright.

149
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,440
Hello, Mrs. Naree.
You didn't tell us you were coming.

150
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,920
I'll have someone prepare the guest room.

151
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,120
No need.

152
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,040
I just saw the page posted
someone was donating food for the kids,

153
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,640
so I dropped by to take a look.

154
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,160
- Hello, Naree.
- Hello, Director.

155
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,120
What inspired you
to host a meal for the kids, Kram?

156
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,320
Ms. Sara wanted to treat them,

157
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,320
so she contacted my restaurant
to help make it happen.

158
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,440
That's strange.

159
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,720
You're acting strange too.

160
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,720
Normally, you don't come
to the foundation. But you're here today.

161
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,800
Not sure if it's a coincidence…

162
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,080
or intentional.

163
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,400
No.

164
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,680
- Kram.
- Hm?

165
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,840
Since Mrs. Naree arrived,
hasn't the whole vibe become gloomy?

166
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,040
Hey.

167
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,880
But you're right.

168
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,400
If I didn't know you were a psychologist,

169
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,960
I would've thought
you were an art teacher.

170
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,840
You're always having kids draw and color.

171
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,160
Art can be a great way to heal the mind.

172
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,960
You really are full of love
and goodwill for children.

173
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,560
I've just been through something strange.

174
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,040
So, I wanted to do something
that could bring me

175
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,080
a little peace of mind.

176
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,760
What a coincidence.

177
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,560
Lately, I've been dealing
with strange things around me too.

178
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,560
I received a strange package

179
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,960
at the clinic.

180
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,160
Never experienced
anything like that before.

181
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,440
Really?

182
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,960
Well, you're kind of famous.

183
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,360
Maybe it was a fan sending a gift?

184
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,840
I thought so too.

185
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,320
But it must've been a fan…

186
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,120
with some serious emotional instability,

187
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,880
judging by how special that gift was.

188
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,160
Actually,

189
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
I don't just work with children.

190
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,080
Even adults with a vicious nature…

191
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,480
I can treat those too.

192
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,120
Would you be able to help find

193
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,680
someone like that?

194
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,440
Nice coloring, by the way.

195
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,640
Yours is also…

196
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,920
unique

197
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,280
and complex.

198
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,320
From just looking at a small sculpture,

199
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,040
you can analyze all that?

200
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,320
That's impressive.

201
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,680
I'd love to know

202
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,760
if you analyzed one of Sydney's drawings,

203
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,840
what kind of story would come out.

204
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,480
That's so intriguing.

205
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,720
Actually,

206
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,280
this sculpture

207
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,560
was inspired by you, Ms. Sara.

208
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,400
With blood all over the neck.

209
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,720
What a coincidence.

210
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,320
Because mine was inspired by you too.

211
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,079
Beautiful…

212
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,480
but filthy.

213
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,240
- Need help?
- No, thank you.

214
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,040
Is something going on
between you and Naree?

215
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,920
I feel a strange vibe.

216
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,560
She doesn't seem to like me much

217
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,240
ever since
I started taking care of Sydney.

218
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,760
Then why does she have
to watch you so closely?

219
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,640
Last time, when you asked me
to let you know

220
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,400
if I found out anything from Sydney.

221
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,560
And you went to the foundation today.
Was there some other reason behind it?

222
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,360
You're free to think whatever you want.

223
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,920
But I'd rather hear it from you.

224
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:10,080
If you say there's nothing,
then I'll believe I was just overthinking.

225
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,880
Well, I just wanted to see it for myself

226
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,080
whether the foundation
that contributed to Sydney's problems

227
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,160
was hiding something.

228
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,240
And if you think I was using you,

229
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,200
I won't deny that.

230
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,560
And if you really did use me,

231
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,600
did it work?

232
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,360
Sara.

233
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,120
Let's go.

234
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,280
Thank you. You helped me so much today.

235
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,880
Of course.

236
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,240
Pia.

237
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,400
You haven't smiled at me today.

238
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,360
Come on. Don't cry.

239
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,520
I brought so many friends
to visit you today.

240
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,320
Weren't you happy?

241
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,560
Don't cry.

242
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:26,720
Stop crying.

243
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,840
I said stop.

244
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,360
You're not being very nice, Pia.

245
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,960
You fell off the balcony
and broke your leg

246
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,600
because you were trying to escape, right?

247
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,120
Don't think I don't know.

248
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,600
Pia…

249
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,120
If you don't try to write
and tell everyone what I've done,

250
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,560
I won't hurt your other friends.

251
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,000
You understand, right, sweetheart?

252
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,520
I'm not letting you die that easily.

253
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,600
You'll be with me

254
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,440
for a long time.

255
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,520
CHOKE DEE ORANGE ORCHARD

256
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,640
You still haven't picked up
the money envelope?

257
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,320
MR. CHAI TIDRAKSA

258
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:46,960
Auntie.

259
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,400
Aunt Sampao.

260
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,880
I'm sorry for your loss, Kamon.
And you too, Napa.

261
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,080
I heard the news.

262
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,680
I'd closed the shop
and had errands to run in Chantaburi.

263
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,080
I just got back.

264
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,160
I heard you're looking for evidence
from the day Chai died, right?

265
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,920
Yes.

266
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,120
While I was in Chantaburi,

267
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,640
someone contacted me
asking to buy the CCTV footage.

268
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,240
I was shocked.
I had no idea what was going on.

269
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,680
So, I thought I'd wait

270
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,200
and ask you two first.

271
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,800
That's all there is. Can it help?

272
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,600
It can help, Auntie.

273
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,760
It clearly shows a car
chasing and hitting Chai.

274
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,080
Can we use this
as evidence for the police?

275
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,880
Of course, you can.
I'll have my nephew, So,

276
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,120
turn it into a file for you.
I don't know how to do it myself.

277
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,960
We've got the proof now, Mom.

278
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,120
Thank you so much, Auntie.

279
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,040
Seoul.

280
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,520
There's something I want to talk about.

281
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,920
About your father.

282
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,080
If you want to know anything,
ask him yourself.

283
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,800
Why don't you like
Sydney's friends coming over?

284
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,160
I saw it when they came last time.

285
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,600
- Sydney!
- Sydney!

286
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,080
Nam-oon! Nina!

287
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,360
Why are you two here?

288
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,640
You weren't really upset.
You looked paranoid.

289
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,600
I wasn't paranoid. I was just annoyed.

290
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,240
Excuse me.

291
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,800
Have you seen Seoul?

292
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,280
Seoul.

293
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,560
Seoul.

294
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,760
What's wrong? Didn't hear me calling?

295
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,040
Ter.

296
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,800
If someone you know
did something really bad,

297
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,160
what would you do?

298
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,680
Depends on how close I am to them.

299
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,360
But if it's you, I'd help you.

300
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,440
But help doesn't mean
covering up what you did.

301
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,600
I'd help find the best solution.

302
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,120
If I only help you,
it wouldn't be fair to the other party.

303
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,600
Right?

304
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,200
Are you worried that Seoul
might have done something wrong?

305
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,440
Mm.

306
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,640
Panter came to talk to me.

307
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,440
He said it felt like
Seoul was hiding something.

308
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,640
But he didn't want to pressure him.

309
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,160
Seoul and Patee
don't really understand each other.

310
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,000
Actually, same goes for him and Naree.

311
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,320
I don't know when it started, but lately,

312
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,680
it's pretty obvious.

313
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,040
The eldest son of the family

314
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,800
should've been the favorite, right?

315
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,760
That's true, but Seoul's
not really the competitive type.

316
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,680
So, maybe he didn't turn out
the way Naree expected.

317
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,760
So, she ended up putting
her expectations on Sydney.

318
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,560
When he first started being an influencer,
Seoul was really happy.

319
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,200
But over time,

320
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,680
it felt like people were using him
for their own gain.

321
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,840
I feel bad for him.

322
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,800
It seems like

323
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,320
no one's truly listening to him.

324
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,840
Not even his own family.

325
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,320
But that's how it is.

326
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,080
Kids this age tend to run to their friends

327
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,960
or people outside the family.

328
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,840
Because those people feel less judgmental.

329
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,480
You can try asking

330
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,880
Seoul to come talk to me.

331
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,080
Are you using me right now?

332
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,800
Weren't you the one
who came to see me first?

333
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,480
But if you think I'm using you,

334
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,560
would you let me?

335
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,720
<i>Because mine was inspired by you too.</i>

336
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,680
<i>Beautiful…</i>

337
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,800
<i>but filthy.</i>

338
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,920
<i>This was inspired by you, Ms. Sara.</i>

339
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,600
<i>With blood all over the neck.</i>

340
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,040
From the picture Sydney drew,

341
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,040
she is jealous that her father spends
more time with the kids at the foundation.

342
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,120
But think about it. What kind of father
would rather spend time with other kids

343
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,680
than his own?

344
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,680
What are those marks?

345
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,880
Is it abuse?

346
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,040
The bruising on the soft palate…

347
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,560
It can come from many causes.

348
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,640
But given the child's age
and all the information we have,

349
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,120
I'm very confident

350
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,360
that this mark came from sexual abuse.

351
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,520
Patee, you sick freak.

352
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,880
What a piece of crap.

353
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,960
There are two kids at the foundation

354
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,800
who drew Patee as a demon.

355
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,240
And both of them were victims.

356
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,720
One gin and tonic, please.

357
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,200
Mrs. Woranun.

358
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,240
Good relax or bad relax?

359
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,560
Most people drink
for just a few main reasons.

360
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,440
If not to relax,

361
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,720
then to de-stress.

362
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,480
I haven't had a drink to relax like this
in a long time.

363
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,200
Gin and tonic

364
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,000
was once used as medicine.

365
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,320
When I want to de-stress,

366
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,800
I drink it.

367
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,000
It's like

368
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,040
it heals something inside me.

369
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:13,920
Excuse me.

370
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,240
I'll take one just like hers.

371
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,480
Mrs. Woranun.

372
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,360
Are you happy?

373
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,840
What's wrong with me?

374
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,480
Just from you asking if I'm happy,

375
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,440
I end up crying.

376
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,360
You must have a lot in mind

377
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,800
that you can't tell anyone.

378
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,480
If you want to talk

379
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,040
or vent,

380
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,120
you can talk to me.

381
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,120
I'm happy to listen,

382
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,520
and I'll keep it a secret.

383
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,360
It's okay.

384
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,680
You must have been tired
from work already.

385
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,080
If I had to let someone walk away in pain,
knowing I could help,

386
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,200
I wouldn't feel right.

387
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,480
Ms. Sara,

388
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,240
have you ever hated yourself?

389
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,480
Hated having to put up

390
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,680
with what you know is wrong.

391
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,240
Hated not standing up

392
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,280
for what you believe in.

393
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,560
And in the end,

394
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,960
it comes back to haunt you every day.

395
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,040
I couldn't even

396
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,040
proudly teach my son

397
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,200
to fight for himself,

398
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,640
to fight for what's right

399
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,840
when I…

400
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,080
Work must be tough at the company, right?

401
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,600
I understand.

402
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,520
Now that you've said it out loud,

403
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,920
how do you feel?

404
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,400
Thank you so much.

405
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,320
It feels like

406
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,639
a heavy load's been lifted.

407
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,040
Thank you, Sara.

408
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,000
Invite me again sometime, Mrs. Woranun.

409
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,880
You can just call me Nun.

410
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,080
Okay, Nun. Get home safe.

411
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,840
Alright.

412
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,720
<i>Hello.</i>

413
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,080
<i>Do you like it?</i>

414
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,120
<i>Good girl. Good girl.</i>

415
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,360
<i>Wow.</i>

416
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,280
<i>Good girl.</i>

417
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,480
Is something wrong, Nun?

418
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,600
<i>Where did you get these photos?</i>

419
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,480
Someone helped me.

420
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,760
Someone who's seen everything all along.
Someone from that house.

421
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,760
So, it means

422
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,000
we have enough evidence
to take him down, right?

423
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,800
We're going to help these kids.

424
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,840
And we'll use this footage
to make our plan succeed.

425
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,480
Mr. Patee?

426
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,000
Nun, are you okay?

427
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,400
I'm okay. I'm okay.

428
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,240
<i>Do you like it?</i>

429
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,280
Where did you get that from?

430
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,760
It doesn't matter where I got it.

431
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,800
What matters is, did you actually do this?

432
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,120
<i>Good girl.</i>

433
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,200
It wasn't me.

434
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,680
It's not me, for sure.

435
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,360
It has to be one of those AI clips.

436
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,080
If I'd only seen one clip,

437
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,160
I probably would've believed you.

438
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,360
But it's not just one.

439
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,280
I can't believe

440
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,240
that you're a pedophile.

441
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,160
How could you do this?

442
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,560
I'll have to ask Mom

443
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,040
to transfer you to work elsewhere.

444
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,000
Not at the foundation.

445
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,880
No, you can't.

446
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,000
That foundation.

447
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,720
I've been taking care of it well.

448
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,080
You can't let someone else take over.

449
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,360
But I don't trust you
to be around those kids anymore.

450
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,760
Even if they're orphans,

451
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,560
they're still someone's children.

452
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,920
Even if you won't care about us,

453
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,520
at least care about your kids.

454
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,760
You also have a daughter.

455
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,880
What's going on?

456
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,360
Aren't you asleep yet?

457
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,720
How long have you been here?

458
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,080
I came down to get some water.

459
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,160
Then I heard loud voices,

460
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,360
so I came to see.

461
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,520
What was it about?

462
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,640
Nun was just asking
about the donation funds.

463
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,440
Nothing important.

464
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,720
Let's go to bed.

465
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,320
Is there a problem at the foundation?

466
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,040
You and Nun

467
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,960
looked really serious.

468
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,680
It's nothing.

469
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,040
I'm your wife.

470
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,680
If something's wrong,

471
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,680
I deserve to know.

472
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,720
<i>I won't tell anyone.</i>

473
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,000
<i>But you'll have to do exactly what I say.</i>

474
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,960
<i>No negotiations.</i>

475
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,760
Tell me.

476
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,080
You know I can help with anything.

477
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,720
I said it's nothing.

478
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,760
I heard your car earlier,

479
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,000
so I came down.

480
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,760
But you parked a while ago, didn't you?

481
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,640
Why are you just coming in?

482
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,400
I was looking for something in the car.

483
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,480
Looking for something in the car?

484
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,400
Go shower and rest.

485
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,800
TUESDAY, MARCH 4TH

486
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,640
ENTER PASSCODE

487
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,040
Ter's birthday?

488
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,200
Patee?

489
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,640
AIRDROP

490
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,200
OTHER DEVICES

491
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,200
Who did Nun get the clip from?

492
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,520
I talked to them already.
It's all handled.

493
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,240
Patee won't find out.

494
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,120
<i>Every piece of the plan is in place.</i>

495
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,160
Let's move forward.

496
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,960
And any progress on the logo on the shirt?

497
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,840
<i>There are two or three places</i>
<i>with similar logos.</i>

498
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,360
<i>I'll find out and update you soon.</i>

499
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,880
Okay.

500
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,920
YC 6985

501
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,640
Hey. Hey.

502
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,880
Hey.

503
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,480
It's okay.

504
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,720
I'm here now.

505
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,080
It's okay. I'm here.

506
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,320
Come on. Sit here.

507
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,760
One sec.

508
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,120
You're safe now.

509
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,440
I'm…

510
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,280
I'm safe now.

511
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,320
I'm safe.

512
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,320
How did you know how to comfort me?

513
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,560
I asked ChatGPT.

514
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,160
Ah, I didn't mean it like that.

515
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,560
It's just, after I saw you
acting strange last time,

516
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,120
I wanted to understand
what was going on with you.

517
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,200
So I could maybe help somehow. So I…

518
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,080
Thank you.

519
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,760
And…

520
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,880
how did you even find me?

521
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,720
I was driving back to the restaurant,

522
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,400
and I saw you sheltering from the rain.

523
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,360
I remembered
you were afraid of loud noises,

524
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,680
and the thunder was so loud.

525
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,600
So I came to you.

526
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,560
Let me get you a drink.

527
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,080
Oh, here's the shirt.

528
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:18,520
You should change, so you get warmer.

529
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,640
If you don't mind.

530
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,400
"What to drink
for someone who's in shock?"

531
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,080
Alright, this one.

532
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,440
Here's a warm drink for you.

533
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,920
Honey lemon?

534
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,920
Yes.

535
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,920
I read it helps calm you down.

536
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,560
Maybe.

537
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,840
Do you read about things like this often?

538
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,160
I just asked ChatGPT again.

539
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I just wanted to find a way to help you.

540
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,880
I didn't even know what to do, really.

541
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,640
I just felt like I had to do something.

542
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,680
Actually, it doesn't happen often.

543
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,480
But when it does,

544
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,920
it feels like
I'm completely alone in the world.

545
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,920
I didn't mean to make you worry.

546
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:29,960
No, not at all.

547
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,240
Just knowing
you feel comfortable talking to me

548
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
makes me happy already.

549
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:40,800
Next time,

550
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,160
if anything like this happens again,

551
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,920
I'll be there for you.

552
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,320
I might be a little too nosy,

553
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,560
but at least

554
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:00,240
now you know
you're not alone in this world.

555
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,600
Sara!

556
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,040
Are you alright?

557
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:22,720
Thank you so much

558
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,600
for taking care of my friend.

559
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,480
No problem.

560
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,240
Your friend's here now.
Let me change your cup before you go,

561
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,640
so you can drink it on the way. Alright?

562
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,480
Are you okay?

563
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,840
I ran out of paper cups.

564
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,200
You can return it next time.

565
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,080
If that's all,

566
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,360
- I'll take her home now.
- Of course.

567
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,480
Thank you.

568
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,680
I'll open the door.

569
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,080
Don't worry about the car.

570
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:56,240
I'll handle it. Just go home and rest.

571
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,520
Normally, you don't take drinks
from strangers, do you?

572
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,760
So, why'd you accept it this time?

573
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,280
Well,

574
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,760
I didn't want to hurt his feelings.

575
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:16,920
You want it?

576
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,840
No.

577
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,280
What if he put a love potion in it?

578
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,960
What?

579
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,600
You can't recover the files at all?

580
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,360
What do you mean a few days?

581
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,600
Using your dad's calendar
as a standard, huh?

582
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:00,760
Damn it.

583
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,480
So, who the hell took the clip?

584
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,040
How did they get it?

585
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,680
Find out for me.

586
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,400
Kram said

587
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,480
I should come talk to you.

588
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,760
Don't worry, Seoul.

589
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,880
Everything we talk about here
stays between us.

590
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,080
Last time, when you asked me…

591
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,920
Well…

592
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,080
My dad…

593
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,160
He does that

594
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,160
to the kids at the foundation too.

595
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,120
How…

596
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:43,960
How did you know?

597
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,480
I can read it from you, Seoul.

598
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,200
The more you hold it in,
the more it destroys you.

599
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,920
I saw him

600
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,880
try to touch Nam-oon's chest.

601
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,640
After that,

602
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,440
I told Sydney to stop
inviting her friends over.

603
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,280
And…

604
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,680
I once saw Dad

605
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,200
keeping those clips on his computer.

606
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,560
I wanted to tell someone.

607
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,360
I wanted to tell him to stop, but…

608
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,160
<i>I know you're scared</i>

609
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,360
<i>and confused.</i>

610
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,600
<i>But if you listen to what you just said,</i>

611
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,800
<i>you'll find your answer.</i>

612
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,120
<i>You want him to stop, right?</i>

613
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:33,360
<i>Then we have to do it together.</i>

614
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,920
<i>What can you do even if you know?</i>

615
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,280
<i>What can I do?</i>

616
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,720
<i>Your dad keeps the clips</i>
<i>on his computer, right?</i>

617
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,520
SNAPDROP

618
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,120
AIRDROP

619
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,720
<i>Can you get them for me?</i>

620
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,960
What will you do with them?

621
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,680
I'll help the kids
your father did that to.

622
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,200
And I'll make him stop.

623
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,880
I can do it. Trust me.

624
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,280
Who are you?
You sent the clips to Nun, right? Talk!

625
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,640
NEW RECORDING 14

626
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,040
Come be my witness

627
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,560
to reopen the case from 19 years ago

628
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,080
before they betray you.

629
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,920
Last night, Patee secretly
met someone in a secluded place.

630
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,600
But I don't know who that person was.

631
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,520
Hey.

632
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,320
Once Patee confesses,

633
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,040
the police will reopen
the case of my parents.

634
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,600
But when that happens,
you'll have to reveal your true identity.

635
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,200
This is the background of Sara.
It seems like

636
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,240
she's been around us
for quite some time now.

637
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,320
- I've arrived.
- Just do what we agreed.

638
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,800
The police will grant you
witness protection.

639
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,160
