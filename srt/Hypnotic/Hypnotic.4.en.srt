00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,400
<i>Free cake tonight for New Year's Eve!</i>

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,520
Hello.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,320
Say thank you, sweetie.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,920
Thank you. Wait for me.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,280
- Thank you.
- Happy New Year.

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,160
See you later.

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,080
- That looks so good, Kamon.
- I'll pour this.

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,440
Alright, pour it first.

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,720
- Me first?
- Yes.

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,360
I'll give you lots of strawberries.

15
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,840
Mom?

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,920
Mom?

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,760
Mom!

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,280
Mom! Mom!

19
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,000
Help! Please help! Help my mom, please!

20
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,840
Help!

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,240
Help!

22
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,240
Please help my mom!
Uncle, please help my mom!

23
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,600
- Help my mom, please.
- Ugh.

24
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,200
- Uncle!
- What the hell do you want?

25
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,040
Uncle!

26
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,520
It's all taken care of…

27
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,080
Mrs. Kulnaree.

28
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,080
Help! Help my mom!

29
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,320
Help!

30
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,520
Help!

31
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,760
Help! Please help my mom!

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,400
The cake must be so delicious.

33
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,880
You little glutton.

34
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,120
Drooling all over yourself.

35
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,880
It's almost New Year's.

36
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,040
I'll count down with you.

37
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,360
Ten, nine,

38
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,320
eight, seven,

39
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,040
six, five,

40
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,120
four, three, two, one.

41
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,960
<i>Happy New Year!</i>

42
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,160
Happy New Year…

43
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,680
you little street dog.

44
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,320
MR. CHAI TIDRAKSA
MRS. NAPA TIDRAKSA

45
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,640
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

46
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,040
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

47
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,400
I'm sorry.

48
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,600
Ms. Sara, you're here to make merit too?

49
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,560
It's my birthday today.

50
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,480
Happy birthday.
I wish you all the happiness.

51
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,440
Thank you.

52
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,040
Didn't expect to see you here.

53
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,080
I came to visit my mom.
Her ashes are kept here.

54
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,840
Oh, did you talk to Seoul already?

55
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,120
- I told him for you.
- I did.

56
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,360
I gave him a counseling session.

57
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,120
I know you have to keep confidentiality,

58
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,960
but it's nothing too serious, right?

59
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,560
I can't really say

60
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,240
because "serious"
means something different to everyone.

61
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,320
True.

62
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,800
But as long as you've talked
to Seoul and he's okay,

63
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,920
that's enough for me.

64
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,840
I'll get going now.

65
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,560
MRS. SUKANDA CHAROENPAKDEECHAI

66
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,360
Sydney, eat your food.

67
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,400
I want to eat at Kram's restaurant.

68
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,720
If the food at home isn't good enough,

69
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,960
then maybe you should
get food for yourself next time.

70
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,080
Mother, if we eat out,

71
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,480
who will you have left to yell at?

72
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,880
Come on, Patee.

73
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,360
What? I'm just saying the truth.

74
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,240
Every time we eat together,

75
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,960
no one else gets to speak but you, Mother.

76
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,160
You keep talking and talking.

77
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,480
If we didn't come sit here
to let you scold us, you'd probably have

78
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,440
a stroke from bottled-up anger by now.

79
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,880
Patee, please.

80
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,679
You're doing plenty
of shameful stuff already.

81
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,520
We're at the table.

82
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,159
At least show some respect
and listen to Mom.

83
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,080
So what?

84
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,360
If everyone behaved well like Panter,

85
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,600
Mother wouldn't have anything
to complain about.

86
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,720
But if she still does, maybe you should

87
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,240
reflect on yourself.

88
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,080
Wow.

89
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,560
No one's more perfect than your son.

90
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,200
If Buddha was born and took seven steps,

91
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,840
your son must've taken ten, right?

92
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,640
So great, huh? Watch my son.

93
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,800
He'll be born moonwalking
just to show you up.

94
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,440
You dare hit me?!

95
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,880
If your parents didn't teach you manners,

96
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,480
I'll teach you myself.

97
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,400
You're insulting my parents?

98
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,320
- You think I won't hit you?
- Stop it.

99
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,600
- You think I won't?
- Patee.

100
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,840
- Damn you!
- Easy, Patee.

101
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,320
- Damn you.
- Please calm down.

102
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,080
- What are you looking at?!
- Stop, Mr. Patee.

103
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:47,960
- Huh?
- Enough, Patee.

104
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,560
- Enough.
- Even if you're my wife, I can beat you.

105
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,320
- Please calm down.
- Come on. What are you looking at?

106
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,960
- Let go of me.
- Enough, Patee.

107
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,800
- Come on.
- Please stop.

108
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,280
<i>You're so tough, huh?</i>

109
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,560
- <i>Are you?</i>
- <i>Please. Mr. Patee.</i>

110
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,800
<i>Come here, bitch.</i>

111
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,880
I'll miss you so much, Sara.

112
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,000
If we never have to see each other again,
that must mean you're all better already.

113
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,200
Thank you so much
for taking good care of Meena.

114
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,200
Of course.

115
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,360
Bye-bye.

116
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,840
Bye-bye.

117
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,480
If you want a session,

118
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,160
you need to make an appointment.

119
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,960
And if it's something else,
what should I do?

120
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
If your business

121
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,880
involves something
hidden behind your back,

122
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,600
I'll need to see it first.

123
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,720
You've been walking with your hands
behind your back this whole time.

124
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,000
Unless your back's itchy,

125
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,440
I'm guessing you've got something hidden?

126
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,320
Happy belated birthday.

127
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,120
This is for me?

128
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,920
Why?

129
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,640
Why are you giving this to me?

130
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,400
Well, it's your birthday.

131
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,240
Is it weird to give a birthday gift?

132
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,280
Do you give birthday gifts
like this to everyone?

133
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,760
Yes. If I know

134
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,280
when their birthday is,

135
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,800
I'd give them to everyone.

136
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,560
Really.

137
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,280
This brand claims

138
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,920
it helps you feel more relaxed.

139
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,480
Just in case you get startled again,
you can light the candle

140
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,400
and feel a bit better.

141
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,160
Does it smell good?

142
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,640
Or does it smell too strong?

143
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,440
Do you like the gift, Ms. Sara?

144
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,440
I've known Kram for ages
and never got a single thing.

145
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,040
I'll get going.

146
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,560
- Thank you.
- Sure.

147
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,600
You talk too much. Just drive.

148
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,000
Hey!

149
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,200
- Hey.
- What?

150
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,120
Captain Bank?

151
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,840
- How are you?
- Kram.

152
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,640
- Can you stand?
- Let me take a look.

153
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,000
Are you hurt?

154
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,120
Just a bit.

155
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,600
So you can't chase the guy now.

156
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,800
It's alright.
I've told my men to go after him.

157
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,400
Ms. Sara, this is Captain Bank. He's
a cop at the station near my restaurant.

158
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,240
And this is Ms. Sara.

159
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,640
A child psychologist, right?

160
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,760
You helped that kid on the rooftop.
I saw it on the news.

161
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,800
Yes.

162
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,480
What did that guy do

163
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,520
to get chased like that?
It doesn't seem like something minor.

164
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,880
It's connected to some shady networks.

165
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,720
Whoa, Captain.

166
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,000
Why do you always get the toughest cases?

167
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,560
Well, not many people want
to take on dangerous cases like these.

168
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,000
If every officer were like you,
things would be much better.

169
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,560
If every officer just did their duty,

170
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,720
followed their own ethical code,
the world would be a better place.

171
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,320
This job has a lot of temptations,

172
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,760
money, perks,

173
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,280
but I always remind myself

174
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,680
why I took this job

175
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,240
and who I'm doing it for.

176
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,040
MIND BALANCE

177
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,240
Ow.

178
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,920
Why are you smiling?

179
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,480
Do I need to call Captain Bank
to drug test you?

180
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,360
Just drive.

181
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,920
Who is he?

182
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,840
You didn't introduce him to me.

183
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,080
It's nothing.

184
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,800
I don't know if you realize this.

185
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,800
But since I've known you,

186
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,839
I've never seen anyone
who can make you smile like that.

187
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,560
I've got another case coming up.
I'll go prep for it.

188
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,760
You can allow yourself to be happy.

189
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,520
And if you're happy,

190
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,280
then smile.

191
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,240
Panter, is something wrong?

192
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,280
Thank you.

193
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,600
What's up, man?

194
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,080
So, the other night,

195
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,600
I was going to help Mom
bring stuff inside.

196
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,240
But when I got there, I couldn't find her.

197
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,680
<i>Then I saw her</i>
<i>heading toward Aunt Naree's place.</i>

198
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,840
<i>So, I followed.</i>

199
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,560
<i>And I saw Mom</i>
<i>talking with Uncle Patee in the backyard.</i>

200
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,800
I can't believe

201
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,360
that you're a pedophile.

202
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,200
How could you do this?

203
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,400
At first, I wanted to ask her about it,

204
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,560
but I didn't have the guts.
I've been feeling uneasy.

205
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,560
I don't understand
why she won't just tell the truth.

206
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,960
How can she keep
something like this hidden?

207
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,960
I get why your mom
wouldn't say anything, Panter.

208
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,360
It's a big deal.

209
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,200
But that doesn't mean we should
turn a blind eye to what happened.

210
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,840
So, what should I do?

211
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,080
I'll try to find a way.
But if you hear anything, let me know.

212
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,160
Yes.

213
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,280
Don't overthink it.

214
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,160
Hello, Captain.

215
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,680
I have something I'd like to discuss.

216
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,840
TOMORROW MIDNIGHT. ABOUT YOUR VIDEO

217
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,320
LOCATION: 102/2 SOI THONGLOR 5, BANGKOK
WATTHANA DISTRICT 10110, THAILAND

218
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,960
BACK ENTRANCE

219
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,480
Who the hell are you?

220
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,600
You're about to be betrayed.

221
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,360
What nonsense are you talking about?

222
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,960
Who the hell are you?
You sent the video to Nun, didn't you?

223
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,160
Where did you get it from?
Who are you working with?

224
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,280
Answer me!

225
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,400
<i>I will not let our reputation</i>
<i>be destroyed over such filthy scandal.</i>

226
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,080
<i>But if Patee gets exposed about this,</i>

227
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,760
<i>he won't hesitate to bring up</i>
<i>the case from 19 years ago</i>

228
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,280
<i>to threaten us.</i>

229
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,320
<i>Then change the game.</i>

230
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,320
<i>Make him pay for the crime</i>
<i>from 19 years ago as well.</i>

231
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,640
<i>Say he was obsessed with that girl</i>

232
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,280
<i>and ended up getting her parents killed.</i>

233
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,080
<i>Then he used his father's influence</i>
<i>to cover it up.</i>

234
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,600
<i>We had no idea.</i>

235
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,760
<i>If we're gonna strike, strike to kill.</i>

236
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,920
Where did you get that voice clip?

237
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,920
So, you do know something
about the case from 19 years ago.

238
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,040
I'm asking you a question.

239
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,320
Be a witness for me.
Help reopen the case from 19 years ago.

240
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,640
Even if you kill me,

241
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,520
others still know the truth.

242
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,360
This won't end easily.

243
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,560
If you don't believe me,

244
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,400
go ask those people yourself.

245
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,720
See if they're planning to betray you.

246
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,760
You think you'll get the truth that way?

247
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,560
Betray them first

248
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,560
before they betray you.

249
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,800
I'll be back for your answer.

250
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,640
You think I'd be dumb enough
to just come and let you leave?

251
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,920
Where did you get it from?

252
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,240
Who are you working with? Answer me!

253
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,200
What the hell?! Hey! Are you crazy?

254
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,560
Hey!

255
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,280
What kind of driving is that?

256
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,000
Cutting me off like that?! Get out!

257
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,800
This looks familiar.

258
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,080
7GK BANGKOK
900

259
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,240
- Who are you?
- Hey. Stop.

260
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,880
Wait.

261
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,600
Ugh.

262
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,760
Wait.

263
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,760
You put a GPS tracker on my car?

264
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,760
The signal showed you were at a bar.

265
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,880
But when I got there,
your car had already left.

266
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,760
Who did you meet?

267
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,320
Meet who? I was drinking, obviously.

268
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,440
You don't usually go to that place.

269
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,960
Hey, go buy a polygraph
and test me if you want.

270
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,800
Settle it once and for all.
You never believe what I say anyway.

271
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,960
Someone like you isn't complicated enough

272
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,560
to need a polygraph.

273
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,840
Really?

274
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,160
Yeah. I couldn't hide anything from you.

275
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,280
Not like you,

276
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,680
a master of secrets.

277
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,200
Complicated. Always hiding things.

278
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,000
What the hell are you saying?

279
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,120
Besides Patee,
someone else was following you too?

280
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,160
Yes. But I don't know who.

281
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,560
Maybe we're being watched.

282
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,520
Then we need to be more careful.

283
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,080
What about the voice clip?
Does Patee suspect anything?

284
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,880
The original audio we got from Sydney's
keychain recorder was very clear.

285
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,880
I used AI to convert it
into whatever words we needed.

286
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,720
It was convincing enough to trick Patee.

287
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,880
A small gift
for our first session together.

288
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,600
Hana Baby.

289
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,520
<i>I will not let our reputation</i>
<i>be destroyed over such filthy scandal.</i>

290
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,480
<i>But if Patee gets exposed about this,</i>

291
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,240
<i>he won't hesitate to bring up</i>
<i>the case from 19 years ago to threaten us.</i>

292
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,960
You were smart to send me
to train in this stuff.

293
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,160
It's been so useful.

294
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,040
But still, we have to understand
human psychology.

295
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,080
That's how we use these tools
to reach our goal faster.

296
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,640
I just hope Patee doesn't lose it
and go blabbing to that side.

297
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,200
That would ruin our plan.

298
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,520
The only thing Patee is smart at
is saving his own skin.

299
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,160
And if he truly believes
the voice clip is real,

300
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,720
he won't say a word.

301
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,920
Hey, Dad.

302
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,400
What? If you're not happy, get out.

303
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,720
Panter, take the kids somewhere else.

304
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,600
Do I need to call a rehab center
to come take you in?

305
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,920
If I have to go to rehab for drinking,

306
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,600
then everyone in this house might as well
be checked into a psych ward.

307
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,440
You're wasted. You should stop drinking.

308
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,440
Mind your damn business.

309
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,880
What demon possessed me

310
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,360
to bring you into this family?

311
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,520
Maybe that demon

312
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,280
was you, Mother.

313
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,240
Don't think I don't know

314
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,080
that the reason you made me marry Naree

315
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,600
was because you wanted
to benefit from my father's position.

316
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,040
If you know that, you should realize

317
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,720
your father doesn't hold
any position anymore.

318
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,280
You're no longer useful.

319
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,520
Is that so?

320
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,040
If I was really that useless,

321
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,200
You would've kicked me
out of this house a long time ago.

322
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,760
But I still get to walk around like this

323
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,720
because I'm keeping a secret
for your daughter,

324
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,640
my lovely wife.

325
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,800
Isn't that right?

326
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,720
That's a hardcore way
to say thanks, sweetheart.

327
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,880
But I'm not even surprised.

328
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,200
You're the type
who enjoys violence anyway.

329
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,320
How did it feel?

330
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,920
Did your heart race

331
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,240
when you saw that poor worker couple
die right in front of you?

332
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,400
You talk like
you didn't volunteer to help.

333
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,800
Weren't you the one who offered first?

334
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,400
If I'd known helping a murderer

335
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,840
and all the accomplices in this room

336
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,120
would get me nothing
but dog shit in return,

337
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,960
I wouldn't have helped in the first place.

338
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,840
Everyone knows this family

339
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,360
only stays together
for the sake of benefits. Pfft!

340
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,560
- Enough of this, Patee! If you don't, I--
- What?

341
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,320
What will you do?

342
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,080
Didn't you plan to go
even further from the start?

343
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,680
Maybe I really am crazy,
just like you said, Mother.

344
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,720
Crazy enough

345
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,280
to have two kids with a murderer,

346
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,040
to stick around for almost 20 years.

347
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,520
You should be grateful

348
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,520
to have someone like me as
your son-in-law. I've put up with a lot.

349
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,960
And you should be even more proud,
since you've got yourself a new title.

350
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,480
Murderer's Mom.

351
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,040
What the hell?! Hey!

352
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,160
Damn it! Hey! What's wrong with you?!

353
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,840
Hey! Are you crazy?! Hey!

354
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,920
We've been trying to protect this family.

355
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,160
I won't let you ruin everything.

356
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,360
It's good you know
this is all about benefits.

357
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,200
The only benefit you have now

358
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,840
is protecting this family's reputation.

359
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,400
If you keep acting insane,

360
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,840
next time, I won't miss.

361
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,960
All talk, huh? You old hag.

362
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,040
Damn it.

363
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,000
We're not open yet. What?

364
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,640
Captain?

365
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,840
Whoa, Captain Bank. You scared me.

366
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,040
Please, have a seat.

367
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,920
Judo.

368
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,880
Regarding what you called
about concerning Mr. Patee.

369
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,520
- I've followed up.
- Okay.

370
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,800
But I haven't found any leads
about child abuse yet.

371
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,960
However, I do have a suspicion.

372
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,840
Last night, Patee secretly met
with someone at a secluded place.

373
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,280
But I don't know who it was

374
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,840
or whether it was related
to the child abuse case.

375
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,680
Thank you.

376
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,080
I don't know who this person is.

377
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,880
She was completely covered up.

378
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,360
But I almost caught her.

379
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,640
<i>Who are you?</i>

380
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,080
Hey.

381
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,160
<i>I'll take her home now.</i>

382
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,280
Are you a chef who likes art?

383
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,680
Cooking is art, you know.

384
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,800
This is an apology for taking your time.

385
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,760
Not at all.

386
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:20,840
I didn't expect to meet you.
So, I didn't bring the cup back.

387
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,560
Oh, don't worry. I'm not in a rush.
I've got plenty more at the restaurant.

388
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,280
Do all your cups at the restaurant

389
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,199
have quotes on them?

390
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,800
Want some?

391
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,679
Why?

392
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,960
Chefs can eat sweets elsewhere too.

393
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,600
When I was a kid, my dad

394
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,640
used to buy me dorayaki after school.

395
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,560
And I'd eat around the edges first,

396
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,600
then save the filling in the middle
for one last big bite.

397
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,920
Last bite of bliss.

398
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,560
What do you like to eat?

399
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,080
Anything, I guess.

400
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,480
Anything? That's tough.

401
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,160
If you need anything from me,
just let me know.

402
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,320
Consider it a thank you for the gift

403
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,600
and for helping me that rainy day.

404
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,640
By the way,

405
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,920
the friend who picked you up that day.

406
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,040
Are you two close?

407
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,640
We've been friends since we were kids.

408
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,600
She seems very different from you.

409
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,800
I noticed she has tattoos, right?

410
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:23,000
You smile a lot.
But today, your smile isn't like usual.

411
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,920
Captain Bank is keeping an eye on Patee

412
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,960
for some kind of illegal activity.

413
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,720
And he saw Patee

414
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,560
secretly meet someone

415
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,600
who looks like your friend.

416
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,280
The tattoo Captain Bank found

417
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,760
looks exactly like the one
I saw on your friend's wrist.

418
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,360
Are you about to ask

419
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,600
- if I know anything?
- No.

420
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,640
I'm just worried that if
she did something wrong,

421
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,440
it might affect you too.

422
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:11,000
I don't think it's what you're imagining.

423
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,360
You know?

424
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,400
I know my friend well.

425
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,480
Plang would never do something like that.

426
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,720
But thank you for your concern.

427
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,480
I'll get going now.

428
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,000
I have an early case tomorrow.

429
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,000
Don't forget.
You're not alone in this world.

430
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,760
Anything on your mind,

431
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,760
you can always talk to me.

432
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,560
Yes, Captain.

433
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,320
I spoke to Ms. Sara.

434
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,640
She insists her friend isn't involved.

435
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,840
You should verify to make sure
if the tattoo

436
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,480
really belongs to Ms. Sara's friend.

437
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,520
Okay.

438
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,640
<i>The meeting's set.</i>

439
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,200
<i>Okay. We need to get everything done.</i>

440
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,680
<i>There's no more time.</i>

441
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,400
<i>You talk like</i>
<i>you didn't volunteer to help.</i>

442
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,960
<i>Weren't you the one who offered first?</i>

443
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,960
<i>If I'd known helping a murderer…</i>

444
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,120
This is all I can do.

445
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,080
But are you sure we can reopen the case?

446
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,000
It's not that simple.

447
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,040
From the footage,

448
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,240
there might be enough
to push for reinvestigation.

449
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,600
Once you confess with the evidence,

450
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,760
you might have a chance to walk free.

451
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,040
But remember.
Everything has to be as solid as possible.

452
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,640
DUSIT THANI

453
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,560
There he is.

454
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,240
I've arrived.

455
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,800
Stick to the plan.

456
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,800
The police will list you as a witness.
I'll help you from there.

457
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,440
You better do it.

458
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,600
<i>Of course. We've come this far.</i>

459
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,320
Go confess
and hand the evidence to the police.

460
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,080
Once Patee confesses
and hands over the evidence,

461
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,240
we'll come forward as the aggrieved party.

462
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,440
That way, the police
can reopen my parents' case.

463
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,680
But when that time comes,

464
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,000
you'll have to reveal your true identity.

465
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,240
So this can all end, once and for all.

466
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,440
<i>And another breaking story just in.</i>

467
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,360
<i>The son-in-law of the famous</i>

468
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,160
<i>Lerthanakul family is involved</i>

469
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,520
<i>in a child sexual abuse case.</i>

470
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,000
SON-IN-LAW OF FAMOUS FAMILY
INVOLVED IN CHILD ABUSE CASE

471
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,640
- He's here.
- There.

472
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,680
Are you turning yourself in
for the abuse case?

473
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,280
What were you thinking when you did it?

474
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,600
Hey. What's happening?

475
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,920
- Are you here to confess for this case?
- Why did you do it?

476
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,240
- Please answer.
- That's not true!

477
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,880
- Please answer, Mr. Patee.
- Talk to us.

478
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,520
- Mr. Patee, please.
- Please answer.

479
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,760
Ouch! Who hit my head?!

480
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,240
My head hurts!

481
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,880
<i>Do you even know</i>
<i>who my father is? Do you?!</i>

482
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,760
- Sara, we're screwed.
- <i>What, Officer?</i>

483
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,160
<i>I didn't do anything.</i>

484
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,080
- <i>Is it true, Mr. Patee?</i>
- <i>It wasn't me.</i>

485
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,080
- <i>Wait!</i>
- <i>Please make way.</i>

486
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,920
- <i>Please don't push.</i>
- <i>Hey! Let me go!</i>

487
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,640
- <i>Is it true?</i>
- <i>Where are you taking me?</i>

488
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,880
<i>Mr. Patee, is it true?</i>

489
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,920
- <i>Please answer me, Mr. Patee.</i>
- <i>I didn't do it.</i>

490
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,440
- <i>Mr. Patee.</i>
- <i>Don't!</i>

491
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,920
SON-IN-LAW OF FAMOUS FAMILY
INVOLVED IN CHILD ABUSE CASE

492
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,760
Someone leaked the clip before us?

493
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,840
What do we do now?

494
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,440
Didn't you say it wouldn't go this far?

495
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,360
Seoul, please listen to me.

496
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,560
I don't know how this happened either.

497
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,240
If not you, then who?

498
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,960
I'll try to fix this somehow.

499
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,280
Seoul.

500
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,480
The adults are meeting at Grandma's.
They sent me to watch over you and Sydney.

501
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,520
I'm sorry.

502
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,600
I'm sorry.
I didn't want it to end up like this.

503
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,440
It's not your fault, Seoul.

504
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,720
You already knew?

505
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,080
How could something like this happen?

506
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:06,440
Naree, did you know anything?

507
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,360
How would I know?

508
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,400
He's your husband!

509
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,280
What's wrong with you, Nun?

510
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,680
I asked what's wrong with you.

511
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,840
I'm sorry.

512
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,360
I actually found out about it earlier.

513
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,400
What?

514
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,200
So, this is what you and Patee
were hiding from me?

515
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,880
Someone sent me the video.

516
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,080
I confronted Patee and told him to stop.

517
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,480
But I didn't know it would leak like this.

518
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,040
And you didn't think to tell me?

519
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,800
Huh?!

520
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,520
Why? Why are you so stupid?!

521
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,160
- You know how much damage it causes?
- Mom!

522
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,120
- That's enough.
- Why are you so stupid?

523
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,160
Mother, that's enough.

524
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,240
Mother,

525
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,760
I'm the one who leaked the video.

526
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,040
Let go of me. Let go.

527
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,280
Let me go! Don't you know who I am?

528
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,320
Don't you? You got a TV at home?!

529
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,600
You know who my father is?!

530
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,760
Why don't you ask your mom?

531
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,880
- Let me go!
- Go! Go in.

532
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,480
- Let me go, you bastards!
- Get in there!

533
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,360
Damn it! You scum!

534
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,240
You don't know who I am?!
You really don't?!

535
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,960
Huh? Don't you know who I am?

536
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:45,280
I don't care who you are.

537
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,560
Break the law
and you face the consequences.

538
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,840
Big talk, huh?
You're all gonna be screwed.

539
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,200
Tomorrow you're all getting fired.

540
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,800
You'll be fired for sure!

541
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,480
- Goddammit.
- Where are you going? Come here.

542
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,880
You're not so tough after all.

543
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,400
Take off your damn suit and fight me.
Come on, one on one.

544
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,720
Damn it.

545
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,600
How did you find out?

546
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,920
Sorry I peeked at your phone, Nun.

547
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,080
I got the video from Nun's phone.

548
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,160
That day, when Patee went off the rails
and picked a fight with us,

549
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,000
I thought something felt off,
so I started keeping an eye on him.

550
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,840
After that,

551
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,680
he made a call to someone.

552
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,600
He was going to reopen
the case from 19 years ago.

553
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,120
- What did you say?
- What did you say?

554
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,480
Patee was planning to betray us.

555
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,960
So, I had to release the video first.

556
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,960
As for the video that was sent to Nun,
I got someone look into where it's from.

557
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,160
But this is serious, Don.

558
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,800
Why didn't you talk to us first?
Why didn't you think it through?

559
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,960
I've thought about this.

560
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,920
Reporters are out front right now.

561
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,200
If you're ready,
we'll go give a press conference together.

562
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,200
In times like this, whoever
speaks up first gets the upper hand.

563
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,720
Why didn't you tell me first?

564
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,880
Calm down.

565
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,160
Isn't it a great chance?

566
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,160
To kick Patee out of the house

567
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,680
and hand over his responsibilities

568
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,720
to me.

569
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,280
You and your mom would feel more at ease,

570
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,680
wouldn't you?

571
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,080
We just heard the news too.

572
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,800
We're all in shock. Right now,
everyone is still processing it.

573
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,160
As legal counsel for the Lerthanakul
family, I want to make it clear

574
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:30,520
that no one else in the family
had any knowledge

575
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,640
or involvement in what happened.

576
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,920
<i>All of this is solely</i>
<i>Mr. Patee's wrongdoing.</i>

577
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,520
I've also received information

578
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,120
that Mr. Patee
may be involved in other cases as well.

579
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,720
- What kind of cases?
- I can't say yet.

580
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,760
Once we have confirmation,
I'll hold a proper briefing. Thank you.

581
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,480
This is the background of Sara.

582
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,280
There's something important
you should know.

583
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,720
This Sara Chaisitthikam…

584
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,160
SARA CHAISITTHIKAM

585
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,640
…used to be a volunteer
with our foundation many years ago.

586
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,520
Shortly after that,

587
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:36,480
she applied for a position
in the HR department at Le Thana Group.

588
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,720
LIST OF APPOINTED EMPLOYEES 2020-2024

589
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,560
It seems this woman

590
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,760
has been around us
for quite some time now.

591
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,120
SARA CHAISITTHIKAM

592
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,120
PSYCHOLOGIST, 29 YEARS OLD

593
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,800
This is happening
because they're starting to catch on.

594
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,080
If you keep pushing forward,

595
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,720
is there a greater chance
of success or failure?

596
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,200
So, you want me to just give up
and die inside?

597
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,360
Look in the mirror

598
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,440
and tell me how you feel.

599
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,480
Any thoughts on Patee's case?
Is the one who sent Nun the clip involved?

600
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,320
If they're connected,

601
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,400
I think there's surely
more to this than we know.

602
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,680
Thank you. The kids are lucky to have you.

603
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,800
Do you want to feel lucky too?

604
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,960
Please let us find a witness and evidence.

605
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,880
This is the one
who took the money from Kitti.

606
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,600
You really love it, don't you?

607
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,720
Hey, Sara.

608
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,920
