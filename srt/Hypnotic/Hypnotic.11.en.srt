Seoul.

Seoul!

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,920
Seoul!

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,320
Seoul!

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,680
Stay with me, Seoul.

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,480
Seoul, please be okay.

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,400
Seoul.

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,640
Please…

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,480
Seoul…

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,040
Seoul. Seoul.

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,520
Seoul!

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,160
Seoul!

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,800
Seoul.

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,800
Seoul. Seoul.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,960
Because of you…

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,720
You shitheads
made my son end up like this!

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,200
Die!

22
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,400
- Sara.
- You've gone crazy!

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,840
- I'm out!
- Sara. Sara.

24
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,000
Sara, we need to go.

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,440
We need to go.

26
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,640
Mom.

27
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,480
Mom.

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,040
Stop! Enough!

29
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,920
It can't be!

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,200
It can't be!

31
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,600
No! I didn't want this to happen…

32
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,920
I'm sorry…

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,280
- Sara.
- No!

34
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,200
- Sara, Sara, pull yourself together.
- No!

35
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,960
No!

36
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,520
Sara, please pull yourself together.

37
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,320
I didn't want it to turn out like this.

38
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,320
No!

39
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,280
Hello?

40
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,520
Sara was surrounded by fireworks?

41
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,240
<i>She's completely losing control now.</i>

42
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,400
- Dammit!
- <i>No!</i>

43
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,120
Kram, take her to Yanin now.

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,160
We'll follow.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,480
- Okay.
- Let's go.

46
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,760
Calm down, okay?

47
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,600
No… It's not true…

48
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,480
No…

49
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,600
It can't be.

50
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,760
It can't be…

51
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,080
Seoul.

52
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,560
- You promised you wouldn't leave me!
- My boy.

53
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,640
Seoul, wake up! Stay with me!

54
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,640
- Seoul!
- Seoul.

55
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,680
Seoul!

56
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,520
Seoul, please be okay!

57
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,280
Sydney.

58
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,360
Why did you do this, Mom?!

59
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,080
- Answer me! Why?!
- Sydney.

60
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,960
If anything happens to Seoul,
I'll never forgive you!

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,960
I didn't do it.

62
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,880
Your father and Sara did.

63
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,840
You did it!

64
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,200
You murderer!

65
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,280
You murderer!

66
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,320
You murderer!

67
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,880
You murderer!

68
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,880
Shut up!

69
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,880
- You murderer!
- Shut up.

70
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,440
I said shut up!

71
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,000
Will you shut up?!

72
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,040
I did not do it!

73
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,040
I'll never do anything wrong!

74
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,120
They're the ones who did it!

75
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,480
Understand now?!

76
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,520
Let go!

77
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,520
- Get off me!
- Hold her.

78
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,800
- Calm down.
- Sara.

79
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,680
Pull yourself together!

80
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,120
- Sara.
- Calm down.

81
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,720
- Get off me!
- Calm down.

82
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,920
Sara, pull yourself together.

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,840
- Sara, calm down.
- Let go.

84
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,320
Get off me.

85
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,040
Get off me.

86
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,880
- Get off me!
- Sara.

87
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,760
Naree.

88
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,640
Where are you going?

89
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,240
Naree.

90
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,720
She's not here.

91
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,080
Then where is she?

92
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,400
Sara!

93
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,680
This is my friend's clinic.

94
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,000
It's not open yet,

95
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,560
so I asked to use it for now.

96
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,080
I already checked.

97
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,360
Naree has people
stationed outside Sara's condo.

98
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,040
Well,

99
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,040
there's no way she can go back there now.

100
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,400
Same with my house and Bank's house.

101
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,400
I had to move my mom
to stay with my relatives.

102
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,720
Kulnaree won't stop hunting Sara.

103
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,280
She needs to hide here for now.

104
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,920
And with how severe her symptoms are,

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,680
how do we treat her, Ms. Yanin?

106
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,760
We'll need medication

107
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,440
and psychotherapy.

108
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But social environment matters too.

109
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:46,320
We all have to help her get through this.

110
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,360
What do we have to do?

111
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,400
Just tell us.

112
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,600
We all must be careful now.

113
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,200
Before coming here,

114
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,640
make sure no one is following you.

115
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,480
No one else can know

116
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,480
where Sara is.

117
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,320
Seoul…

118
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,880
Wake up soon, okay?

119
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,200
We promised we'd never leave each other.

120
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,520
Seoul.

121
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,840
You're strong.

122
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,640
I know you'll wake up.

123
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,160
Hey.

124
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,680
- Sara.
- No!

125
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,600
- No!
- Hey.

126
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,000
- Calm down.
- Get off me!

127
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,400
Get off me!

128
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,800
- Get off me! No!
- It's me.

129
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,480
- Sara, it's me.
- Get off me!

130
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,520
- Calm down.
- No!

131
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,800
You're alright.

132
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,120
I'm here now.

133
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,960
You're safe.

134
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
You're safe here.

135
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,720
It's okay.

136
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,720
You're safe now.

137
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,920
I'm right here.

138
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,200
It's alright.

139
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,800
It's alright.

140
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,280
Hey.

141
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,440
This is the first dish I taught you.

142
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,120
Eat some.

143
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,120
You want it?

144
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,560
How's Sara?

145
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,320
She's responding much better.

146
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,440
She should get better and better.

147
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,560
Thanks to all of you

148
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,760
for staying by her side.

149
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,280
Yes?

150
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:17,720
What?

151
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,520
Okay, got it.

152
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,040
Is something wrong?

153
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,360
There's an update on Chawadon.

154
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,000
So…

155
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,560
Mr. Don abandoned his car and disappeared.

156
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,840
The police found it,

157
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,440
and it seems

158
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,880
they're also looking for him.

159
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,160
Where could a guy like him
possibly run to?

160
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,400
What about Sara?

161
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,840
We still haven't found her.

162
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,800
The people we had tailing her

163
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,480
have been trying to follow her friends,

164
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,400
but still no luck.

165
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,040
They're being extremely cautious.

166
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,720
And now there are cops
staking out Kram's house

167
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,760
and his friends' places too.

168
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,840
Do they really think
they can hide forever?

169
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,720
Find them.

170
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,240
Yes, ma'am.

171
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,920
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

172
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,680

MRS. SAMPAO KLAIYAM
MS. KULNAREE LERTHANAKUL

174
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,320
Yes?

175
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,480
<i>The person buying your land</i>

176
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,280
<i>wants to cancel it.</i>

177
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,120
<i>They're worried there'll be an issue.</i>

178
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,240
What issue?

179
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,680
The deed's in my name.

180
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,040
<i>You haven't seen the news, have you?</i>

181
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,680
What news?

182
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,200
SOCIALITE WORANAN LERTHANAKUL
SUES HUSBAND FOR EMBEZZLEMENT

183
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,760
<i>How did you get here?</i>

184
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,480
<i>I drove here to see my filthy wife</i>

185
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,840
<i>who's been sleeping</i>
<i>with her sister's husband!</i>

186
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,240
<i>Now you've seen it, right?</i>
<i>You're no better than me.</i>

187
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,720
<i>Especially when it comes to your man.</i>

188
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,840
THEY SAY THE DEAD CAN'T TALK
BUT WHAT IF THEY COULD? TONIGHT AT 7 P.M.

189
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,400
<i>If I'd known helping a murderer</i>

190
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,360
<i>would get me nothing</i>
<i>but dog shit in return,</i>

191
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,600
<i>I wouldn't have helped in the first place.</i>

192
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,720
THOUGHT IT WAS JUST AN AFFAIR CLIP
BUT THEY ALSO TALK ABOUT MURDER

193
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,320
THE "L" FAMILY IS SOMETHING
THEY ALSO TALK ABOUT KILLING SOMEONE

194
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,920
IT'S MORE DRAMATIC THAN A DRAMA

195
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,920
IF THEY KILLED SOMEONE
WHY ARE THEY STILL WALKING FREE?

196
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,840
GUESS WHO'S THE MURDERER
DON'T SUE ME, BUT I'D SAY MADAM J

197
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,280
WHEN WILL THE POLICE GET TO WORK?

198
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,480
#THEL.FAMILYSCANDAL
IS TRENDING ON X AND TIKTOK

199
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,480
<i>As of now, the Lerthanakul family's reps</i>

200
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,080
<i>have not issued a statement</i>
<i>or denied any of the allegations.</i>

201
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,080
Hello.

202
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,920
I'm the one who created this account.

203
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,640
Many of you may know me

204
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,280
as a child psychologist.

205
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,840
But the truth is,

206
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,400
I lied to the entire country.

207
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,040
But before I tell you the truth,

208
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,720
let me tell you a story.

209
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,520
There was once a couple
who were labor worker parents.

210
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,880
They were killed…

211
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,720
unjustly,

212
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,240
just because

213
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,560
they knew a secret…

214
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,840
about a wealthy family…

215
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
that they had

216
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,080
an affair within the family.

217
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,040
The daughter of that murdered couple…

218
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,880
was almost killed too.

219
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,320
She was poisoned.

220
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,560
She tried

221
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,160
to move on with her life

222
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,840
but couldn't.

223
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,200
IS THIS YOUR OWN STORY?

224
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,280
So, she decided…

225
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,080
to come back
to seek justice for her parents.

226
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280
I…

227
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,080
am that little girl.

228
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,680
My real name…

229
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,320
is Kamon

230
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,280
Tisraksa.

231
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,280
The girl whose parents
were murdered without justice.

232
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,680
Every clip you've seen

233
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,040
is evidence

234
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,840
I've gathered.

235
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,160
JUSTICE FOR KAMON

236
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,120
#SAVEKAMON

237
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,080
Throughout this long fight,

238
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,840
I know…

239
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,720
#SAVEKAMON

240
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,400
…it's nearly impossible…

241
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,440
#SAVEKAMON

242
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,640
…for an ordinary person…

243
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,760
#SAVEKAMON

244
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,480
…to fight against the powerful alone.

245
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,800
But I've come this far.

246
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,400
And I want everyone to know.

247
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,200
If I die,

248
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,600
this story won't die with me.

249
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,640
And for anyone wondering if this is real…

250
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,760
I have a witness.

251
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,080
A witness

252
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,760
who's ready to stand beside me.

253
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,440
I am

254
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,280
Woranan

255
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,600
Lerthanakul.

256
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,840
What Kamon said is true.

257
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,000
As someone

258
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,520
who covered up
my family's crimes for 19 years,

259
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,160
today,

260
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,160
I'm choosing to stand by the victim,

261
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,080
the one who lost her entire family

262
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,040
because of my sister.

263
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,280
What if I say

264
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,040
I once did something wrong,

265
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,000
but it was to protect the family?

266
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,000
How would you feel, Ter?

267
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,240
If protecting our family

268
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,920
means others have to suffer,

269
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,760
then I'm not okay with it.

270
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,520
You always taught me

271
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,760
to consider other people's feelings.

272
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,920
I'm willing to be condemned

273
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,840
for destroying my own family,

274
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,720
but I won't ever let my children

275
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,920
live under the shadow
of their parents' sins.

276
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,720
The one thing I can still do for them…

277
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,440
THIS IS 100% REAL

278
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,280
…is to speak the truth.

279
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,760
#SAVEKAMON

280
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,680
Why?!

281
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,920
Why is everyone abandoning me?!

282
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,040
What is it?

283
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,240
Really? How did the police find out?

284
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,360
Yeah. Okay, okay. I gotta go.

285
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,160
Ma'am,

286
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,400
the police are on their way.

287
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,320
What?

288
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,520
My men said

289
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,560
the police've got evidence
I murdered Aunt Sampao.

290
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,320
How is that possible?

291
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,720
You already

292
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,640
destroyed all the cameras in that house.

293
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,000
It was a hidden CCTV camera
in her bedroom.

294
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,600
They must've installed it secretly
for some reason.

295
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,560
It's my fault.

296
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,840
Please stay calm, ma'am.

297
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,120
Ma'am. I've got a warrant out.

298
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,880
You've been summoned too.

299
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,200
We should run now.

300
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,840
Please.

301
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,960
Ma'am.

302
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,080
Let's go, ma'am.

303
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,320
We've issued arrest warrants
for Mr. Kitti and Mr. Phathi.

304
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,120
And a summons for Mrs. Kulnaree.

305
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,240
Hurry up, ma'am.

306
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,200
Hurry up. Faster.

307
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,600
Let's go. Now.

308
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,080
Hurry up.

309
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,800
- Hey! Where are you going?
- Hey!

310
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,080
- Ma'am.
- I won't let you escape.

311
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,000
- You're gonna get arrested in front of me.
- Help!

312
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,520
- Phathi, let me go!
- Mr. Phathi, let her go.

313
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,000
- Search the area.
- Yes, sir.

314
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,920
- Mr. Phathi, let her go.
- Ugh!

315
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,240
- Kitti, let go of me!
- Let go of her.

316
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,360
- Ma'am.
- Kitti, let go of me!

317
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,000
- Where are you going?
- Shut up!

318
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,120
You're yelling at me now,
you damn servant?

319
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,040
- Yeah.
- Damn you!

320
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,120
Kitti, you bastard!

321
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,600
I've hated you for so long, Phathi.

322
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,840
That mouth of yours
needs to be stomped on.

323
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,720
Let's go, ma'am. I've got the car ready.

324
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,120
- Let's go.
- Kitti, you…

325
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,880
Kitti!

326
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,880
Hey, you!

327
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,360
Get back here, Kitti!

328
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,800
Let's go, ma'am. Hurry.

329
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,920
- Follow me.
- Hey.

330
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,960
Let's go. Go, go.

331
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,200
Hey, come back here!
Where are you running off to?!

332
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,880
Hey, come back! Hey!

333
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,200
Dammit.

334
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,360
Officer! Officer, over here!

335
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,480
This way. They ran that way!

336
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,000
- Which way?
- That way. Hurry up!

337
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,840
- Follow me.
- That way! Hurry!

338
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,880
You're getting arrested!

339
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,720
You're rotting in jail!

340
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,600
Dammit.

341
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,480
What now, officers?

342
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,840
Hey, let go. Why are you arresting me?

343
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,160
Go arrest my wife.

344
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,440
Come on. I'm not running anywhere.
I'm wearing an EM bracelet. How can I run?

345
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,920
Let me go, officers.

346
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,200
Stop!

347
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,920
Ma'am!

348
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,400
Surrender. Now!

349
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,640
- Calm down.
- Now.

350
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,680
Ma'am, get to the car and escape.

351
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,040
Now.

352
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,160
Now.

353
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,120
- Stop.
- Ma'am!

354
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,400
Stop. Move back.

355
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,520
I'm surrendering.

356
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,680
I'm surrendering.

357
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,400
Arrest me.

358
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,880
Request backup at the backyard.
One suspect fleeing. Now.

359
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,880
Turn around. Now!

360
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,280
Hands behind your back.

361
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,560
Now!

362
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,560
On your knees.

363
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,000
Kneel down.

364
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,560
Kitti, hurry!

365
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,360
Stop!

366
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,320
- Ma'am, careful.
- Stop.

367
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,680
Ma'am, get in now.

368
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,560
Alert HQ. Alert HQ.

369
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,080
Intercept a Honda Accord.

370
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,040
- Captain, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

371
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,560
Thank you…

372
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,640
for doing the right thing.

373
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,360
No matter what happens,

374
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,800
I will always be by your side.

375
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,280
So will I.

376
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,880
You were amazing, Sara.

377
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,720
Thank you, Nin.

378
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,520
How are things there, Bank?

379
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
Huh?

380
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,880
I'm sorry.

381
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,640
I couldn't manage to catch those two.

382
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,280
Don't say that.

383
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,960
The fact that you're okay
is already a huge relief.

384
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,400
But at least what we did worked.

385
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,360
Right now, #SaveKamon

386
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,720
is trending number one.

387
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,120
From now on,
you won't have to fight alone, Kamon.

388
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,280
We really need

389
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,840
to thank you

390
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,040
for proposing this idea.

391
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,200
<i>I think you should</i>
<i>reveal your real identity.</i>

392
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,040
The situation has changed.

393
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,320
This isn't like before,
back when no one knew you,

394
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,800
or when that family
still looked perfectly united.

395
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,600
But based on all this evidence,

396
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,120
I'm not sure

397
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,040
how far we can actually prosecute them.

398
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,960
But we've come this far.

399
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,840
I've got nothing left to lose.

400
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,120
I believe this will help.

401
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,120
Once the public learns the truth,

402
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,560
they'll stand with you.

403
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,280
And your case

404
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,000
will gain even more attention.

405
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,480
At first, I was scared

406
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,680
of what would happen
if I showed my real identity.

407
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,000
But you told me to trust in the truth.

408
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,480
And now I've seen another side.

409
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,520
So,

410
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,760
we can now move to the next step.

411
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,120
<i>First,</i>

412
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,960
<i>you need to cancel your death certificate.</i>

413
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,560
<i>Then,</i>

414
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,560
<i>you'll fight this case</i>
<i>under your real name, Kamon Tisraksa.</i>

415
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,760
<i>As for the legal stuff,</i>

416
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,360
<i>I've prepared all the documents.</i>

417
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,240
Hello.

418
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,320
I'm here to cancel my death certificate.

419
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,840
Here are the medical

420
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,760
and legal documents.

421
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,680
I'm here as her witness.

422
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,840
You're Ms. Kamon, right?

423
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,160
I remember you.

424
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,600
I'm rooting for you.

425
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,600
- Is that Ms. Kamon?
- Ms. Kamon.

426
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,360
Yes, that's Ms. Kamon.

427
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,400
- Ms. Kamon, we're supporting you.
- We're rooting for you.

428
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,720
Can we take a picture with you?

429
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,080
You can finally start over now,

430
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,120
Kamon.

431
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,880
MS. KAMON TISRAKSA

432
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,840
Whose letter is this?

433
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,440
<i>Ten million baht in cash</i>
<i>for all the evidence.</i>

434
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,160
<i>18th, 2 p.m.</i>

435
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,080
<i>Café in the alley next to the airport.</i>

436
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,440
<i>Corner table by the window.</i>

437
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,400
<i>Do not bring cops.</i>

438
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,440
He's calling.

439
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,360
<i>It's me.</i>

440
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,520
Chawadon.

441
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,000
Where are you?

442
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,520
We've been waiting forever.

443
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,600
I had to make sure
you weren't planning anything sneaky,

444
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,280
like bringing the police to ambush me.

445
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,800
Well,

446
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,720
I guess you've followed the rules.

447
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,520
If you're sure, come out now.

448
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,240
We brought the money, see?

449
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,880
Just put it there.

450
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,240
What do you mean?

451
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,720
You said you'd hand over the evidence.

452
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,960
If we just leave the money,

453
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,600
how are we supposed to get it?

454
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,400
Under the table,

455
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,520
there's a hidden box.

456
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,320
<i>Inside it</i>

457
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,480
<i>is the location</i>
<i>where I've stored the evidence.</i>

458
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,520
<i>Just leave the money.</i>

459
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,800
Once I know I'm safe,

460
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,640
I'll send the code.

461
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,600
And how do we know
you won't just trick us or screw us over?

462
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,960
You don't have many choices.

463
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,520
Let me give you some advice, as a lawyer.

464
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,120
If you get my evidence,

465
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,960
it will nail Naree completely.

466
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,639
It will guarantee
you'll be able to reopen the case.

467
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,719
<i>But if you don't,</i>

468
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,480
<i>you'll be stuck</i>
<i>battling it out in court for ages.</i>

469
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,040
And who knows

470
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,760
how that'll end.

471
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,280
Okay. Then let's do it your way.

472
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,520
<i>Good choice.</i>

473
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,840
Now get out.

474
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,960
I'll contact you later.

475
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,600
We left the money just like he asked.

476
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,920
He should be picking it up
and running soon.

477
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,200
<i>Okay, he's probably waiting</i>
<i>until he's sure he's safe</i>

478
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,800
<i>before he sends you the code.</i>

479
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,320
<i>If he picked somewhere near the airport,</i>

480
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,560
<i>it's possible he's planning</i>
<i>to flee the country.</i>

481
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,360
<i>I've already sent people</i>
<i>to stake out the airport.</i>

482
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,240
I'm counting on you, Bank.

483
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,400
BANK

484
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,920
You think I'd run off on a plane?

485
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,760
Idiots.

486
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,880
You'll never catch me.

487
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,160
691

488
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,840
He sent it.

489
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,920
- Here.
- Okay.

490
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,000
PARCEL LOCKER ACCESS CODE

491
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,480
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

492
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,360
MR. CHAYUT CHAROENPAKDEECHAI

493
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,880
MS. KULNAREE LERTHANAKUL

494
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,280
Thanks.

495
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,240
- Hey!
- Where are you going?

496
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,760
- Come here.
- Hey! How did you get here?

497
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,840
- Hey, let me go.
- Come here.

498
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,640
- Stay still.
- Hey, let go of me!

499
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,280
Hey! Let go!

500
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,400
- Stay still.
- Stay still.

501
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,640
Stop, Chawadon.

502
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,120
You're under arrest for embezzlement
and concealing evidence in a murder case.

503
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,080
- Take him into custody.
- Yes, sir.

504
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,640
- Go.
- Hey, wait.

505
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,840
- Wait!
- Go.

506
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,960
- No. Let me go!
- Go.

507
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,880
- Hey.
- Go.

508
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,400
- Dammit!
- Don't resist.

509
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,040
Get in the car.

510
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,880
How's it going, Bank?

511
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,440
We've caught Chawadon.

512
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,280
He parked the car in the woods

513
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,800
and snuck out through a natural trail
just like Panter told us.

514
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,040
Aside from the vacation home
you told me about,

515
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,720
I honestly can't think
of where Don could have run off to.

516
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,840
To be honest,

517
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,760
with everything that's happened,

518
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,440
I feel like I don't know him at all.

519
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,400
I know where.

520
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,400
The day Dad came to pick up his things,

521
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,920
I saw him print out a map.

522
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,720
It looked like a route to Mae Sot.

523
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,360
Mae Sot?

524
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,600
If that's the case,

525
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,240
then he's probably going
through natural channels.

526
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,280
I'll have men intercept him.

527
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,520
<i>Yesterday, police arrested</i>
<i>Mr. Chawadon Lerthanakul, while fleeing,</i>

528
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:13,000
<i>and got evidence of a murder case</i>
<i>involving Mrs. Kulnaree Lerthanakul,</i>

529
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,120
<i>a suspect in a homicide</i>
<i>that occurred 19 years ago.</i>

530
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,240
<i>More details will be released soon.</i>

531
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,360
Ma'am, we've got an update.

532
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,360
The prosecution has now received
all the evidence we got from Chawadon.

533
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,160
The next step is filing charges in court.

534
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,480
And Sara,

535
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:41,000
I'll move you to a safe house
to enter the witness protection program.

536
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,040
So, next,

537
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,040
we have to find Naree.

538
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,720
Only then
can the court process begin, right?

539
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,000
That's correct.

540
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,600
Kulnaree is the key defendant.

541
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,840
We have Mrs. Woranan as a witness too.

542
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,440
No way she can get out of this now.

543
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,040
And if I meet Kulnaree at court,

544
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,440
can I punch her in the face?

545
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,120
So,

546
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,480
we have four defendants, right?

547
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,200
It's five.

548
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,520
My father was involved in this too.

549
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,080
I love and care about him deeply,

550
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,800
but that's not a good enough reason
for him to avoid responsibility.

551
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,480
But Uncle Chayut is sick, Kram.

552
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,120
That's true.

553
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,160
But

554
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,280
the justice system

555
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,880
has procedures in place
to handle ill offenders.

556
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,480
In that case,

557
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,880
the court will appoint a doctor to assess

558
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,920
whether Uncle Chayut

559
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,640
is able to understand
and participate in the legal process.

560
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,800
If his condition improves,

561
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,800
everything must proceed
as the law dictates.

562
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,560
Right.

563
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,640
<i>You brought everything?</i>

564
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,920
You'll head to the witness accommodation
and stay there.

565
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,080
There'll be a police escort.

566
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,720
Let's go.

567
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,440
<i>Moving now is the safest.</i>

568
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,600
<i>We should reach the safe house by dawn.</i>

569
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,000
Good evening to all our viewers.

570
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,920
I'm Kulnaree Lerthanakul.

571
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,040
You've been looking for me, haven't you?

572
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,200
Well, here I am.

573
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,120
Mom.

574
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,080
Look.

575
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,960
- Naree?
- Mom?

576
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,720
CRAZY WOMAN

577
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,840
<i>Hey, Officer!</i>

578
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,640
<i>What is this?</i>

579
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,600
<i>I don't even know</i>
<i>where she popped out from.</i>

580
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,400
<i>She went live like that? Is she insane?</i>

581
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,800
What are you waiting for?

582
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,760
Come arrest me.

583
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,080
Come on.

584
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,360
Come get me.

585
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,880
Watch out!

586
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,840
How the hell did they find us?

587
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,160
Everyone stay in the car.

588
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,840
Sara, duck down.

589
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,040
Be careful, Bank.

590
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,520
Aunt Nan, what's wrong with Mom? Aunt Nan!

591
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,240
<i>Those shots were beautiful.</i>

592
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,320
<i>I'm not showing you. I'd get banned.</i>

593
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,120
- Ter, let go.
- It's nothing, Sydney.

594
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,040
Follow me.

595
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,160
So what now, Captain?

596
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,720
Wanna shoot me?

597
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,560
Go on, shoot me.

598
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,360
Come on, shoot.

599
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,040
Shoot her.

600
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,920
You can't do it, can you?

601
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,760
Because legally,

602
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,160
I'm unarmed.

603
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,880
So, you can't shoot me.

604
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,680
I should thank the law

605
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,600
for being so merciful
to murderers like me.

606
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,560
Even when the killer
is standing right in front of you,

607
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,960
the police still can't do a damn thing.

608
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,720
Phleng, get Sara out of here!

609
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,960
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

610
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,800
<i>Kamon, where are you?</i>

611
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,960
