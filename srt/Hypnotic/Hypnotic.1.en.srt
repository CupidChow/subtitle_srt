00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,560
THIS DRAMA IS CREATED
FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,880
ALL CHARACTERS, SETTINGS
AND EVENTS ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,600
THERE IS NO INTENT TO REFERENCE
ANY REAL INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,920
NOR TO PROMOTE INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR
OR UNDERMINE MORAL STANDARDS

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,720
COUNTDOWN TO 2007

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,920
Ladies and gentlemen,

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,080
the big moment is just about to arrive.
In just a few heartbeats,

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,400
we will step
into a brand-new era together.

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,600
Please welcome

10
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,600
the inspiring figure behind the success

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,920
of Thailand's leading
luxury condominium projects,

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,960
Mrs. Jira Lerthanakul

13
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,720
and the Lerthanakul family,

14
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,520
chairman and founder of Le Thana Group.

15
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,280
Let's give them a big round of applause!

16
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,640
Alright then,

17
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,440
I believe everyone is ready

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,800
to enter this moment of joy.

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,240
Are you ready?

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,840
- Ready!
- Ready!

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,120
Then, let's start
the countdown together from…

22
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,000
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

23
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,960
five, four, three, two, one…

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,760
Happy New Year to everyone!

25
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,920
Thank you all.

26
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,400
19 YEARS LATER

27
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,480
What did I do to you, Sydney?

28
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,800
Being annoying, that's what.

29
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,000
Didn't I tell you to leave this school?

30
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,120
Seeing your face makes me want to puke.

31
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,080
Blegh.

32
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,400
No, don't.

33
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,000
Don't!

34
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,960
No!

35
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,560
I… I'm sorry.

36
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,040
Don't.

37
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,160
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,320
I didn't mean it.

39
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,680
Sorry?

40
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,920
Sydney, something's happened!

41
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,760
AMBULANCE

42
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,200
Judee?

43
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,720
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE

44
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,840
Hello?

45
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,480
Okay, I'll come right away.

46
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,680
Ma'am. Ma'am.

47
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,760
Judee.

48
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,160
I'm here.

49
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,800
Mommy's here, Judee.

50
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,320
Kids, no photos.

51
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,040
Kids, don't film, okay?

52
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,560
Step back, please.

53
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,200
Let's talk.

54
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,440
Don't do this, okay? Don't.

55
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,840
- Judee, honey.
- Seoul.

56
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,520
Don't do this.

57
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,240
- Seoul.
- Please don't.

58
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,240
Sydney, if your friend jumps,
our family will be in trouble.

59
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,760
Calm down, Seoul.

60
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,160
Talk to her gently.

61
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,520
Don't blame me.

62
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,160
I have nothing to do with this, Ter.

63
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,640
Don't do this, Judee.

64
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,280
Trust me, okay?

65
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,600
No!

66
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,320
Sydney bullied me!

67
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,160
<i>The teachers didn't help me!</i>

68
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,320
You didn't help me!

69
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,040
No one helped me!

70
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,280
I don't want to live anymore!

71
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,640
Are you really going to jump?

72
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,440
That's Ms. Sara.

73
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,560
She's the child psychologist

74
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,680
working with the school.

75
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,240
Let her handle this.

76
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,240
Don't come closer.

77
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,560
I'm asking, do you really want to jump?

78
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,240
Yes.

79
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,760
Because no one helps me!

80
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,280
I don't want to be bullied
by Sydney anymore.

81
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,520
It's all Sydney's fault!

82
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,880
It's Sydney's fault!

83
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,200
Judee…

84
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,080
Are you alright?

85
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,440
It's because of her, right?

86
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,920
Is it because of her?

87
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,000
It's her.

88
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,240
She's the one who made Judee do this.

89
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,480
She's a murderer.

90
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,960
This kid is a murderer!

91
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,680
Ma'am, calm down.

92
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,000
- Ma'am.
- Please calm down.

93
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,520
- You had to bully your friend this badly?
- Calm down.

94
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,240
You had to push your friend this far?

95
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,840
You wanted her to jump off a building?!

96
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,120
You murderer!

97
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,559
What kind of kid are you?!

98
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,679
Murderer!

99
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,000
You little murderer!

100
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,800
Sydney!

101
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
<i>I heard it's about bullying.</i>

102
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,280
<i>How can a school this expensive</i>
<i>still have bullying?</i>

103
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,840
<i>Expensive schools are the worst,</i>
<i>lots of prejudice.</i>

104
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,280
<i>A 10-year-old</i>
<i>wants to jump off a building. Poor thing.</i>

105
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,800
<i>Who did this to her?</i>

106
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,920
<i>I'm sharing this. My niece studies here.</i>

107
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,560
<i>So many scandals, bullying everywhere.</i>

108
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,800
<i>The principal seems like a money-grubber.</i>

109
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,120
<i>I'm complimenting. Don't sue me.</i>

110
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,360
<i>All big families here.</i>

111
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,400
<i>They don't fear anyone.</i>

112
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,920
<i>I really want to know who it was.</i>

113
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,280
<i>Bullying until a friend jumps, so cruel.</i>

114
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,280
<i>Where's the link? Ready to give them hell!</i>

115
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,320
<i>#ThonglorInternationalSchool</i>

116
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,640
It's trending overnight

117
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,400
with the hashtag
#ThonglorInternationalSchool.

118
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,880
Netizens are trying to find out

119
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,560
who bullied the girl.

120
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,640
<i>They're ready to call out that account.</i>

121
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,200
Yes?

122
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,240
Go ahead.

123
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,440
Help me look around.

124
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,480
Where's Dad?

125
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,560
Come take photos.

126
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,880
This way, Ms. Ying.

127
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,680
Hello, Ms. Ying.

128
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,040
Let's take a photo together.

129
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,280
Panter, dear,

130
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,520
when are you going to London?

131
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,400
Tell Auntie when you go,

132
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,360
so I can have a friend look after you.

133
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,680
Thank you, Auntie.

134
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,880
I'm planning to go with Seoul.

135
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
But if you're going,

136
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,880
you'll have to study harder, Seoul.

137
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,960
Seoul's more into activities…

138
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,800
and influencer stuff.

139
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,320
Kids have different interests.

140
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,440
Ms. Ying,
have you decided yet about the land

141
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,040
for our co-project,

142
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,560
the Learning Space?

143
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,520
It's settled.

144
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,000
Right now,

145
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,880
I'm bringing in experts
from many fields to help.

146
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,800
I invited one along today.

147
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,880
I see.

148
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,040
There she is.

149
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,120
Hello, Mrs. Jira,

150
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,920
Mrs. Waranun,

151
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,880
and Mrs. Kulnaree.

152
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,760
You look familiar.

153
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,520
I'm a child psychologist

154
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,160
working with the school.

155
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,880
Ms. Ying asked me to consult
for the Learning Space project,

156
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,840
so I came along today.

157
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,800
If Ms. Ying recommends you,

158
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,440
I have no objection.

159
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
You're the one who helped Judee,

160
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,520
the child who fell
from the building, right?

161
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,040
That's right.

162
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,640
I didn't recognize you at all.

163
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,360
You look beautiful today.

164
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,200
It's nothing.

165
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,560
I'm just thinking…

166
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,480
If we had let the authorities handle it,

167
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,600
maybe the kid wouldn't have fallen.

168
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,880
No one ever knows, right,

169
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,560
when something unexpected will happen?

170
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:36,920
Excuse me.

171
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,920
I know you're proud
of the manners your father taught you

172
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,560
from those police banquet tables,

173
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,680
but you don't have to bring them here.

174
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,120
Well, I like

175
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,480
to show off.

176
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,640
When your mother gets on stage,

177
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,200
should I strip naked

178
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,840
to bless the penthouse, make it go viral?

179
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,960
Is it a good idea?

180
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,840
Disgusting.

181
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,160
Oh, Naree.

182
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,160
With how disgusting I am,

183
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,560
I still managed to have two kids with you.

184
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,040
So damn proud.

185
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,760
Hey.

186
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,600
Sorry, Mrs. Naree.

187
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,240
I don't know how to drink like a snob.

188
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,680
It loses the flavor.

189
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,080
Sorry I brought you to the wrong event.

190
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,320
If there's a stray dog
and cat event coming up,

191
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,080
I'll make you the guest of honor.

192
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,080
You'd suit a dog event.

193
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,520
Naree.

194
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,840
And now, it's the moment
everyone's been waiting for.

195
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,960
Come on, kids.

196
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,440
We're about to meet
the owner of the luxury

197
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,400
you can truly touch.

198
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,560
Please welcome Mrs. Jira Lerthanakul,

199
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,680
owner of The Learning House
by Le Thana Group.

200
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,120
A big round of applause, please.

201
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,360
I'd like to thank you all
for your interest in our penthouse.

202
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,280
Right now, there is no location

203
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,320
better than this one.

204
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,880
Thank you.

205
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,760
And here is the Kindiko Ocean Set.

206
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,840
Here it is.

207
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,200
Here.

208
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,280
Please enjoy.

209
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,120
Please.

210
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,760
It's fine.

211
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,160
- Kram.
- Yes?

212
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,880
The guests love your food.

213
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,359
Thank you so much, Nun.

214
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,560
Thank you for the opportunity

215
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,920
to be part of this event.

216
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,400
People who are underprivileged

217
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,560
always have to wait
for chances from others,

218
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,880
like this, right?

219
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,839
Patee, that's rude.

220
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,320
- Please excuse me.
- Yes.

221
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,880
What, Nun?

222
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,960
What's wrong with you?

223
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,280
If you're drunk, just go home.

224
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,920
I didn't want
to come here in the first place.

225
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,120
And you, what's wrong?

226
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,680
Why would you care about him?

227
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,120
We're the ones who've done him a favor.

228
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,240
We can do whatever we want with him.

229
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,040
His father has a good living

230
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,240
- because of us--
- Enough.

231
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,520
Don't talk about this again.

232
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,920
Get yourself together

233
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,960
and wait for the interview.

234
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,120
Keep running your mouth, old hag.

235
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,600
Your dentures are gonna fall out.

236
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,640
We must give credit to Waranun,

237
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,800
my eldest daughter.

238
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,360
She's really worked hard on this project.

239
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,520
And do you think the news on social media

240
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,080
is affecting the image of the project?

241
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,320
Yes, how would you
answer questions on that point?

242
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,840
About Sydney
bullying a classmate at school

243
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,320
until she went up to jump off a building,

244
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,640
is it true?

245
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,640
- Please answer.
- Please answer.

246
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,760
- So, what's the truth?
- I didn't do it!

247
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,880
Is it true?

248
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,760
Sydney, sweetheart.

249
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,840
But on social media, they're saying

250
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,480
the name of the kid who bullied her friend

251
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,600
is the name of a city in Australia.

252
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,800
Isn't that you, Sydney?

253
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,040
Yes, we've heard
she's a high-society child too.

254
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,760
Please be polite

255
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,960
and ask only topics
related to the project.

256
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,560
Many comments say

257
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,480
Sydney often bullies her friends.

258
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,040
- Is it true?
- Please answer.

259
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,960
- Is it you?
- Is it?

260
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,600
- Please answer.
- Please answer.

261
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,920
- Please answer.
- Is it true?

262
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,720
- Is it true?
- Sydney.

263
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,560
Sydney, please answer.

264
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,600
Please answer.

265
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,120
- Please answer.
- You haven't answered yet.

266
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,880
- Is it true?
- Please answer, Sydney.

267
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,080
You haven't answered yet.

268
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,400
Sydney.

269
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,400
Sydney.

270
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,960
Calm down, honey.

271
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,800
- Sydney.
- I want them all to die!

272
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,520
All of them!

273
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,000
Sydney, calm down.

274
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,920
So annoying.

275
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,560
The one who should die is you.

276
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,960
Seoul.

277
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,080
Don't talk to your sister like that.

278
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,320
You're always taking her side.

279
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,880
It's because you behave like this.

280
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,840
Didn't that principal say
the story was already buried?

281
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,720
- It's ruined Sydney's image.
- She ruined it herself.

282
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,720
Seoul.

283
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,120
Sydney,

284
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,400
I'll take care of the principal for you.

285
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,120
Don't worry about anyone else.

286
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,520
Sydney. Listen to me.

287
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,040
We must be the ones
in control of everything.

288
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,360
And you're not wrong.

289
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,160
Kids are like this, Mom.

290
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,880
If the reporters hadn't pressed her,

291
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,880
Sydney wouldn't be like this.

292
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,040
We don't know
which outlet asked the question yet.

293
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,040
I will handle it myself.

294
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,080
I've already sent someone
to find out which reporter it was

295
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,240
while you were fussing around
calming Sydney.

296
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Sydney, dear,

297
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,160
you should apologize to Grandma.

298
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,400
Am I confused or something?

299
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,600
Were you the one who gave birth to Sydney?

300
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,440
As far as I remember,
the one who pushed Sydney out

301
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,920
was Naree,

302
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,040
not you.

303
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,320
You of all people should know

304
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,160
that the one who gives birth

305
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,400
isn't always the one who raises the best.

306
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,440
That's true.

307
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,640
Otherwise,

308
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,400
the son of a former high-ranking policeman

309
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,880
wouldn't have this kind of behavior.

310
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,600
Oh, thank you very much, Mother,

311
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,640
for reminding me.

312
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,600
Apologize to me

313
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,480
and promise you won't do it again.

314
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,920
Sydney.

315
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,680
Please apologize to Grandma, honey.

316
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,520
Sydney.

317
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,120
Just apologize and get it over with.
It's annoying.

318
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,080
I'm not wrong.

319
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,920
Mom said I'm not wrong.

320
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,360
I won't apologize!

321
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,800
What did I do wrong?!

322
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,800
What did I do wrong?!

323
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,080
Sydney.

324
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,840
Sydney.

325
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,920
Sydney.

326
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,840
- Sydney.
- Sydney.

327
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,400
- Sydney, it's okay.
- Sydney.

328
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,560
- It's okay.
- Sydney, enough.

329
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,360
- Sydney, enough now.
- Sydney.

330
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,280
- Sydney.
- Sydney.

331
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,720
You're not wrong, Sydney.

332
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,800
Sydney. You're not wrong.

333
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,400
- I did nothing wrong!
- Sydney.

334
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,800
No!

335
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
Sydney.

336
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,280
So much pressure.

337
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,960
It's just a small thing.

338
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,200
Why ruin the mood like this?

339
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,480
Would you like to smell
some lovely flowers?

340
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,560
They might cheer you up.

341
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,680
Want some?

342
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,760
Mom, what's wrong with you?

343
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,280
Let's end this.

344
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,680
If everyone wants to punish Sydney,

345
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,080
I've already taken the punishment for her.

346
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,520
Sydney.

347
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,120
Come to me, sweetheart.

348
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,160
These two seem
to love each other very much.

349
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,240
I'm going to pass out.

350
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,280
Naree is acting like this again.

351
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,800
I'm disturbed.

352
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,760
You know what Naree's like.

353
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,240
Don't overthink.

354
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,280
Ter, take your mom upstairs to rest.

355
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,200
Everyone's exhausted today.

356
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,440
I'll lock up the house.

357
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,400
Ter,

358
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,120
I'm so happy you're my son.

359
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,200
You've never given me
a headache even once.

360
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,080
Wow.

361
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,160
Look at you.

362
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,760
What?

363
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,600
If my place is a stray dog event,

364
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,520
then I think you should go

365
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,720
to a mental illness gathering.

366
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,280
I'd rather get hurt

367
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,480
than let anyone punish Sydney.

368
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,920
Why didn't you say it earlier?

369
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,640
I've got a baseball bat in the car.

370
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,560
I could've taken it for you.

371
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,080
That's what happens.

372
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,400
With a mother like this,

373
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,160
no wonder the kid is crazy.

374
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,120
I hate you, Dad.

375
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,400
That's your issue.

376
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,280
Does it hurt, Mom?

377
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,760
It doesn't hurt.

378
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,040
I did it for you, Sydney.

379
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,960
It doesn't hurt at all.

380
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,040
Remember this.

381
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,360
No one loves you

382
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,120
and understands you better than I do.

383
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,120
Breaking in like this,
if I stab you, it's not my fault.

384
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,960
Come on. It's just a prank.

385
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,320
You'll stab me, Sara?

386
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,840
I gotta be careful, right?

387
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,800
So, did it work out perfectly?

388
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,320
Sydney!

389
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,440
You little murderer!

390
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,720
Same old menu again.

391
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,440
I only know how to make a few things.

392
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,400
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

393
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,760
I'll eat with Mom.

394
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,080
I'm just here to drop off the documents
you asked for. Here.

395
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,440
How's Auntie Goy lately? Is she okay?

396
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,840
Not so good lately,

397
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,520
but better than before
you stepped in to help.

398
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,000
Hey, don't forget
you've got an interview this afternoon.

399
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,040
You're really getting famous now.

400
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,360
If I had a choice, I wouldn't.

401
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,680
But there's no other way.

402
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,080
Eat it all.

403
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,120
- Don't forget that.
- Oh, the snacks.

404
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,120
Bye.

405
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,440
Mom, Sara asked me
to bring you some fruit and snacks.

406
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,360
Go rest.

407
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,120
I'll iron and deliver them myself.

408
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,560
Sara takes good care of us.

409
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,120
I wish I could cook for her, but I can't.

410
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,440
If there's anything you can do
to help her,

411
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,360
please do.

412
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,560
I plan to go all the way with Sara, Mom.

413
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,160
Good.

414
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,960
Whoever does wrong

415
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,400
must face the consequences.

416
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
Kram.

417
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,160
Last night, Sydney did get in trouble.

418
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,200
How do they raise a kid to be this wild?

419
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,440
Have kids when you're ready.

420
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,720
But having a lot of money
isn't enough, bro.

421
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,920
Udo, weren't you a bit harsh?

422
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,200
Why are you defending that family?

423
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,000
They're not your relatives.

424
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,240
And they don't care about you.

425
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,400
It's not everyone.

426
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,920
The kids and Nun are good to me.

427
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,320
I mean the others.

428
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,440
Your father used to work for that family.

429
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,480
When he got sick, they cut ties,
like they hated him.

430
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,440
I still don't get it.

431
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,520
It's alright.

432
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,520
I'm sorry.

433
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,280
What's this, one earbud?

434
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,320
It's not mine.

435
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,200
Someone left it.

436
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,960
I'm planning to return it.

437
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:16,880
Give it to me.

438
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,080
So, why did you choose
to become a child psychologist?

439
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,200
I believe a child's development

440
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,560
depends on their environment

441
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,040
and the experiences

442
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,880
they encounter growing up.

443
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,360
There are good things

444
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,400
and bad things.

445
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,600
Something small to one person

446
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,560
can be huge to another.

447
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,640
Right now, Ms. Sara's schedule is packed.

448
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,080
You may have to wait.

449
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,320
Please add me on Line

450
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,120
and message me to check your slot.

451
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,040
Thank you.

452
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,120
There aren't enough staff.

453
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,560
There are almost
more patients than workers.

454
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,040
Are you complaining, Bew?

455
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,080
Sara…

456
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,880
I've been on the calls since we opened.

457
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,000
The phone's practically burning up.

458
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,080
Then you could just extend the hours.

459
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,600
Take on a few more cases.
You'd be able to help more people.

460
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,120
Ms. Sara,

461
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,160
Ms. Yanin would like to see you.

462
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,080
Yanin?

463
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,520
Yes.

464
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,640
SARA THE HEROINE

465
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,960
When did you get back, Nin?

466
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,040
I thought you'd be back
at the end of the year.

467
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,160
I had some things to handle here

468
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,920
and clear a few matters up.

469
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,760
Sit down.

470
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,080
Right.

471
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,040
I brought you a gift, Sara.

472
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,720
PRELIMINARY MENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT FORM

473
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,840
Do it.

474
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,920
You already know

475
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,760
that psychologists like us can't do that.

476
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,840
We already know the answers.

477
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,920
That's even better.

478
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,159
Because you can choose

479
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,840
whether or not to lie.

480
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,800
I'm sorry, Nin.

481
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,760
Everything

482
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,880
is just the way you think it is.

483
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,719
Everything I've done,

484
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:52,199
I've done for that.

485
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,200
And I'm supposed
to just look the other way?

486
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,040
I know exactly

487
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,320
what I'm doing.

488
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,560
And I know

489
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,080
you're not comfortable with it.

490
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,520
But I'm sorry.

491
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,440
I won't change my mind.

492
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,800
But you know, right, Sara,

493
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,920
that no matter what you do,

494
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,440
we can't go back and change the past?

495
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,160
That child

496
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,680
is dead, Sara.

497
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,480
A life that doesn't move forward

498
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,320
isn't called a life.

499
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,320
But a life

500
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,000
spent enduring pain

501
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,920
and suffering

502
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,320
every day

503
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,160
isn't a life either.

504
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,120
I have to make it happen

505
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,680
before I can truly live.

506
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,680
Welcome back, Nin.

507
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,040
<i>Awesome, huh? What was that?</i>

508
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,640
<i>Again?</i>

509
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,720
- <i>Not again.</i>
- <i>Just once in a while.</i>

510
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,560
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

511
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,440
Bua.

512
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,960
I'll be back late tonight.

513
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,640
A client booked the whole restaurant.

514
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,720
Please watch Dad for me.

515
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,840
Don't worry, Mr. Kram.
I'll take care of him.

516
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,840
Thank you.

517
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,560
Dad, I'm going to work now.

518
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,640
Excuse me. Which ones are better?

519
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,240
I'll ask the staff for you.

520
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,000
What dish are you making?

521
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,280
Soup.

522
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,280
Soup?

523
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,280
Can I see?

524
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,280
Fresh, sweet tomatoes

525
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,040
should smell a little earthy at the stem.

526
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,480
Pick the ones
that are bright red and heavy.

527
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,880
Want me to help you pick?

528
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,560
- Yes.
- Let's go.

529
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,520
Try smelling this one.

530
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,000
- This one smells.
- Here.

531
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,120
Here. That's five.

532
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,040
- Thank you.
- Right.

533
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,320
Did you go to the penthouse launch
of Nun's family?

534
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,040
You were the chef at that event, right?

535
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,720
Yes.

536
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,160
I've been meaning to return this to you,

537
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,240
but didn't know where to find you.

538
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,960
- I already bought a new one.
- Oh.

539
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,680
Are you close to Mrs. Waranun's family?

540
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,960
Not that much.

541
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,680
My father used to work there,

542
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,400
but he doesn't anymore.

543
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,400
He had problems with them?

544
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,840
My father's sick.

545
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,360
So, he stopped working.

546
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,240
He used to run a construction company.

547
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,000
You don't seem to like crowds.

548
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,640
But that penthouse launch the other day

549
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,640
was packed

550
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,680
and so chaotic.

551
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,080
You must have been exhausted.

552
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,600
I read that introverts

553
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,560
need a lot of energy to socialize.

554
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,040
People's motivations
come from many things.

555
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,920
Some act out of love.

556
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,480
Some want to prove themselves.

557
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,040
Sometimes it comes from what they've lost.

558
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,920
I have to go now.

559
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,920
Okay. Bye.

560
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,960
Hey!

561
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,360
Hey.

562
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,360
Hey.

563
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,560
Ms. Sara.

564
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,480
Hey.

565
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,320
Hey, take it slow.

566
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,400
Are you okay now?

567
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,920
I'm okay.

568
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,920
I'm okay now.

569
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,840
You just collapsed out of nowhere.
You scared me.

570
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,320
Are you sure you're okay?

571
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,880
Want me to take you somewhere
or call a ride for you?

572
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,000
It's okay.

573
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,000
Thank you.

574
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,000
Come eat at my restaurant sometime.

575
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,000
It's on me.

576
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,280
To make up for you
having to buy new earbuds.

577
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,840
Okay.

578
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,520
Get home safe.

579
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,160
Yanin.

580
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,560
What are you two planning to do?

581
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,320
And if I don't tell you,

582
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,720
will you hypnotize me to talk?

583
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:26,080
If you saw Sara at her lowest point,

584
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,520
you'd understand

585
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,200
why I don't want her to go back there.

586
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,600
But if you experienced what we have,

587
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,840
you'd understand us too.

588
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,600
We're going to reopen the case.

589
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,200
KAMON TIDRAKSA

590
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,880
<i>Today we're proud to show you</i>

591
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,960
<i>the potential of our children</i>

592
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,560
<i>in music and art,</i>

593
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,880
<i>which we support</i>

594
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,600
<i>and prioritize</i>

595
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,400
<i>alongside IQ</i>

596
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,320
<i>and EQ development.</i>

597
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,640
And the next performance

598
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,280
is a piano solo

599
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,840
by Phopfah Lerthanakul,

600
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,080
also known as Sydney from Grade Four.

601
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,880
You shameless brat!

602
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,520
Mrs. Narumon?

603
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:48,960
What are you staring at me for?

604
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,280
You don't know me, do you?

605
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,560
Security!

606
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,040
I'm the mother of Judee,

607
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,480
the girl who almost
ended her life because of you.

608
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,000
Remember?

609
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,080
Judee.

610
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,960
Step back, please. Let's talk.

611
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,160
<i>Don't.</i>

612
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,480
Don't you feel anything

613
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,520
- that your friend almost died?
- I didn't do it.

614
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,440
You did.

615
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,120
I don't know

616
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,800
how your family

617
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,840
- raised you.
- Sydney!

618
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,560
- Sydney!
- But out here,

619
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,360
you don't have the right
to do that to others.

620
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,840
Remember that.

621
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,680
Apologize to Judee now.

622
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,800
Apologize.

623
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,880
I didn't do it! It's not my fault!

624
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,680
- You did it!
- Let go!

625
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,120
- I didn't!
- Apologize to my child!

626
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,520
- Sydney.
- Sydney!

627
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,080
It's your fault! You did it!

628
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,360
Security.

629
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,920
- Sydney.
- Sydney, don't.

630
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,080
Sydney.

631
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,200
You want to fight?

632
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,280
Sydney.

633
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,280
Sydney.

634
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,120
Sydney, listen.

635
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,480
Sydney, listen to me.

636
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,560
Listen to me.

637
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,640
<i>You'll start to feel tired</i>

638
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,160
<i>and relaxed.</i>

639
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,160
<i>You'll want to rest.</i>

640
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,040
Right?

641
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,800
Five.

642
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,720
Four.

643
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,840
Three.

644
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:29,800
Two.

645
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,800
One.

646
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,040
Sleep.

647
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:55,920
<i>That child is dead, Sara.</i>

648
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,240
<i>Yes.</i>

649
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,160
<i>That child was murdered.</i>

650
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,720
<i>But no one was punished.</i>

651
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,120
<i>They see the law</i>

652
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,320
<i>as a tool to protect themselves</i>

653
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,440
<i>and crush others</i>

654
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,240
<i>into piles of dust.</i>

655
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,040
<i>But time</i>

656
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,320
<i>is a friend to the destroyed</i>

657
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,840
<i>and an enemy</i>

658
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,160
<i>to those who think they're untouchable.</i>

659
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,120
<i>Those who were once above the law</i>

660
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,520
<i>should learn what it's like</i>
<i>to be trapped beneath it,</i>

661
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,400
<i>unable to move,</i>

662
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,360
<i>unable to escape.</i>

663
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,000
<i>They'll learn how it feels.</i>

664
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,000
LERTHANAKUL FAMILY

665
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,600
<i>And when the time comes,</i>

666
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:54,200
<i>I'll make them pay</i>

667
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,400
<i>in a way they'll never forget.</i>

668
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,640
Plang said you're reopening the case.

669
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,320
I will make them pay
for what they've done.

670
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,960
Sydney will be suspended
from school for three months.

671
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,680
During this time,
she must undergo therapy with Ms. Sara.

672
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,920
Hello.

673
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,600
If you're ready, shall we begin?

674
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,840
How much do you want?

675
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,600
Keep your spare change.

676
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,000
You might have something

677
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,680
far more expensive to pay for later.

678
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,360
<i>What's happening? I can't move my body.</i>
