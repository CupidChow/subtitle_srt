00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,360
THIS DRAMA IS CREATED
FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,720
ALL CHARACTERS, SETTINGS
AND EVENTS ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,280
THERE IS NO INTENT TO REFERENCE
ANY REAL INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,920
NOR TO PROMOTE INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR
OR UNDERMINE MORAL STANDARDS

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,800
<i>Aunt Sampao, it's me, Kamon.</i>

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,320
<i>Aunt Sampao, it's me, Kamon.</i>

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,600
It's me, Kamon.

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,360
Kamon…

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,040
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,680
You must be so tired, aren't you?
If you could turn back time,

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,360
would you do the same?

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,080
No, I wouldn't.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,200
I don't want to endure it anymore,

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,640
not that kind of suffering.

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,080
If I could go back,
would you choose to tell the truth?

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,080
Will telling the truth help me?

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,040
Will it help me?

18
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,440
Tell the truth.
Telling the truth is the only way.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,280
Tell the truth.
Telling the truth is the only way.

20
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,200
<i>Tell the truth.</i>

21
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,400
<i>Tell the truth.</i>

22
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,400
<i>Tell the truth.</i>

23
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,520
- <i>Tell the truth.</i>
- Tell the truth.

24
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,720
<i>Tell the truth.</i>

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,720
- Tell the truth.
- <i>Tell the truth.</i>

26
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,400
- <i>Tell the truth.</i>
- <i>Tell the truth.</i>

27
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,640
- Tell the truth.
- <i>Tell the truth.</i>

28
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,400
Tell the truth!

29
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,440
Will this really work?

30
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,280
This subconscious-mind trick of yours.

31
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,200
She will believe that telling the truth
is the only way

32
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,480
to free her from her nightmare.

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,640
And after that,

34
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,840
we'll ask her to help us.

35
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,520
Sara.

36
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,240
Are you sure about this?

37
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,280
I am.

38
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,600
I think it's part of the reason

39
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,120
why that family
doesn't like Kram very much.

40
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,320
I think Uncle Chayut helped them
cover up my parents' case

41
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,640
in exchange for money.

42
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,160
Makes sense. After everything happened,

43
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,000
he suddenly expanded his business

44
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,040
and even got exclusive deals
with Le Thana Group.

45
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,720
He must've made a fortune.

46
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,680
And your Kram,

47
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,040
does he know that the money
that raised him was dirty?

48
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,960
I don't think he knows.

49
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,840
Otherwise,
he'd already know who Kamon was.

50
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,800
That means

51
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,480
on the day it happened,
Uncle Chayut must've been there too.

52
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,400
Otherwise, how would he have the evidence?

53
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,080
Or maybe

54
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,280
he already handed
all the evidence to them.

55
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,920
If I were him,

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,800
I'd have kept some evidence
to protect myself.

57
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,680
Plang, you're really smart.
How did you come up with that?

58
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,440
Yeah?

59
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,840
What you said

60
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,200
makes a lot of sense.

61
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,120
Even if Uncle Chayut can't testify for us,

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,560
that evidence we can potentially get,

63
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,360
plus Aunt Sampao's statement
and Kamon's petition,

64
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,440
might be enough
to reopen the case, I think.

65
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,240
But don't forget

66
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,440
that Uncle Chayut's got Alzheimer's.

67
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,360
He can barely talk.

68
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,440
How can he remember anything
about that evidence?

69
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,320
Those three seem unusually close.

70
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,400
And the documents you asked for

71
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,720
are all gathered in this folder.

72
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,080
- I'll go inside!
- Stop!

73
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,440
- You can't!
- Go get someone to talk to me!

74
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,840
Please stop!

75
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,760
I said stop!

76
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,840
What's going on? I'm the homeowner.

77
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,200
Well, ma'am,

78
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,720
this guy named Phathee hired me
to recover files from security cameras.

79
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,720
I got them back,
but he hasn't paid me yet.

80
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,920
<i>I'll pay you myself.</i>
<i>Just give me the recovered files.</i>

81
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,280
<i>That one kid</i>
<i>really stirred up some trouble.</i>

82
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,440
<i>Even deleted the security footage himself.</i>
<i>Kids these days are something else.</i>

83
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,760
That damn brat.

84
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,400
Ter.

85
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,640
What happened to you?

86
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,240
Grandma found out
Sol took Uncle Phathee's clip.

87
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,560
So, she punished him.

88
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,400
Aunt Naree kept telling Sol
to confess who told him to do it,

89
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,880
but he said he acted on his own

90
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,280
because he couldn't stand
the toxic things in the house.

91
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,720
Then Grandma…

92
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,840
<i>I tried to stop her,</i>

93
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,440
<i>but she was too angry.</i>

94
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,320
Ugh! Arrgh!

95
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,640
No! No!

96
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,480
But Uncle Phathee did something wrong!

97
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,280
You're really going to protect a criminal?

98
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,000
Don't you lecture me.

99
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,960
You ungrateful brat.

100
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,840
I've been trying to protect this family,

101
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,800
and I won't let you destroy it.

102
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,960
Ugh, no!

103
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,000
Grandma, stop. Please.

104
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,840
- Grandma, please.
- Please stop.

105
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,760
- Enough.
- I was wrong.

106
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,640
Mom.

107
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,120
Don't stop me. Go away.

108
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,600
Please, I'm begging you.

109
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,600
- Grandma, please stop.
- Please. No!

110
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
That's violence.

111
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,760
You have to report it, Ter.

112
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,520
You know the police can't touch my family.

113
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,240
If she finds out,

114
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,680
Sol and I will only get hurt again.

115
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,920
So, what now?
You're just going to let this go?

116
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,600
How's Sol right now?

117
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,520
<i>Grandma grounded him.</i>

118
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,200
<i>Won't let him go anywhere.</i>

119
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,679
<i>Won't even let him use his phone.</i>

120
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,240
I never wanted it to end up like this.

121
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,360
Don't blame yourself.

122
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,960
We couldn't have known

123
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,840
that they'd use violence against the kids.

124
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,200
But still, I'm responsible for this.

125
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,320
Should we confess?

126
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,640
Tell them we asked Sol to do it,
so he won't be blamed,

127
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,240
and they'll stop punishing him.

128
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,600
- Kram.
- I'll confess myself.

129
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,000
What do you mean?

130
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,320
You didn't do anything wrong.

131
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,320
It doesn't matter whether I did or not.

132
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,200
But they'll stop hurting the kids.

133
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,760
That family already hates me.

134
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,760
One more reason won't change anything.

135
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,640
At least this way,
you won't take the blame,

136
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,480
and you can keep treating Sydney.

137
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,360
That family won't believe it.

138
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,400
Yes, they will.

139
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,200
I'll tell them I've known
about it for a while.

140
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,080
And that I asked Sol
to get the evidence to help the victims.

141
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,080
So, please look after Ter for me.

142
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,040
I think I've got a better idea.

143
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
With that family,

144
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,120
you can't talk to them nicely.

145
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,480
Did Sara come to the clinic today?

146
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,960
If you've got something to say,
just say it.

147
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,200
I know you didn't just drop by
to check out the clinic.

148
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,120
KAMON TIDRAKSA

149
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,520
SARA CHAISITTHIKAM

150
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,240
You used to be the psychiatrist here.

151
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,440
You took care of Sara
and the child named Kamon too, right?

152
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,760
DEATH CERTIFICATE
KAMON TIDRAKSA

153
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,640
I want to know what kind of problem

154
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,200
that child Kamon had
that led her to take her own life.

155
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Why are you so interested?

156
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,320
Or did you…

157
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,840
do something to her?

158
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,160
I wouldn't remember.

159
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,040
Trivial people don't cross my mind.

160
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,840
That's why I came to ask you.

161
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,080
You should know best.

162
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,120
Or should I be asking you instead,

163
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,760
Ms. Sara?

164
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,440
Sorry for the interruption.

165
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,120
I just happened to be passing by.

166
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,240
When Kamon died,

167
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,480
you were very upset, weren't you?

168
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,280
A friend who entered
the orphanage on the same day

169
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,080
tragically died first.

170
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,520
If you want to know how Kamon died,

171
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,120
I'll tell you.

172
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,080
That child

173
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,880
was abused

174
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,640
by some heartless monsters,
physically and mentally.

175
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,920
It was more than a child could endure.

176
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,080
So, she left this world.

177
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,560
I'd love to meet that heartless monster,

178
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,920
just to thank them

179
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,040
for helping a poor,

180
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,880
suffering child finally find peace.

181
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,960
That's all for today.

182
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,040
Oh.

183
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,960
I really did come to the right people.

184
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,240
You two seem deeply attached
to that girl's death.

185
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,760
I wish you both

186
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,360
a speedy reunion with her.

187
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,840
It's your fourth therapy session.
How do you feel?

188
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,440
I'm okay. I sleep very well.

189
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,840
Ah.

190
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,160
Has Sol come to the hospital yet?

191
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,600
I asked the doctor
to go check on him at home.

192
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,000
He's safe now.

193
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,240
Sara, please take care of Sol too.

194
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,440
Don't worry, Sydney.

195
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,160
As someone responsible
for taking care of all the children,

196
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,000
I won't let anyone hurt you again.

197
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,680
Thank you, Sara.

198
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,320
And don't forget to thank yourself

199
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,920
for learning to care more about others.

200
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,480
Nun, are you okay?

201
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,720
I really want to thank you, Sara,

202
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,080
for looking after Sydney.

203
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,200
She used to be very self-centered,

204
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,120
but now, it seems like
she's starting to see others too.

205
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,280
A good environment helps.

206
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,680
All of us have played
a part in helping Sydney.

207
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,400
From now on,

208
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,760
if there's anything I can help with,
please just tell me.

209
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,640
In that case…

210
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,400
could you help me with something?

211
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,200
DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES
BANGKOK METROPOLITAN

212
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,360
TEMPORARY CHANGE OF GUARDIANSHIP

213
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,160
Why is there an order
changing Sydney's guardian to Nun?

214
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,800
Madam,

215
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,640
a voice recording of you
hurting Mr. Sol has leaked.

216
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,880
It's already in the news.

217
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,880
SHOCKING: AUDIO CLIP LEAKED
OF HIGH-SOCIETY WOMAN ABUSING HER GRANDSON

218
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,480
How could this happen?!

219
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,040
I recorded it myself.

220
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,200
No! No!

221
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,200
- Why did you do this?!
- Mrs. Naree!

222
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,200
Why, Sol?!

223
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,520
- Naree.
- How could you do this?!

224
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,160
How could you?!

225
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,640
Sol, why would you do this?!

226
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,480
How long have you been planning this?

227
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,560
Huh?!

228
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,280
I started thinking about it

229
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,000
when Sydney jumped off the balcony.

230
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,840
And when Sol got hurt again, I decided

231
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,600
I had to do something.

232
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,480
Do whatever it takes
to get a phone to Sol.

233
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,360
Ask him to take pictures
of his bruises and send them to me.

234
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,280
If a child is in danger,

235
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,360
we can use the Child Protection Act
to help them.

236
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,920
Just separating them
from the parents temporarily.

237
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,640
- Why would you do this?
- Mom.

238
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,880
- Let go of me.
- Please.

239
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,320
Please stop.

240
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,840
Go take care of your crippled father

241
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,480
instead of meddling
in my family affairs. Go!

242
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,440
You think I'll just let this happen?

243
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,920
You don't have to.

244
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,600
But if you go near the kids,

245
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,000
you'll be interfering
with a government official's work.

246
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,120
And at that point,
it won't be me talking to you.

247
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,240
It'll be the Ministry
of Social Development and the police.

248
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,440
The only thing you can do now

249
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,920
is join the rehabilitation program

250
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,600
that I've arranged.

251
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,600
As for when you'll get your children back,

252
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,520
that depends
on the evaluation team's assessment

253
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,000
and the psychologist's report…

254
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,120
which is me.

255
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,360
Sydney! Sol!

256
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,280
I know you love your children.

257
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,760
That's why I chose this route.

258
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,640
This is the result

259
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,680
of allowing violence to happen to them.

260
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,000
And consider this payback

261
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,680
for the slap you gave me that day.

262
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,920
This is all your fault.

263
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,760
You're useless.

264
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,040
Can't even take care of your own children.

265
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,400
But the leaked audio…

266
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,600
Isn't that you hurting your grandchild?!

267
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,160
Stop!

268
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,360
Mrs. Naree, please calm down.

269
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,200
Please.

270
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,240
Mrs. Naree.

271
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,520
Get out!

272
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,920
Leave me alone!

273
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,000
Get out! Leave me alone!

274
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,640
Mrs. Naree.

275
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,960
Mrs. Naree!

276
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,280
If you blame me
for not being able to raise my children,

277
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,320
then ask yourself

278
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,000
how you raised me

279
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,920
to make me turn out like this!

280
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,040
When you're done,

281
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,680
go clean this mess up

282
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,120
before I throw you out of this house.

283
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,360
Here it is.

284
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,680
Wow.

285
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,800
- No, not for you guys.
- What?

286
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,480
- Hey.
- Kids,

287
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,440
wanna try making it?

288
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,760
Come, come, come.

289
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,600
Here.

290
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,640
For you, Nun.

291
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,920
Thank you.

292
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,480
Enjoy.

293
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,960
You're rejecting my cooking again.

294
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,040
Why? You're making me
lose all confidence here.

295
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,400
I just had a meal.

296
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,960
But don't think like that.

297
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,600
If you weren't good at it,

298
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,080
the kids wouldn't love
your cooking so much.

299
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
I'll eat it myself.

300
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,120
It's really good.

301
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,480
So good.

302
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,240
I brought some food.

303
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,720
Seeing all this makes me regret…

304
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,160
being such a coward,

305
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,080
letting things spiral

306
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,440
the way they did.

307
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,160
This situation…

308
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,880
I almost didn't fix it in time.

309
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,200
But at least today,

310
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,440
you chose to stand on the side
of what's right, Nun.

311
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,760
And look at the result.

312
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,480
The kids are happy again,

313
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,080
just as they should be.

314
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,280
If you choose what's right,

315
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,400
you'll never hate yourself.

316
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,520
Doing the right thing

317
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
never betrays us.

318
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,480
SYDNEY

319
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,600
I made this myself,

320
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,400
as a gift for everyone
to mark a new beginning.

321
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,920
Try putting them together.

322
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,320
PANTER SYDNEY Sol

323
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,120
Remember.

324
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,160
No matter what happens,

325
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,440
if you have each other,
no one can hurt you.

326
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,120
Thank you, Sara.

327
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,160
From now on, I'll look after them myself.

328
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,960
Panter, take the kids
to wait in the car, will you?

329
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,480
Sure.

330
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,840
Let's go.

331
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,040
I have something
I'd like to ask of you, Sara.

332
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,520
Headless ghost…

333
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,520
Did you invite me here
just to shoot content,

334
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,040
really?

335
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,120
Okay, I admit it.

336
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,080
I heard you like to cook for yourself.

337
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,800
But you only know how to make
stir-fried cabbage with fish sauce.

338
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,720
You talked to Plang, didn't you?

339
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,840
I did.

340
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,680
I just wanted you
to eat more kinds of food.

341
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,640
And since you already
like cooking at home,

342
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,280
I thought I'd teach you some recipes,

343
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,880
so you'd have more options. Sound good?

344
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,680
<i>No need to chop too precisely.</i>

345
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,000
<i>Just roughly the same size is fine.</i>

346
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,560
<i>Lightly coat them in flour</i>
<i>and fry on medium heat.</i>

347
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,280
<i>As for the sauce,</i>

348
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,480
<i>the flavor shouldn't overpower the tofu.</i>

349
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,520
<i>Mix everything until well combined.</i>

350
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,880
For the miso soup,

351
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,240
add seaweed and tofu.

352
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,520
Then pour the dissolved miso in.

353
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,440
Just a little more.

354
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,720
Okay, stir it.

355
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,240
Hey.

356
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,320
Gently.

357
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,800
Stir it slowly,

358
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,560
like you're dissolving honey in hot tea.

359
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,480
Let it melt and seep into everything.

360
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,000
There, it's hot now.

361
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,080
Sara,

362
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,920
I like you.

363
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,320
I'm sorry

364
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,080
for saying that
without considering how you might feel.

365
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,960
But I felt like I needed to tell you.

366
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,080
Even though you know

367
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,920
I still have things I'm hiding from you,
why do you still…

368
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,400
I don't know what your intentions are.

369
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,840
But I don't really care either.

370
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,120
I think

371
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,280
if two people really want to be together,

372
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,960
they'll have to learn and grow together.

373
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,200
And what if

374
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,440
what I'm hiding
is something you can't accept?

375
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,680
How do you know I can't accept it?

376
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,360
You don't have to answer me now.

377
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,280
Just the fact
that you're listening to my feelings

378
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,680
already means a lot.

379
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,440
You said

380
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,400
when making miso soup,
you have to be patient, right?

381
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,120
Then, let's just keep…

382
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,600
stirring slowly.

383
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,960
<i>This new dish you made yourself,</i>
<i>try it, and let me know how it tastes.</i>

384
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,880
What's so important

385
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,720
you had to call everyone over like this?

386
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,680
As you all know,

387
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,200
we've just come through some tough times.

388
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,160
I think

389
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,200
from now on,

390
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,880
I want Sara to live with us.

391
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,600
To help take care of the kids
until the program is complete.

392
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,840
Nun.

393
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,320
So now, you don't even
need to consult me anymore?

394
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,600
I've thought this through.

395
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,680
I believe this will be good for the kids.

396
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,840
I want you to live in my house,

397
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,640
to help take care of the kids.

398
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,320
They've gone through enough trauma.

399
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,640
I want a professional to be close by
and help care for them.

400
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,880
Are you trying to one-up me?

401
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,680
I never wanted to one-up you, Mom.

402
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,440
I never could anyway.

403
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,320
Please think about it.
Look at it as helping the kids.

404
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,400
Besides, what I'm doing isn't wrong.

405
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,680
Nun.

406
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,240
Doing this is like slapping
your mother and Naree in the face.

407
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,360
Your sister's not going to stand for it

408
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,840
after everything you've done.

409
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,160
That's fine.

410
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,720
Just like Nun said.

411
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,520
It's for the kids.

412
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,640
I'll excuse myself now.

413
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,719
If you need anything, just let me know.
I'll have people prepare it.

414
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,600
As for making your own meals, go ahead.

415
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,560
About my mother, I truly apologize.

416
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,000
From the point of view of Mrs. Jira,
I understand.

417
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,920
But I just can't believe that
Mrs. Kulnaree would go along with this.

418
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:44,199
After being separated from her kids,

419
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,480
Naree must have learned
a thing or two by now.

420
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,600
Make yourself comfortable.

421
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,920
Install this camera in your bedroom too,

422
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,120
so you'll know who comes and goes.
We can't trust anyone.

423
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,440
Since you'll be living in their house,

424
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,040
we might be able to gather more clues.

425
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,800
You're not planning
to take action, are you?

426
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,480
I asked you a question. Answer me.

427
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,680
NUN

428
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,520
NUN

429
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,200
Yes, Nun?

430
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,320
I did what you asked.

431
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,440
<i>Don't cause any more chaos.</i>

432
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,960
<i>Got it?</i>

433
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,880
‪Thank you so much, Nun.

434
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,920
I'm really not doing anything else.

435
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,120
And please treat Sara nicely.

436
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,640
I've already taken care of everything.

437
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,840
How did you convince Nun
to ask that of Sara?

438
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,680
I just went to ask for another chance.

439
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,400
Told her I regretted what happened
and wanted to help my kids.

440
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,280
You know Nun's softhearted, right?

441
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,600
I only followed what you taught me.

442
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,200
Keep your friends close,

443
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,120
but your enemies closer.

444
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,680
It won't be long now.

445
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,080
She'll have to pay for what she did.

446
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,560
HAPPY BDAY

447
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,840
<i>This brand claims</i>
<i>it helps you feel more relaxed.</i>

448
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,680
<i>Just in case you get startled again,</i>
<i>you can light it and feel a bit better.</i>

449
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,760
<i>A little aromatherapy.</i>

450
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,880
<i>For today's therapy activity,</i>

451
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,440
<i>we're going on a diamond hunt.</i>

452
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,080
<i>Aunt Nun will hide diamonds</i>
<i>around the house,</i>

453
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,560
<i>and I, along with you,</i>
<i>Sydney, Sol, Panter,</i>

454
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,600
<i>will work together to find them.</i>

455
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,680
<i>Whoever collects the most wins.</i>

456
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,000
<i>Ready?</i>

457
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,720
One, two, three.

458
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,240
I found one!

459
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,760
Sara, come quick, or you'll fall behind.

460
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,920
Let me see.

461
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,440
Good job.

462
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,760
Keep it with you.

463
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,400
I'll go check that corner.

464
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,240
Well done, everyone.

465
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,480
Oh?

466
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,240
Sara, it's you?

467
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,440
What's going on?

468
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,000
Nothing.

469
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,280
I heard a strange noise,
thought a burglar broke in.

470
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,200
I almost shot someone by mistake.

471
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,280
What are you doing here, anyway?

472
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,480
We're just playing
a treasure-hunt game with the kids.

473
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,000
Sara,

474
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,880
are you alright?

475
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,080
I'm fine.

476
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,320
Just startled by the gunshot.

477
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,680
Afraid of loud noises?

478
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,720
I didn't know that about you.

479
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,960
Not everyone's used to the sound of a gun…

480
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,120
right?

481
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,440
Hey.

482
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,760
Sydney, Sol,

483
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,080
why don't you take
some Bua Loy to your mom?

484
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,000
I'll go with you.

485
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,560
Come here. I'll get it for you.

486
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,320
Sol, Sydney.

487
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,160
How are you?

488
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,960
We made some dessert today,
so we brought some for you.

489
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,200
Aw,

490
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,880
that's so sweet of you.

491
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,560
I miss you so much. When will you
come back to live with me again?

492
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,120
Aunt Nun said it's up to Sara.

493
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,160
I understand.

494
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,640
Come back to me soon, okay?

495
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,120
Enjoy your dessert.

496
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:26,880
Sure.

497
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,200
I miss you both so much.

498
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,560
Come in.

499
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,360
I was just heading out,

500
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,440
taking the kids shopping.
You want to come?

501
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:35,440
If I go, they'll feel like
they're being evaluated the whole time.

502
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,600
They won't get to relax.

503
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,120
I asked you to take them,

504
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,760
so you can spend time together
outside therapy.

505
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,080
Alright, call me if you need anything.

506
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,840
I thought you went out with Nun.

507
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,520
I had some business to take care of.

508
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,880
So, I asked her
to take the kids out on purpose.

509
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,840
On purpose?

510
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,800
What are you planning to do?

511
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:55,680
Was the Bua Loy good?

512
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:05,960
Ugh!

513
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,000
Sara!

514
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,960
Let us handle this.

515
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:12,960
You go take a rest.

516
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:14,560
Thank you.

517
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,600
Are you feeling more relaxed now?

518
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,840
But don't worry,

519
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,640
I'm not putting you to sleep.

520
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,320
I'm just helping you

521
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,560
open up a bit more.

522
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:37,880
After this,

523
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,640
your mind won't register

524
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,680
what really happened.

525
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,240
No one's home right now.

526
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,840
That makes it easier for us to talk.

527
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,160
Uh.

528
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,160
Let me go.

529
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,920
Let me go.

530
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:49,680
Have you… ever killed anyone?

531
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,280
How many people have you killed?

532
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,160
You once asked…

533
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,600
about the child named Kamon.

534
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,280
What happened to that child?

535
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,360
Kamon…

536
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:14,760
Answer me.

537
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,160
I…

538
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,560
I won't tell you.

539
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:51,240
<i>No!</i>

540
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,920
<i>Stop. I said stop!</i>

541
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,640
<i>You want it to get worse, don't you?!</i>

542
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,480
<i>Come here.</i>

543
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,640
<i>Mom!</i>

544
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,240
<i>It hurts!</i>

545
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,720
<i>I found something good.</i>

546
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,440
<i>Might be useful to you.</i>

547
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,400
<i>Ugh.</i>

548
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,360
<i>Speak to the camera, Naree.</i>
<i>Say you won't cause any more trouble.</i>

549
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,320
<i>I'll keep it to remind you later. Say it!</i>

550
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,200
<i>Say it!</i>

551
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,800
<i>I won't cause any more trouble!</i>

552
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,240
I won't cause any more trouble!

553
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,360
Mom, don't hurt her.

554
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,640
You too, Nun. You want to get hit again?

555
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,720
You want it harder this time?! Huh?!

556
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,360
Come here.

557
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,600
Mom…

558
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,560
Dad, help me! Dad, please help!

559
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,640
Your scumbag father
abandoned you long ago.

560
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,400
Why are you even screaming?!

561
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,240
Say it. Say it to the camera

562
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,880
that you won't cause any more trouble.

563
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,120
Say it.

564
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:17,040
I apologize.
I will not cause any more trouble.

565
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:19,440
I will not cause any more trouble anymore.

566
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,560
I'm sorry. Mom, I'm sorry.

567
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,600
Remember this in your skulls, both of you.

568
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,880
If you cause trouble again,

569
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,960
I won't keep you. You useless kids.

570
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,000
Mom, I'm sorry.

571
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,360
Mom, I'm sorry.

572
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,000
Mom, I'm sorry…

573
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,600
I'm sorry!

574
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,960
Mom, I'm sorry!

575
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:05,200
Mom…

576
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,640
Do you want your mom to stop hurting you?

577
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,520
Yes…

578
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,640
Then say it out loud.

579
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,480
Tell me what happened to Kamon.

580
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,200
They…

581
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:19,920
They messed things up.

582
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,040
Her father

583
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,240
saw something he shouldn't have seen.

584
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,080
What did he see?

585
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,320
She and her mother were also nosy,

586
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,840
so they had to die like street dogs.

587
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,480
Who else knows about this?

588
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,880
That old hag.

589
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,240
The old woman named Sampao.

590
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:02,080
And that Chayut. He knows.

591
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,280
He knows what?

592
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:08,480
Chayut used the clip to blackmail,

593
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,280
then bargained.

594
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,680
We had to give him work and money.

595
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,440
And Chayut's sick.

596
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,840
Serves him right.

597
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,400
Serves him right.

598
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,960
The clip?

599
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,640
What clip?

600
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,800
The clip of the child's father dying.

601
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:38,720
Where's the clip?

602
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,200
Gone.

603
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,600
All the evidence's been destroyed.

604
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,480
There's none left.

605
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,440
Does anyone else have evidence?

606
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:59,360
- No one.
- Not true.

607
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,040
No. No one.

608
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:02,840
Not true!

609
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,400
- No one!
- Not true!

610
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,040
No one…

611
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,600
Get out. No!

612
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,520
Tell me!

613
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,680
Where's the evidence?!

614
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,520
I know you have it!

615
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,000
Bring me the evidence!

616
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,160
Where's my father's evidence?!

617
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,440
Tell me now!

618
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,160
- Mom, I'm sorry.
- Tell me!

619
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,200
- Give me my father's evidence!
- Mom, I'm sorry!

620
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,200
- Tell me!
- I'm sorry.

621
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,360
- I said tell me!
- I'm sorry.

622
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,640
- Where's the evidence?!
- Please stop, Mom…

623
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,880
- Mom.
- Tell me!

624
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,200
Mom! Let me go…

625
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,040
Ahh!

626
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:47,920
Sara.

627
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:02,000
<i>We made some dessert today,</i>

628
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,560
<i>so we brought some for you.</i>

629
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,080
<i>Nun.</i>

630
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,800
Did you go anywhere yesterday?

631
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,560
I took the kids shopping.

632
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:15,720
What about you?

633
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,320
I stayed at Nun's house all day. Why?

634
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,640
Your face looks off.

635
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,120
Maybe I ate something weird yesterday.

636
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,480
I had strange dreams.

637
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,280
I couldn't sleep well.

638
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,840
Sometimes, dreams

639
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,120
come from a person's subconscious.

640
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,600
You actually dared to do this?

641
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,640
That's kind of fun,

642
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,800
Sara.

643
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:53,520
A person with Alzheimer's doesn't lose
memories, they're just buried deep inside.

644
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,120
We just need to help stimulate them,
so memories can resurface.

645
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,600
You know how he died, don't you?

646
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:05,920
Sara did something to me.

647
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,400
I want to know
what she's thinking right now

648
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,560
and what she's planning to do next.

649
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:13,400
TAX DOCUMENTS

650
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,160
And what if she reopens Naree's old case

651
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,560
and expose everything?

652
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:21,760
I'll show you

653
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,600
that we can control everything.

654
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:25,960
Hello, Plang?

655
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,040
Huh?

656
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,000
I'll go now.

657
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:28,760
