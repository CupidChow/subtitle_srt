What the hell?!

7
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,000
Naree.

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,560
Do you miss me?

9
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,480
Naree?

10
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,320
Why did you help me?

11
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,400
Because we're family.

12
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,040
Don't try to be nice.

13
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,200
What do you want?

14
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,240
Why did you save me?

15
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,120
I don't want anything.

16
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,640
I just want to listen to you
about everything.

17
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,280
You can relax with me.

18
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,240
Just tell me.

19
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,880
All the things you've kept
to yourself all this time…

20
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,880
It's time you told me.

21
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,680
Hey!

22
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,240
Who?!

23
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,920
- Who kicked me?!
- I did!

24
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,240
Hey.

25
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,520
Why are you lying here like this?

26
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,960
Why didn't you sleep in the house?

27
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,320
Is this a habit from prison?

28
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,160
Oh, Mother. Why?

29
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,760
You want to go on a field trip there?
I could help arrange it for you.

30
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,000
Patee.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,760
Why didn't you take me to sleep inside?

32
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,680
How was I supposed to know you were out
here drunk by the pool like a stray dog?

33
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,400
How could you not know?

34
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,920
You were talking to me right here
last night, right by the pool!

35
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,760
Don't pretend you don't remember.

36
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,920
I recognized your perfume.

37
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,320
What did you say to me?

38
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,760
Handle your husband, Naree.

39
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,560
He's drunk and delusional now.

40
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,200
Stop staring and go
get me a towel. I'm soaked.

41
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,640
Get back here.

42
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,640
Ugh!

43
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,600
What the hell?!

44
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,560
Naree.

45
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,560
Do you miss me?

46
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,520
Naree?

47
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,560
Why did you help me?

48
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,760
Because we're family.

49
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,520
Just tell me.

50
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,360
All the things you've kept
to yourself all this time…

51
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,760
It's time you told me.

52
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,200
I want to know…

53
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,640
where your phone is.

54
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,960
In the office.

55
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,720
<i>The book.</i>

56
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,280
<i>The fifth one.</i>

57
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,040
<i>Password is our kid's</i>

58
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,880
<i>birthday.</i>

60
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,920
PLANG

61
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,600
Hello, Plang. I got Patee's phone.

62
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,240
I'm on the way to Kram's house.

63
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,680
<i>I'll check things on my end.</i>

64
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,840
Everything seems normal.

65
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,920
Looks like no one suspects anything yet.

66
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,520
Be careful, Sara.

67
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,520
<i>I'm on my way to pick up Aunt Sampao.</i>

68
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,760
Good. Once we have
all the evidence and witnesses,

69
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,560
we can finish this.

70
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,720
Kram already left for the restaurant.

71
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,880
And Bua left for the market.

72
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,920
<i>Okay. Once you get</i>
<i>the evidence, let me know.</i>

73
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,360
<i>We'll meet at the police station.</i>

74
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Hello, Uncle.

75
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,760
I'm Kram's friend.

76
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,480
Oh, it's you. I remember.

77
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,760
Kram forgot something at home,

78
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,600
so he asked me to come pick it up.

79
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,640
May I come in to get it?

80
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,760
Sure, sure, come in.

81
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,600
Thank you.

82
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,720
What are you doing?

83
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,720
You…

84
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,160
Why…

85
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,560
I saw a car parked
in the distance when I was leaving.

86
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,960
I thought it looked like yours.
And it really was.

87
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,720
You know what this paper is?

88
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,440
I stuck it in the ceiling.

89
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,000
If anyone opened it, the paper would fall.

90
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,440
Were you here looking for evidence, Sara?

91
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,440
Or should I call you Kamon?

92
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,440
What are you talking about?

93
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,200
That day at the temple, where the urns
were smashed and I ran into you,

94
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,960
you thought I'd just arrived, right?

95
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,880
No.

96
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,600
I'd been there long enough
to hear that Uncle Chai and Aunt Napa

97
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,680
were your parents.

98
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,280
When I heard that and connected the dots,

99
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,160
everything made sense.

100
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,920
That you…

101
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,240
are this girl.

102
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,680
- Hey.
- Step aside.

103
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,720
How long have you known
my dad was involved?

104
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,360
That doesn't matter. I want the evidence.

105
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,160
And you're not going to tell me anything?

106
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,320
What would it change if I did?

107
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,720
At least let me help you.

108
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,280
You wouldn't need to sneak around
breaking into houses like this.

109
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,040
You got close to me, to the kids,

110
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,200
because you wanted revenge
for Naree, didn't you?

111
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,960
I'm seeking justice for my parents.

112
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,280
By using the kids?

113
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,160
You once told me that

114
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,960
if you ever shared what you were hiding,
I probably couldn't accept it.

115
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,600
But if you're doing all this
for your revenge,

116
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,360
to get justice,

117
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,480
I can accept it all.

118
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,880
But look at yourself now, Sara.

119
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,840
You're trying to get justice in a way
that's unjust to the kids.

120
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,600
And what your father did…

121
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,360
Was that justice for me, Kram?

122
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,360
He knew everything.

123
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,920
He could've helped me and my mom.

124
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,160
But he chose
to exploit it for his own gain.

125
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,560
Your dad is no less of a murderer
than those people.

126
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,120
And you…

127
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,320
You grew up on money
stained with the blood of my parents.

128
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,520
- I--
- And if I choose to be a little unjust

129
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,720
so I can keep fighting,

130
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,760
am I really that wrong, Kram?

131
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,560
I'm sorry

132
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,680
my dad never faced
the consequences of what he did.

133
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,760
But if you need someone
to take responsibility,

134
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,920
I'll be that person.

135
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,160
You don't need to.

136
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,800
But you do need to get me that evidence.

137
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,560
Do what your father refused to do.

138
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,280
How could it just disappear?
I really kept it here.

139
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,200
There's a video clip that my dad recorded.

140
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,920
The moment Naree
pushed your father off the building.

141
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,200
- Yes, Nin?
- <i>Sara.</i>

142
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,880
Someone from the temple
just called to tell me

143
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,840
that Kamon's urn was smashed.

144
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,280
They just noticed it.
Not sure when it happened.

145
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,360
<i>Your parents' urns</i>
<i>and Kamon's were destroyed.</i>

146
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,760
I don't think this is a coincidence, Sara.

147
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,320
I'll call you back, Nin.

148
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,800
Yes, Bank?

149
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,400
Sara, I want you to remain calm.

150
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,640
Aunt Sampao is dead.
Police at the scene said

151
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,480
it looked like a robbery.

152
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,400
<i>But I don't think so.</i>

153
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,280
Hey.

154
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,760
Hey.

155
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,240
Why?!

156
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,800
Why did it turn out like this?!

157
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,880
Why?!

158
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,280
Hey. Sara.

159
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,640
Sara.

160
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,960
Sara. Hey.

161
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,480
Where are you going?

162
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,240
I'm going to end this.

163
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,520
What are you going to do?

164
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,280
They think they're above the law.

165
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,760
I used to believe
I could drag them all down,

166
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,800
make them pay for what they did.

167
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,359
But now I'm not sure
that's all I want anymore.

168
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,599
Are you going to kill them?

169
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,600
If you do that,
how are you any different from them?

170
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,480
And why should I be different, Kram?

171
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,640
I tried not to be like them.

172
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,520
And look what's left of me now.

173
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,520
I have nothing left!

174
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,880
Hey, calm down.

175
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,040
I know you feel hopeless right now,

176
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,760
but I'll find my dad's DVD.

177
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,480
You'll have your evidence.

178
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,040
Then you can do
what you set out to do from the start.

179
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,320
It's no use anymore, Kram.

180
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,280
The witness is dead. Aunt Sampao is dead.

181
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,400
I'll finish this my way.

182
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,480
Hey, wait.

183
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,720
Sara.

184
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,640
Ugh!

185
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,360
Kram, what happened?

186
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,320
What are you doing?

187
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,760
Your hand's all red.

188
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,120
Does it hurt?

189
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,600
Oh.

190
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,240
Look at this.

191
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,080
Does it hurt?

192
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,640
You shouldn't have done that.

193
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,080
What?

194
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,000
There, there. It's okay, son. It's okay.

195
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,520
No matter what happens,

196
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,560
I'll protect you, son.

197
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,040
It's okay.

198
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,040
Looks like the victim
had a camera installed in the bedroom.

199
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,960
Bag it with the other evidence.

200
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,120
Got it, sir.

201
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,120
Sergeant, take photos.

202
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,040
Evidence bag.

203
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,120
Yes, Plang?

204
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,080
Okay, I'm coming right now.

205
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,440
Uh…

206
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,080
Mr. Kram,

207
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,680
didn't you go to the restaurant?

208
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,560
Or did you forget something?

209
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,720
Where have you been, Bua?

210
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,240
I just…

211
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,600
went to the market.

212
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,800
But you usually don't take
this long at the market.

213
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,000
I got distracted walking around.

214
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:51,000
And why are you checking
the security cameras?

215
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,200
Something's missing.

216
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,400
I checked the footage. No one came in.

217
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,320
Only us leaving.

218
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,840
Bua.

219
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,000
You took what I hid, didn't you?

220
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,160
No, I didn't take anything.
I swear I don't know anything.

221
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,640
How would I even know
where you hid the DVD?

222
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,960
I never said it was a DVD.

223
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,400
Kram, I'm sorry.

224
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,600
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to.

225
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,240
She…

226
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,080
She paid me

227
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,320
to report everything about Ms. Sara.

228
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,840
And when she found out about the DVD,

229
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,760
she told me to bring it to her.

230
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,880
But I swear I didn't know what was inside.

231
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,960
I didn't know anything, really. I'm sorry.

232
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,640
She threatened me.
She said she'd hurt my mother.

233
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,160
So, I had no choice.

234
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,160
Who paid you?

235
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,120
Miss…

236
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,400
Kulnaree.

237
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,560
Bank, are you close? I'm here already.

238
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,960
Kulnaree's car, the one you checked,
is parked here too. Hurry up.

239
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,880
Excuse me. My friend was admitted today.

240
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,440
Her name is Sara Chaisitthikam.

241
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,240
Could you tell me which ward she's in?

242
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,800
One moment, please.

243
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,400
- Ma'am!
- Where's Sara?

244
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,960
- Hey! Hey!
- Where's Sara?

245
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,560
What did you do to my friend?!

246
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,720
That's a way of saying thank you,
fitting for someone as low as you.

247
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
Where's Sara?!

248
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,480
Ms. Sara is in the ICU.

249
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,800
The doctor is treating her.

250
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,520
I'm the one who brought your friend here.

251
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,440
I don't believe you!

252
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,800
What did you do, you psycho?!

253
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,880
- Hey.
- What did you do to my friend?

254
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,800
Tell me! What did you do to her?

255
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,720
What did you do to my friend?!

256
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,960
- Let go! Let go of me!
- Please go outside.

257
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,560
I said let me go! Let me go!

258
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,880
- I'll kill her.
- You can't go in.

259
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,160
- I'll kill her. Get out of my way!
- Plang!

260
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,360
Plang. What happened?

261
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,680
This lady assaulted someone
and caused a scene.

262
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,400
If she doesn't stop,
I'll have to call the police.

263
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,520
I'll kill her.

264
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,800
- You psycho bitch, come out!
- Plang!

265
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,520
- If you're so brave, come out here.
- Plang, stop.

266
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,440
- Come on!
- Calm down, Plang!

267
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,120
If they don't let us in,
we can't go see Sara.

268
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,000
Damn it!

269
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,800
How could Sara
just collapse out of nowhere?

270
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,200
That psycho must've done
something in her room.

271
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,040
How could I miss it?

272
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,720
I only saw Sydney and the maid walk in.

273
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,920
I thought I checked everything.

274
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,960
Why did Sydney go in there?

275
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,480
She was bringing flowers.

276
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,400
Wait.

277
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,760
Sara collapsed
right next to the flower vase.

278
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,400
- Hello?
- Hello, Plang?

279
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,880
I can't reach Sara.
Do you know where she is?

280
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,760
Kram, Sara's at the hospital right now.

281
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,920
<i>Huh? What happened?</i>

282
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
- What happened to her?
- <i>We don't know yet.</i>

283
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,280
All we know is that
Kulnaree brought her in.

284
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,400
What?

285
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,720
Mr. Kram, I need your help with something.

286
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,400
Kram?

287
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,400
Nun.

288
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,920
Do you know which room is Sara's?

289
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,400
What's going on, Kram?

290
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,080
Sara's in the hospital.

291
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,080
Huh?

292
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,760
I need something from her room
for the doctors to check.

293
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,560
Kram. Sara had a seizure in her room?

294
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,960
How could that be possible?

295
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,200
We don't know the cause yet.
The doctor's still checking.

296
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,200
But I think it might be

297
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,760
from this flower vase.

298
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,040
Who brought this vase

299
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,840
into Sara's room?

300
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,440
Naree asked Sydney to bring it to her.

301
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,000
She wanted to apologize.

302
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,720
Did Naree put something in the vase?

303
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,440
Kram.

304
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,240
Are you trying to say that Naree
poisoned Sara through the flowers?

305
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,760
That's a serious accusation.

306
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,520
And if it was poisonous,
would she really let Sydney carry it?

307
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,000
We don't know for sure yet.

308
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,280
But we have to have it tested

309
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,760
to see if it really came from the vase.

310
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,240
Dad…

311
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,480
Mom…

312
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,760
Are you tired, dear?

313
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,360
If you can't go on, it's okay to stop.

314
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,200
I can't stop.

315
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,920
I can't give up.

316
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,000
Otherwise,

317
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,640
you'll both

318
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,960
have died without ever getting justice.

319
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,760
We don't want justice

320
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,440
if it costs you your life.

321
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,920
The only thing your dad and I want

322
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,240
is for you to live on

323
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,600
and be happy.

324
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,120
Keep living, my dear.

325
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,960
Keep living.

326
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,880
Are you awake now,

327
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,040
good girl?

328
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,400
What are you doing?

329
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,960
Did you like the flowers?

330
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,280
I changed the water in the vase a little,

331
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,560
for something more volatile,

332
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,600
like cyanide.

333
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,840
I wanted to see how long

334
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,360
the color of the flowers would stay fresh.

335
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,480
I don't want you to touch the pollen.

336
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,520
I'm afraid you'd be allergic.

337
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,720
Then why did you save me?
What do you want?

338
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,880
I want you to live long enough
to know the truth,

339
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,680
Kamon.

340
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,600
This is the DNA test result of you…

341
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,880
TEST RESULT

342
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,600
…and that laborer couple

343
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,800
that I killed 19 years ago.

344
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,000
At first,

345
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,960
I thought

346
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,760
maybe you were just a relative of theirs.

347
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,920
But when the results came out,

348
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,960
it turned out

349
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,000
you were their daughter.

350
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,560
That's when I realized

351
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,320
the person

352
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,440
behind all of this is you.

353
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,720
Are you trying to reopen the case?

354
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,600
It must be exhausting.

355
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,440
You had to run around for evidence,

356
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,880
drug me to get clues,

357
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,440
and search for witnesses.

358
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,480
In the end,

359
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,800
you're left with nothing.

360
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,520
You… You really killed Aunt Sampao.

361
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,760
You're the one who killed her.

362
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,640
If you hadn't sent your cop friend

363
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,760
to drag Aunt Sampao back into this,

364
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,360
she'd still be alive and at peace.

365
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,880
You're the killer.

366
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,760
But come to think of it,

367
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,240
I really did kill some people.

368
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,480
Your parents, obviously.

369
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,480
You're sick.

370
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,640
Thank you

371
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,840
for confirming what I already knew.

372
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,040
And I should praise you, too.

373
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,760
You're impressive,

374
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,440
living under
a dead person's name all this time.

375
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,040
Hypnosis really is amazing, isn't it?

376
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,640
It can bring back memories
we thought were gone…

377
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,560
even after being drugged.

378
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,440
The doctor I went to

379
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,280
told me the reason
I couldn't remember certain things

380
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,800
was because I'd been sedated with
some kind of central nervous depressant.

381
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,000
It made me vulnerable

382
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,320
to have been manipulated.

383
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,600
And you already knew that,
because this syringe

384
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,800
is the one you prepared.

385
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,280
Ugh!

386
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,320
How fun.

387
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,920
Go on then.

388
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,840
Call for help.

389
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,440
Let them all see what you're trying to do.

390
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,800
Because this syringe…

391
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,000
is yours.

392
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,600
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

393
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,000
The IV line came loose.

394
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,080
Is something wrong?

395
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,680
Just a loose IV line.

396
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,560
Please sit down, miss.

397
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,440
I've got the evidence for testing.

398
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,400
How's Sara doing?

399
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,680
No updates yet.
Kulnaree's inside with her.

400
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,280
What? Why would she--

401
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,400
Kulnaree brought Sara here

402
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,040
and signed as her relative.

403
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,600
Until Sara wakes up,
we can't switch who's staying with her.

404
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,600
I'll send this to the lab and have it
compared with Sara's blood sample.

405
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,400
Then we'll know
what she was poisoned with.

406
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,480
Alright.

407
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,640
Ms. Sara is awake.

408
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,320
Ma'am.

409
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,680
If you do this, she'll be on alert.

410
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,280
She might escape.

411
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,680
We've come this far.
She'll come back anyway.

412
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,400
We should prepare a little welcome gift.

413
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,040
And will you tell the others in the house?

414
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,080
Not my mom. It'll just cause chaos.

415
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,760
As for the rest, I'll think about it.

416
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,240
Maybe I'll tell them
after I've killed her.

417
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,120
And the test results?

418
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,440
Do you know why
I took her to this hospital?

419
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,080
Don's client is the hospital director.

420
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,520
They won't find anything.

421
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,160
Understood.

422
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,280
I think you should stop.

423
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,520
If you go back, you might not be as lucky.

424
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,320
I agree.

425
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,560
You should back off now.

426
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,120
Or should we just leak
the evidence from Patee's phone?

427
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,400
It's the only thing we've got left.

428
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,520
That clip only works

429
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,480
with Aunt Sampao's testimony.

430
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,200
And the footage of the murder
from Uncle Chayut

431
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,840
won't even be able to legally
pin them down, honestly.

432
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,200
Any last words?

433
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,880
We all know we can't stop you anyway.

434
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,480
If your plan fails and you die,

435
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,720
the only thing we can do

436
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,600
is follow your last wish

437
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,400
and send a wreath.

438
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,440
Yanin.

439
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,760
Now that they know,

440
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,200
our only choice now is to keep going.

441
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,120
And to answer your question,

442
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,040
I've got nothing to leave behind.

443
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,400
Because I only have one plan.

444
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,800
To win.

445
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,200
I still have one more card
that they don't know about yet.

446
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,040
Won't you stop, Naree?

447
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,320
I'm the one who brought her
to the hospital, in case you forgot.

448
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,960
I should've never trusted you.

449
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,560
I should've known
someone like you would never repent

450
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,960
and agree with me
to let Sara stay in the house.

451
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,760
You said the kids were getting better.

452
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,920
So, why should you care
what I plan to do with her?

453
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,400
Naree, if you can't even thank her, fine.

454
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,160
But if you want your kids back,

455
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,400
at least try to be better.

456
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,800
So Sara will evaluate
that you're ready to raise them again.

457
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,480
That orphan has no right to decide
whether I'm fit to raise my kids or not!

458
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,080
You're

459
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,840
so damn stupid.

460
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,840
Naree.

461
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,240
Nineteen years ago,

462
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,320
I knew the kid Kamon survived.

463
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,760
I was tracking her down.

464
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,960
But before I got anywhere,

465
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,400
I heard she'd died.

466
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,800
So what?

467
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,240
You've never been a good liar.

468
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,360
You knew she wasn't dead.

469
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,960
You were the one who tipped them off
that I was looking for her.

470
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,960
You're talking nonsense, Naree.

471
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,520
You lied to me. You lied to everyone.

472
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,120
You betrayed our family.

473
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,480
You're drunk. Go to bed.

474
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,760
Stop lying already.

475
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,840
I found all the evidence.

476
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,600
That's not true. How would you know that?

477
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,640
I never left evidence behind.

478
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,080
I didn't find any evidence.

479
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,920
I just suspected you and tested you.

480
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,960
And you really said it yourself.

481
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,080
That's why I said

482
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,200
you're so damn stupid. Stupid as a cow!

483
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,560
You found that girl, didn't you?
That's how you know everything?

484
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,760
Back then, you must've felt proud

485
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,800
for saving one child's life.

486
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,640
You had no idea

487
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,640
what that child would become.

488
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,040
Because of your compassion,

489
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,680
the life you saved

490
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,520
came back to destroy our family!

491
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,840
What do you mean?!

492
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,640
That girl is already inside our house!

493
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,280
Sara?

494
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,160
Is it Sara? That's not possible.

495
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,400
Sara

496
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,480
is Kamon.

497
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,320
She's been living
under a dead person's name.

498
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,240
Everything that's happened to us

499
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,000
is all her doing.

500
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,000
She found witnesses, gathered evidence,

501
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,360
blackmailed Patee, and even used you,

502
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,320
just to reopen the case
about what we did to her parents!

503
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,400
Kram.

504
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,200
I'm sorry for what I said to you.

505
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,080
What you said was right.

506
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,760
I should apologize too.

507
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,200
Even if my father thought
he was protecting our family,

508
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,560
it shouldn't have come
at the cost of yours.

509
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,840
You didn't do anything wrong, Kram.

510
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,640
Neither did you.

511
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,640
I just…

512
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:23,600
worry about you.

513
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,840
I wish there was another way.

514
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,840
But honestly, I still don't know

515
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,920
if there even is one.

516
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,800
At that time, I was angry.

517
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,160
I was disappointed.

518
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,760
It felt like everything I'd done
meant nothing.

519
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,120
So, I thought…

520
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,680
Forget it.

521
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,640
No need to say it now.

522
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,960
Get some rest.

523
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,120
I'll stay with you tonight.

524
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:38,000
- <i>What are you going to do to Sara?</i>
- <i>Why do you care?</i>

525
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,080
<i>Just keep your eyes shut and stay quiet.</i>

526
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,280
<i>Or do you want to help her</i>
<i>reopen the case,</i>

527
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,240
<i>so we can all rot in prison together?</i>

528
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,720
<i>That way, the family you're trying</i>
<i>to protect can crumble for good.</i>

529
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,160
What should I do?

530
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,440
It's morning already?

531
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,240
Good morning.

532
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,800
Morning.

533
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,680
Did you sleep well?

534
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,480
Better than any night before.

535
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,360
Sara.

536
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,600
How are you feeling?

537
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,520
Better now.

538
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,400
So, was there anything wrong
with the flowers in Sara's room, Kram?

539
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,040
The doctor said there was nothing unusual.

540
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,600
Sara must've had
an allergic reaction to the pollen.

541
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,200
I'm sorry, Sara.

542
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,120
I guess I chose
the wrong way to show concern.

543
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,240
It's okay.

544
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,880
We all make mistakes.

545
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:33,880
But once we realize them,

546
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,080
we usually don't make the same ones again.

547
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,480
Can I come in for a bit?

548
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,280
Please.

549
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,480
I planned to wear black

550
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,680
to welcome you back,

551
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,080
but what a pity, you didn't die.

552
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,680
But it's okay. Here.

553
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,160
A little welcome-back gift.

554
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,920
Don't worry.

555
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,840
I don't reuse old tricks.

556
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,400
Go ahead. Open the card.

557
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:34,120
DEEPEST CONDOLENCES

558
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,320
FROM THE LERTHANAKUL FAMILY

559
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,160
WITH LOVE AND REMEMBRANCE
THE TIDRAKSA FAMILY

560
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,960
Surprise!

561
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,560
Do you like it?

562
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,280
For your funeral portrait,

563
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,960
let's use this one.

564
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,680
You look bright and fresh in it.

565
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,720
And sorry

566
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,760
that I took your parents' ashes.

567
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:09,920
I mixed them with cement
and molded them into this,

568
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,800
so it'll remind you

569
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,360
that you'll soon be joining them.

570
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,000
Mommy dog, Daddy dog,

571
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:22,440
and the puppy

572
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,240
are soon to be reunited.

573
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,280
How touching.

574
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,400
I could cry.

575
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,720
WITH LOVE AND REMEMBRANCE
THE TIDRAKSA FAMILY

576
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,720
Okay.

577
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,080
You can come up now.

578
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,560
Thank you

579
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,280
for letting me speak with your father.

580
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,680
I wanted my father to make up
for what he did to yours somehow.

581
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,160
- Kram!
- Hey. What?

582
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,480
Sorry, but I only looked away
for a second and your dad's gone.

583
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,880
Huh?

584
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,360
Uncle!

585
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,080
Uncle! Uncle Chayut!

586
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,560
- Uncle.
- Dad.

587
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,800
Uncle, can you hear me?

588
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,720
Dad.

589
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,160
Dad.

590
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,120
Dad.

591
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:34,600
Dad.

592
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,760
Dad.

593
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,600
Uncle.

594
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,400
Let me relax for today.

595
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,240
Sure.

596
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,600
What are you doing up here? Get down.

597
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,200
Hey.

598
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,320
Is it from the money my mom gave you?

599
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,440
No, I made money myself.

600
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,520
What are you doing?

601
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:25,200
I told you I'd stay out of your business.

602
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,280
- Really?
- Don't!

603
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,960
Just staying out of it isn't enough.

604
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,280
Dad, are you okay?

605
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,040
Dad.

606
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,680
Naree killed Chai.

607
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,800
Dad, you remember what happened now?

608
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,720
Dad?

609
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,120
Why did she kill Kamon's father?

610
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,240
<i>Thank you for helping</i>
<i>with the hospital test results.</i>

611
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,880
My pleasure.

612
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,120
Chai.

613
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,080
Hey!

614
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,200
What?

615
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,120
Just leave. I'll handle this.

616
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:55,760
Hey.

617
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,360
Hey! Don't run!

618
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,200
Ugh.

619
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,440
Motorbike!

620
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,480
Stop! Stop!

621
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,600
Hurry up.

622
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:07,720
Go down the alley.

623
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,520
Chai saw

624
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,760
Ms. Naree

625
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,680
and Mr. Chawadon having an affair.

626
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:32,960
They were having an affair!

627
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,640
Please stay out of this.
What I've been doing

628
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,240
has been the exact opposite of you
for a long time.

629
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,600
This time, I won't miss.

630
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,520
You're dead for sure.

631
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,880
I also won't stop

632
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,520
until I see you

633
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,800
and your whole family utterly destroyed
with my own eyes.

634
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,560
So, tomorrow, go to room 1023.

635
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:09,560
I'll prove to you

636
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,240
that your husband
hasn't been faithful to you.

637
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:23,640
