KAMON TIDRAKSA

6
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,760
I didn't see anything.

7
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,600
I really didn't see anything.

8
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,360
Hey, where are you going?

9
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,120
It's dangerous. Don't go up there.

10
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,600
What are you doing up here? Go down.

11
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,200
KAMON TIDRAKSA

12
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,200
What's this?

13
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,360
Is it from the money my mom gave you?

14
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,040
I made money myself.

15
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,800
What are you doing?

16
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,640
Are you crazy? Give it back.

17
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,920
I told you I'd stay out of your business.

18
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,880
Really?

19
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,480
Don't!

20
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,720
Just staying out of it isn't enough.

21
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,800
Sydney, my dear.

22
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,840
Sydney.

23
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,520
- Sydney.
- Sydney, stay with me.

24
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,040
Handle all the parents.

25
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,440
Don't let the news spread.

26
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,960
Hey.

27
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,240
Do you hear me? Are you okay?

28
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,560
Are you okay?

29
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,400
Feeling dizzy again?

30
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,800
I'll get you an inhaler.

31
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,800
I'm okay.

32
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,160
You've been dizzy a lot lately.

33
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,680
Maybe you should see a doctor.

34
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,360
It could be a health issue.

35
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,320
I'm not wishing anything bad on you.
I'm just worried.

36
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,880
I wasn't dizzy.

37
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,120
Okay.

38
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,520
Did you get hurt?

39
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,160
Worry about yourself first.

40
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,240
If you don't treat the wound soon,
it'll leave a scar.

41
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,320
I don't really mind scars.

42
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,520
It's actually a good thing.
They help you remember the past.

43
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,920
Look at my hands.

44
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,640
If you look closely,
you'll see my hands look different.

45
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,560
See this stitch mark? Actually,

46
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,240
this hand isn't mine.

47
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,560
Just kidding!

48
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,600
Are you really okay?

49
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,840
Usually,

50
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,400
scars remind us
of the pain we went through.

51
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,360
I don't see anything good about that.

52
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,520
That's just how life is.

53
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,720
There's pain, there's joy,

54
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,480
all mixed together.
It's more fun that way.

55
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,120
But what if my life is nothing but pain?

56
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,080
Then there must be at least one day,
or even just one moment,

57
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,760
when you tasted something delicious,

58
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,080
when you had a good night's sleep,

59
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,400
or when you successfully
helped a child recover.

60
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,320
I think in that moment, you were happy.

61
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,920
Hello?

62
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,120
Okay, I'll go now.

63
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,160
Don't forget to treat your wound.

64
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,240
One more step done.

65
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,320
As for what you asked,
I'll take care of it.

66
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,360
Thank you so much
for agreeing to go along with the plan.

67
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
No, I'm the one who should thank you.

68
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,480
<i>My daughter has been hurt, both physically</i>
<i>and emotionally, for so long.</i>

69
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,120
<i>And the school</i>
<i>never did anything about it.</i>

70
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,120
You didn't help me!

71
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,800
No one helped me!

72
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,160
<i>This might be the only way to help her.</i>

73
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,840
Mrs. Narumon?

74
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,640
Apologize to Judee now.

75
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,280
And you, Judee?

76
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,640
Are you still shaken up or scared?

77
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,440
No, because you're here with me.

78
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,800
I don't know

79
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,680
what your history is with that family,

80
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,160
but I'm rooting for you.

81
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,960
People who use money and power

82
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,400
to hurt others
deserve to face someone like you.

83
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,480
Thank you again.

84
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,800
Let's go, sweetie.

85
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,720
Good luck.

86
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,760
Thank you.

87
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,640
Let's go.

88
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,920
Bye-bye.

89
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,000
Thank you.

90
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,160
THESE DAYS, EVERYONE KNOWS SARA
THE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG PSYCHOLOGIST

91
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,560
I called and talked to them.

92
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,120
All parents said they'll wait to settle
things at the emergency meeting tomorrow.

93
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,840
I'll handle it myself tomorrow.

94
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,600
Great. I'll leave it to you.

95
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,320
What? You said you'll handle it yourself.

96
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,240
Well, what are you all looking at?

97
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,440
Of course, I'll go too.

98
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,880
Half of Sydney came from me anyway.

99
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,160
Right, sweetie?

100
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,280
How did all these headaches
happen one after another?

101
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,240
It's not your niece's fault.

102
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,000
If that parent hadn't come
and messed with her head,

103
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,840
she wouldn't be like that.

104
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,920
No matter how much someone tries to mess
with us, we still have to keep our image.

105
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,760
So, you're just going to let people
treat your niece however they want?

106
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,520
All she did was defend herself.

107
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,240
If my niece hadn't done something

108
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,240
to give them a reason to attack her,
none of this would've happened.

109
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,280
Mom.

110
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,560
Naree. What Mom said is right.

111
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,880
If that woman
hadn't stopped Sydney in time,

112
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,680
who knows what could've happened.

113
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,160
Honestly, we should be sending her
a gift basket to thank her.

114
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,160
I'm sorry…

115
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,600
my daughter doesn't have

116
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,000
the talent for putting on
a show like your son does.

117
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,000
Naree.

118
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,400
Sydney, we're going home.

119
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,440
My daughter's still shaken up
from what happened yesterday.

120
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,720
Are we really going to let
something like this slide?

121
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,600
I won't let my daughter

122
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,720
stay in the same school as a monster
with that kind of violent behavior!

123
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,200
Hey!

124
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,720
Watch what you say about my daughter.

125
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,320
It's all because
someone disrupted the event.

126
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,640
The school should be blamed

127
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,480
for letting it happen in the first place.

128
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,880
My kid has told me multiple times
that Sydney bullies other kids.

129
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,920
A lot of people have seen it too.

130
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,520
- Yes.
- Exactly.

131
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,280
See?

132
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,200
Or is it because you think their family
donates so much to the school?

133
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,240
We donate just as much, you know.

134
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,720
- Yes.
- Me too.

135
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,200
So, our kids

136
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,320
are supposed to risk getting hurt
by some psycho kid?

137
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,440
- Yes.
- Yes.

138
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,440
- Yes.
- Yes.

139
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,160
- Psycho kid…
- Psycho kid…

140
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,240
We want Sydney
to leave this school, right?!

141
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,680
- Yes.
- Yes.

142
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,160
- Leave the school…
- Leave the school…

143
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,720
Everyone, please calm down.

144
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,760
No one's calm anymore.

145
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,000
Our school needs to be safe
from dangerous kids like her.

146
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,120
That kid's a psycho!

147
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,840
- Psycho…
- Psycho…

148
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,040
- Psycho…
- Watch your mouth, four-eyes!

149
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,600
- You wanna fight?
- What are you gonna do, huh?

150
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,680
Security! Security!

151
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,240
- Security!
- Come on!

152
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,400
- The hell is going on?
- What?

153
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,520
Calling my girl psycho?

154
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,840
- Why is he doing this?
- Look at him.

155
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,760
Your kid is a psycho!

156
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,640
- Your kid is a psycho!
- Stop.

157
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,040
- Your kid is a psycho! Psycho!
- Come on, four-eyes!

158
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,680
- Bring it on!
- Come on!

159
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,600
Come on!

160
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,920
Stop right now!

161
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,160
Parents, do you see what just happened?

162
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,400
Some adults here
couldn't even control their emotions.

163
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,080
And yet we expect a ten-year-old

164
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,880
to manage hers in that kind of situation?

165
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,480
I have a better idea
than expelling Sydney.

166
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,520
<i>Imagine this.</i>

167
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,960
<i>If all the parents reject Sydney,</i>

168
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,640
<i>she'll never have a chance to improve.</i>

169
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,960
<i>And she could become</i>

170
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,000
<i>an even bigger problem in the future.</i>

171
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,440
<i>Her fate is in your hands.</i>
<i>Will you deny this child</i>

172
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,960
<i>the chance to become someone better,</i>
<i>to grow into an adult</i>

173
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,960
<i>who can live peacefully</i>
<i>alongside your children?</i>

174
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,000
Sydney!

175
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,960
<i>The best solution</i>

176
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,480
<i>is to find a way for everyone to coexist</i>

177
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,360
<i>without pushing anyone out</i>
<i>without a chance.</i>

178
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,520
<i>Sometimes,</i>

179
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,200
<i>we have to admit that a child</i>
<i>doesn't need punishment,</i>

180
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,720
<i>they need an opportunity.</i>

181
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,000
It is now confirmed

182
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,160
that Sydney will be suspended
for three months.

183
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,120
During this period,
she will undergo therapy

184
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,520
with Ms. Sara,

185
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,320
a child psychologist,
at least twice a week.

186
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,960
She must also be evaluated in detail
by Ms. Sara on her behavior.

187
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,560
If, after three months,
Sydney shows improvement,

188
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,480
she will be allowed to return to school.

189
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,640
This is out of respect for Ms. Sara,

190
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,119
who's always taken
good care of our children.

191
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,560
That's why we agreed to this.

192
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,720
You're screwed.

193
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,440
We have to thank you, Ms. Sara,

194
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,319
for handling the parents.

195
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,120
Otherwise, this could've been a disaster.

196
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,040
There's always a solution
to every problem.

197
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,320
Payment for taking care of Sydney.

198
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,600
ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND BAHT

199
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,680
I'll pay in advance.

200
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,360
I don't accept payment in advance,

201
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,240
not until I see results.

202
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,680
You don't take advance payment,

203
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,760
or do you want more than that?

204
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,960
Money may be important to many people.

205
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,480
But to get to where I am today,

206
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,600
I've prepared myself enough

207
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,560
that money has become a small matter.

208
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,080
Then, can I ask you
to take care of my wife too?

209
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,800
Looks like her condition's pretty serious.

210
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,360
That glare's so intense. I'm scared.

211
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,960
Still, thank you so much for helping,

212
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,080
even though I didn't ask.

213
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,080
You're welcome.

214
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,920
Because I can't stand

215
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,960
seeing kids grow up

216
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,200
to become awful adults.

217
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,520
Sydney has been suspended from school.

218
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,920
From now on, my daughter, Melbourne,

219
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,440
won't have any rivals left.

220
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,440
My Melbourne, you're the best.

221
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,560
- Hey!
- No!

222
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,880
Hey, what the hell?!

223
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,360
What are you doing?!

224
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,800
It's alright, dear.

225
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,760
<i>Right now, officials have entered</i>
<i>and raided an illegal cockfighting ring,</i>

226
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,000
<i>which was hidden inside a longan orchard</i>

227
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,560
<i>about 300 meters</i>
<i>behind the village chief's house.</i>

228
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,000
<i>The rock-throwing robbery gang</i>
<i>has returned.</i>

229
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,960
<i>This time, the incident</i>
<i>happened on the city outskirts.</i>

230
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,560
<i>The victims were identified</i>
<i>as the family of Mr. Panu,</i>

231
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,560
<i>a major export businessman.</i>

232
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,360
<i>Mr. Panu is in critical condition,</i>

233
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,920
<i>currently in the ICU.</i>

234
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,320
<i>His wife and daughter</i>
<i>are still under observation.</i>

235
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,560
Good news came so early in the morning.

236
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,800
That girl's in my class.

237
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,200
Karma's real, huh?

238
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,640
Looks like she won't be going
to school anytime soon.

239
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,800
Just like me.

240
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,600
No, sweetie.

241
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,840
You're not like her.

242
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,200
I'll make sure you get back
to school as soon as possible.

243
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,440
Hang in there a little longer,
my precious girl.

244
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,360
I checked.

245
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,400
There's no direct connection
to the Lerthanakul family.

246
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,480
There's just some education history
listed for past events.

247
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,880
And…

248
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,320
he graduated from culinary school.

249
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,440
No information
about his family background.

250
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,880
So, why are you so interested
in this guy, Kram?

251
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,560
I saw him hanging around that family,

252
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,600
and I get the feeling there's

253
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,680
something off about him.

254
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,440
He said his father used to work
for the Lerthanakul family

255
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,040
but is sick now and doesn't work anymore.

256
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,680
Let me see.

257
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,280
He seems alright.

258
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,360
But more importantly,

259
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,520
he's close with the kids from that family,
and with Waranun too.

260
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,760
So, I'm thinking maybe
he could be useful to us.

261
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,240
But hasn't he met you
several times already?

262
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,520
Honestly, you might as well try
getting close to him. Could be useful.

263
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
- Dear!
- Kamon!

264
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,080
- Dear, are you alright?!
- Kamon!

265
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,000
What kind of driving is that?!

266
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,960
My girlfriend was driving properly.
Your dumb kid walked right into traffic!

267
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,200
She walked like a dumbass!

268
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,240
- You…
- The hell are you doing?

269
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,000
What's going on?

270
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,160
Take it, Chai.

271
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,120
For this amount of money,

272
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,680
how many sites do you have
to pour concrete for to earn it?

273
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,560
I won't accept your money.

274
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,720
I just want an apology from your daughter.

275
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,480
These laborers really are dumb.

276
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,160
Mom, if he doesn't want
the money, I'll take it.

277
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,640
Let's consider this
an apology from me and my daughter.

278
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,560
Take it.

279
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,160
Money doesn't have a mouth.
How's it supposed to apologize?

280
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,120
Your daughter's right there. Say it.

281
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,680
If you want an apology,

282
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,040
then be born on the same level as us
in your next life.

283
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,800
- So poor!
- Hey.

284
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,720
- Chai. Napa.
- Let go!

285
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,520
- Let go of me!
- Chai, please.

286
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,400
- Look at them.
- Pa…

287
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,400
<i>Why do we have to bow down?</i>

288
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,760
They're human, we're human too, right?

289
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,800
Yeah, but they have money, Chai. We don't.

290
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,680
What are you gonna fight them with?

291
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,080
I've never asked you two for anything.

292
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,040
But can I have it this time, please?
I don't want any problems.

293
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,760
But Dad and Mom really didn't do
anything wrong, Uncle Chayut.

294
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,720
I know, Kamon.

295
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,520
But sometimes in life,

296
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,520
we do what it takes to survive.

297
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,760
If something helps us survive,
we have to use it.

298
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,640
I hope you understand, Chai.

299
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,920
Are we supposed to bow to the rich
for the rest of our lives, Mom?

300
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,560
If we're not in the wrong,
then never back down.

301
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,520
At the very least,
make those who've done wrong realize it.

302
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,480
So they won't do it to anyone else again.
Do you understand, Kamon?

303
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,400
Yes, Mom.

304
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,960
- Chai.
- Huh?

305
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,800
Once you get paid, buy Kamon
a new school uniform. Look. It's so old.

306
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,920
Alright. Next week, when I get paid,
I'll buy you a new school uniform, okay?

307
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,360
Really, Dad?

308
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,880
- Thank you, Dad.
- Sure thing.

309
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,160
Dad!

310
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,120
Kamon…

311
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,920
KAMON TIDRAKSA

312
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,960
This way, please.

313
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,880
Hello.

314
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,720
If you're ready,

315
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,120
shall we begin?

316
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,520
Naree and I will be here too.
That's okay, right?

317
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,120
If Sydney agrees, then it's fine with me.

318
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,800
- My daughter--
- I will speak for myself.

319
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,760
Sydney, but I think--

320
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,520
If you stay, it'll take forever.

321
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,680
It's annoying.

322
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,600
Next time, try teaching your daughter

323
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,680
not to embarrass me in front of others.

324
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,200
Are you still able to feel embarrassed?

325
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,920
Can you stop acting like me?

326
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,440
Can you stop acting like me?

327
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,960
Can you smell that?

328
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,560
Some say anger

329
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,240
makes your body stiff.

330
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,400
Do you feel that, Sydney?

331
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,000
Your limbs are slowing down…

332
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,880
or maybe not moving at all.

333
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,320
Strange, isn't it?

334
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,600
You've always been able to move just fine…

335
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,560
but now you can't.

336
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,000
Or maybe those limbs aren't yours anymore.

337
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,840
How long
have you been sitting there, Sydney?

338
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,120
What just happened?

339
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,600
Why couldn't I move a moment ago?

340
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,800
When did I end up sitting here?

341
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,600
What did you do to me?

342
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,240
I didn't do anything.

343
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,120
Your mind and body did.

344
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,040
Because you were angry. You lost control.

345
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,320
So, I could easily influence you.

346
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,360
I made you believe

347
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,600
you couldn't move,
even though you actually could.

348
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,280
You weren't unconscious.

349
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,000
Your brain just shut down temporarily,
that's all.

350
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,880
Do you do this to everyone?

351
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,680
I can't do this to everyone.

352
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,240
Only to those who let me in.

353
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,520
If you're ready, shall we start?

354
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,720
Or do you want to keep
playing on your phone?

355
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,000
Can you tell me a bit about your family?

356
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,560
We have three houses,

357
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,040
Grandma's house, my house,

358
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,920
and Aunt Nun's house.

359
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,760
Mom says

360
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,760
Grandma wants everyone
to have their own space.

361
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,840
But I don't think that's true.

362
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,520
What made you think that?

363
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,840
Because everyone's always fighting.

364
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,960
Grandma has us all
eat together once a week.

365
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,320
Not because she wants to see us,

366
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,280
but because…

367
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,840
<i>No one in this family is worthy.</i>

368
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,400
Patee,

369
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,840
stop acting so disgusting.

370
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,120
It's ruining your image.

371
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,880
Nun, you too.

372
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,880
Be more decisive with your work

373
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,720
or I'll remove you.

374
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,120
And you, Naree.

375
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,760
I asked you to prevent your husband
and kids from causing problems.

376
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,360
You can't even do that.

377
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,520
How can I trust you
to work at the company?

378
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,440
Well, no one's as perfect as you, Mother.

379
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,440
You're an angel.

380
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,080
I've lost my appetite.

381
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,159
Sit down.

382
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,880
I said sit down!

383
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,760
Seoul.

384
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:46,360
All of you are useless.
Completely pathetic.

385
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,840
I can't count on any of you.

386
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,560
Be grateful.

387
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,360
Everything you have today
is because of me.

388
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,080
If I died, how would you all survive?

389
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,680
Good question, Mother.
I wonder about that too.

390
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,320
Maybe you should try dying and see.

391
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,720
Just because I won't let Naree divorce you

392
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,280
doesn't mean
you can speak to me like this.

393
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,120
Without my family,

394
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,760
you'd just be the son
of some washed-up cop

395
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,120
with zero power.

396
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,720
If you won't be grateful to me,

397
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,920
at least acknowledge
your own pathetic failures.

398
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,920
<i>I don't like eating at home.</i>

399
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,040
I prefer eating at Kram's restaurant.

400
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,040
Is Kram someone you feel comfortable with?

401
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,840
He isn't annoying like the others.

402
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,040
He's kind.

403
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,960
But I don't understand why

404
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,200
Mom and Dad always speak badly to him.

405
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,840
What about the others in the house?

406
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,760
Uncle Don is nice.

407
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,760
He doesn't talk much.

408
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,200
And Aunt Nun.

409
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,880
I've seen her cry a lot.

410
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,360
Cry?

411
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,840
Do you know why?

412
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,320
I asked once.

413
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,040
She said it was nothing.

414
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,040
Ter is the nicest.

415
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,720
I wish he were my big brother
instead of Seoul.

416
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,360
What about your mom and dad?

417
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,400
They fight a lot.

418
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,320
You always go out and come home late.

419
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,680
Because at home, I have to deal
with psychos like you and your mom!

420
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,600
I'm going crazy!

421
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,960
<i>Dad always yells at Mom.</i>

422
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,720
Do you know what they argue about?

423
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,760
Seems like…

424
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,840
Mom doesn't like that Dad stays out late

425
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,760
and then locks himself in the study room.

426
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,720
<i>Or you're seeing another woman?</i>

427
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,480
One wife's enough of a headache!

428
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,120
I should've married a cow.

429
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,800
At least they don't talk back.

430
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,400
<i>Do they fight violently?</i>

431
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,400
Has there ever been physical abuse?

432
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,040
No.

433
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,040
Just throwing stuff.

434
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,200
Is there anything else?

435
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,120
If you can't think of anything,

436
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,440
how about we try drawing instead?

437
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,720
How was it, Sara? Is everything okay?

438
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,760
Everything went smoothly.

439
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,800
It's just the first day,
so, there wasn't much yet.

440
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,280
Really?

441
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,800
Is it true what she said, dear?

442
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:37,000
Sara just talked with me
and asked me to draw pictures.

443
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,360
Drawing?

444
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,040
Is that part of the therapy?

445
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,840
Naree.

446
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,760
Don't judge Ms. Sara's methods.

447
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,920
The expert knows what she's doing.

448
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,320
Sydney, next time, I'll find
something new for you to do, okay?

449
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,160
And here,

450
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,040
a small gift
for our first session together.

451
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,920
Hana Baby.

452
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,080
- Sydney!
- Sydney!

453
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,400
Namo! Nina!

454
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,840
- I missed you.
- Missed you too.

455
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,720
Why are you two here?

456
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,080
Let's go play somewhere else

457
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,080
before someone gets upset.

458
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,480
Are you heading out? I'll walk you.

459
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,760
I'll take my leave, then.

460
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,440
Thanks for walking me out.

461
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,680
But if you've got something to say,
just say it.

462
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,240
Straightforward, aren't you?

463
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,360
How much do you want?

464
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,120
For what exactly?

465
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:38,440
For your little signature,
stating that my daughter's fine

466
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,840
and ready to return to school.

467
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,160
You're asking that after just one session?

468
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,280
Normally, I charge

469
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,200
from 3,000 baht per hour for counseling.

470
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,320
That's cheaper than hiring an escort.

471
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,360
If it's such pocket change like that,

472
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,160
how about I pay you for 50 hours?

473
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,400
No, a hundred hours.

474
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,280
Consider it gas money.

475
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,160
Keep your spare change.

476
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,680
You might have something

477
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,640
far more expensive to pay for later.

478
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:42,880
Sorry, we're not open yet.

479
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,760
Kram.

480
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,320
Special guest. I can open for her.

481
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,760
Nice place you've got here.

482
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,920
Thank you.

483
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,560
But it looks even nicer
when we're open normally.

484
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,640
What's your order?

485
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,080
You didn't get to try my food
at the penthouse launch.

486
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:31,120
I should come back and eat
when the place is open.

487
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,120
Sure.

488
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,960
I actually came to ask you for a favor.

489
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,320
If you're selling insurance,

490
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,080
I already have every type there is.

491
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,080
You know Sydney's been suspended, right?

492
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,560
Yes.

493
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,920
Panter and Nun told me.

494
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,880
And I also know you were the one
who stopped her from being expelled.

495
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,920
Thank you so much for that.

496
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,840
Not many people understand Sydney.

497
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,560
You must be really close to the kids.

498
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,400
I just saw Sydney earlier,

499
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,400
and I think there's still a lot

500
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,120
of missing information
that could help with her treatment.

501
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,400
So, you're here now to ask me about her?

502
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,360
I don't know that much, honestly.
They don't spend a lot of time with me.

503
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,120
But when they have problems,
they talk to you, don't they?

504
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,120
Well, yeah.

505
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,680
But if I tell you
what they confided in me,

506
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,280
wouldn't that be betraying them?

507
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,280
But I think it's more beneficial.

508
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,360
Sometimes kids with problems

509
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,440
don't open up completely

510
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,280
to the people trying to fix them
or even to their families.

511
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,760
But they do open up

512
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,320
to the people they feel safe with.

513
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,960
What if the things I know
are really personal?

514
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,760
Everything you say will stay confidential.

515
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,640
Okay.

516
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,640
If it'll really help Sydney,
then I'm happy to help.

517
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,720
But if I find out you're tricking me

518
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,680
or using what I say for something bad,

519
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,160
I'll tell everyone.

520
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,080
I'll be going now.

521
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:55,720
Okay.

522
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,280
Oh.

523
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,320
I should get going.

524
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,320
Hello, Mind Balance Center speaking.

525
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,400
<i>Ah, I'm almost there.</i>

526
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:13,400
Hello?

527
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,520
<i>Don't hang up yet.</i>

528
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
You psycho! What the hell?

529
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,080
Whose stuff is this?

530
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:32,840
I checked the CCTV .

531
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:35,240
The person who left it
was wearing a helmet.

532
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,720
He even threw a rock
at the cameras to break them.

533
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,280
You think this is some kind of threat?

534
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,760
Calm down, Bew.

535
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:43,800
And this morning,

536
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,920
there was a weird call.
Someone called but didn't say a word.

537
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,560
What a cursed day.

538
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,720
Plang said you're reopening the case.

539
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,400
How will you do that

540
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,440
when you have no evidence left?

541
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,640
Even someone as sharp as Yanin
couldn't figure it out.

542
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,920
They won't see it coming either.

543
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,080
I think we're on the right path, Sara.

544
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,800
You think this is funny, Plang?

545
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,760
The rabbit sent today
was very clear it was a threat.

546
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,320
We're not even sure

547
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,920
it's from them yet.

548
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,840
You can lie to anyone else,

549
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,160
but you know

550
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,720
you can't lie to yourself.

551
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:58,200
Compared to what I've been through,

552
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,320
this doesn't scare me.

553
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,640
It's not about
whether you're scared or not.

554
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,640
It's about safety, Sara.

555
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,440
Don't worry about that.

556
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,760
I'll take care of her and protect her

557
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,240
until our plan is complete.

558
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,520
And what if something happens
to one of you before it's done?

559
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,280
Is it worth it, seriously?

560
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,320
No matter the threats,

561
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,760
the obstacle, or the danger,

562
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,640
we'll finish this.

563
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,320
I'll make them pay

564
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,880
for what they've done.

565
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,400
MR. CHAI TIDRAKSA
MRS. NAPA TIDRAKSA

566
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,160
Did someone clean up
Uncle Chai and Aunt Pa's graves?

567
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,680
Why do they look so clean?

568
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,200
Dad.

569
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,200
Mom.

570
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,240
I won't let the last 19 years
be for nothing.

571
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,760
Even if I have less than a year left,

572
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,640
I'll make sure

573
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,280
you both get justice.

574
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,240
I promise.

575
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,000
Dad.

576
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,360
Dad.

577
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,000
Dad.

578
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,440
Dad, you scared me.

579
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,880
Don't sneak out like this again.

580
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,400
Dad.

581
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:43,920
I just want to see Kamon.

582
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,200
Where is Kamon? Where is she?

583
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,480
Kamon's not here, Dad.

584
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,680
Then, where's Mom, Kram?

585
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,760
She's at work.

586
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,480
Let's go get some rest, okay?

587
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:58,960
Come on. I'll help.

588
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,240
Let's go.

589
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,600
<i>I'm not sure…</i>

590
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:23,640
<i>Seems like…</i>

591
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,080
<i>Mom doesn't like that Dad stays out late</i>

592
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,160
<i>and then locks himself in the study room.</i>

593
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,920
LERTHANAKUL FAMILY

594
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,680
FRIENDS OF PATEE FOUNDATION

595
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,360
KULNAREE

596
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,960
What made you want to treat
the kids today, Kram?

597
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,440
Ms. Sara wanted to treat the kids.

598
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,280
Find out everything you can about Sara.

599
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:39,760
If she really is the enemy
and managed to infiltrate this far,

600
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:40,800
she's no ordinary person.

601
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,760
Did you go to the foundation today
to do something else?

602
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,920
<i>The pieces are all in place.</i>

603
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,160
It's time to move.

604
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:59,240
So, we've got enough evidence now
to deal with them, right?

605
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,600
We'll use this clip
to make our plan succeed.

606
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,680
