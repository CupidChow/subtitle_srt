Doctor! Doctor! Kamon is awake!

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,280
Where's my mom?

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,400
My mom…

Uncle Chayut.

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,480
Where's my mom?

13
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,760
So…

14
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,160
Your mom…

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,160
I'm sorry.

Mom!

20
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,960
Mom…

21
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,880
Mom…

22
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,480
Mom…

23
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,800
Mom!

24
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,200
Mom!

25

00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,920
Mom…

27
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,640
Mom…

28
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,560
Mom…

29
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
Mom.

30
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,440
Mom.

31
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,520
Mom…

32
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,640
So, go pack your bags.

33
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,240
Where are we going?

34
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,960
Don't ask.

35
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,640
Pack everything.
We're never coming back here again.

36
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,960
Go.

37
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,440
While I was in Chantaburi,

38
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,920
someone contacted me,
asking to buy the CCTV footage.

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,720
So, I thought I'd wait
and ask you two first.

00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,040
What are you doing?!

43
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,760
Say what you want to say.

44
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,040
Say you told us so.

45
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,840
Now you see it, right?

46
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,840
It's not as smooth as you thought.

47
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,720
So many unpredictable things.

48
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,720
I was prepared.

49
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,480
But now that it's happening,
you're feeling lost, aren't you, Sara?

50
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,120
Look carefully at the situation.

51
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,120
This is happening
because they're starting to catch on.

52
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,400
And you still don't know
what exactly they've found out.

53
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,840
You need to ask yourself now.

54
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,040
If you keep pushing forward,

55
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,000
is there a greater chance
of success or failure?

56
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,640
But if we do nothing,

57
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,600
that's already a failure.

58
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,720
You might say
you're doing this for your parents…

59
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,960
but the dead

60
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,120
don't feel anything anymore, Sara.

61
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,640
Think about it.

62
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,440
Would your parents

63
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,120
want their girl, the one who survived,
to take this kind of risk?

64
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,040
So, you want me to just give up
and die inside?

65
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,240
I can't do that.

66
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,160
I've tried to move on,

67
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,320
but I can't.

68
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,600
I never could.

69
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,880
Sara, someone's here to see you.

70
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,680
Seoul told me

71
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,560
you asked him to get Patee's video clip.

72
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,320
If you're asking

73
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,320
whether I was the one who leaked it,

74
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,120
the answer is no.

75
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,840
When I first saw the news,

76
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,720
I was so worried about Seoul
and Sydney above all else.

77
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,200
And when I thought
you might've been the one to leak it,

78
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,000
I felt even worse.

79
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,760
But I also…

80
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,200
Felt disappointed?

81
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,240
Part of me was glad

82
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,240
that you kept your word to Seoul.

83
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,400
But the other part, I was sad

84
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,280
that you didn't choose
to help the kids Patee hurt.

85
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,320
I'm sorry

86
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,280
if I made you feel like
this was all your responsibility.

87
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,680
It is my responsibility.

88
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,120
I want to help the victims as quickly

89
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,760
as I possibly can,

90
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,320
if it's possible.

91
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,800
And what would make it impossible?

92
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,520
Hesitation.

93
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,160
Or selfishness, maybe.

94
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,200
Choosing who gets hurt

95
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,200
must be a hard decision.

96
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,680
I feel for you

97
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,400
to be in that situation.

98
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,000
And I shouldn't have rushed to judge you.

99
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,520
I'll talk to Seoul.

100
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,000
He'll understand.

101
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,800
Helping those victims is more urgent.

102
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,360
I'll tell him he made the right choice.

103
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,920
And thank you so much

104
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,680
for carrying such a heavy burden.

105
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,320
I tried pressuring Patee to talk,

106
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
but he insists

107
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,600
we have to get him out of prison first,

108
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,880
then he'll tell us
who asked him to reopen the case.

109
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,560
Pathetic. Always creating problems.

110
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,760
There must be a reason
he suddenly did this.

111
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,720
Why would he trouble himself
for no reason?

112
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,800
Stop trying to defend your man.

113
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,560
I'm not defending him.
But if we knew the reason,

114
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,040
maybe we'd know who's behind this.

115
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,200
That's the part I find strange.

116
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,000
He said he overheard us talking

117
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,840
about

118
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,280
betraying him
and pinning all the blame on him.

119
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,800
What?

120
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,200
Nonsense.

121
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,400
When did we ever talk about that?

122
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,440
At first, I thought he was bluffing.

123
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,360
But he seemed genuinely pissed.

124
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,920
He must have heard something.

125
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,440
<i>But I can already say this.</i>

126
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,040
<i>If a therapist told her to draw this,</i>

127
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,880
<i>they probably know more</i>
<i>about your family than you think.</i>

128
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,120
SARA CHAISITTHIKAM

129
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,360
<i>This Sara Chaisitthikam</i>

130
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,920
<i>used to be a volunteer</i>
<i>with our foundation many years ago.</i>

131
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,400
<i>Shortly after that,</i>

132
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,600
<i>she applied for a position</i>
<i>in the HR department</i>

133
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,040
<i>at Le Thana Group.</i>

134
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,560
<i>It seems this woman</i>

135
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,720
<i>has been around us</i>
<i>for quite some time now.</i>

136
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,880
That's the part I find strange.

137
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,560
He said he overheard us talking

138
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,080
about

139
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,200
betraying him
and pinning all the blame on him.

140
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,680
Wanna treat that wound first?

141
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,960
What do you think about Patee?

142
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,400
Could it involve that unknown number
that sent the clip to Nun?

143
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,160
If they're connected,

144
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,360
it might be a case of blackmail.

145
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,600
But if it's blackmail,

146
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,520
why not send it to Patee directly?
Why go through Nun?

147
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,440
I think there's more to this than we know.

148
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,240
It's okay.

149
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,680
Take your time.

150
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,680
You'll figure it out.

151
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,440
I've been sleepless for days, Kram.

152
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,920
<i>I don't wanna come to school.</i>

153
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,840
<i>I don't wanna be on social media.</i>

154
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,320
<i>Don't wanna see any friends.</i>

155
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,680
Or anyone at home.

156
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,680
I don't even know
how I'm supposed to feel.

157
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,560
I'm the reason my dad went to jail.

158
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,440
If I had just pretended
not to know anything from the start,

159
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,600
none of this would've happened.

160
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,840
Can you really bear it, Seoul?

161
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,400
Staying silent like that forever?

162
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,160
We might feel bad
about deciding to take action,

163
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,920
but trust me, Seoul,

164
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,160
we'd feel even worse

165
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,400
if we didn't do anything at all.

166
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,080
Come here, Seoul.

167
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,760
Look into the mirror.

168
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,560
Tell me what you feel.

169
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,480
Everything is my fault.

170
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,320
I caused trouble for my dad

171
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,800
and created problems for my family

172
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,119
Try putting these on.

173
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,680
And if the person in the mirror right now

174
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,840
isn't Seoul

175
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,480
but those kids

176
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,520
from the foundation

177
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,920
or Sydney's friends,

178
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,880
the ones your dad hurt,

179
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,680
what do you think they'd say to you

180
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,280
if they saw you now?

181
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,480
You don't need to say anything nice.

182
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,200
Just speak from the heart.

183
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,040
Those kids…

184
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,760
They'd say…

185
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,480
"Thank you."

186
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,680
You heard that, right, Seoul?

187
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,440
What happened

188
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,840
helped free those kids

189
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,600
from their pain.

190
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,920
The person who did wrong

191
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,480
is paying
for the consequences he deserves.

192
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,840
There's nothing
you need to feel guilty about

193
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,920
or blame yourself for.

194
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,440
Right?

195
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,880
- Mom?
- Seoul.

196
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,640
Why didn't you have the school
call me when you fainted?

197
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,040
If the admin hadn't called me,
I wouldn't have known.

198
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,160
Naree, Seoul's okay now.

199
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,720
Stay out of this.

200
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,280
You're not going to class today.
You're going to the doctor with me.

201
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,360
- I'm not going.
- Seoul.

202
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,360
I'm fine now. Sara helped me.

203
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,280
What would she know?
This is about your health.

204
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,080
- Come with me.
- I'm not going.

205
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,440
- Go, Seoul.
- I'm not going.

206
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,640
- Come on, now.
- I said I won't.

207
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,560
- Seoul!
- Naree, let's go outside.

208
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,720
Let go!

209
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,720
Seoul.

210
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,240
Seoul!

211
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,280
FIRST AID ROOM

212
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,920
Naree, can you stop yelling for once?

213
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,880
Just listen to him.

214
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,600
Who are you to act like
you know better than our family?

215
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,920
I listen to my son, of course.

216
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,080
Oh, really?

217
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,360
Do you even know that Seoul
couldn't sleep for days, so he collapsed?

218
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,960
You didn't know, did you?

219
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,200
Some things, you don't need
to wait for your child to tell you.

220
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,080
If you were truly a caring mom,

221
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,840
you'd notice before anyone else.

222
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,480
Are you lecturing me on how to be a mother

223
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,960
when you've never even had one yourself?

224
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,680
If it were me, if my mom died

225
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,800
and my dad had Alzheimer's,

226
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,280
I wouldn't dare speak to others like that.

227
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,120
Or are you trying to resolve your issue?

228
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,320
I don't have anything to resolve.

229
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,880
My dad raised me just fine.

230
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,880
But how did you and Patee raise your son?

231
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,160
Something happens and he doesn't call you.

232
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,760
Sometimes he runs away to my place.

233
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,840
If parents and grandparents
are supposed to be like you all,

234
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,720
then I'm actually lucky
to have just my dad.

235
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,280
Mom!

236
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,800
This is a school.

237
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,320
You shouldn't behave like this
in front of the kids.

238
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,640
Please go home.

239
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,040
When Seoul is ready,
he'll go home on his own.

240
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,360
Seoul.

241
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,120
You sure you're okay to go to class?

242
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,800
Yes, I'm okay now.

243
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,520
Thank you.

244
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,880
Sorry about my mom, Kram.

245
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,440
Hey, chill.

246
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,320
Whoever did wrong, it's on them.

247
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,920
A kid shouldn't have to take
the blame for their parents.

248
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,880
Thank you for protecting Seoul.

249
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,680
He called me himself.

250
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,720
He trusts me.

251
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,120
I didn't want to break that trust.

252
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,200
I've never seen you speak up
against that family before.

253
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,120
I've always given in to them.

254
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,400
I didn't want the kids to be worried.

255
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,480
Even if they didn't like me,
that was fine.

256
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,880
But today, the timing was perfect.

257
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,200
Why are you smiling?
It was perfect timing.

258
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,120
Besides making spicy food,

259
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,160
my mouth is pretty spicy too.

260
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,200
The kids are lucky to have you.

261
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,200
Do you want to feel lucky too?

262
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,800
Watch out!

263
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,040
I'm so sorry.

264
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,800
Is your girlfriend okay?

265
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,880
She's fine.
Just be more careful next time.

266
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,000
Yes.

267
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,800
That was pretty cool, but it hurt.

268
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,520
<i>If the mom is like this,</i>
<i>how's the kid going to be?</i>

269
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,520
<i>That family just loves drama.</i>

270
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:25,000
<i>Poor Seoul. The dad, the mom,</i>
<i>the sister, none of them are normal.</i>

271
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,680
Mom, what did you do?

272
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,320
Dear.

273
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,360
What are you talking about?

274
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,160
<i>Mom!</i>

Didn't you tell us to lay low?

277
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,200
You're not laying low at all.

278
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,480
How am I supposed to go back to school?

279

- Sydney.

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,720
Hello. How can I help you?

298
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,160
Do you do laundry for official uniforms?

299
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,720
The shop I usually go to shut down.

300
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,280
We only accept regular clothing here,
no police uniforms.

301
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,480
How did you know I'm a policeman?

302
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,440
I'm not in uniform,
and my haircut isn't even regulation.

303
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,320
You said it's an official uniform.

304
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,200
How many jobs have that?

305
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,800
Wait, Plang.

306
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,240
Plang, Pattra Suphaisin.

307
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,040
Who told you my full name?

308
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,520
Let me go!

309
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,360
- Let me go! Don't do this!
- Come here.

310
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,720
- Don't be scared.
- Let me go!

311
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,600
Don't hurt me! No!

312
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,280
- Anybody help! No!
- Plang!

313
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,560
- Don't hurt me!
- Plang!

314
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,600
- Don't hurt me!
- Plang!

315
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,920
- Get off of her!
- What the hell?

316
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,600
Hurry!

317
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,520
Damn it!

318
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,800
Sorry.

319
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,440
Plang, are you okay?

320
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,160
I'm fine. Thank you so much
for helping me, Bank, Kamon.

321
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,640
Last time I had trouble at school,

322
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,760
you helped me too.

323
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,600
Yeah. We've got to help each other.

324
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,000
It's just us, after all.

325
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,360
Come on.

326
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,640
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

327
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,640
Bank?

328
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,800
Is that really you?

329
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,600
Yeah.

330
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,440
I can't believe it either.

331
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,120
Why that face?

332
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,560
Aren't you happy to see me?

333
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,200
No, I'm just stunned.

334
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,120
It's been so long.

335
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,400
You have to tell me
what you've been through.

336
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,200
You and Aunt Goy
have been through a lot, huh?

337
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,520
They ruined the only way
my mom and I could make a living,

338
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,800
to the point we had to go
collect and sell scrap.

339
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,440
And then Mom got sick.

340
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,680
Back then, we thought we wouldn't survive.

341
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,520
But luckily,
someone helped us just in time.

342
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,400
That feeling of being powerless

343
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,000
is the worst.

344
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,200
And

345
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,520
you saw the news about Kamon, right?

346
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,200
I still feel awful
every time I think about it.

347
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,120
Mom, Kamon's awake!

348
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,160
Mom!

349
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,480
Where's my mom?

350
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,400
Where's my mom?

351
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,480
- Mom…
- <i>That image of Kamon from that day</i>

352
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,880
<i>is stuck with me ever since.</i>

353
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,800
TRAGIC! ORPHANED GIRL TAKES HER OWN LIFE
AFTER LOSING BOTH PARENTS

354
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,840
<i>When I heard Kamon was gone,</i>

355
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,920
- Kamon?
- <i>I got even more angry.</i>

356
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,920
Even more frustrated
that I couldn't do anything then.

357
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,120
Oh, Kamon.

358
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,240
The justice system is useless, isn't it?

359
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,160
Yeah.

360
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,880
That's why I chose to become a cop.

361
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,200
That day, we couldn't reach justice.

362
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,520
But today, the law is in my hands.

363
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,520
I'll use it to help many others, so they
don't have to go through what we did.

364
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,400
Bank.

365
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,840
If there were something
we could do for Kamon,

366
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,600
would you do it?

367
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,400
I would. I'd do anything.

368
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,120
Since the day I became a policeman…

369
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,080
MR. CHAI TIDRAKSA
MRS. NAPA TIDRAKSA

370
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,920
…I've always thought I'd be able
to uncover the truth about

371
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,480
what happened to you both and Kamon.

372
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,400
But up until now,

373
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,840
I haven't achieved anything.

374
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,840
I'm sorry.

375
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,400
I'm not a good enough cop yet.

376
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,160
But if there's anything I can do,

377
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,440
I swear

378
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,480
I'll do everything in my power
to make those who hurt us pay.

379
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,360
If Kamon knew
you're still fighting for us,

380
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,520
she'd be proud
to see how determined you are.

381
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,400
You'll get your chance soon.

382
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,520
What do you mean?

383
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,880
We haven't been able to do anything

384
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,760
because we didn't have anyone
connected to the case.

385
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,240
But what if we have
someone directly involved?

386
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,480
How would that even be possible? I mean…

387
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,680
Hello, Ms. Sara.

388
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,680
Thank you, Bank,

389
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,920
for still being the same person.

390
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,040
What?

391
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,240
This can't be.

392
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,960
It's just us, after all.

393
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,200
Kamon?

394
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,480
Kamon.

395
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,960
Sorry.

396
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,639
Did you get anything?

397
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,080
It's a high-profile case,
so we're being watched closely.

398
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,639
It's going to be tough.

399
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,840
Whatever they want, name the price.

400
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,239
But we cannot let
that clip on Patee's phone

401
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,600
become another legal case.

402
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,800
Yes, I'll handle the deals
with all parties involved

403
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,560
and report the numbers
back to you, Mother.

404
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,800
Make sure everything
is taken care of, Don.

405
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,720
No mistakes.

406
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,840
In just a few months,

407
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,160
the statute of limitations will expire.
Then this whole thing will be over.

408
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,600
Yes.

409
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,760
119 BAHT

410
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,080
TRUE FLAVOR IS MUCH MORE
THAN BEAUTIFUL APPEARANCE

411
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,680
What am I? Doraemon?
She bought me so many.

412
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,080
How cute.

413
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,760
<i>I've got it.</i>
<i>Thanks for the delivery service.</i>

414
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,400
Keep your eyes on the road.

415
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,920
I'm watching the road.

416
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,200
But I'm interested in something else too.

417
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,560
Kram is such a sweet guy.

418
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,640
He's kind, attentive.

419
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,200
But he's got one flaw.

420
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,040
What is it?

421
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,960
You're eager to know?

422
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,760
I'm glad to see you happy,

423
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,720
no matter what it's about.

424
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,960
But I just want you to be careful.

425
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,760
He still knows that family.

426
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,360
Even if he's a good person,

427
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,360
we don't know how much we can trust him.

428
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,880
Hey.

429
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,040
We're almost there.

430
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,720
HEAD EAST

431
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,600
Please let us find a witness
and some evidence.

432
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,760
Sathu.

433
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,640
Is this the orange farm you mentioned?

434
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,120
CHOKE DEE ORANGE ORCHARD

435
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,520
Who are you here to see?

436
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,760
He's the one who took money from Kitti.

437
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,200
We're just here to ask
about buying some oranges.

438
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,720
This is my aunt's orchard.

439
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,440
She's been running it for over ten years.

440
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,000
She's got guests at the moment.

441
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,920
The grove is that way.

442
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,360
Why don't you take a walk
and try some oranges first?

443
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,600
I guarantee they're sweet and tasty.

444
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,160
I think I left my phone in the car.

445
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,080
Oh, really?

446
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,040
I'll catch up with you then.

447
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,640
How large is this orange farm?

448
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,480
Quite large, actually.

449
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,800
Are you sure, Auntie?

450
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,720
I told you no one came.

451
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,600
Why would anyone come talk
about a case from 19 years ago?

452
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,080
What's really going on?

453
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,360
Nothing, Auntie.

454
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,040
If no one comes, then fine.

455
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,320
But if anyone contacts you or your nephew

456
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,120
about that case from 19 years ago,
call me right away.

457
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,000
Okay.

458
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,920
Wait.

459
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,080
I heard you're looking for evidence
from the day Chai died, right?

460
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,960
Yes.

461
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,720
Have you spoken to the other person yet?

462
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,440
The other one shouldn't be a problem.
I'll talk to them.

463
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,280
Don't forget, Auntie.

464
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,880
Okay.

465
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,840
The path's a bit rough.

466
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,960
Sorry. I'm sorry.

467
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,120
Did you finish talking to my aunt?

468
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,240
Yes.

469
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,520
Is there a problem?

470
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,520
Did you see anyone run this way?

471
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,240
No, I didn't.

472
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,200
Thanks.

473
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,280
Auntie's done with her business.

474
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,640
Let's go talk to her.

475
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,480
Okay.

476
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,240
Sara.

477
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,200
He's just about to take us
to talk with the owner.

478
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,000
Can I talk to my friend for a sec?

479
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,200
Sure.

480
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,280
Once you're done,
come join us in the house.

481
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,560
Sara, I just saw Kitti.

482
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,240
I have no idea what he's doing here.

483
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,160
Don't tell me he saw you.

484
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,040
He didn't,

485
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,600
but I barely managed to hide.
I was in shocked.

486
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,720
About what?

487
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,800
The orchard owner,
the one Kitti gave money to,

488
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,520
is Aunt Sampao.

489
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,880
Sampao?

490
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,000
Sampao.

491
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,240
- This is for you, Kamon.
- Thank you.

492
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,840
This one's for you, Plang.

493
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,960
Thank you. Here you go.

494
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,040
Alright.

495
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,520
- Here. My treat.
- It's okay.

496
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,280
Mom said not to take things for free.

497
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,360
I'll ask Mom for money later.

498
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,200
Then don't tell her.

499
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,200
Just drink it all before you go back
to the construction site.

500
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,680
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

501
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,760
Sit and drink here.

502
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,360
Slow down. You'll choke.

503
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,160
Your orange juice
is the best in the world!

504
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,840
Such a sweet talker.

505
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,440
One day, I'll have to buy
an orange orchard and start selling juice.

506
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,360
Drink up that sweet juice,

507
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,560
so life won't be bitter anymore.

508
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,240
Drink it all, every drop.

509
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,480
Aunt Sampao?

510
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,680
He came to check

511
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,280
if anyone's asked her to be a witness
for the case from 19 years ago.

512
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,840
And she asked him too

513
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,880
whether he's talked
to the other person yet.

514
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,080
That means someone else knows about this?

515
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,400
Then they already suspect
someone's reopening the case.

516
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,920
They just don't know who yet.

517
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,960
Please, come in.

518
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,920
I squeezed some juice for you.

519
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:59,000
So, where's this smoothie shop
you're planning to open?

520
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,240
At the new avenue by Le Thana Group.

521
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,680
Have you been running
this orange orchard for a long time?

522
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:21,000
Almost 20 years now, dear.

523
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,960
Have you lived here from the beginning,

524
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,680
or did you move from somewhere else?

525
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,120
I moved from Bangkok.

526
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,040
Why though?

527
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,120
Was there something
in Bangkok you didn't like?

528
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,680
Well…

529
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,080
I…

530
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,120
You must really love farming, right?

531
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,080
So, you left

532
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,200
a city life in Bangkok

533
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,680
and came live out here like this.

534
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,160
So, you know Le Thana Group then?

535
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,200
They're super famous.

536
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,680
They've built lots of nice condos.

537
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,720
I don't really know much about them.

538
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,440
I'm sorry.

539
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,520
Also, my orchard is quite small.

540
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,440
I probably can't supply
enough produce for your shop.

541
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,600
But thank you
for coming all the way out here.

542
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,720
Sorry for bothering you.

543
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,800
Dear.

544
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,760
Take some juice with you.

545
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,320
That's okay.

546
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,120
I know it's good.

547
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,880
Wait.

548
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,720
You said you're opening your stall
at Le Thana Group's place, right?

549
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,600
If possible,

550
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,840
find another place instead. Trust me.

551
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,240
I've always thought Aunt Sampao had died.

552
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,080
Because back when she was going
to give the evidence to you and Aunt Napa,

553
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:54,000
she suddenly disappeared.

554
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,440
I thought she'd been silenced.

555
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,120
Plang, pull over.

556
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:10,720
Sara.

557
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,800
Sara.

558
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,600
Are you okay?

559
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,560
Part of me is happy

560
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,920
to see Aunt Sampao again.

561
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,720
We used to be close.

562
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,440
She almost helped us once.

563
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,800
But she also betrayed us.

564
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,320
You're right.

565
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,600
That money was probably hush money.

566
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,000
She must've used it to start over here.

567
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,760
But from what she said earlier,

568
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,280
that we shouldn't work
with Le Thana Group,

569
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,200
do you think it's possible
Aunt Sampao isn't on their side?

570
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,400
Maybe.

571
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,480
Or you're…

572
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,000
I'm thinking

573
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,440
of asking Aunt Sampao to be our witness.

574
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,920
And if we find
the other witness she mentioned,

575
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,480
plus the clip from Patee's phone
that we're about to get from Bank,

576
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:36,800
both the witnesses and the evidence
might be legit enough to reopen the case.

577
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,080
And when that happens,

578
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,720
we can get Patee to testify for us again.

579
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,560
There's some hope now.

580
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,760
Sara, are you sure

581
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,640
Aunt Sampao won't betray us again?

582
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:58,920
<i>The girl's crazy.</i>
<i>The parents are crazy. Crazy family.</i>

583
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,760
<i>Twisted, rotten to the core.</i>
<i>Rich on the outside, hollow inside.</i>

584
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:06,280
<i>The kids in the foundation</i>
<i>are exposing him. Big jail time coming,.</i>

585
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,640
THE KIDS IN THE FOUNDATION
ARE EXPOSING HIM. BIG JAIL TIME COMING

586
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,600
Enough.

587
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,520
The more we respond, the worse it gets.

588
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,080
Just let the content
get reported and taken down.

589
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,240
No.

590
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:25,000
I want them all dead.

591
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,600
Give it here.

592
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,840
Give it!

593
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,520
- Enough.
- Seoul!

594
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,520
- Stop it, Sydney.
- Give it!

595
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,120
This won't fix anything.

596
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,280
That's because you're not doing anything.

597
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,280
You let them say anything
they want about me,

598
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,880
about Dad and Mom.

599
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,360
If you don't want me to fight back,

600
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,160
then you deal with them for me.

601
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,160
Our family really did do wrong.
Sydney, you bullied others.

602
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:53,280
Mom insulted Kram and Sara.
Dad broke the law.

603
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,040
No.

604
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,520
Our family isn't wrong.

605
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,760
They are the ones who butted in!

606
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,920
We're not wrong!

607
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,680
- Give it to me!
- Hey!

608
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,640
- Give it to me!
- Enough already!

609
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:09,240
- You could behave, but you didn't.
- Give it to me! Let go!

610
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,520
I said let go!

611
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,480
My phone!

612
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,520
Give me yours.

613
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,720
- Give it!
- No. No!

614
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,520
- You broke my phone!
- Don't!

615
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,880
- Sydney, give it to me.
- You want it?

616
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,920
Now both are broken.

617
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,560
Ugh!

618
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,440
- Ugh!
- Seoul!

619
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,520
- Stop it, damn it!
- Ugh!

620
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,800
Just get out of here. You're annoying!

621
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,440
Seoul.

622
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,880
You like it so much, right?

623
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,400
You like it so much.
You love it, don't you?

624
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,280
- Screw it!
- Seoul!

625
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,840
- Goddamn it!
- Stop it!

626
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,480
- What are you doing?!
- Bastard!

627
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,840
- What's going on?! Are you fighting?!
- Love it, huh?

628
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,360
- Huh?
- What's going on? I said stop!

629
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,600
Seoul, what did you do to your sister?

630
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,440
Why don't you ask her what she did?

631
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,000
Seoul.

632
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,840
Sydney.

633
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,680
Sydney, baby.

634
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,720
Sydney, don't cry, sweetheart.

635
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,880
Sydney. Sydney.

636
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,160
A small gift
for our first session together.

637
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,880
Hana Baby.

638
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,320
Hey, Sara.

639
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,320
The bug we planted inside Sydney's doll

640
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,680
just lost signal.

641
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,400
<i>Or the signal from the bug disappeared</i>

642
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:16,880
<i>because they found it?</i>

643
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,240
Someone like Kulnaree would gather as much
as she could before making her move.

644
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,760
And while she's collecting information,

645
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,800
we should end it all.

646
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,040
CHOKE DEE ORANGE ORCHARD

647
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,200
Give it back to me!

648
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,680
I hate you, Grandma!

649
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,920
- Sydney, what are you doing?
- Everyone hates me.

650
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:33,880
I want to die.

651
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,000
If she hadn't tried to control everything,

652
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,080
none of this would've happened.

653
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,360
This brilliant psychologist

654
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,600
hid a bug

655
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,840
inside the doll she gave Sydney.

656
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,520
You tried to get close to the Lerthanakul
because you had a purpose, didn't you?

657
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,400
