1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,840
(Perpetual Bloom)

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,060
Marrying off your daughter
is a good thing.

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,660
Why are you shedding tears?

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,180
People will tease you for this.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,580
A daughter awaits a good husband
upon growing to adulthood,

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,380
not knowing the pain of separation.

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,260
Father, Fifth Uncle.

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,020
Dou Zhao?

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,160
Seventh Brother?

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,340
How can we clean up this mess?

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,540
Have you come up with a countermeasure?

12
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,700
Shishu, why are you asking me this?

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,769
I was kept in the dark too.

14
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:54,199
I don't know what to do as well.

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,580
Stop pretending.

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,140
Do you think a lass like Ming

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,060
could come up with
something like this by herself?

18
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,150
What if Duke of Jining

19
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,780
insists on blowing this issue up
and seeking the local authorities?

20
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,980
The Dou family will
be embarrassed, you know?

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,020
In my opinion,

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,140
why don't we make the Wei Family

23
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,919
acknowledge the marriage?

24
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,500
We should keep this matter under wraps.

25
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,399
This way, Ming won't suffer as much

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,820
when she marries into the family.

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,820
Ms. Longevity was supposed
to marry into their family.

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,860
Isn't it reasonable for us to deliver more
dowries to them on Ming's behalf?

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,560
How dare you still think about
touching Ms. Longevity's dowries?

30
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,679
Tell me.

31
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,060
Were you the one

32
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,740
behind Ms. Longevity's switcheroo?

33
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,659
I know you feel unfair
for Ms. Longevity.

34
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,550
But Ming is our daughter as well.

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,599
I gave birth to her
after ten months of pregnancy.

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,340
Of course, I have to
give her my support.

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,599
Do you expect me to stand idly by
as she takes her own life?

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,710
How dare you still reason with me

39
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,439
when you've done something
this shameful?

40
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,370
In the end,
it's all because you spoiled her.

41
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,239
How can you explain yourself
to Ms. Longevity?

42
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,380
Enough.

43
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,540
This is not the time
for a family argument.

44
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,560
Ms. Longevity has the demeanor
of the eldest daughter in the family.

45
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,159
Now, we should think about

46
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,980
how to protect the family's reputation.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,839
Ms. Longevity, you should've told us
about their relationship earlier

48
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,190
since you've realized their
affection for each other before.

49
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,420
If so, it'll be easier
for us to re-plan the marriage.

50
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,340
She's not willing
to be married to him anyway.

51
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,620
Now, she has her wish granted.

52
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,540
Besides, Ming was always meek.

53
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,540
Why would she fall for Wei Tingyu
all of a sudden?

54
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,460
Who knows if she
was instigated by someone?

55
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,420
I'm already wounded.

56
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,460
You guys didn't even hire
a physician for me

57
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,580
in fear that people
might hear about this.

58
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,140
Now that you want
to sweep things under the rug,

59
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,380
you're actually pushing the blame on me?

60
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,820
Look at the mess we're in now.

61
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,330
I have no idea how to pacify

62
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,300
Duchess of Jing tomorrow
if she confronts us.

63
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,090
For now, the most urgent thing
is for you to draft a written agreement.

64
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,740
State that you were sick for a long time

65
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,199
and that it's hard
to bear children.

66
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,940
You're withdrawing
from the marriage voluntarily

67
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,600
due to fear of affecting
the lineage of the Wei Family.

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,220
In the future, if the Wei Family
comes to confront us,

69
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,980
we can use Ms. Longevity's dowries

70
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,980
to make up for Ming's bluntness.

71
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,180
After all, the Dou Family
was at fault first.

72
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,900
This way, Ming can marry
into their family officially.

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,780
Back then, you guys
forced me to get married

74
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,940
when I didn't want to.

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,780
You pressured me with talks
of parents' orders and family importance.

76
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,100
Now that this has happened,

77
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,540
you're forcing me
to be the victim again?

78
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,860
If today's matter cannot be
resolved through discussion,

79
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,930
I'll deliver the marriage certificate
to Shengtian tomorrow.

80
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,820
I'll let the people
in the Capital be my judge.

81
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,770
Have you lost your mind?

82
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,719
This is preposterous.

83
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,390
Do you have any regard
for the Dou Family?

84
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,159
Shut up!

85
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,300
That's enough!

86
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,460
Shiying.

87
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,959
You...

88
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,140
You only care about
the Dou Family's reputation.

89
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,660
My daughter is at fault
no matter what she does!

90
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,720
You two even joined hands

91
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,900
to force her to swallow
all her grievances in silence!

92
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,820
She's my daughter!

93
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,900
She's not your daughter!

94
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,590
Even if the Wei family
demands an account,

95
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,319
I, Dou Shiying,
will give them an account!

96
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,180
You don't need to worry!

97
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,860
And you,

98
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,620
you've done such a shameful deed.

99
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,100
You've ruined the family's reputation.

100
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,380
And now, you're still thinking
of Ms. Longevity's dowries?

101
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,940
You disgust me to no end!

102
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,340
As an elder of the Dou family,

103
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,660
you're acting as if
you care about the Dou family.

104
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,730
But you only wish
to give the Wei family an account.

105
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,800
Who will give Ms. Longevity
an account, then?

106
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,239
Fine.

107
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,780
I'll stay out of this!

108
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,220
I don't need your interference!

109
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,639
Ms. Longevity,

110
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,780
let's go.

111
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,719
=Blossom=
(Adapted from the novel "Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

112
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,940
=Episode 17=

113
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,740
Does it still hurt?

114
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,660
Do you need me to hire
an imperial physician for you?

115
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,100
No need for that.

116
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,660
Your fifth uncle always
looks at the bigger picture.

117
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,110
Your mother had to swallow
a lot of grievances back then.

118
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,300
This time, I mustn't let you
suffer the same fate.

119
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,100
The incident may seem like
your stepmother's fault,

120
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,780
but in reality,

121
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,370
it's because your fifth uncle and I

122
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,100
kept being lenient
to her all these years.

123
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,300
That's why she's bold enough
to do something like that.

124
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,500
You don't need to sign the
marriage certificate if you don't want.

125
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,180
I'll join you if you want
to report her to the authorities.

126
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,940
You don't need
to care about anything else.

127
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,420
I'll cover your back.

128
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,740
I'll punish your stepmother

129
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,100
and make it up to you

130
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,100
without showing any favoritism.

131
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,060
It was an exhausting night.

132
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,900
You should rest early.

133
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,020
Father.

134
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,900
Have you truly sobered up?

135
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,460
That's right.

136
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,820
I've sobered up.

137
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,140
I won't get drunk again.

138
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,300
(Serenity)

139
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,320
Fourth Young Lady, are you really
going to report her to the authorities?

140
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,940
I just said that out of spite.

141
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,700
My head has been hurting the entire day.

142
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,200
It's time to let Wang Yingxue
experience it herself.

143
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,100
Dou Zhao.

144
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,540
I'll marry you.

145
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,420
Su Lan.

146
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,340
Go buy me a bowl of tofu pudding.

147
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,140
Yes, Fourth Young Lady.

148
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,940
How did you know
that the bride wasn't me?

149
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,860
I could tell at first glance

150
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,660
that it wasn't you.

151
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,980
Dou Zhao,

152
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,540
marry me.

153
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,580
Don't spend your days
suffering in a family like this.

154
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,140
I'll treat you well in the future.

155
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,540
No one will dare to bully you
again in the future.

156
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,820
Do you think we're playing house here?

157
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,380
Since Wei Tingyu married my sister,

158
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,999
does that mean I have to find myself

159
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,399
a husband who has a higher status,

160
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,719
ranking, and is superior to him

161
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,860
in all aspects?

162
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,980
I just wish to lead my own life.

163
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,860
There's no need
to pit myself against them.

164
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,620
What about your own will, then?

165
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,100
I don't wish to get married.

166
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,580
Moreover,

167
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,639
you and Fifth Uncle are sworn enemies.

168
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,300
You and him are different.

169
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,020
These are two different matters.

170
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,460
For your sake,

171
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,460
I might be able
to tolerate him a little more.

172
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,260
I'm not saying this out of impulse.

173
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,980
I'm more serious
than I've ever been before.

174
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,020
I don't like you.

175
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,180
That's why I cannot be married to you.

176
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,980
You're lying.

177
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,419
I'm not.

178
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,900
That's not what I saw

179
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,060
from your eyes.

180
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,900
This is a magnolia tree,
my late mother's favorite plant.

181
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,740
In the eighth year of the Chengping era,

182
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,140
my mother took
her own life in front of me.

183
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,140
My father had an affair
with Wang Yingxue.

184
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,580
My mother's expectations of love

185
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,580
(Perpetual Bloom)
shattered

186
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,500
like brittle snow.

187
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,479
The Dou Family even wanted
to frame my mother

188
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,319
(Perpetual Bloom)

189
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,660
by using the Seven Rules.

190
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,300
They forced her to submit.

191
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,740
No matter if it's love or marriage,

192
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,940
I'm terrified of both.

193
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,740
Your Lordship, I know you fancy me.

194
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,740
I'm very grateful to you.

195
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,460
It's just that...

196
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,460
No wonder

197
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,820
you rely on yourself for everything.

198
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,340
But I can tell

199
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,620
that this isn't all
of your true intentions.

200
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,439
Fine.

201
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,780
I'll tell you everything, then.

202
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,059
I once had a strange dream.

203
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,919
In my dream,

204
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,279
both of us were killed
by the same arrow.

205
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,119
If we continue

206
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,639
to let our fates interact,

207
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,780
I'm afraid...

208
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,580
That's the reason you always feared me,

209
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,580
right?

210
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,140
I once had strange dreams too.

211
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,140
But that was just a dream.

212
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,780
No. It's more than just a dream.

213
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,380
The mark behind my ear
is the best proof there is.

214
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,580
But there's no red mark behind your ear.

215
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,420
How could that be?

216
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,660
It's actually gone?

217
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,060
I knew you would cover it with rouge.

218
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,220
But now,

219
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,060
it's gone.

220
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,420
If one day,

221
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,180
with the power of towering mountains
and cascading valleys,

222
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,999
you can make
this towering mountain before you

223
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,320
collapse,

224
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,420
the river will be changed.

225
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,310
Dou Zhao.

226
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,380
This is?

227
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,180
This is the imperial decree.

228
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,500
Since ancient times,

229
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,100
countless women have
gone against their consciences

230
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,660
and suffered for the rest of their lives

231
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,399
because of their parents' orders.

232
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,679
Prince Song is sincere.

233
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,960
He's fighting for her happiness.

234
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,740
Relay my order.

235
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,100
For Fourth Young Lady Dou's marriage,

236
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,280
there's no need to conform
to conventional etiquette.

237
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,460
She can make her own decision.

238
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,700
If the ceremony isn't completed,

239
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,399
she may withdraw from her marriage
with Duke of Jining.

240
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,559
(Imperial Bestowment)

241
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,820
In the future, if anyone
forces you to get married again,

242
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,860
you may show them this.

243
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,420
You have the right to choose

244
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,940
and refuse anyone you like.

245
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,620
No matter if it's your father or uncle,

246
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,180
no one can force you to do anything now.

247
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,580
Although I believe

248
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,420
that the purple crape myrtle
could grow independently,

249
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,300
I believe that it would grow better

250
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,780
if it receives support

251
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,180
and love.

252
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,460
You don't need to give me an answer now.

253
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,700
Take your time to consider it.

254
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,740
If you agree to my proposal,

255
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,380
hang a red tassel

256
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,479
on the magnolia tree

257
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,020
in five days.

258
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,300
I'll be able to see it from afar.

259
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,260
If you refuse,

260
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,540
hang a white tassel on it.

261
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,220
In the future,

262
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,580
I shall not bother you again.

263
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,100
Farewell.

264
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,380
(Duke of Jining's Residence)

265
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,849
Last night was their wedding night.

266
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,330
It's normal for them
to wake up late the next day.

267
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,020
Tingzhen...

268
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,580
What's wrong?

269
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,599
Come out.

270
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,820
I have something to tell you.

271
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,399
You can tell me right here.

272
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,439
I...

273
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,620
Tell me.

274
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,700
What are you doing here?

275
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,820
How dare the Dou Family do such a thing?

276
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,479
(Aspire for Greatness)
My brother

277
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,159
drank quite a lot last night.

278
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,420
He has a headache.

279
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,159
Madam Wei, if you have something to say,

280
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,500
you may discuss it with me and Yingxue.

281
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,940
What's there to discuss when you guys have
deceived us with a switcheroo?

282
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,580
We're a family.

283
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,900
You don't need to do this.

284
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,020
Who said she was a part of my family?

285
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,920
Her name isn't even
on the marriage certificate!

286
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,060
If I send this to Shengtian,
this can be used as a proof of crime!

287
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,780
Mother.

288
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,940
Since we've already done the deed,

289
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,380
we should confess.

290
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,180
As the saying goes,

291
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,700
wrong palanquin, right man.

292
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,399
As long as the youngsters
are happy with it,

293
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,279
I guess it's acceptable

294
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,900
to break some old conventions

295
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,540
if it makes them happy.

296
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,439
Madam Wang,

297
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,980
your father is the Minister of War.

298
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,020
Now, Fifth Master Dou is backing you up.

299
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,900
Are you trying to rewrite the law here?

300
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,580
Deceiving the court with a substitution
in marriage is punishable by flogging.

301
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,100
Madam Wei, if you do intend
to report this to the authorities,

302
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,140
you should be at Shengtian
at this moment.

303
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,380
What are you doing
at the Dou's Residence now?

304
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,250
The wedding banquet
has already been completed.

305
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,820
If you file a lawsuit now,

306
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,519
it'll only result
in the embarrassment and humiliation

307
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,820
of both families.

308
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,700
Madam Wei, why don't you

309
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,420
just tell us about your intention?

310
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,740
This marriage doesn't count.

311
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,399
Return the betrothal gifts

312
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,340
we gave you threefold,

313
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,980
and I'll forget about this incident.

314
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,860
So, in the end,
all you care about is money.

315
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,399
But you want threefold? Isn't it...

316
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,100
No matter how greedy a person is,

317
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,420
they could never demand
a compensation of this sum.

318
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,919
Do you think the Dou Family

319
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,500
receives a windfall from time to time?

320
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,100
You can go ahead and do what you want.

321
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,020
Do you think Duke of Jining

322
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,940
did not consummate with my daughter?

323
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,180
You really have the nerve
to cause a scene here, huh?

324
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,620
If Shengtian cannot handle this,

325
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,839
I'll tell His Majesty

326
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,700
and Her Majesty to handle this case!

327
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,540
Tingzhen.

328
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,279
Heaven and Earth, be my witness!

329
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,740
This is all my fault alone!

330
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,380
It has nothing to do with Ming.

331
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,519
Strange.

332
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,020
Even a cowardly turtle has its moments
of stepping up, huh?

333
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,700
I was the one who persuaded Ming
to proceed with the switcheroo.

334
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,120
No matter if
it's compensation or punishment,

335
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,580
I, Wei Tingyu alone, will bear them.

336
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,220
I'll say the same thing

337
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,500
even if His Majesty is here.

338
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,380
(Marriage Certificate)
What a load of nonsense!

339
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,759
They were at fault from the start!

340
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,280
Why are you trying to bear the blame?

341
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,799
Excellent!

342
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
This is an action befitting
of the Duke of Jining.

343
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,180
I promised I would watch over you.

344
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,580
I'll keep my promise.

345
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,660
Ming and I truly love each other.

346
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,980
I don't need a single cent

347
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,340
from the Dou Family.

348
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,580
I only hope that the elders of both
families can renew the marriage contract

349
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,660
to give Ming and me a rightful status.

350
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,980
Dou, if you do love me,

351
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,020
can you carry me on your back

352
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,900
and walk a few rounds

353
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,460
after you bring me to your residence?

354
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,300
I will do it.

355
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,420
Since it has come to this,

356
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,340
it should be so.

357
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,220
You're being stubborn again, huh?

358
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,479
All these years of education

359
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,890
and rite-learning were for nothing!

360
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,860
If you get yourself a wife like this,

361
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,820
people will mock you forever!

362
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,119
I'll lead my own life.

363
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,420
They can mock me all they like.

364
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,340
I've already deemed her

365
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,740
as my wife.

366
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,860
Madam Wei, what do you think
about your marriage?

367
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,860
Stop your nonsense!

368
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,620
When I was her age,

369
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,020
I have always hoped that in this life,

370
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,740
there would be someone who would
protect me and love me.

371
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,420
But it's impossible to have that
in this lifetime.

372
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,020
But there's still hope

373
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,260
for the youngsters.

374
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,230
Madam Wei,

375
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,020
do you still remember the promise
we made at Duanyang?

376
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,580
Please leave.

377
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,159
Father,

378
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,860
I've let Zhao down.

379
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,020
I'll apologize to Zhao right now.

380
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,159
No.

381
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,540
I've let Fourth Lady down.

382
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,660
I'll beg her for forgiveness.

383
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,780
Fifth Young Lady and Wei Tingyu
are heading to our courtyard.

384
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,279
Young Lady, it's like Wei Tingyu
has changed entirely.

385
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,239
He's become responsible.

386
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,920
He said he came here
to apologize to you.

387
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,890
I couldn't care less.

388
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,380
Come here quickly.

389
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,119
- Look at the red mark behind my ear.
- Young Lady.

390
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,800
Has it truly disappeared?

391
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,530
You've been looking at it
for the entire afternoon.

392
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,660
You should have some water.

393
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,580
By the way, Miss,

394
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,679
Wang Yingxue has dragged
Madam Wei into the room.

395
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,060
They're being so mysterious.

396
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,100
Why are they being so secretive?

397
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,460
Everything in the world
is driven by the pursuit of gain.

398
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,180
At the moment, there seems
to be no better option

399
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,580
than sharing the profits
with Wei Tingzhen.

400
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,940
(Ledger)
This is all of my usury business

401
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,100
in the Capital.

402
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:21,439
The related government offices are all
waiting to curry favor with my father.

403
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,020
Adding one more point of interest

404
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,900
won't cut off the flow of wealth.

405
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,340
As long as you leave
your thumbprint here,

406
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,940
half of the dividends

407
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,860
will be delivered to your residence
by different money houses

408
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,260
every month on time.

409
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,300
Madam Wang,
you're straightforward indeed.

410
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,660
Regarding the marriage certificate,

411
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,340
let's pick an auspicious hour
together tomorrow.

412
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,260
I'll call the duke of our residence

413
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,679
and several lords from
the Imperial Clan Court

414
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,559
to be our witnesses.

415
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,199
That will surely put an end
to the idle gossip.

416
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,279
Don't worry.

417
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,879
She'll be my sister-in-law
in the future.

418
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,660
I'll treat her well.

419
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,740
Madam Wei, thank you for your effort.

420
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,759
Ming,

421
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,260
if you don't know what to say later,

422
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,740
I'll apologize to her first.

423
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,959
Your Lordship, Fifth Young Lady,
please return.

424
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,500
Miss doesn't want to see anyone.

425
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,399
Zhao,

426
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,940
I've let you down.

427
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,470
(Perpetual Bloom)
Fourth Young Lady,

428
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,230
Ming only came up with that terrible
method because she was desperate.

429
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,300
She has broken your heart.

430
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,479
If you want to blame someone,

431
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,620
you should blame me.

432
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,220
How is she brokenhearted?

433
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,279
His Lordship fancies Young Lady.

434
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,860
She doesn't have time for them.

435
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,060
Fourth Young Lady,
we've owed you too much.

436
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,180
In the future, just tell me

437
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,020
if you need any help

438
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,380
in the future.

439
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,180
I, Wei Tingyu, will surely do my best

440
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,380
to repay your huge favor.

441
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,300
(Even a cold and unfeeling person
like Wei Tingyu)

442
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,820
(is treating Dou Ming sincerely.)

443
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,940
(Maybe they're destined to be together.)

444
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,740
Here are 5,000 silver taels banknote.

445
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,580
Keep them.

446
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,380
Father.

447
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,780
I know.

448
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,900
I know that money alone

449
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,220
cannot atone for all the sins
that I've committed.

450
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,900
But I don't know
what else I can do for you

451
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,540
besides giving you money.

452
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,180
When you were born,
I promised your mother

453
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,300
that I would do my best
to treat you well

454
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,460
and make you happy.

455
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,060
When you were young,
you kept clinging to me.

456
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,380
You would always hang on my neck

457
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,660
whenever I was studying
or entertaining officials.

458
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,700
But,

459
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,780
ever since Guqiu's passing,

460
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,780
I felt like you were
no longer close to me.

461
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,460
Whenever I returned
to the manor to visit you...

462
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,900
Grandmother,

463
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:24,790
what is this?

464
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,260
Ms. Longevity and I made these
lotus root dumplings together.

465
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,290
But we weren't good at it.

466
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,780
They became sticky after cooking.

467
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,180
Come. Let me try.

468
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,740
What do you think?

469
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,180
The lotus root dumpling paste
tastes better than the dumplings.

470
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,959
Master,

471
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,999
- why do you never go inside?
- Guys, try it.

472
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,140
Take your seats.

473
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,250
Initially, I thought

474
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,650
they would have a hard time
after leaving me.

475
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,960
But seeing how happy they look

476
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,540
made me realize

477
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,360
that I was
the extra member of the house.

478
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,460
Father,

479
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,500
I don't need your money.

480
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,060
But I hope that you can
agree to this request of mine.

481
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,860
If anyone wants to discuss marriage
with me again,

482
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,620
reject all of them.

483
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,540
Ms. Longevity.

484
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,020
You still have a long way to go.

485
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,180
Don't punish yourself
because of the foolish mistake

486
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,180
I did in the past.

487
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,920
Entrusting your life to the wrong person
is the worst punishment.

488
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,039
Moreover, I have Grandmother,
I have you, and I have my friends.

489
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,410
I own a business too.

490
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,420
And, there are many

491
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,420
magical and mysterious things
in the world

492
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,740
that are worth learning from.

493
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,980
That's the life I want to lead.

494
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,860
It's not
that I don't want to get married.

495
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,260
I just don't want
to be married to the wrong person.

496
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,740
I promise you.

497
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,300
In the future, you can decide

498
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,140
your own marriage.

499
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,460
Thank you, Father.

500
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,460
There's one more thing.

501
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,620
It's related to Wang Yingxue.

502
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,140
What's wrong with her again?

503
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,460
(Willow Alley, To Miss Wang)

504
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,980
(To Yingxue, Under the Moonlit Night)

505
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,340
Dou.

506
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,870
In the future,

507
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,590
you should hand our domestic affairs
and accounts to Ms. Longevity.

508
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,100
Right after Ming's crisis was resolved,

509
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,220
you're in a hurry
to go for the kill, huh?

510
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,620
When Wei Tingyu was reciting
his touching vows,

511
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,260
weren't you reminded of

512
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,180
the promises you made to me?

513
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,020
I still have the poems and letters

514
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,540
you wrote to me.

515
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,020
Fine.

516
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,980
Let's get to business, then.

517
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,460
Usually,

518
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,340
who takes care of the unpaid taxes

519
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,839
owed by those nobles and officials?

520
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,620
And when you can't
account for the missing records,

521
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,220
who goes door to door,
begging tirelessly?

522
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,300
It was me, Wang Yingxue.

523
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,380
Why should I hand both of them to her?

524
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,100
Do you think

525
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,420
tomorrow's sun cannot rise without you?

526
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,639
Even if I lose you,

527
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,220
I can still live normally.

528
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,100
Madam's abilities

529
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,900
are way beyond than
handling the family's accounts.

530
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,960
If not, how could she persuade
Madam Wei to agree to the marriage?

531
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,780
Even Ms. Longevity could tell.

532
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,780
Who are you still trying to deceive?

533
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,759
Lending money at a high interest
is a serious crime.

534
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,660
The Dou Family will fall
because of your crime!

535
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,420
I didn't do it.

536
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,959
I didn't!

537
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,460
She's framing me!

538
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:04,810
Gao Shen overheard

539
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,799
your conversation with
Wei Tingzhen in the room.

540
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,060
How dare you still deny it?

541
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,919
All these years,

542
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,440
you did maintain a perfect front
when it came to our accounts.

543
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,940
I thought you actually devoted
yourself to the family.

544
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,700
I never expected you to do this.

545
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,620
Let's go and see your father now.

546
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,849
Let's tell him to investigate
how his own daughter

547
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,639
is undermining him!

548
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,759
No!

549
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,439
Shiying, I know my fault now!

550
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,900
I truly know my fault now!

551
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,980
You mustn't tell my father about this!

552
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,439
No!

553
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,220
You mustn't tell anyone about this!

554
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,879
I've spent all the dirty money

555
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,820
on the Dou Family!

556
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,140
Fifth Brother knows about this!

557
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,879
Fifth Brother knows everything!

558
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,180
Dou, let's ask Fifth Brother about this!

559
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,400
Stay in the side courtyard
and reflect upon your mistakes!

560
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,820
From now on, Ms. Longevity shall
handle the household.

561
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,450
Not a single dirty coin must ever
flow into the Dou Family again.

562
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,879
(Dou's Residence)

563
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,479
- Open the door!
- Open the door!

564
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,799
- Open the door!
- Open the door!

565
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,399
- Open the door!
- Open the door for us!

566
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,249
Open the door!

567
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,299
Open the door!

568
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,389
- Open the door!
- Open the door!

569
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,220
(Orchid's Fragrance Highlights Serenity)

570
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:20,870
Open the door!

571
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,020
It's so early in the morning.

572
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,380
Where did all the quacking come from?

573
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,159
Guys, please calm down!

574
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,620
Stop fighting!

575
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:32,839
Calm down!

576
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,980
Everyone, calm down!

577
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,810
No!

578
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,919
I will absolutely not accept
the wild geese as gifts.

579
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,039
Guys, please return.

580
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,830
This is Lord Qing's
letter of recommendation.

581
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,100
I serve the crown prince, you know?

582
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,399
I, Guo Yan, am peers

583
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,150
with Seventh Master Dou
in Neo-Confucianism.

584
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,159
Fate has brought us together.

585
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,550
I've been a widower for many years.

586
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,719
Coincidentally, Fourth Young Lady Dou
is not that young as well.

587
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,820
Fourth Young Lady Dou is
at least 20 years younger than you.

588
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,620
Lord Guo, I don't think you studied
Neo-Confucianism.

589
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,140
In my opinion,

590
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,740
I think you studied
how to get yourself a young wife.

591
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,060
You!

592
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,820
I'm no match for you.

593
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,000
You're young and talented.

594
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,770
You've already
given birth to many children

595
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,159
without getting an official wife.

596
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,130
What do you mean by that?

597
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,039
So what?

598
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,079
What did you say?

599
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,999
To hell with you!

600
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,780
- So what?
- How dare you hit me?

601
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,199
I'll kill you!

602
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,340
It's you!

603
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,319
Master,

604
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,580
Lord Liang is paying us a visit.

605
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,260
Hurry and invite him.

606
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,719
Everyone, I have to handle
the Ministry of Revenue's affairs.

607
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,729
Lord Liang is looking for me.

608
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,310
I'm sure he has something important
to discuss.

609
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:34,999
Farewell.

610
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,140
Sorry about this.

611
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,790
- Lord Dou, take the proposal!
- Lord Dou, take the proposal!

612
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,220
It's all your fault!

613
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,580
Lord Liang.

614
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,820
Shiying.

615
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,199
It's about time for my fourth son

616
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,420
to get married.

617
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,660
You...

618
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,479
This is bad.

619
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,020
I'm afraid I'm having a headache again.

620
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,660
Farewell.

621
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,900
Farewell.

622
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,380
Here.

623
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,060
Bear with it.

624
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,860
It's fine.

625
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,240
It doesn't hurt.

626
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,740
I feel much better now.

627
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,610
Master, all those geese are
still in the courtyard.

628
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,660
How should we deal with them?

629
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,710
Throw them outside.

630
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,140
I panic when I think about

631
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,460
all those livestock.

632
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,820
It'll be humiliating
if you throw them away.

633
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,140
You should return them
back at night sneakily.

634
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,380
All right.

635
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,890
Since the substitution marriage
had happened,

636
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,479
they came to the Dou Family

637
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,140
to take advantage of the situation.

638
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,189
Why should we show them any respect?

639
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,820
They're crooks.

640
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,820
There's no need to be angry at them.

641
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,980
Initially, I've made you some goose soup

642
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,020
to help relieve heatiness.

643
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,319
But when I think about the fact

644
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,660
that the goose
has a sharp beak and wings,

645
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,559
I think I should order the kitchen

646
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,559
to make something else.

647
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,559
Don't.

648
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,340
Ms. Longevity, it'll definitely work
since you made it.

649
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,199
Did you scald your tongue?

650
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,460
I'm fine.

651
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,220
It's delicious.

652
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,590
This time, you don't need to worry.

653
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,799
I'll send every single one of them back

654
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,580
even if there are 100 geese
in the residence.

655
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,980
Drink it slowly.

656
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,279
Master,

657
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,140
Earl of Haichang is here to ask
for Fourth Young Lady's hand.

658
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,140
Earl of Haichang?

659
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,460
You mean the one who has
slept 3,000 prostitutes in the Capital?

660
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,639
He's killing me!

661
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,430
- Don't run! I'll kill you!
- He's beating me up!

662
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,119
- Master!
- I'll beat you to death!

663
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,239
- I'll beat you to death!
- Master!

664
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,359
Master, calm down!

665
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,679
Master, don't be angry!

666
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,990
- Please be appeased!
- Go away!

667
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,010
You scum!

668
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,239
How dare you ask for her hand?

669
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,999
Do you think my residence is a brothel?

670
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,050
Seventh Master Dou,
what has gotten into you?

671
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,559
Since no one wants
Fourth Young Lady,

672
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,550
I'm willing to marry her!

673
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,639
I'm doing you a favor.

674
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,639
You shameless scum!

675
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,719
I'll beat you to death!

676
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,779
- Help!
- Master!

677
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,999
- I'll beat you to death!
- What's with the ruckus?

678
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,960
- Stop right there!
- Master, please be appeased!

679
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,999
Seventh Master Dou is beating me!

680
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,140
Stop running!

681
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,660
- Master!
- He's beating me!

682
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,420
- Hurry!
- Master!

683
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,620
What has gotten into you?

684
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,170
Scaring him is fine.

685
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,479
Earl of Haichang comes from
a family of nobles, you know?

686
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,039
How could you hit him for real?

687
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,180
All those shameless scums
are trying to marry Ms. Longevity.

688
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,260
They deserved the beating.

689
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,580
You...

690
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,180
Father, you were implicated
because of me.

691
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,190
You think that you're free
after withdrawing from the marriage.

692
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,540
We arrange a marriage for you

693
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,100
so that we can at least protect you.

694
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,900
You'll know how terrifying it is

695
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,780
when outsiders plot against you.

696
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,500
Forget it.

697
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,790
You missed Grandmother, right?

698
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,980
You can return to the manor
and lay low for the moment.

699
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:09,060
Let the Dou's Residence
have some peace and quiet for now.

700
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,100
Understood.

701
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,079
Earl of Guangen? Earl of Changyu?

702
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,639
They're a bunch of scums.

703
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,079
They're even worse than Wei Tingyu.

704
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,400
Everyone in Zhending Market
knows who I am.

705
00:34:19,410 --> 00:34:20,639
How dare they bully my sister?

706
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,660
I'll slaughter them
with my men tomorrow.

707
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,100
Your fifth uncle is also a lord now.

708
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,260
But he has to chase you away
to make peace with them.

709
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,060
It's good that he's chasing me away.

710
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,460
It's best that he doesn't call me
to return ever again.

711
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,540
Times have changed.

712
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,380
The Dou Family
is the new favorite in the court.

713
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,540
Now that I look at it,
your fifth uncle might be

714
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,740
the next Grand Secretary.

715
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,260
All those officials he wanted
to butter up in the past

716
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,300
have the same rank as him now.

717
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,460
Now, they're trying
to butter him up instead.

718
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,100
Fifth Uncle has power
while Father has money.

719
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,460
And, a substitution marriage
has occurred.

720
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,300
To outsiders,

721
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,340
I'm a huge bargain up for grabs.

722
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,980
Shiying has finally done
something heroic this time.

723
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,559
When you look at the smaller picture,

724
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,340
it's just a marriage.

725
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,319
But when you look at the bigger picture,

726
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,780
it's a case of the Dou Family choosing
between the crown prince and Lord Qing.

727
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,039
Now, everyone in the imperial court

728
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,460
will make their choice
based on our choice.

729
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,439
Maybe His Majesty

730
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,580
is also waiting to see our stand.

731
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,860
If so, we won't choose any of them.

732
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,180
It's good to take a step back.

733
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,500
It's better to act
after understanding the situation.

734
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,460
You guys are discussing the marriage
as if it's war.

735
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,679
If His Majesty is that free,
we can do another substitution marriage.

736
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,080
I'll go on Ms. Longevity's behalf.

737
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,839
Grandmother,

738
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,679
the raisins are sweet.

739
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,820
You should try them.

740
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,559
It's sweet, right?

741
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,239
- (Grandmother is healthy and happy.)
- Try this.

742
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,399
Try this.

743
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,580
(Everything is developing
in a good direction.)

744
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,699
Young Lady, Old Madam,

745
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,860
here's the tofu pudding.

746
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,820
Tofu pudding?

747
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,620
It tastes like Lin's tofu pudding.

748
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,180
And, it's still warm.

749
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,500
Lin's?

750
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,039
I thought they were
located in the Capital.

751
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,300
Where did they come from?

752
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,260
Lu Ming delivered them to us.

753
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,580
(Tea)

754
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,999
Why are we practicing
how to make tofu pudding every day?

755
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,030
Cut the crap.

756
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,159
Our lord said that one must travel
1,000 li with the tofu pudding intact

757
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,970
if they wish to achieve
mastery in equestrian.

758
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,559
Practicing our next move is key.

759
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,700
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

760
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,439
Your Lordship,

761
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,279
should we finish

762
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,420
the tofu puddings that are still intact?

763
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,879
What are you saying?

764
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,660
You guys can have the shattered ones.

765
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,820
Deliver the intact ones to the manor.

766
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,199
Amazing.

767
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,740
You're killing two birds with one stone.

768
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,439
Lu Ming delivered them to us?
Doesn't that mean

769
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,020
they're from His Lordship?

770
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,039
It's sweet, right?

771
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,519
Mine is salty.

772
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,239
Even so, it tastes sweet.

773
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,620
Eat up.

774
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,039
Even if it tastes salty,

775
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,420
it's sweet in the heart.

776
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,460
What flower is this?

777
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:29,500
Fourth Young Lady,
why do you cherish it this much?

778
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,340
I believe
that it can grow well independently.

779
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,060
But I also believe

780
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,580
that it can grow better

781
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,980
with love and support.

782
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,580
Ms. Longevity.

783
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,540
Are you tending
to the plants by yourself?

784
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,020
Grandmother.

785
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,180
Ms. Longevity.

786
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,799
If I were to stroll around

787
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,220
the courtyard alone,

788
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,420
I would also think about

789
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,020
the person who plays the tune at night.

790
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,780
Grandmother,

791
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,260
what are you saying?

792
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,039
I'm talking about

793
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,260
the person on your mind right now.

794
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,060
Let me ask you something.

795
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,140
What was on your mind when Song Mo

796
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,980
delivered the imperial decree to you?

797
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,600
Grandmother, how did you know
that Song Mo delivered that to me?

798
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,679
Do you think I'm ignorant just because

799
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,340
I'm living at the manor?

800
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:37,680
I have my own spies
in the Capital's Western Dou Family.

801
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,020
Who are they?

802
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,900
Don't shift the topic.

803
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,879
Tell me

804
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,460
what was on your mind.

805
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,860
At first, when I heard it from him,

806
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,660
I was shocked.

807
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,060
I found it absolutely unbelievable.

808
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,660
He and I were strangers,

809
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,980
yet he did so much for me.

810
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,860
I don't know how to repay him.

811
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,340
You see, he begged His Majesty
for an imperial decree

812
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,480
not for his own sake.

813
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,720
He did it for your sake.

814
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,640
He could've begged His Majesty
to grant him a marriage with you.

815
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,039
However, he only begged His Majesty

816
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,990
to grant you freedom
to decide your own marriage.

817
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:25,860
I can see that he's sincere toward you.

818
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,780
I can rest at ease

819
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,220
now that a person like him
is watching over you.

820
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,060
(Qianqing Palace)

821
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,140
An insignificant marriage

822
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,700
is actually stirring up a storm here.

823
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,300
I've already given her
an imperial decree.

824
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:53,580
Could it be that none of the men
in the Capital is good enough for her?

825
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,220
Your Majesty,

826
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,860
I've already promised my daughter

827
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:59,800
that I would never interfere
with her marriage.

828
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,620
Fine.

829
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,580
Return to your residence
and make your choice.

830
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,100
Don't return to the Ministry of Revenue
until you're done.

831
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,100
Thank you, Your Majesty.

832
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,419
Take a look!

833
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,559
Take a look!

834
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,140
Fresh vegetables for sale!

835
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,500
Lord Dou,

836
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,060
are you okay?

837
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,540
(This is strange.)

838
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,470
(He's actually sending me
back to my residence?)

839
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,690
(My sworn enemy is helping me out now?)

840
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,460
(What exactly is he up to?)

841
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,159
(My goodness.)

842
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,590
(Before this, I reprimanded
the Dou Family for being devious.)

843
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,700
(But now, I'm the devious one.)

844
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,260
(How can I change my image?)

845
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,380
It seems like an explosion occurred
at a firecracker field on the outskirts.

846
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,980
- Song Mo!
- Fourth Young Lady!

847
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,799
Song Mo, I like you.

848
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,360
I fear that I might lose you.

849
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:05,919
You fear the seven reasons for divorce.

850
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,890
Therefore, I'll write
the seven promises for you.

851
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,569
I will respect all of your decisions
and ensure your safety.
