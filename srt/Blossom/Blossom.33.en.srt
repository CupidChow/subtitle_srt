1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,680
I will confess! I will!

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,310
It's Second Young Master.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,200
He's been sending someone
to hunt me down

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,520
because...

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,550
Because of Mr. Anping.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,870
That day, at Drunken Bordello...

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,590
Han.

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,030
Han, look. Someone beat me.

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,070
Call a few men to go with me
and avenge me.

10
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,270
Let's go.

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,150
You...

12
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,840
Why?

13
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,180
- Take care of it.
- Yes.

14
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,840
I've failed you, Your Highness.

15
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,990
I've failed Mr. Anping.

16
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,659
I was terrified
of being hunted by him,

17
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,880
so I had to hide among the refugees.

18
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,280
You're frightening me.

19
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,950
Where were you

20
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,400
tonight?

21
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,790
I...

22
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,350
Do you know

23
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,280
where I went

24
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,910
and what I saw tonight?

25
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,070
How am I supposed to know?

26
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,720
I searched through the entire capital

27
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,000
to find this necklace.

28
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,480
Today is your first birthday

29
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,670
after our wedding.

30
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,000
I didn't know today

31
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,510
was my birthday.

32
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:31,929
When I saw this necklace,

33
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,390
I thought it was perfect for you.

34
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,320
Do you like it?

35
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,630
I do.

36
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,440
What's wrong?

37
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,000
Did I

38
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,950
do anything wrong again?

39
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,560
No.

40
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,350
It's because

41
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,560
only Zhao celebrated my birthday
back then.

42
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,400
From now on,

43
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,220
I'll celebrate your birthday with you

44
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,390
every year,

45
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,550
all right?

46
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,910
Sure.

47
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,310
Muyu,

48
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,710
is there anything

49
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,440
you're hiding from me?

50
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,320
I've done many things wrong

51
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,510
and I've hurt you.

52
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,760
If you could mend your ways,

53
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,630
would you do it for me?

54
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,359

(Natural Grace and Talent)

57
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,020
Your Majesty,
you just regained your consciousness.

58
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,470
Please take this pill.

59
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,390
Where's Official Lu?

60
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,710
Official Lu failed his duty and has
requested to return to his hometown.

61
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,649
The Taoist I invited

62
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,510
was recommended by him.

63
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,019
Besides, Wang Yuan waits on you
day and night.

64
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,000
You will recover soon.

65
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,830
This is strange.

66
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:02,150
Official Lu always advised me

67
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,920
to quit taking pills and cultivation.

68
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,560
Why would he recommend a Taoist?

69
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,440
If Wang Yuan has been waiting on me,

70
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,560
who's overseeing the Directorate
of the Credentials then?

71
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,150
Was it Wang Ge?

72
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,760
Your Majesty,

73
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,289
please don't trouble yourself
with such trivial matters.

74
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,000
Your health is important.

75
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,200
Your smile reminds me

76
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,590
of when you first entered the palace.

77
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,520
Back then,

78
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,680
we often stayed up all night
discussing state affairs.

79
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,750
Sometimes, I would grow tired,

80
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:54,680
but you were still all smiles.

81
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,440
As bright as the morning sun.

82
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,160
I was ignorant back then.

83
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,280
I entrusted Youting to the late Empress

84
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,070
and sent him over to his fief early.

85
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,590
That's unfair to you.

86
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,520
Speak freely

87
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,070
if you have any resentment.

88
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,619
Your Majesty,

89
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,870
maybe you should rest for tonight.

90
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,230
It's already midnight.

91
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,800
His Majesty has been
feeling unwell recently.

92
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,230
If I slack off and delay the operations
of the Six Departments,

93
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,520
problems might arise.

94
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,680
Has His Majesty retired for the night?

95
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,880
Not yet.

96
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,040
His Majesty is coughing severely.

97
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,500
(Natural Grace and Talent)

98
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,940
(Yuxi Palace)

99
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,830
After my passing,

100
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,160
this will be the last decree.

101
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,160
The Empress is to be buried with me

102
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,640
to prevent the harem's involvement
in politics.

103
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,990
Before I entered the palace,

104
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,680
I once disguised myself as a man

105
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,560
to attend the imperial exam.

106
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,569
My parents caught me

107
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,040
and punished me.

108
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,710
They said women should never
interfere in state affairs.

109
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,590
But you never criticized me.

110
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:50,710
Instead, you praised my talent,

111
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,680
taught me how to manage state affairs,

112
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,560
and rewarded me with countless honors.

113
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,760
If someone has to be blamed,

114
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,680
blame me for my greed for power
and overstepping my bounds.

115
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,920
How could I ever do that?

116
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,830
Over the years,

117
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,160
I've been fortunate to have you.

118
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,979
I'm truly grateful to you.

119
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,710
I can't handle
all the internal and external affairs

120
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,470
by myself.

121
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,870
For the nation,

122
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,870
please take this pill

123
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,219
and recover soon.

124
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,069
This is absurd.

125
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,219
Father has just woken up.

126
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,990
As his son, can't I even visit him?

127
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,979
Your Majesty.

128
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,280
Your Majesty,

129
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,139
I couldn't stop the Crown Prince
and Official Liang.

130
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,379
I accept any punishment.

131
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,680
I may be your subject,

132
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,520
but above all, I'm your son.

133
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,350
You've finally awakened

134
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,709
after so long.

135
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,929
For any reason,

136
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,980
I should stay with my own father.

137
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,440
If you wish to punish me,

138
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,440
I accept it.

139
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,640
But if this ever happens again,

140
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,280
I'd do the same.

141
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,280
Youcheng,

142
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,750
you've finally behaved like an heir.

143
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,870
Official Liang,

144
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,320
you risked your life to come here.

145
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,520
State your urgent matter.

146
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,400
What I wish to propose concerns

147
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,899
about this year's
ancestral worship ceremony

148
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,470
prepared by the Ministry of Rites.

149
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,320
Given your frail condition,

150
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,739
such a long journey is inadvisable.

151
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,470
I'm deeply concerned.

152
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:48,870
However, the ancestral worship ceremony
is of national significance.

153
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,350
Therefore, I venture
to request your permission

154
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,950
for the Crown Prince to attend
in your place.

155
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,940
The rain appears

156
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,940
as a godsend.

157
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,070
Granted.

158
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,350
Father,

159
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,169
I should remain by your side

160
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,339
to take care of you.

161
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,880
The Crown Prince is indeed considerate.

162
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,099
Perhaps the ceremony

163
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,979
could be postponed.

164
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,400
I have Official Liang
and the rest with me.

165
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,110
No need to worry so much.

166
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,110
This is a decree,

167
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,160
not a negotiation.

168
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,710
I accept your decree, Father.

169
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,800
Wise decision, Your Majesty.

170
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,440
Let Gu Yu tag along.

171
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,970
He was just promoted to
Senior Commandant-in-Chief of Cavalry.

172
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,529
He can lead some men

173
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,040
to escort the Crown Prince.

174
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,680
Consider it

175
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,440
a small favor for my family

176
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,350
and a convenience for him
to rise in rank later.

177
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,350
Since you've said so,

178
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,350
I'll grant my permission.

179
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,200
I shall thank you on Gu Yu's behalf.

180
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,990
His Majesty and Liang Jifang
put on quite a display

181
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,120
to have the Crown Prince
lead the ancestral ceremony.

182
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,990
It's obvious that they intend for him
to inherit the throne.

183
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,560
I assign you to lead a troop
to the ceremony

184
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:18,360
is to give you a chance to earn
the first merit under the new Emperor.

185
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,240
Yu,

186
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,070
I've treated you well all these years.

187
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,830
It's time to grow up.

188
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,110
I understand what you mean, Aunt.

189
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,120
Aunt,

190
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,640
could you please spare Yantang?

191
00:14:49,837 --> 00:14:51,800
If you accomplish
this task successfully,

192
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,710
the new reign will be stable,

193
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:57,110
and Song Mo won't have to die.

194
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,990
Not just that,

195
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,710
you can marry any woman you like

196
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,950
and ask for any title you want.

197
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,440
I will grant you all.

198
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,280
Understood.

199
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,259
Besides, for the sake of the nation,

200
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,800
don't allow Youting to enter the capital
for the funeral.

201
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,659
If Liaodong shows a sign
of unusual movement,

202
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,350
secretly instruct the Duke of Ding

203
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,760
to quell the chaos
under the name of suppressing rebellion.

204
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,880
Your Majesty.

205
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,110
From the very beginning,

206
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,800
you all have been forcing me.

207
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,750
Your archery skills are no longer
inferior to Song Mo's.

208
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,520
On the fifteenth day,

209
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,350
you will command all the troops
from Chengtian Gate to Zhiyang Gate.

210
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,440
Once the time comes,

211
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,160
open the Daming Gate.

212
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,550
A coup?

213
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,099
My head could roll.

214
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,680
I need to get what I deserve.

215
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,480
I'm not done yet.

216
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,350
Your Princess Anyu

217
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,160
grew up together with Dou Zhao.

218
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,470
To achieve great things,

219
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,069
you have to be ruthless,

220
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,470
especially when you've
sought my refugee.

221
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,150
Learn from your father's mistake.

222
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:36,830
Among twenty-six units in the capital,

223
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,640
apart from the Imperial Guard,

224
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,289
for the rest who are in power

225
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,350
to stay out of it on that day,

226
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,800
just how much effort and money
it will take.

227
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,920
Can you afford that, Your Highness?

228
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,680
Without the Miao family,

229
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,160
I can't do anything.

230
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,809
It's fine if you don't want to kill her.

231
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,750
I really disapprove

232
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,200
of your tone.

233
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,920
Whether you like it or not,

234
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,520
I don't care.

235
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,449
If you want
the entire Soaring Steed Guard

236
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,840
to act according to your plan,

237
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,310
you need to understand

238
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,310
that it's not me
seeking refuge with you,

239
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:20,030
it's you who needs me instead.

240
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,920
I can kill you if I want.

241
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,440
A dead man can't work with you.

242
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,470
I need to obtain what I deserve.

243
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:43,870
Very well.

244
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,810
You have guts and spirits.

245
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:49,120
My plan will definitely succeed.

246
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,000
Come.

247
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,929
(Map)

248
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,470
Pick any land you want.

249
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,840
You'll be the first non-royal lord
of the new reign.

250
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:06,920
You're wise, Your Highness.

251
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,270
I'll send her
out of the capital immediately

252
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,680
so that you can rest assured.

253
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,550
This hairpin fits you beautifully.

254
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,249
Muyu, there's something
I want to discuss with you.

255
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,390
What's it?

256
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,990
Father and Mother have been upset.

257
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,640
They want to take my brother's
memorial tablet back to our hometown

258
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,600
and enshrine it at a temple
for praying.

259
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,200
I'd like to accompany them to Futing.

260
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,030
As long as you're back
after Lantern Festival.

261
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,440
That's when every family
gathers together.

262
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,920
I don't want you to be alone.

263
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,030
If we're deeply in love,

264
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,270
being apart for a few days is nothing.

265
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,310
I don't want you to get tired

266
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,750
from the journey.

267
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,520
All right.

268
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,960
As you say.

269
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,570
Yantang.

270
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,520
Yantang.

271
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,200
Su Xin, Su Lan.

272
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:28,819
Madam.

273
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,709
Madam.

274
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,950
Where's Yantang?

275
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,230
Master loses all his senses
when the poison flares up

276
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,579
and might accidentally hurt you.

277
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,409
You can give him the medicine
when he's sober.

278
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,919
His pulse shows a worsening sign.

279
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,479
If he doesn't take the medicine,

280
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,980
the poison could be beyond control.

281
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,039
Uh...

282
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,580
Tell me where he is now.

283
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,300
Master locked himself in the bathhouse.

284
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,890
He won't answer the door.

285
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,770
Madam.

286
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,359
Madam.

287
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,500
- Madam.
- Madam.

288
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,300
Yantang.

289
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,100
Yantang.

290
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,020
Yantang.

291
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,119
Madam.

292
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,100
Master has been inside for long.

293
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,900
Leave us for now.

294
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,420
- Yes, Madam.
- Yes, Madam.

295
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,980
Yantang.

296
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,559
Ms. Longevity,

297
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,740
don't come in.

298
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,540
I'm all right now.

299
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,060
I just

300
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,980
don't want you to see me now.

301
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,580
You are my husband.

302
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,740
Even if your hair turns all white,
I won't fear you either.

303
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,740
Even so,

304
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,279
I wish to leave a perfect image

305
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,799
to you.

306
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,940
Yantang,

307
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,020
I've concocted a new remedy.

308
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,639
It will slow down the poison inside you.

309
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,759
Open the door now.

310
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,700
The previous remedy took effect.

311
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,980
Now I feel...

312
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,020
Yantang.

313
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,060
Yantang.

314
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,180
Yantang.

315
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,500
Here. Take the medicine.

316
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,060
Yantang.

317
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,740
I'm Ms. Longevity.

318
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,580
Yantang.

319
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,900
Yantang.

320
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,079
Yantang.

321
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,660
Yantang, wake up.

322
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,700
Hurry and take the medicine.

323
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,060
Ms. Longevity.

324
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,700
I can't control myself right now.

325
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,220
I might hurt you.

326
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,780
(Rest in the Flow,
Clarity in the Stones)

327
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,260
Yantang,

328
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,420
we've long been bound as one.

329
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,620
Ansu,

330
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,140
read this on the way.

331
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,879
(Shantong, Hanzhou, Yuzhou, Heguan,
Kangnan, Futing)

332
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,020
Pick a place you like the most.

333
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,900
Tell me later.

334
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,260
What's this for?

335
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,100
It wouldn't be a surprise if I tell.

336
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,540
I'll write to you.

337
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,940
Together with my good news.

338
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,060
(Yongding Gate)

339
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,799
(Rest in the Flow,
Clarity in the Stones)

340
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,380
Do you remember

341
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,100
the rainy night when we first met?

342
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,700
Rainy rain, estate.

343
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,500
You wanted to kill me

344
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,719
when we first met.

345
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,140
(Loyal)

346
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,199
You were composed

347
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,519
and calm.

348
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,300
I almost lost my composure,

349
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,700
but I pretended to stay calm

350
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,580
so that the guards wouldn't notice.

351
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,170
Really?

352
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,959
I was truly anxious inside,

353
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,500
but I kept pretending.

354
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,079
Your eyes were aggressive.

355
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,860
They could scare anyone away.

356
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,650
But I felt

357
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:12,740
as if we were friends for years.

358
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,740
Aside from fear,

359
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,020
your eyes showed anticipation.

360
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,980
If I told you

361
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,020
that I once dreamed

362
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,550
of us experiencing life
and death together,

363
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,180
would you believe me?

364
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,740
I would.

365
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,599
And I hope

366
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,060
we can stay together

367
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,900
in many lives to come.

368
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,419
Don't be cheesy.

369
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,020
You're turning my words into a joke.

370
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,660
It's not a joke.

371
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,860
I'm grateful for that rainy night

372
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,380
for bringing you to me.

373
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,820
When the magnolia blooms,

374
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,519
let's travel to see
famous rivers and seas

375
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,380
and admire spring bloom
and autumn moon.

376
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,580
What do you say?

377
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,460
There's no need to wait.

378
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,500
You've already given me spring.

379
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,519
(Diecui Pavilion)

380
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,980
Madam, Master,

381
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,140
Her Majesty's court lady came
with a decree.

382
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,439
By Her Majesty's decree,

383
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,740
you're invited
to the palace banquet, Madam.

384
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,340
Your Highness.

385
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,700
Earl of Yunyang,

386
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,820
you're tight with Song Mo and his wife.

387
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,980
I thought you would choose
the side of the greater cause.

388
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,239
After all, she's my aunt.

389
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,380
Blood is thicker than water.

390
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,500
Also, I need to leave myself a way out.

391
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,580
Your Highness, you have to stop here.

392
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,020
(Melody of Bamboo and Pines)

393
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,060
They actually fought?

394
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,519
The Duke of Ying's poison flared up.

395
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,420
They fought from the bathhouse
all the way outside and smashed everything.

396
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,780
Their faces looked pale, their breathing
was rapid and their hands were trembling.

397
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,519
But they don't seem to be injured.

398
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,780
It's more like sick.

399
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,020
Whether true or not,

400
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,100
I'll explain this to His Highness.

401
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,220
Keep a close watch on Yizhi Hall.

402
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,580
Report to me once anything happens.

403
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,260
Yes.

404
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,380
Father has barely been awake,

405
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,100
and everything has become complicated.

406
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,660
Father refuses to take the pill,

407
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,980
so Mother changes the incense

408
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,540
to put Father to sleep.

409
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,060
In case anything happens,

410
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,620
no external officials are allowed
to enter Xihua Gate.

411
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,300
Her Majesty merely relies on a Taoist.

412
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,060
I'm afraid something could go wrong.

413
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,700
I'd like to trouble you
by making a trip there, sir.

414
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,380
Before the Lantern Festival,

415
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,340
no mistakes can be afforded.

416
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,700
If the Crown Prince returns now,

417
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,199
he'll surely ascend to the throne.

418
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,500
Song Mo and his wife are scheming.

419
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,960
They pose a threat.

420
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,780
A big threat, indeed.

421
00:29:03,773 --> 00:29:05,558
News from Shadow Guards reports

422
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,380
that Dou Zhao and he had a fight
at Zhiyi Hall.

423
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,399
The entire yard was in a mess.

424
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,559
Song Mo is now too ill

425
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,140
to care about court affairs.

426
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,060
The coup is now or never.

427
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,140
(Xuanyue Palace)

428
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,660
What's the situation at Yuxi Palace?

429
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,180
Lord Qing is concerned about it.

430
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,479
He had Official Ji enter the palace

431
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,260
to check His Majesty's pulse
and perform acupuncture.

432
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,990
Those from the Imperial Medical Bureau
daren't disclose anything.

433
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,900
But I have to be frank with you.

434
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,720
If His Majesty's condition
doesn't improve,

435
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:58,060
I'm afraid he won't last
until the next spring.

436
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,740
All of them

437
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,900
are ready.

438
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,180
The Western craftmanship

439
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,940
are indeed unique.

440
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,740
Why hasn't the Duchess of Ying
shown up yet?

441
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,159
A few concubines and I

442
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,780
found a new business

443
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,620
and are hoping to seek her advice.

444
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,199
Madam Mu,

445
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,900
you have to be cautious.

446
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,719
Two women from the Dou family

447
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,519
ruined my son

448
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,799
and brought great harm
to the Duke of Ying's family.

449
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,980
She's such a jinx.

450
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,660
The Dou family is down and out now.

451
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,439
She's to blame.

452
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,420
I guess she's now riding
a mule carriage here.

453
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,140
Madam Wei, don't look down on her.

454
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,199
Can you guess who sent
these exotic gifts

455
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,260
to Her Majesty?

456
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,220
Don't tell me it's that jinxed woman.

457
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,220
Looks like the donkey carriage
isn't that slow.

458
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,199
But the donkey in the stable

459
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,399
sure is loud.

460
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,639
I can hear it from outside.

461
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,820
Who are you calling a donkey?

462
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,960
- Who's the donkey yelling at?
-The donkey is yelling at you.

463
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,700
- You!
- Here comes Her Majesty.

464
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,540
Greetings, Her Majesty.

465
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,559
Greetings, Her Majesty.

466
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,820
Greetings, Her Majesty.

467
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,759
Tonight is a family banquet,

468
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,220
so please do away with formalities.

469
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,460
Please be seated.

470
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,199
These exotic gifts

471
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,460
intrigue me.

472
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,740
Speaking of which,

473
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,300
the Duchess of Ying is so thoughtful.

474
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,420
It's really the Duchess of Ying.

475
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,839
I heard she also

476
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,780
prepared a unique performance.

477
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,900
What a beautiful dance.

478
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,540
These ladies are dancing so excellently.

479
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,260
They are all talents.

480
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,900
Not really.

481
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,560
They just each have their own interest.

482
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,599
They acquired those skills
to make a living

483
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,839
and not rely on their families

484
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,180
or men.

485
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,540
We've been awaiting you, Your Highness.

486
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,060
Take Qianqing Palace down
as quickly as possible.

487
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,020
Once the sky brightens,

488
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,460
I'm going to hold the imperial seal
and command the country.

489
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,940
Tonight,

490
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,600
we'll eradicate bad influences
around the Emperor

491
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,100
and reestablish the court.

492
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,519
Bravo!

493
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,540
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

494
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,559
I've prepared

495
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,220
a century-old floral brew for you.

496
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,300
Allow me to make a wish.

497
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,199
From this day forward,

498
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,740
this land

499
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,740
will usher in new changes.

500
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,020
What does this mean?

501
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,380
There are rebels emerging
in the palace tonight.

502
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,140
Lord Qing is currently eliminating them.

503
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,359
For your safety,

504
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,580
Xuanyue Hall has to be sealed.

505
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,820
Dou Zhao,

506
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,980
stop waiting.

507
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,020
No one is coming to your aid.

508
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,860
Of course.

509
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,079
So you've known all along

510
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,620
that I'd take action
against the ladies tonight.

511
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,660
You used the harem
to control the Imperial Medical Bureau

512
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,839
and to keep His Majesty bedridden

513
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,140
so that he's unable to govern.

514
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,719
All you've been waiting for

515
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,220
is to join hands with Lord Qing tonight.

516
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,839
And Eunuch Wang
can falsely accuse anyone

517
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,500
of being a rebel,

518
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,359
for instance,

519
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,420
Wang Yuan, the godfather
he has served for years.

520
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,239
Hence, Lord Qing's men

521
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,580
have a rightful reason
to eliminate other officials.

522
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,839
You've confined us womenfolk

523
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,580
in Xuanyue Hall.

524
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,100
Naturally, the external court officials
will be restrained.

525
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,799
Not only can Lord Qing enter
the palace unopposed,

526
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,430
but he will also earn praise

527
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,860
for quelling treason
and protecting the Emperor tomorrow.

528
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,540
By then,
whether His Majesty lives or dies,

529
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,100
the throne

530
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,820
will fall into Lord Qing's hands.

531
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,599
What should we do now?

532
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,300
Are they committing treason?

533
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,639
Dou Zhao,

534
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,759
you're insane.

535
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,100
Aren't you afraid of being killed?

536
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,940
Don't panic, madams.

537
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,660
Her Majesty only holds us as hostages.

538
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,300
She won't harm our lives.

539
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,460
If something were to happen to us,

540
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,900
the officials wouldn't
let Lord Qing rest easy,

541
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,540
not even if he ascended to the throne.

542
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,260
I don't mind killing one or two.

543
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,460
Dou Zhao,

544
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,380
I'll start with you.

545
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,660
Don't move.

546
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,140
Su Yan, you...

547
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,420
Madams, run now.

548
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,799
Now!

549
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,919
Stay still.

550
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,940
Whoever defies me,
their families will be executed.

551
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,940
Protect Her Majesty. Hurry!

552
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,940
Stay still.

553
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,060
If you come any close, I'll kill her.

554
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,380
You prepared those lanterns.

555
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,580
Your hands have even reached
the Ministry of Work.

556
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,780
When you summoned me to the palace
to hold me hostage,

557
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,220
did it never occur to you

558
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,719
that I might fight back?

559
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,799
Don't come near.

560
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,940
Move.

561
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,900
Quick.

562
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,420
Stay back.

563
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,620
Surrender.

564
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,380
It's pointless for you to do this.

565
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,140
Without Song Mo,

566
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,100
what change can you make?

567
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,740
Song Mo?

568
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,780
Su Yan.

569
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,140
Dou Zhao, run!

570
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,639
Now!

571
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,700
Protect my mother and brother.

572
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,900
Go now!

573
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,140
Surrender peacefully.

574
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,860
You won't escape.

575
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,140
Madam!

576
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,900
- Madam!
- You're here.

577
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,140
Madam, Lord Qing led a large troop

578
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,860
and breached the Shuntian Gate.

579
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,740
You came all the way to meet your death.

580
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,980
Very well.

581
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,260
Today,

582
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:33,180
I'll send you all to meet Jiang Meisun.

583
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,679
- Guards!
- Yes.

584
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,140
Execute impertinent assassins

585
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,860
immediately.

586
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,500
Chen Jia, are you rebelling?

587
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,079
I've wanted to kill him for a long time.

588
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,260
Kill me if you want credits.

589
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,279
You!

590
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,820
Who's rebelling tonight?

591
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,100
Haven't you figured it out yet?

592
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,180
Wang Ge colluded with Lord Qing
to usurp the throne.

593
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,980
To whom do the Shadow Guards
pledge their loyalty,

594
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,060
the Emperor or the traitor?

595
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,420
This is impossible.

596
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,740
Don't listen to this madwoman.

597
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,860
Men,

598
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,300
the people see us as eunuch's lackeys,

599
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,359
and those dignitaries treat us

600
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,159
as killing tools and scapegoats.

601
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,940
Haven't you had enough?

602
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,340
I've had enough of all this!

603
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,180
- Officer Chen.
- Officer Chen.

604
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,780
- We'll follow you.
- We'll follow you.

605
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,620
You all could tell right from wrong
and stand up for justice.

606
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,900
His Majesty will reward you.

607
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,940
If the evil really gains power tonight,

608
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,340
I, Dou Zhao,

609
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,140
will take all the blame.

610
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,620
Chen Jia,

611
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,220
Zhao Liangbi and you
will take the remaining Shadow Guards

612
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,799
and those from Zhaowen Bookstore

613
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,140
to guard the Chengtian Gate

614
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,479
to stop Lord Qing and Song Han.

615
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,359
Yes.

616
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,500
Yes.

617
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,980
To repay the ruler's grace and favor,

618
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,980
I'm willing to wield my sword
to defend the Emperor to death!

619
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,660
To defend the Emperor to death!

620
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,540
He's here.

621
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,479
Bring the token of the Ding Army along.

622
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,620
Before the Lantern Festival,

623
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,500
secretly command all Ding Army
to enter the capital by boat.

624
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,500
Song Mo?

625
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,060
Isn't he poisoned?

626
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,140
This mere Ding Army

627
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,420
is trying to turn the table?

628
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,679
In your dreams!

629
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,359
Ding Army, hear my command!

630
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,500
At your service!

631
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,140
Avenge

632
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,359
the Marshal!

633
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:21,479
Kill!

634
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:27,380
Kill!

635
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,060
Release.

636
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,580
- Formations.
- Yes.

637
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:19,959
Master,

638
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,100
we've arrived.

639
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,140
Wang Ge can't be trusted anymore.

640
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,660
Mother...

641
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,020
- Guards!
- Yes.

642
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,679
Deploy all the reserve troops!

643
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,820
Yes.

644
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,820
They outnumber us,

645
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,319
but don't panic.

646
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,550
We'll fight and retreat slowly.

647
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,620
Kill!

648
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,460
A fish in a barrel.

649
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:07,479
His Majesty

650
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,540
is sinking fast.

651
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,719
Quell the rebels and protect the nation!

652
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,159
It's now or never.

653
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,780
