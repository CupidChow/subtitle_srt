1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,080
By the Emperor's command,
it is hereby decreed

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,180
that the Minister of War, Wang Xingyi,
failed in his duties and caused harm.

3
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,779
His position as Grand Secretary
of the Wen Yuan Pavilion is revoked.

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,390
He is demoted to Police Chief

5
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:23,610
of the Shengtian Prefecture
Police Office.

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,060
His daughter, Wang Yingxue,
is guilty of murder.

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,599
(Fangfei Pavilion)
She should've been executed immediately.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,239
But considering she has fallen ill
with madness,

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,060
she is permitted to take her own life
within her household.

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,980
This is the emperor's will.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,639
We thank His Majesty
for his great mercy.

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,620
(Fangfei Pavilion)

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,060
Ming.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,420
Ming, look at me.

15
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,500
Ming...

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,439
Ming, you're a good girl.

17
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,940
Madam, there are so many men
in the Dou's household.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,119
Why should you be the one to do this?

19
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,660
The imperial decree has been issued.

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,660
So let me be the bad person here.

21
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,490
Ming,

22
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,820
look who's here.

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,180
You...

24
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,840
Are you here to laugh at me?

25
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,340
You cursed your mother to death,

26
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,420
then your sister.

27
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,660
You bring nothing but bad luck.

28
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,700
So many people wish you were dead,

29
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,500
why don't you just grant their wish?

30
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,420
Give me back my daughter.

31
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,660
Bring Ming back to me.

32
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,020
In a few days,

33
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,300
it's my mother's birthday.

34
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,380
Since the day
your mother hanged herself,

35
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,780
I knew you wouldn't spare me.

36
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,580
But I've already let you go.

37
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,420
It's you who can't let yourself be free.

38
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,959
Your hatred toward me runs so deep

39
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,740
because every time you see me,

40
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,020
you're reminded

41
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,140
of how you drove
your best friend to suicide,

42
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,540
how you took what was hers

43
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,820
and ruined her happiness.

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,220
You're evil.

45
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,540
But you're still human,

46
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,020
and your conscience haunts you.

47
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,380
You fear the retribution that will come.

48
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,860
Again and again,

49
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,039
you've tried

50
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,460
to kill me.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,700
But all you want is to escape

52
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,260
the torment of your guilty heart.

53
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,620
It's not true!

54
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,519
It's natural for men to marry

55
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,940
and take concubines.

56
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,439
Your mother couldn't accept it!

57
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,639
She chose to end her life!

58
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,220
It has nothing to do with me!

59
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,759
This is a grudge

60
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,620
between you and my mother.

61
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,540
Now let's

62
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,460
settle this.

63
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,100
Zhao Guqiu,

64
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,500
I'm not afraid of you.

65
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,820
I'm living well here!

66
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,660
(What's done is done.)

67
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,360
(Taking your life
won't change anything.)

68
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,479
(These flower petals)

69
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,100
(won't take your life.)

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,660
(I hope this lesson)

71
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,119
(makes you truly understand)

72
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,900
(the pain that killed my mother)

73
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,140
(and brings her peace.)

74
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,159
=Blossom=
(Adapted from the novel "Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

75
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,239
=Episode 24=

76
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,420
(Dou's Residence)

77
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,020
Ms. Longevity.

78
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,740
Yes, Father.

79
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,420
My marriage to Yingxue was a mistake.

80
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,220
First, I failed you and your mother,

81
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,500
Later, I failed her and Ming.

82
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,500
Ming had a kind heart.

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,780
She shouldn't have such an ending.

84
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,580
She suffered from our broken marriage,

85
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,220
which led her to fall blindly into love.

86
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,740
I often wonder

87
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,300
where I went wrong.

88
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,380
Maybe I shouldn't have entered
the official world,

89
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,020
or maybe I should never
have left the capital.

90
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,220
If I hadn't,

91
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,740
I'd be happily admiring

92
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,580
the magnolia flowers blooming now.

93
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,980
What's done is done.

94
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,540
But unfortunately,

95
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,540
I'm forever stuck in the past.

96
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,100
The fact that you came to see me,

97
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,780
I feel much better now.

98
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,500
But after everything that happened,

99
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,380
I want to tell you something.

100
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,780
Seize the opportunity
while it's still available.

101
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,620
Cherish your loved ones,

102
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,500
so you don't regret it

103
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,980
like I do.

104
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,060
When did you arrive?

105
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,500
I was already here

106
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,940
when you entered Wang Yingxue's room.

107
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,879
This is a grudge

108
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,700
between you and my mother.

109
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,980
Now let's settle this.

110
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,660
It's such a pity for Ming.

111
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,300
The more meaningful something is,

112
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,900
the more strength is needed
to protect it.

113
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,760
Ms. Longevity,

114
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,700
I will protect you

115
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,740
and keep you safe.

116
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,700
I know you will.

117
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,660
Let's go home.

118
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,780
Yes, let's go home.

119
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,959
(Duke of Jining's Residence)

120
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,399
The Duke of Jining's Residence
has been confiscated,

121
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,860
and he's been demoted to a commoner.

122
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,119
Do you want it?

123
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,239
Sir!

124
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,380
Sir!

125
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,500
- Catch!
- Give it to me.

126
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,620
Sir, return the portrait to me.

127
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,820
Get off me!

128
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,239
With so many valuables,
why would you want this painting?

129
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,620
Why? Is this a treasure map?

130
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,060
Do you want it?

131
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,519
If you do,

132
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,779
kowtow three times on your knees,
and call me "Boss".

133
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,380
Come on! Kneel!

134
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,420
Do it.

135
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,340
Come in.

136
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,180
Boss.

137
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,860
- What? I can't hear you.
- I can't hear you.

138
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,620
Louder!

139
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,159
Boss!

140
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,039
Boss, return the portrait to me.

141
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,180
Boss.

142
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,140
Get out of here!

143
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,430
- Leave.
- Go.

144
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,359
(Qianqing Palace)

145
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,199
(Revere Heaven and Ancestral Wisdom)

146
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,900
Losing a token has caused such chaos.

147
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,999
Shengtian Prefecture's transfer order

148
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,700
has already reached
the Military Command.

149
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,100
What are those useless officials doing?

150
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,639
Your Majesty,
I failed to manage my household properly

151
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,980
and caused this disaster.

152
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,500
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

153
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,220
Stop taking all the blame.

154
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,740
It was the negligence
of the capital's defense.

155
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,820
Your family's issues

156
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,300
wouldn't stir up any trouble.

157
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,359
Thank you, Your Majesty.

158
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,479
I will immediately coordinate
with the Six Ministries

159
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,079
and Censorate officials

160
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,620
to thoroughly investigate this

161
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,319
and report the details
to the Grand Secretariat

162
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,100
for Your Majesty's decision.

163
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,580
Approved.

164
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,479
The Duke of Ying has kept

165
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,020
the southern city safe.

166
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,740
The Song Family

167
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,220
hasn't disappointed me.

168
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,599
Yantang,

169
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,260
you still need to help

170
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,380
with the aftermath.

171
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,690
The Duke of Ying guarded
the southern city

172
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,820
and still had his personal guards assist
my family in fighting the enemies.

173
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,740
His attention to detail is admirable.

174
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,180
I should learn from him.

175
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,780
Handling the current disaster
is a pressing matter.

176
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,700
Eradicating the bandits
is a long-term plan.

177
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,519
I am willing
to relieve Your Majesty's worries

178
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,340
by leading troops
to eliminate this threat.

179
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,340
Your Majesty,

180
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,460
the bandits are desperate but cunning.

181
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,820
The Duke of Ying hasn't fought
in a while.

182
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,340
I suggest

183
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,459
letting Lord Song lead the troops,

184
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,540
and I'll support him

185
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,980
with strategy.

186
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,420
Very well.

187
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,500
Song Yichun will temporarily command
the Military Command of the Five Wards

188
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,300
and handle the capital's aftermath.

189
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,279
Yantang will lead the Imperial Guard
and three thousand elite soldiers.

190
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,619
You will depart in three days.

191
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,620
Shishu will act as the Minister of War

192
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,220
and coordinate reinforcements.

193
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,660
The bandits must be eradicated

194
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,860
before you return to the capital.

195
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,860
We shall obey your command,
Your Majesty.

196
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,039
(Lu's Dental Clinic)

197
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,460
These bandits have burned half
of the northern city.

198
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,939
As long as Song Mo investigates
by following the bandits' trail,

199
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,470
he will find something suspicious.

200
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,780
Why not let him go after the bandits

201
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,820
and I'll support from behind.

202
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,060
Even if there's news,

203
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,660
it won't reach the emperor.

204
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,220
You truly have

205
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,100
a great foresight.

206
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,540
No matter how he investigates,

207
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,140
we have nothing to fear.

208
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,100
(Peace and Prosperity)

209
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,759
Sir,

210
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,340
will Madam come to see you off?

211
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,340
It's not even my first campaign.

212
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,340
There's no need for that.

213
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,900
Then we should set out quickly.

214
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,200
The auspicious time is not here yet.

215
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,020
Of course.

216
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,020
Yantang!

217
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,119
Didn't you say yesterday

218
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,260
you wouldn't see me off?

219
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,900
I'm here to see the army off.

220
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,540
You're lying again.

221
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,460
Then why did you come
from outside the city?

222
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,940
Be honest now.

223
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,149
I went to Wanfo Temple

224
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,599
to obtain divination sticks for you.

225
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,900
The bandits are ruthless.

226
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,759
So you must return unharmed

227
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,980
and victorious.

228
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,500
Did you leave the city so early

229
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,740
just to get these divination sticks
for me?

230
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,460
Aren't you afraid
I might draw a bad reading?

231
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,519
You can draw without worries.

232
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,959
I already picked out

233
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,540
all the bad sticks one by one,

234
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,220
leaving only the best ones.

235
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,640
I didn't know
such a domineering worshiper existed.

236
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,580
(May our love endure
and stay united for a lifetime.)

237
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,140
Heaven watches over us

238
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,060
and Bodhisattva truly understands
my heart.

239
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,420
May our love endure
and stay united for a lifetime.

240
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,350
Not this one.

241
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,170
You must draw for peace
and a smooth journey.

242
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,140
- Draw another one.
- What's wrong with this one?

243
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,060
I'm not drawing another one.
I want this one.

244
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,860
My dear,

245
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,060
do you think
this fortune will come true?

246
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,920
Let's talk about it when you return.

247
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,540
I don't want to wait that long.

248
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,969
If you don't answer me,
I'll feel restless

249
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,160
and overthink.

250
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,119
If I'm distracted like this
on the battlefield,

251
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,199
I might lose an arm or a leg.

252
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,999
What if one day I lose my head?

253
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,530
Don't say such things!

254
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,860
You're about to march to battle.

255
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,440
Don't you know it's a taboo to say that?

256
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,020
So it's a promise, then?

257
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,540
Bodhisattva is watching.

258
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,020
So no backing out.

259
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,460
You must return unharmed.

260
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,540
I will wait for you.

261
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,700
Sir!

262
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,999
Sir,

263
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,280
Official Dou has ordered us
to break camp and move out.

264
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,820
Fall in!

265
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,500
Fall in!

266
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,100
Imperial Guards.

267
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,620
Here!

268
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,260
Today, we march to battle!

269
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,740
We swear not to return
until the bandits are defeated!

270
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,399
Wipe out the bandits!

271
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,959
Wipe them out!

272
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,669
Wipe them out!

273
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,940
March!

297
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,660
So you don't have any money?

298
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,180
Someone!

299
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,220
Search him for money.

00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,940

Hurry, follow him.

Fancy seeing you here, Your Lordship.

310
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,660
How did you end up
in such a miserable state?

311
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,140
Mr. Zhou.

312
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,860
That painting in your hand
could be worth several taels.

313
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,999
How about selling it to me?

314
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,359
Take it as a favor from me.

315
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,209
Give it to me.

316
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,239
Mr. Zhou,

317
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,620
this painting is not for sale.

318
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,599
Do you think it is still up to you
whether to sell it or not?

319
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,780
- Give it to me.
- Mr. Zhou.

320
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,559
Help me!

321
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,570
Mr. Zhou, don't take it.

322
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,620
Mr. Zhou!

323
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,620
Let me go! Give it back to me!

324
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,940
Let me go!

00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,220
Ah, it's the late Marchioness.

326
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,660
She died because of you.

327
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,900
What's the point
of keeping her painting?

328
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,460
How about this? I'll do you a favor

329
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,519
and burn this painting for her
in heaven.

330
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,559
No.

331
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,599
Mr. Zhou.

332
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,719
Don't burn it, Mr. Zhou.

333
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,860
Don't burn the painting.

334
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,359
You can't burn the painting!

335
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,540
Please!

336
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,700
Mr. Zhou!

337
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,279
Don't take offense
at my previous mistakes.

338
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,369
I'll bow as an apology.

339
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,780
I'll bow to you.

340
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,959
- Don't burn the painting.
- Why did you do it

341
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,380
- Please don't burn it!
- if you knew the consequences?

342
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,719
No!

343
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,919
No, Mr. Zhou!

344
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,220
Mr. Zhou, I beg you.

345
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,239
Don't burn it, Mr. Zhou!

346
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,500
Don't burn that painting, Mr. Zhou!

347
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:35,050
No!

348
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,100
Let me go!

349
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,500
Darn you!

350
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,380
Beat him!

351
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,300
Let's go.

352
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,180
Ming, don't be sacred. It's all right.

353
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,479
Show it to me.

354
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,620
I want to see it.

355
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,239
My Lord, please.

356
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,380
I won't let you see it.

357
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,820
Ming,

358
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,060
I miss you so much.

359
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,940
I knocked Zhao out
and took her place in the bridal sedan.

360
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,599
Tomorrow, the world will surely mock me
for degrading myself

361
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,980
and going against tradition.

362
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,260
Will you come and visit me in my dreams?

363
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,420
Is this the painting you did last time?

364
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,020
Do you like it?

365
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,260
I do.

366
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,780
Ming...

367
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,060
Ming.

368
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,180
My Lord,

369
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,140
time for your medicine.

370
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,820
The physician already said
your cold isn't fully recovered.

371
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,660
Yet here you are, insisting on painting.

372
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,300
Ming,

373
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:44,900
is it really you?

374
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,780
Am I dreaming?

375
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,020
How could you...

376
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,940
What are you talking about?

377
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,079
I only left

378
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,279
for a while.

379
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,700
What's the matter with you?

380
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,340
Did you have a nightmare?

381
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,620
Ming...

382
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:00,759
Ming.

383
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,050
I don't want to be apart anymore.

384
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,320
I don't want to leave you again.

385
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,060
Why would we be apart?

386
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,380
I won't leave you.

387
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,119
Ming,

388
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,039
I'm so glad.

389
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,340
It was only a nightmare.

390
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,140
We won't be apart anymore.

391
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,260
Here you go.

392
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,820
After the imperial decree was issued,

393
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,540
a mad sorcerer came to the household,

394
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,380
claiming he could cure her illness.

395
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,980
He said she only needs to bow her way up
the mountain every day.

396
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,100
One bow after three steps
and one kowtow after nine steps

397
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,100
while chanting scriptures
a hundred times.

398
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,900
Only then, could Ming be spared
from the torments of hell.

399
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,460
After she heard that,
she actually stopped acting mad

400
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,020
and begged to come here.

401
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,100
It seems

402
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,340
that Mother has forgiven her.

403
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,700
Thanks to your plea for imperial mercy,

404
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,820
she's been allowed to spend
the rest of her days here.

405
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,940
Consider it her way of atoning
for her sins.

406
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,133
From the foot of the mountain
to the summit,

407
00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:08,519
there are over a thousand steps.

408
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,140
Even walking up would take hours,

409
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,180
let alone bowing every three steps
and prostrating every nine steps.

410
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,620
How could a woman

411
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,350
possibly complete such a task
over 999 days

412
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,820
while enduring rain, snow, and wind?

413
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,820
It'll be hard in her lifetime.

414
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,839
That's the point.

415
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,679
There's a saying in Buddhism

416
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,079
about Avici Hell.

417
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,039
It's the worst of the eight hell.

418
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,500
Those who committed the gravest sins

419
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,759
will be cast there

420
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,799
and will never

421
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,660
have the hope of release.

422
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,940
When the bandits attacked the residence,

423
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,800
I thought you only suffered
physical injuries.

424
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,300
I didn't realize it was psychological.

425
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,549
You're restless,

426
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:51,260
sleepless, and troubled by dreams.
Am I right?

427
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,780
There's something else.

428
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,799
My friend's husband is away,

429
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,060
and she keeps having nightmares.

430
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,079
She dreamt her husband

431
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,780
was ambushed in a forest.

432
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,639
She came to me to interpret the dream,

433
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,820
asking if her husband was safe.

434
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,180
But I don't know these things.

435
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,780
Could it be

436
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,820
that the forest is near Jinxi?

437
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,300
It's over.

438
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,819
It's all over.

439
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,719
What's wrong?

440
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,679
It's over.

441
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,990
Your friend's husband

442
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,319
has fallen prey to an enemy,
with omens of blood and death.

443
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,940
He won't live much longer.

444
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,839
My friend also dreamt

445
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,740
that someone was cursing her husband.

446
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,479
He ended up with his mouth,
stomach, and heart rotting.

447
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,620
Madam!

448
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,740
A letter from His Lordship.

449
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,940
Sharped-tongued but soft heart.

450
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,740
You should be quiet.

451
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,740
Prepare the horse!

452
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,120
You don't need treatment anymore?

453
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,319
The bandits broke through the siege.

454
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,920
His Lordship was ambushed in the woods.

455
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,900
What's the matter, my dear?

456
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,839
I'm right here.

457
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,980
Yantang.

458
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,220
Your concern makes you overthink.

459
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,540
Are you all right?

460
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,100
I'm all right.

461
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,940
Yan Chaoqing said
you were ambushed in the forest.

462
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,940
I was the one who ambushed them.

463
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,660
If I needed you to save me
from these bandits,

464
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,820
I might as well go home
and do needlework.

465
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,580
Enough with the nonsense.

466
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,780
Get out of here!

467
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,239
Even so,

468
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,780
I did get hurt.

469
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,380
That archer was skilled.

470
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,700
Luckily, I had my golden silk armor.

471
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,500
Are your hands all right?

472
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,060
Did you get injured here?

473
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,620
Let's head back to the camp.

474
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,060
I'll take a look at your wounds.

475
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,260
Massaging around the wound helps

476
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,200
with blood circulation,

477
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,060
which can speed up the healing.

478
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,540
Let me see the wound.

479
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,380
No need.

480
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,559
It's almost healed.

481
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,300
You were just crying out
in pain earlier.

482
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,580
Are you afraid I'd worry
because the injury is serious?

483
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,759
Let me see.

484
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,759
No need, really.

485
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,900
Let me check.

486
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,820
What's wrong?

487
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,260
Your injury is serious.

488
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,820
Does it still hurt?

489
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,260
No.

490
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,700
It's only a minor injury.

491
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,860
At home, no one cared if I was hurt.

492
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,460
But seeing how you worry about me,

493
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,660
I realize even small injuries

494
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,060
can make you worry for a while.

495
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,540
Who says I'm worried about you?

496
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,980
Do you know what day it is today?

497
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,020
Today is...

498
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,180
Time stands still in the army.

499
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,180
Today is your birthday.

500
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,380
Here's some birthday noodles.

501
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,460
Happy birthday.

502
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,260
You remembered my birthday?

503
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,780
Of course, I do.

504
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,660
Thank you, my dear.

505
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,380
Have a taste.

506
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,540
Slowly.

507
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,020
Is it delicious?

508
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,100
Since you made it,

509
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,460
it's delicious.

510
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,620
Can you fulfill

511
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,380
my birthday wish today?

512
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,940
What is it?

513
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,180
Don't be angry.

514
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,860
All right.

515
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,180
General!

516
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,460
You better say something useful.

517
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,540
- Or else...
- I know.

518
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,100
Running in laps.

519
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,980
So, what is it?

520
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,519
General.

521
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,740
The refugees we saved
from the bandits have woken up.

522
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,340
They said they want to thank you.

523
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,860
All right.

524
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,980
Why are you still here?

525
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,239
Thank you for saving my son and I.

526
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,540
Please get up.

527
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,180
It was no trouble at all.

528
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,980
Where are you from?

529
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,180
My husband is a general.

530
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,300
He can ask someone to take you home.

531
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,860
Thank you, Madam.

532
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,159
Our village was burned down by bandits.

533
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,020
We have no home anymore.

534
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,780
We are on our way to the capital
to find my sister.

535
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,579
Where does your sister live
in the capital?

536
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,380
My eldest daughter lives there.

537
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,820
But we don't know where exactly.

538
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,220
The capital is so big

539
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:59,020
and we don't know how to find her.

540
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,500
Madam,

541
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,420
I have a place in the capital

542
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,900
that sells stationery.

543
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,740
If you don't mind,

544
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,119
you can stay there

545
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,300
for now

546
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,460
and look for your daughter from there.

547
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,479
Thank you so much, Madam.

548
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,679
Can, kneel and thank Madam.

549
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,500
- Get up.
- Please get up.

550
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,420
Thank you very much.

551
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,380
Madam! Madam!

552
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,959
Madam, my mother wants you
to have this hairpin.

553
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,140
Thank you.

554
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,260
I cannot accept this.

555
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,100
General!

556
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,580
What is it?

557
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,959
General, we have received a report
from Guanghe Tower in the city.

558
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,100
What is it about?

559
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,580
In summary, we won.

560
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,380
But there are many rumors in court.

561
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:58,290
They say you are ambitious and don't follow
the Ministry of War's orders.

562
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,479
They also say the bandits' raid

563
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,179
was because Madam flaunted her dowry,

564
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,359
which made the bandits envious

565
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,940
and caused trouble for the people.

566
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,260
Being wealthy brings trouble.

567
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,759
What did His Majesty say?

568
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,559
Official Dou Shishu defended you a bit.

569
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,100
His Majesty promoted him to a deputy

570
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,820
but didn't mention any rewards for you.

571
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,460
Giving backhanded remarks

572
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,500
is what my Fifth Uncle is good at.

573
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,279
He likely spread rumors

574
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,900
about you being ambitious

575
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,300
to make His Majesty wary
of your independence.

576
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,460
The bandit chaos in the capital!

577
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,860
Two hundred thirty-nine bandits

578
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,540
were executed.

579
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,140
In the campaign to eliminate bandits,

580
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,100
seven major gangs
from the three provinces,

581
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,990
totaling 8,000 bandits who had been
terrorizing the outskirts of the capital,

582
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,260
have all been either killed or captured!

583
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,879
If anyone dares
to cause more trouble in the capital

584
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,780
and harm the people in the future,

585
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,740
their bodies will be displayed
on the city walls

586
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,300
for the birds

587
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,039
as a warning to others!

588
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,720
- Good!
- Well said!

589
00:35:57,730 --> 00:35:59,470
I have arranged for prayers
at Wanfo Temple

590
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,100
for the suffering people.

591
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,020
From today,

592
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,780
all celebrations and feasts
are suspended for a month

593
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,700
in honor of the dead.

594
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,460
For those affected,

595
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,199
Zhaowen Bookstore and Miao's Family Shop

596
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,380
have prepared food and medicine.

597
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,260
They will be given out
for free for three days.

598
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:29,060
- Wonderful!
- Great!

599
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,589
Song Mo is winning the hearts
of people in the capital.

600
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,620
You should deprive him of his power

601
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,900
as a warning.

602
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,159
Your Majesty.

603
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,639
But Lord Song's wife said

604
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,980
that giving out medicine and food is Your
Majesty's grace and the court's gesture.

605
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,020
Using kindness and authority

606
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,700
to eliminate the reputation
of being brutal.

607
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,800
It also ends rumors and public anger

608
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,860
as well as giving me a face.

609
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,519
But

610
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,220
this is clearly just flattery
and scheming.

611
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,380
If you could learn
how to flatter and scheme like this,

612
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,690
I'd be at ease.

613
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:16,460
What about the feast for Lord Song?

614
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,300
It shouldn't have been held.

615
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,959
As mentioned earlier,

616
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,580
the civil and military officials
lack vigilance.

617
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,620
Only Yantang was thoughtful.

618
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,919
Issue my decree.

619
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,310
Over a thousand people
in the capital were killed or injured.

620
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,820
According to the mourning regulations,

621
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,820
from the palace to the officials,

622
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,260
all celebrations will be banned
for a month.

623
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,380
Yes, Your Majesty.

624
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,700
Father,

625
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,020
why did you bring me here?

626
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,519
I have found

627
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,809
the best teacher in the world
to teach you music and arts.

628
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:54,120
It's also to celebrate your birthday.

629
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,460
Follow me.

630
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,740
Come inside.

631
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,700
Come.

632
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,900
Shuyao.

633
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,920
Han.

634
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,140
A gift for you.

635
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,060
May it keep you safe.

636
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,460
Father.

637
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,740
Han.

638
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,220
All these years,

639
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,460
the birthday gifts I delivered to you

640
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,740
were personally made by her.

641
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,380
Do you understand her intention?

642
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,740
I don't understand anything.

643
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,020
Han.

644
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,820
Han!

645
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,300
Han.

646
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,060
Mo?

647
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,900
What happened to your eyes?

648
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,300
Were they irritated by the smoke?

649
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,039
I'm fine, Mo.

650
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,180
What brings you here?

651
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,460
Your cat ran to Yizhi Hall again.

652
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,060
I caught it for you.

653
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,940
It loves to run around.

654
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,780
What are you burning?

655
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,279
I needed a pendant for my belt.

656
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,940
So I had a maid to make one.

657
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,039
It didn't turn out well.

658
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,180
So I burned it.

659
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,380
Sir,

660
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,959
General Yan and Officer Chen are here.

661
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,140
They said it was urgent.

662
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,479
Let them wait in the front hall.

663
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,300
- Yes, sir.
- Officer Chen?

664
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,279
He is an undercover agent

665
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,780
I planted in the Northern Pacification
Bureau, named Chen Jia.

666
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,420
(Chen Jia?)

667
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,020
I'll make you pay!

668
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,500
Can I listen to your conversation?

669
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,420
- Greetings, My Lord.
- Good evening, Your Lordship.

670
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,890
We've looked into the house
in the northern part of the city.

671
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,630
The original owner registered
under a false name.

672
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,060
The woman living there now
is only known as Li.

673
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,860
She enjoys playing music.

674
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,300
I matched her appearance,

675
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,080
features, and preferences
with the portrait.

676
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:20,780
I suspect she was a former official courtesan
from the Music Office,

677
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:22,940
who was reported dead early on,

678
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,460
named Li Yaoniang.

679
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,700
Li Yaoniang?

680
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,740
How long has she been living there?

681
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,140
Twenty years.

682
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:32,940
Neighbors say a sedan often stops
at the back door at night.

683
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,240
I've also matched
the appearance with the portrait.

684
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:37,100
It's a sedan
from the Duke of Ying's Residence.

685
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,740
Don't worry about it, continue.

686
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,639
I also found the old neighbors nearby

687
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,780
and verified it.

688
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,700
He never took concubines,

689
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,060
and I thought he was loyal to Mother.

690
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,660
It turns out
he had secretly kept a mistress.

691
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,359
My Lord,

692
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,940
how could the Duke of Ying alone rescue

693
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,439
and hide a convicted woman

694
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,020
for twenty years

695
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,780
under the nose of the Duchess?

696
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,340
It's not easy.

697
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,439
Who does she usually associate with?

698
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,860
She rarely goes out.

699
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,959
She would only visit Wanfo Temple
at the beginning and fifteenth

700
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,090
of each month to burn incense
and listen to scriptures.

701
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,820
The abbot there is familiar with her.

702
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,780
Keep following this lead.

703
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,140
Yes, sir.

704
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,879
We'll split up to investigate.

705
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,140
I'll go to Wanfo Temple.

706
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,540
All right.

707
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,820
No matter what happens,

708
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,420
don't forget

709
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,260
that you still have me.

710
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:05,340
Why are you so foolish?

711
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,660
Licorice-preserved fruit clashes

712
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:37,100
with the euphorbia
in Mother's prescription.

713
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,279
You caused her death!

714
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,340
Giving birth to you with her

715
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,620
was the greatest regret of my life!

716
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,380
