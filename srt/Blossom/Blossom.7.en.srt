1
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,839
Very clever, Prince Song.

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,839
If anything happens to Mr. Wu,

3
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:13,880
His Majesty might think that our family

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,000
attempted to eliminate

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,160
a political rival.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,719
As for today's matter,

7
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:21,440
I, the Magistrate of Shengtian,
can testify

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,239
that Song Mo trespassed
on private property,

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,480
threatened a court official
with a sword,

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,280
and obstructed a rescue.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,760
Even if this matter is brought
before His Majesty,

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,120
the facts remain the same.

13
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,240
What a lively scene.

14
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:39,399
Judging by the atmosphere,

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,000
are you planning to perform
a sword dance?

16
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:45,240
Greetings, Madam Cui.

17
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,280
I was just chatting with my mother.

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:49,600
What's going on here?

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,960
It's all because of Dou Zhao.

20
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,240
She refused to let Mr. Wu
be taken for medical treatment

21
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,359
and insisted on treating him herself.

22
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,640
Prince Song,

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,000
haste makes waste,
calmness brings resolution.

24
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,719
Duke of Ding has always been
a loyal and upright man.

25
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:08,640
By overstepping your authority
to search his residence

26
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,040
just to silence a political opponent,

27
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,719
you will only end up harming your uncle.

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,560
Please weigh the consequences
of your actions

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,599
and be careful in your judgment.

30
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,319
Madam Cui,

31
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,359
while today's events

32
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,159
cannot be taken to court,

33
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,879
I know what I've seen.

34
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,760
We've disrupted your peace today.

35
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:31,719
I sincerely apologize.

36
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,560
Everyone, withdraw.

37
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,680
Master Dai, you've come
all the way here.

38
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,359
Sorry I did not welcome you properly.

39
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,840
But if you could spare me
from further conflict,

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,400
I would be most grateful.

41
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,599
Since you put it that way, Madam Cui,

42
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,239
I will not pursue today's matter
any further.

43
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,359
Everyone, leave.

44
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,640
It's working.

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,640
He's waking up.

46
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,240
Dezhen.

47
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,520
The doctor is here.

48
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,599
Doctor, quickly!

49
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,120
Lung abscesses are most dangerous
when they rupture internally.

50
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,560
Thankfully, this young lady released the
clotted blood with acupuncture.

51
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,639
Otherwise, he could have
suffocated to death.

52
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,479
Madam,

53
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,719
the young master is out of danger now.

54
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,560
I'll go prepare a decoction

55
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,439
for him immediately.

56
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,599
Follow me.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,520
Thank you, Fourth Young Lady,
for saving my life.

58
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,360
Mr. Wu, there's no need to thank me.

59
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,319
The credit goes to the Dou family.

60
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,080
We'll make sure to send tonics
to your residence later.

61
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,800
Lung abscesses are dangerous.

62
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,960
You mustn't take it lightly.

63
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,840
Take good care of your health
in the future.

64
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,560
Dezhen,

65
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,319
it's true she saved you,

66
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,919
but your illness today

67
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,280
may not have been accidental.

68
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,800
Just ask the Fourth Young Lady.

69
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,000
Song Mo,

70
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,159
what are you suggesting?

71
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,159
I contracted lung abscess
while assisting with disaster relief.

72
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,120
Not even my grandfather knew about it.

73
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,919
As for the phoenix butterfly incident,

74
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,439
no one could have foreseen it.

75
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,319
You must be upset, Fourth Young Lady.

76
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,800
I apologize on Dezhen's behalf.

77
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:59,840
Fourth Young Lady, you broke
societal conventions today

78
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,400
to save my life.

79
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,599
There's no way I can repay you,

80
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,080
except...

81
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,759
Mr. Wu,

82
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,039
no need for words now.

83
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,039
Focus on recovering.

84
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:10,919
We can't hide this from your father.

85
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,840
I'll escort you back to the capital.

86
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,719
Suxin, Sulan.

87
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,120
Lu Zheng, Lu Ming, come with us.

88
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,120
- Yes.
- Yes.

89
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,560
Thankfully, nothing bad happened.

90
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,959
Prince Song should feel relieved now.

91
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,600
Once Mr. Wu recovers,

92
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:35,000
there will be no more misunderstanding.

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,240
Quickly, help Mr. Wu to the guest room
to be treated.

94
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,879
The embroidery is quite unique.

95
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,800
Tell me,

96
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,360
what is this?

97
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,759
A tiger talisman.

98
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,279
Is that it?

99
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,000
I disregarded propriety just now
to save a life.

100
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,399
It can well prove
I have nothing to hide.

101
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,399
You're lying.

102
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,720
You owe me an explanation.

103
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,940
=Blossom=
(Adapted from the novel "Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

104
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,660
=Episode 7=

105
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:03,920
(Cui's Residence)

106
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,680
Careful on the steps.

107
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,439
I'm glad Mr. Wu is all right.

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,480
Mr. Wu just suffered from heatstroke.

109
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,680
He's now out of danger.

110
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:14,600
No need to see us off.

111
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,839
I'll say goodbye here.

112
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,279
Thankfully, it ended without incident.

113
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,079
At least the Wei family didn't witness
the earlier scene.

114
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,319
The Fourth Young Lady
really has a temperament...

115
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,319
Sister,

116
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,079
I know the Fourth Young Lady
has feelings for me,

117
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,399
but she is so uncouth.

118
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:46,079
From now on, stop using expensive paper
and inkstone for calligraphy.

119
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,519
Sell all the gardens and estates.

120
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,720
If you can do that,

121
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,279
I'll cancel the marriage proposal.

122
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,160
When it comes to your treasures,

123
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,199
you can't bear to part with them.

124
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,360
Now you understand
how difficult it's been for me

125
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,279
to support the household.

126
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,720
You have no idea

127
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,279
how generous her dowry is.

128
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,279
Gold and silver are just
superficial things.

129
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,600
What matters in marriage
is mutual affection.

130
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,399
Right now, only she has feelings for me.

131
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,040
How can that work?

132
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,240
You marry a wife for the sake
of the household.

133
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,680
If you want mutual affection,

134
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,480
take a concubine.

135
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,519
Don't even think about
the Dou family's Fifth Young Lady.

136
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,199
Her maternal grandfather is Wang Xingyi,

137
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,160
and you've seen how capable
Wang Yingxue is.

138
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,000
And you?

139
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,120
All you have is a fancy title,

140
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,799
with neither scholarly achievements
nor an official position.

141
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,559
Titles and positions are just
superficial things.

142
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,480
It's better not to be a greedy,
fame-chasing official.

143
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,240
Fine, fine.

144
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,519
As you wish.

145
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,519
I'll think of it as marrying
a pair of cotton ear plugs

146
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,200
to stop your constant nagging.

147
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,159
When I retrieved this item from Mr. Wu,

148
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,679
it was filled with the scent
of silk tree flowers.

149
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,200
Silk tree flowers?

150
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,120
As far as I know,

151
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,279
there are no silk tree flowers nearby,

152
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,879
let alone silk tree flower pollen.

153
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,039
Exactly.

154
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,000
It took me a while to figure it out.

155
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,799
You soaked the tiger talisman

156
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,440
in silk tree flower essence beforehand,

157
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,320
leaving only its fragrance
and no trace of its presence.

158
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
At the Dragon Boat Festival,

159
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,039
the tiger talisman contained camphor
to mask its scent.

160
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,720
Within an hour,

161
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,519
the fragrance would have
completely dissipated.

162
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,120
Luckily, Song Mo is a military man

163
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,320
who has no idea of
the harem's scheming ways.

164
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,559
Otherwise, your household
would be in deep trouble.

165
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
These are baseless speculations.

166
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,600
I suggest you watch your words.

167
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,360
Years ago, you framed me
with ephedra poisoning,

168
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:42,360
and now you've manipulated Mr. Wu,

169
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,720
even swapping his tiger talisman
with Wei Tingyu's.

170
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,080
Let me tell you,

171
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,480
it won't work.

172
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,919
Your destiny is to marry Wei Tingyu.

173
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,360
I won't marry Wei Tingyu.

174
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,240
Marriage is a matter decided by parents.

175
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,679
It's not up to you.

176
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,879
Wu Shan is my father's student,

177
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:59,840
and I specifically chose him
as a husband for Ming.

178
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,399
Don't even think about taking him.

179
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,600
Madam Wei came today

180
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:06,519
specifically to discuss your marriage
to Wei Tingyu.

181
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,480
If I don't marry you off
to the Wei family,

182
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,039
I would feel guilty.

183
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,200
You're truly calculating.

184
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:33,519
Are you feeling better?

185
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,120
The Fourth Young Lady saved my life.

186
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,799
You shouldn't doubt her.

187
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,679
Did I ever say I doubted her?

188
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,279
If you don't doubt her,

189
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,840
why did you make such a fuss earlier?

190
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,240
Dou Shishu is ambitious and scheming.

191
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,039
Dou Shiying has no interest in power,

192
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,440
but he's easily swayed.

193
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:53,120
Wang Yingxue, on the other hand,
hides malice behind a smile.

194
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,039
Your illness was most likely her doing.

195
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:56,639
But judging by her reaction,

196
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,679
even she doesn't want

197
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,920
such a controversial matter

198
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,840
to happen between you
and the Fourth Young Lady.

199
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,039
As for the Fourth Young Lady...

200
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,360
What about her?

201
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,399
It's clear that

202
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:09,320
she doesn't align with the rest
of the Dou family.

203
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,759
But somehow,

204
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,279
she accidentally caused you harm.

205
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,879
Her actions to save you were sincere,

206
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,240
but for the sake of her family,

207
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,120
she chose to cover up the truth.

208
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:19,679
Are you suggesting

209
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,360
that the Fourth Young Lady
has feelings for me?

210
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
If that were true,

211
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,080
I'd be a lucky man.

212
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,440
What I'm saying is,

213
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,639
the Dou family is full
of scheming minds,

214
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,320
and someone as simple as you

215
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,360
can't handle them.

216
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,519
I'm well aware of the darker side

217
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,279
inside these noble families.

218
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:44,120
But I'm not like you.

219
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:45,919
I think being on the battlefield

220
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,919
has made you paranoid.

221
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,039
The Fourth Young Lady
is intelligent and capable,

222
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,679
a perfect match.

223
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,679
You need to get it

224
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,200
into your thick skull.

225
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:00,399
You speak as if you know

226
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,720
the Fourth Young Lady better than I do.

227
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:04,159
Have you secretly investigated her?

228
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,200
You could say that.

229
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:08,960
When you pulled me away

230
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,960
and stopped me from speaking earlier,

231
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:10,840
I haven't even started...

232
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,279
Still coughing?

233
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,759
You shouldn't talk so much
when you have lung abscesses.

234
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,639
I think the Fourth Young Lady's
medical skills are lacking.

235
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,159
I'll ask a court physician
to examine you.

236
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,220
(Duke of Ying's Residence)

237
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,559
Sleeves, 1.8 feet long.

238
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,039
Shoulders, 1.5 feet wide.

239
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,279
His shoulders have grown wider.

240
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:42,639
The cape needs altering.

241
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,080
Good thing you held him back.

242
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,559
Otherwise, that silly boy Dezhen

243
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,039
would have insisted on repaying her
with marriage.

244
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,399
You may leave.

245
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:56,919
The Dou family uses underhanded tactics.

246
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,040
When it comes to marriage,

247
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,760
Old Master Wu would never allow Dezhen
to make decisions on his own.

248
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,840
Better to offend a nobleman
than provoke a villain.

249
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,480
The Dou family, especially Dou Shishu,

250
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,799
is like a venomous snake

251
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:08,000
waiting to strike.

252
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,639
Fortunately, the Dou family is quite
separated from the Cui Clan's Manor,

253
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,159
and Madam Wang is openly hostile
toward Dou Zhao.

254
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,279
Dou Shishu is deceitful
and power-hungry,

255
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,080
while Dou Zhao is clever and strategic.

256
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,120
If the two of them band together,

257
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,120
we'd be in serious trouble.

258
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:26,120
I've heard she grew up
without the protection of her parents,

259
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,039
so her life must have been difficult.

260
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,480
It's only natural that she's
sensitive, thoughtful,

261
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,679
and cautious.

262
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:35,440
Sir.

263
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:38,480
Sir.

264
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,000
General Yan has sent a message

265
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,399
that the phoenix butterfly incident
has nothing to do with Dou Zhao.

266
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:44,639
As I expected.

267
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,320
Although traveling by water is slow,

268
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,200
Brother should arrive
in the capital soon.

269
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:55,960
Mother,

270
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:57,759
your urinary condition

271
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,120
leaves you dizzy and nauseous.

272
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:01,559
Let the servants handle the sewing.

273
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:03,399
Are you saying my sewing is poor?

274
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,799
Come here.

275
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:09,919
It's been so many years
since I mended clothes for you.

276
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,639
This time, I'll finish the summer
garments for you and your brother.

277
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,159
They'll be perfect for your trip
back to Futing.

278
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,519
Mother, Brother.

279
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,879
Young Master Song Han
brought you medicine, Madam.

280
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,960
Brother, you finally came home,

281
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,519
yet you've been so busy
keeping Mother company

282
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:31,840
that you haven't spent time with me.

283
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,960
Mother said you love grilled venison.

284
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,159
I'm planning to hunt a deer
for you tomorrow.

285
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:38,919
Great!

286
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:40,559
If you can bring me venison,

287
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:42,240
I'll ask Father to let you

288
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,879
accompany me to Futing next year

289
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,399
and join the military.

290
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,879
Do you promise?

291
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,799
Then we can arrange the prayers.

292
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,600
Our ancestors

293
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,960
should be informed
of Dou Zhao's marriage.

294
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,200
Father, Fifth Uncle.

295
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,080
I don't want this marriage.

296
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,039
Dou Zhao,

297
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,720
the court is unstable right now.

298
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,919
It's obvious from Song Mo's actions.

299
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,600
I worry he may not be able
to protect you all.

300
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,000
You may be strong-willed,

301
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,080
but you are just a girl.

302
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:22,840
If something happens to the Dou family,

303
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,000
at least you'd have a husband
to protect you.

304
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,440
I don't need anyone to protect me.

305
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,240
All these years,
I've worked and studied hard,

306
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,679
building a career and amassing wealth,

307
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,759
so I wouldn't have to rely on anyone.

308
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,840
I can protect myself.

309
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,320
Do you think a little money

310
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,840
can guarantee lifelong security?

311
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,799
I've told you before,

312
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:44,799
if a woman delays marriage for too long,

313
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,159
she'll develop

314
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,360
rebellious ideas.

315
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:48,679
If I had known this would happen,

316
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,580
I would've sent you off
in abridal sedan chair

317
00:15:50,581 --> 00:15:51,320
when you came of age.

318
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,080
Even if you had,

319
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,039
I would still refuse
to marry Wei Tingyu.

320
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:55,200
You insolent girl!

321
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,519
You...

322
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,000
You've already done
such disgraceful things,

323
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,399
and I haven't even dealt with you yet.

324
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,480
You have no shame,

325
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,360
but the Dou family does.

326
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,320
Shishu, what are you doing?

327
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:03,639
Let's talk this out!

328
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:04,759
Why are you hitting her?

329
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,440
Dou Zhao.

330
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,519
After all these years,

331
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,159
you haven't changed one bit.

332
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,039
I am your daughter,

333
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,840
so why does Fifth Uncle
get to decide my marriage?

334
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,279
You disgraceful child,
get out of my way!

335
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:21,639
Shishu.

336
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:22,279
Get out of my way.

337
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:22,919
Don't hit her!

338
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:23,279
Get out of my way.

339
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,639
Shishu!

340
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:24,159
Enough!

341
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:26,799
Mother.

342
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,639
Mother.

343
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:28,240
Get up.

344
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,159
Are you all right?

345
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,679
This marriage will have a big impact
on Dou Zhao's long-term happiness.

346
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,279
How can you decide it so casually,

347
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,279
treating her like an object
to be pawned?

348
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,600
And who is Wei Tingyu?

349
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,679
A man known for frequenting brothels
and having countless maids.

350
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,799
He's bound to squander
his family fortune.

351
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,279
Whoever decided on this engagement
should cancel it.

352
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:57,960
Mother,

353
00:16:58,399 --> 00:16:59,960
Shishu and I didn't mean it like that.

354
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:01,600
And what if we did?

355
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,559
Mother,

356
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:04,359
I am now the head of the Dou family.

357
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,159
A women unmarried
should defer to her father.

358
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,880
A married woman
should defer to her husband.

359
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:10,240
A woman's duty is to bear children,

360
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,519
to support her husband
and raise children.

361
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:12,640
The teachings state that

362
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,119
a father is a guide to his children.

363
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,640
If the father is unkind, the child
may seek refuge elsewhere.

364
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,839
A husband is a guide to his wife.

365
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,119
If the husband is unworthy,
the wife may remarry.

366
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,680
When did it ever say

367
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,759
that women should be forced
into submission?

368
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:24,519
You...

369
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,240
Grandmother, take it easy.

370
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:28,440
Let's leave.

371
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,640
Mother,

372
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,400
you and Father were always at odds.

373
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,759
You've been lonely and resentful,

374
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,039
and that's why you raised
Dou Zhao this way

375
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,359
to spite the Dou family?

376
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,119
The fire is already lit.

377
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:49,359
All that's left is to pour oil.

378
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,000
What did you say?

379
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:56,960
Shishu, stop it.

380
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,559
Mother.

381
00:17:58,279 --> 00:17:58,920
Mother,

382
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,559
please don't misunderstand.

383
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,799
Shiying has the family's

384
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,319
best interests at heart.

385
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:05,640
When you provided grain
to support disaster relief efforts,

386
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,480
Shiying went to the court specifically

387
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,759
to request a commendation for you.

388
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:11,519
He planned to present it
at the family banquet

389
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:12,680
to honor you.

390
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:21,060
(Commendation)

391
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,240
You sought a commendation

392
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:28,000
just to persuade me

393
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,079
to agree to Dou Zhao's marriage?

394
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,200
I thought

395
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,440
you cared about me.

396
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,000
Mother,

397
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:40,079
I genuinely care about you.

398
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,240
I have no intent to deceive or barter.

399
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,160
That's right,

400
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,119
Shiying genuinely wants
to bring you and Zhao

401
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,720
back to the manor

402
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,319
so that you may live in happiness.

403
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,559
Do you think that Dou Zhao
will be at your mercy

404
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,799
once she's at the manor?

405
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,400
Let me tell you,

406
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,599
as long as I still draw breath,

407
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,119
Dou Zhao will stay here with me.

408
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,039
If the Wei family wants
to propose marriage,

409
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:03,839
they'll have to get through
our gates first.

410
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:06,880
Mother.

411
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,599
Mother.

412
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,599
Mother, I didn't mean it like that.

413
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,960
This is too much.

414
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,839
Why should I be caught in the middle?

415
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:17,960
Mother,

416
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,279
Shiying and I didn't mean it like that.

417
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,039
Mother,

418
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,640
please don't take it to heart.

419
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,720
Take it easy, Mother.

420
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:36,640
Years ago, you killed my mother,

421
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:38,160
took my home,

422
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,359
and schemed against me.

423
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:40,559
I didn't hold it against you.

424
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,119
Since returning here,

425
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:45,000
I haven't competed with you once.

426
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,200
But as long as you remain unmarried,

427
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,279
I can't have peace

428
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:50,319
as the mistress of the Dou family.

429
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,880
My grandmother is the
dearest person to me.

430
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,240
If you dare to scheme against her again

431
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
and cause her pain,

432
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:59,880
I'll make you suffer a hundredfold.

433
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:01,880
Dou Zhao,

434
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:02,720
come back.

435
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,720
Don't waste words with her.

436
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:17,039
Does it hurt?

437
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,160
Not anymore.

438
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,240
I'd forgotten

439
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,240
to hit her back.

440
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,240
They talk about ethics and morality,

441
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:31,279
but their actions are disgraceful.

442
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:34,480
As expected of the son
of that brute, Dou Duo.

443
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,680
You never speak of Grandfather.

444
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,319
What really happened back then?

445
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,559
I won't let you follow in my footsteps.

446
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,680
Dou Duo and I

447
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,519
were victims of an arranged marriage.

448
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,880
That marriage ruined my entire life.

449
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,440
It also destroyed Ms. Tuo's life.

450
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:03,039
Ms. Tuo?

451
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:07,319
Wasn't she my mother's personal maid?

452
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,200
Why was she involved?

453
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:12,240
Ms. Tuo was originally a maid
from my maiden family.

454
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,319
But Dou Duo was debauched and lustful.

455
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,920
It was one thing for him
to indulge with concubines,

456
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,559
but he even preyed on relatives
and servants.

457
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,799
I can't count how many messes
I've cleaned up for him.

458
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,559
But I never expected

459
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,880
he'd lay hands on Ms. Tuo,
who was already betrothed.

460
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,559
I struck Dou Duo with a bottle

461
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:37,559
to save Ms. Tuo.

462
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,039
In the Dou household,

463
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,880
no one condemned Dou Duo's
depravity or violence.

464
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:46,359
Instead, they accused me
of injuring my husband,

465
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,799
a violation punishable by divorce.

466
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,839
They didn't dare offend
the prominent Cui family,

467
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,039
so they sent me to this manor

468
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,359
and treated me like a cast-off wife.

469
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,480
You hurt Father this badly

470
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,000
and disgraced the family.

471
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:08,319
I don't deserve

472
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,759
a wicked mother like you.

473
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,319
Leave now!

474
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,119
Shut the door.

475
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:18,200
I can ignore

476
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,680
their words and actions.

477
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,440
But my own son

478
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,720
treating me like a poisonous snake,

479
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,079
denouncing me as unworthy
of being a mother...

480
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,079
No wonder you never use the Dou surname

481
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,880
and avoid the Dou's Residence.

482
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,440
Such a family is no family at all.

483
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,480
They don't deserve to be called family.

484
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:44,440
So, Grandmother,

485
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,880
you shouldn't feel sad because of them.

486
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:49,039
We don't need this family.

487
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:50,640
As long as we have each other,

488
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,720
Sister, Ansu, and the others,

489
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,039
this manor is our true home.

490
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,039
You sweet child,

491
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,920
always trying to cheer me up.

492
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,000
Look at me.

493
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,480
You got it on my face.

494
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:42,960
Apologies for my sudden visit.

495
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:45,240
Pardon my rudeness.

496
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,279
Not at all.

497
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,640
Su, let's go.

498
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,480
Come on.

499
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:54,880
Cousin.

500
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,680
Mr. Wu, will you stay for dinner?

501
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,079
I'll prepare chicken stew for you.

502
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:03,519
Let's go.

503
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,960
Bye.

504
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,799
I'll wait for you back at the manor.

505
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,319
It's fine.

506
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,359
You've come from afar,
you must have an urgent matter.

507
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:17,359
You can tell me right now.

508
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,960
I won't mind.

509
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,079
You may leave.

510
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:25,519
Yes.

511
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:35,839
I thought

512
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,599
you had followed the Seventh Master

513
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:38,400
and moved to the capital.

514
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,240
When I reached the Dou's Residence,
you were nowhere to be found.

515
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:42,279
I...

516
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:43,920
I...

517
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:45,839
was so anxious that I rushed here.

518
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,880
In order to save me
at the Dragon Boat Festival,

519
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,119
you...

520
00:24:56,359 --> 00:24:57,359
you removed my clothes.

521
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:00,200
It was a matter of life and death.

522
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:03,319
Even if it were an old farmer,

523
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:04,640
I would have done the same.

524
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:07,039
You needn't dwell on it.

525
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,440
You are magnanimous and open-minded,

526
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,640
but as a man,

527
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,559
how can I let your reputation
be tainted?

528
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,440
I should take responsibility.

529
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,519
And I'm willing to do so.

530
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,360
I will ask the Wei family
to annul their engagement,

531
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,480
then proceed with the proper
betrothal rites,

532
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:24,920
and formally marry you.

533
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:31,319
Mr. Wu,

534
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,039
you and I have only met
three times before.

535
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,720
How can we base a lifetime commitment

536
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,279
on just three meetings?

537
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,240
You treat me sincerely,

538
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:43,119
so I must speak honestly.

539
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,160
I don't wish to marry you

540
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:46,799
or Wei Tingyu.

541
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,599
A bet's a bet, nine taels of silver.

542
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,920
Hand it over.

543
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,759
So he really came to propose.

544
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,039
Why doesn't any young master

545
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,680
ever insist on taking responsibility
for me?

546
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,640
All right, I'll take responsibility
for you.

547
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:07,000
Let's go.

548
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,599
I am captivated by your character.

549
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,880
I think of you day and night.

550
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,079
I believe

551
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,160
we are kindred spirits.

552
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,160
However, our family backgrounds
are incompatible.

553
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,400
I don't care about status.

554
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,039
You may not care about status,

555
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:30,559
but it does dictate one's life.

556
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:32,359
The poet, Li Yishan once said,

557
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,920
“Washing one's feet in a clear spring,
sipping tea before flowers,

558
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:38,480
these are vulgar acts
that spoil the scenery.”

559
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:40,480
Yet I do so every day,

560
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:42,559
and find it carefree and joyful.

561
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,319
But this kind of joy

562
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,279
is not permitted by noble families.

563
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,759
I understand, I truly do.

564
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:05,440
What you can't have,

565
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:08,039
you yearn even more.

566
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,440
The fame and pride of noble families

567
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:16,640
is a cage to me.

568
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:20,640
Love, marriage and reputation,

569
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:22,200
all are burdens.

570
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,559
I don't wish to be a virtuous wife.

571
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,039
I only wish for a small boat
in the spring breeze,

572
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,359
flowers by the shore,

573
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,359
and wine in my cup.

574
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,799
I understand.

575
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,400
Because I admire your character,

576
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,000
I will do my utmost to protect you

577
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,720
from those constraints.

578
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:43,720
Mr. Wu,

579
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:46,039
I appreciate your kindness.

580
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,200
But did your grandfather

581
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,279
consult you when he appointed you

582
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:52,440
to the Ministry of Rites?

583
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,000
Even you are not free
to act for yourself.

584
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:01,599
Why think about protecting someone else?

585
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:06,200
I wish you good health

586
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,559
and a flourishing career.

587
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,000
We shan't meet again.

588
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:17,200
Fourth Young Lady...

589
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,680
I made this myself.

590
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,840
It's not only a token of gratitude,

591
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,279
but also a couplet.

592
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:35,720
Please accept it.

593
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:42,559
"Divided by words of a kindred spirit,"

594
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,079
"seeking a bond to soar as one."

595
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,559
"A sincere heart dares to be
tested by simplicity."

596
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:53,079
I'm no good at poetry,

597
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,000
but I know the words "heart" and "dare"
make "simplicity".

598
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,920
It's a brilliant couplet,

599
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:03,640
but unfortunately, it's directed
at the wrong person.

600
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,559
Dou Zhao,

601
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:08,240
weren't you even a little moved?

602
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,400
Love is a two-way street.

603
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:13,680
Stop saying things that will upset Zhao.

604
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,519
"A woman's infatuation
cannot be spoken of."

605
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:20,799
The price of being moved

606
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,400
is too high.

607
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,160
I noticed his hands were calloused.

608
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,839
He must be skilled in woodworking.

609
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:30,119
Yet he never mentioned it

610
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:31,519
in front of others.

611
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:34,359
Craftsmanship is considered lowly work.

612
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,039
Even if he enjoys it,

613
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,559
he has to hide it away.

614
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:40,799
Ladies,

615
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:42,599
the Fifth Young Lady
sent handmade dumplings

616
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:44,319
from the capital.

617
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,240
There's meat dumpling,

618
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,359
sesame dumpling,

619
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,039
and red bean paste dumpling.

620
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,440
Very thoughtful of her.

621
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,039
(The night before the fifteenth,
the moonlight is clear.)

622
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,839
(I miss you and Grandmother dearly,)

623
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,680
(so I made these dumplings for you.)

624
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,240
(I hope they bring joy.)

625
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,079
(Though tonight isn't
the Lantern Festival,)

626
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,039
(I wish the family
is together and whole,)

627
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,279
(like the moon above.)

628
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,920
(I hope we can be reunited soon.)

629
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,240
(Regards, Ming.)

630
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,119
Wang Yingxue doesn't want you
to return to the capital,

631
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,279
but she doesn't seem to share
her mother's feelings

632
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:24,519
and hopes for your return.

633
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,400
Who knows if it's sincere or not?

634
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,000
(After all that's happened,)

635
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:33,400
(refusing marriage to Wei Tingyu,
meeting Wu Shan,)

636
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:35,559
(and Wang Yingxue's
increasing hostility,)

637
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,880
(Dou Ming doesn't seem as hypocritical
as I imagined.)

638
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:43,079
Whether it's sincere or not,

639
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,440
your true home is here.

640
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:47,039
We are your family,

641
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:47,759
right?

642
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:48,880
Right.

643
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,359
The Duke of Jining sent gifts in return.

644
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:57,799
He sent many brushes and ink
to Seventh Master and Fifth Master.

645
00:30:58,319 --> 00:30:59,799
Knowing Fifth Young Lady
loves calligraphy and painting,

646
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:01,240
he sent her premium paper.

647
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,119
This paper is sturdier
than what we usually use.

648
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,680
It's not made from sandalwood bark.

649
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,799
It's made from mulberry bark.

650
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,319
The branches of this tree,
if left to grow,

651
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,079
could shelter people from wind and rain.

652
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,079
Its fruits can fill stomachs
and relieve hunger.

653
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,720
Mulberry bark can also
be made into paper.

654
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,759
The two simply have different purposes.

655
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,559
Why rank one over the other?

656
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,920
People are the same.

657
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,279
What about mulberry bark?

658
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,519
Nothing.

659
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:40,839
Father loves making books.

660
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:42,480
He uses a lot of paper.

661
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:44,200
Send it to Father's study.

662
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:45,920
Yes.

663
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,559
Hurry up.

664
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,319
All right, all right.

665
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,960
Remember

666
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,200
what I just said.

667
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,160
Yes, yes.

668
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,720
Official Wu.

669
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:02,680
Official Wu.

670
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,960
Official Dou.

671
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,960
Recently, the Censorate
and the Six Ministries

672
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,920
rejected my memorials.

673
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,920
I had no choice but to bring them here.

674
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:17,160
The Grand Secretariat
still upholds its integrity.

675
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:22,240
Official Dou, you needn't
trouble yourself.

676
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,400
For the sake of Yingxue and Shiying,

677
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,359
I'll leave you with some advice.

678
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:52,240
"The world is filled with perils
caused by human desires."

679
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:54,880
"How many have been misled
and lost everything?"

680
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,519
Mother.

681
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:35,359
Song Mo.

682
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,079
Uncle's ship has docked today.

683
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,519
I'm heading there with Gu Yu
to meet him.

684
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:44,200
Since you're receiving your uncle,

685
00:33:45,319 --> 00:33:47,839
remember, the Jiang family's reputation
cannot be lost.

686
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,119
Rest assured,

687
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,000
I've made all the arrangements
in the court.

688
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:52,359
Uncle will be fine.

689
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,000
Perhaps he'll meet the Emperor
during the day,

690
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:57,920
and by night, we'll reunite.

691
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,519
The impeachment memorials

692
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,440
have been submitted.

693
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,839
This is the perfect time
for the Emperor and your uncle

694
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,559
to have a proper conversation.

695
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,320
It's a good thing.

696
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,599
Given the Dou family's
questionable behavior,

697
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,719
you still trust
the Fourth Young Lady's words?

698
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,599
You might as well hand yourself
over to the Emperor.

699
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:20,239
We're all players in this game.

700
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,880
Even if she sees me as a chess piece,

701
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,679
who's to say I'm not the one
moving the pieces?

702
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,639
When I meet the Emperor,
I'll explain everything myself.

703
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,280
Traveling by water must
take a toll on Uncle.

704
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:30,679
Prepare to change his dressing.

705
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:35,400
Gu Yu,

706
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,159
isn't that Uncle's sedan chair?

707
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:42,800
Stop!

708
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,039
It's empty.

709
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:52,599
Where is he?

710
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,599
Move aside!

711
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:07,800
Move aside!

712
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:11,800
Sir, you cannot enter.

713
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,639
You dare stop me?

714
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,519
Move aside!

715
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,039
Get out of the way!

716
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:18,239
Sir, you cannot enter.

717
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:19,079
You mustn't enter, Sir!

718
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:19,599
Stop this!

719
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:20,320
Earl Yunyang.

720
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:21,719
(Wang Yuan, Chief Eunuch)
Earl Yunyang.

721
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,440
Earl Yunyang.

722
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,320
We are handling a case.

723
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,559
Do not obstruct official duties.

724
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:25,519
Magistrate Dai.

725
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,239
Eunuch Wang.

726
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,920
What are you both doing here?

727
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,159
Fulfilling our duties.

728
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,320
Yes.

729
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:33,639
Who's up there? I'll go see.

730
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,000
Earl Yunyang,

731
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:36,719
you mustn't go up.

732
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,039
But I insist.

733
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,920
Please...

734
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,639
- Move aside.
- Earl Yunyang.

735
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:40,400
Please, don't.

736
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:40,719
Move aside.

737
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:41,320
Earl Yunyang!

738
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:45,960
Uncle.

739
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,239
Wake up.

740
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,480
Uncle...

741
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:52,679
Wake up.

742
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,639
Uncle!

743
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,920
Why?

744
00:37:06,199 --> 00:37:06,719
How dare you!

745
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,719
How dare you disrupt a case.

746
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,880
Do you have a death wish?

747
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,320
Get out!

748
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,440
General.

749
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,639
General.

750
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,719
The Shadow Guard operates
under imperial orders.

751
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:20,960
Anyone interfering is guilty of treason.

752
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,800
General, please disembark the boat
with Earl Yunyang.

753
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,079
Was the Emperor's order
to bring Duke Ding

754
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,559
safely to the capital,

755
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,320
or to return with his corpse?

756
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:30,920
General,

757
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,679
you mustn't speculate
about the Emperor's intentions.

758
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,559
Duke Ding was assassinated
last night by sea bandits.

759
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,559
The Shadow Guards responsible
for his escort

760
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,960
failed in their duty
and perished as well.

761
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,760
The sea bandits of Dongyu
always slash upwards.

762
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,880
The wound should be wider at the top,

763
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,760
but this is the opposite.

764
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:51,360
Eunuch Wang,

765
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,440
you must know this.

766
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:58,400
Bandits are cunning.

767
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,719
Perhaps this was
deliberate misdirection.

768
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:03,559
Eunuch Wang,

769
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,079
Duke Ding is dead.

770
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,159
Speak the truth.

771
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,760
Duke Ding's death

772
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,440
is not the work
of the Northern Pacification Bureau,

773
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,599
nor was it ordered by the Emperor.

774
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:13,559
The incident happened suddenly,

775
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:15,280
and we have yet to report
to the Emperor.

776
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,040
General, please return to your residence
and await the Emperor's decree.

777
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,880
The Ministry of Imperial Ceremony
will investigate thoroughly

778
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,440
and give you an explanation.

779
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,559
Uncle...

780
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,079
If only I had returned
to the capital with you,

781
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,599
this wouldn't have happened.

782
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,199
We wouldn't have this outcome.

783
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:38,760
You want me to wait?

784
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,280
General!

785
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:41,320
To wait while you fabricate
false charges against my uncle

786
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:43,440
or issue an imperial decree
to exterminate our family?

787
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,880
General, let's not be rash.

788
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,719
Get out!

789
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,440
Song Mo,

790
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,159
what are you doing?

791
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,559
Since the Emperor doesn't know,

792
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:51,719
I will take Eunuch Wang
to report directly to him.

793
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,719
Song Mo, calm down.

794
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:54,400
General.

795
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,039
Let me through!

796
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,280
General...

797
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:13,460
(The Grand Hall)

798
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,580
(Lady Wan, the Empress)

799
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,559
Straighten attire.

800
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:23,360
Prepare to receive the gods.

801
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:25,199
Maintain solemnity.

802
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,960
Compose yourself.

803
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:28,400
Kneel.

804
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:30,440
Bow.

805
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,599
Natural disasters plague the land.

806
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,760
The common people are suffering.

807
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:39,159
This is my fault.

808
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:42,639
I humbly ask for divine protection.

809
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,960
Bless my people.

810
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,559
Let evil be eradicated.

811
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:50,880
Grant peace and prosperity to the land.

812
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,360
Song Mo,

813
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:55,400
that is a capital offense,

814
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:56,400
please think carefully.

815
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,400
If my life can preserve my uncle's honor

816
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,760
and the lives of the Jiang family,

817
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,519
it'll be worth it.

818
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,559
Stand back! Don't come closer!

819
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:08,440
I must see the Emperor!

820
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,360
Stand back.

821
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:12,920
Song Mo?

822
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,599
We're on the same side!

823
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:14,760
The same side!

824
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:15,920
Gu Yu,

825
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:17,280
breaking into the palace

826
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,079
is a capital offense,
why didn't you stop him?

827
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,360
Aunt,

828
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,239
this is urgent.

829
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:21,960
Move aside.

830
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:34,000
A ruler may kill his minister
if he doubts him.

831
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:36,239
If Your Majesty wanted Duke Ding dead,

832
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,239
a cup of poisoned wine would suffice.

833
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:41,239
A man should maintain his dignity
even in death.

834
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:43,760
Why the torture and humiliation?

835
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:45,440
He's already dead.

836
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,480
Why add insult to injury

837
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,760
by claiming he was killed

838
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,760
by the very bandits he dedicated
his life to fighting?

839
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:54,119
I, Song Mo,

840
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,000
demand an answer,

841
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,719
so that I may die without regrets.

842
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:02,039
No matter how great the issue,

843
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,039
it does not justify
such insubordination.

844
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:08,199
Who? Who has died?

845
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,599
Your Majesty,

846
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,360
Duke Ding, Jiang Meisun,

847
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,239
died in the ship's cabin
on his way back.

848
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:17,639
How is this possible?

849
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:21,519
I was waiting for him,

850
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,960
waiting to question him.

851
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:27,199
Who?

852
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:30,880
Who dared to kill him?

853
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:32,199
Who?

854
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:33,360
Your Majesty.

855
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,159
This is my uncle's keepsake,

856
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:41,880
something he shared
with you in the past.

857
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:43,719
Even in his final moments,

858
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,360
he held onto it tightly.

859
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,320
If there is a conspiracy,

860
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,679
I beg Your Majesty to investigate.

861
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:13,119
We were allies,

862
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:15,599
but General Yan's threats to me

863
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:17,000
indicate a different story.

864
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:18,719
Your Majesty!

865
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,480
Arrest this treasonous wretch.

866
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,639
Take him away.

867
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:24,800
What the General has done
is a capital offense.

868
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,039
If you do not eliminate
the problem at its root,

869
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:28,159
it will lead to disaster.
