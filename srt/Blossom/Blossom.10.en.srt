1
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,100
Miao Ansu spoke up for you,

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,410
saying earlier this year

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,509
that sea trade had already peaked

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,999
and it was time
to pull Futing's business out.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,010
It‘s like

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,999
you knew my uncle would die.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,970
Of course not.

8
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,100
In business,

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,060
it's natural to buy low and sell high.

10
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,900
After the big victory at Boat Island,
the trading routes opened up.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,759
Everyone jumped into businesses.

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,410
So I had to look for new opportunities.

13
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,620
Dou Zhao,

14
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,770
your heart is racing right now.

15
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,330
I can tell

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,300
you're hiding something,
and it has to do with me.

17
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,770
Why won't you tell me?

18
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,330
Tell me!

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,450
I...

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,250
If I survive through this,

21
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,780
I promise to explain everything.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,450
I will trust you one more time.

23
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,249
I'm Ji Yong, the Secretary
of the Bureau of the Waterways.

24
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,760
The Miao raised funds to build ships
but hasn't repaid the debt.

25
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,170
I was sent by the Futing
Provincial Administration Commission

26
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,860
to interrogate Dou Zhao and Miao Ansu

27
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,500
for the Miao family's shipping case.

28
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,379
=Blossom=
(Adapted from the novel "Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

29
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,880
=Episode 10=

30
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,700
Young Lady!

31
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,959
He's on our side.

32
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,399
If we're going to act, do it right.

33
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,580
Miss Dou,

34
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,580
you're quite capable.

35
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,730
You've got people everywhere
risking their lives for you.

36
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,770
But too bad, you're in my hands now.

37
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,490
No one can save you now!

38
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,730
That's wrong.

39
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,959
You overstep your authority
and question her in private.

40
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,210
You're the one
who has fallen into my hands.

41
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,869
You, a seven-rank Secretary of
the Ministry of Works are investigating

42
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,399
the Provincial Judicial Office
and Maritime Trade Bureau's case.

43
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,210
Who's really overstepping here?

44
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,950
The Provincial Administration Commission
governs the entire province.

45
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,799
I'm acting under official orders.

46
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,420
By reason and by law, I can be here.

47
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,420
But you?

48
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,170
You're caught red-handed
for coercing confessions.

49
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,610
You think you can stop me

50
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,999
with that?

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,490
I haven't even started.

52
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,610
Watch and learn.

53
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,019
Ji Yong!

54
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,559
Official Ji!

55
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,330
Sir, someone's been stabbed.

56
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,220
You attacked a court official.

57
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,370
You'll face charges for this!

58
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,930
Young Lady, watch out!

59
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,050
Come on, make it big.

60
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,479
It would be best if someone died.

61
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,220
I won't be blamed anyway.

62
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,100
Song Mo, stop it!

63
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,890
Young Lady,
be careful not to hurt yourself.

64
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,919
Enough watching. Let's go.

65
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,930
Let her go!

66
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,220
Help me walk.

67
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,100
Yes, sir.

68
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,130
Good thing we prepared

69
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,130
to confuse Ding Wei.

70
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,460
You knew we were putting on a show?

71
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,679
The prison guard told me that Lord Song wanted
to interrogate you himself.

72
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,799
So I'm betting he's smart enough

73
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,930
to see through Ding Wei's setup.

74
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,340
I'm not like you,

75
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,900
who'd die

76
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,220
for beauty wherever you go.

77
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,420
He's still here. Scold me.

78
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,180
Shameless rogue.

79
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,949
What's the problem,
you troublemaker mantis?

80
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,250
Go ahead, kill me if you dare.

81
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,900
Looks like they're doing this for real.

82
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,130
Notify the rest

83
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,490
not to rush in.

84
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,479
Go in when they've had enough.

85
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,170
Yes, sir. I'll notify them.

86
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,429
Kill me if you dare!

87
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,130
- You think I don't dare?
- Kill me, then!

88
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,020
They're gone.

89
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,690
All right. It's over.

90
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,100
They're already gone.

91
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,420
Thank you for your help.

92
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,719
Sulan,

93
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,100
go and check on Su.

94
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,269
Stay alert.

95
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,399
- Let us know if someone's coming.
- Yes, Young Lady.

96
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,130
It will leave a scar
if you don't get it treated soon.

97
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,220
Have you applied the medicine?

98
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,799
The military-grade stuff

99
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,220
only stops the bleeding.

100
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,100
I've got a real remedy here.

101
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,269
People say you're sharp

102
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,570
but cold-hearted.

103
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,999
Seeing

104
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,220
you risked your life
for Fourth Young Lady,

105
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,340
you sure are head over heels for her.

106
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,999
I've known her

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,559
since we were kids.

108
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,930
She's my confidante, my soulmate.

109
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,730
She's naturally different
from everyone else.

110
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,690
You wouldn't understand.

111
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,100
Here.

112
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,420
Something feels off.

113
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,860
We shouldn't have let Ji Yong in.

114
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,980
What if he clashes with Deputy Marshal?

115
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,599
The Deputy Marshal told us

116
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,389
to watch Ding Wei closely

117
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,900
and avoid causing trouble.

118
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,130
I'm only worried about Deputy Marshal.

119
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,020
As soon as we arrived in Futing

120
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,199
and found out Fourth Young Lady
was being interrogated,

121
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,690
he couldn't wait but rushed into the prison
to rescue her.

122
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,389
Zheng,

123
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,050
can't you see?

124
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,599
The Deputy Marshal is falling
for Fourth Young Lady.

125
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,420
You...

126
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,100
Do you think he's as foolish as you?

127
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,749
That was interesting.

128
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,810
Sir, this way.

129
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,540
The night Uncle died,

130
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,810
someone saw Ding Wei leaving
his residence late at night.

131
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,800
But that's not solid proof.

132
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,899
However, Ding Wei falsely accusing the Miao
family of colluding with enemies is

133
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,039
just a case of the thief crying thief.

134
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,330
It exposes his own crime instead.

135
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,780
If we can force a confession,

136
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,690
we can take this to the emperor
and convict him.

137
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,559
Ding Wei found

138
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,860
those bandit's blades
on the Miao family's ship.

139
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,260
The Ministry of Imperial Ceremony
is investigating this.

140
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,540
So Ding Wei is rushing
to find a scapegoat.

141
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,050
I've looked into him.

142
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,189
He's been selling
the relief food for money

143
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,810
and exploiting the people.

144
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,370
Now he's anxiously trying
to frame the Miao family.

145
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,719
The deeper we dig,

146
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,020
the more dirty secrets we'll uncover.

147
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,930
If I can board that ship,

148
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,780
I'll find the answers we need.

149
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,290
I have to go.

150
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,450
It's not only about clearing
the Duke of Ding's name,

151
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,520
but also the Miao family's.

152
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,610
I'm going too.

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,900
What?

154
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,170
Are you both planning
to board the ship together?

155
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,900
Let's do it this way.

156
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,090
I'll pretend to lick Ding Wei's boot

157
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,660
and steal his official badge
over drinks.

158
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,620
Let's hope Mantis Song
doesn't drag us down.

159
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,260
(The Maritime Trade Bureau Badge)
I've talked to Eunuch Ding.

160
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,999
Since this is about retrieving jewelry
from the ship,

161
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,170
please wait here.

162
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,500
What do you mean?

163
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:24,930
You dare to stop me?

164
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,480
Please calm down, Your Lordship.

165
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,330
Eunuch Ding explicitly ordered

166
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,540
that no one was to board the ship.

167
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:36,380
Sir,

168
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,660
it's all clearly written
on this document.

169
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,380
The ship was detained

170
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,359
when I had a shipment

171
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,570
of jewelry from the West.

172
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,050
They're worth a fortune.

173
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,930
If I don't get them back this time,

174
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,540
Madams will never let me off easy.

175
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,690
Comfort me.

176
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,549
There.

177
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,050
It's all right. Don't cry.

178
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,389
My precious little sunshine,

179
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,389
don't cry.

180
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,500
Did you hear that?

181
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,119
We only want to collect
some jewelry on the ship.

182
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,210
Why are you still in my way?

183
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,500
Calm down, Your Lordship.

184
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,300
But the ship is still sealed.

185
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,389
Perhaps I can send some men

186
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:18,760
to escort the young lady and you
to search for the jewelry.

187
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,930
Sir,

188
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:26,210
do you take me for a criminal?

189
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,500
Exactly!

190
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,090
With so many people following us,
it's no fun at all.

191
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,749
Can't you be more tactful?

192
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,850
No offense, none at all.

193
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,020
It's just that we can't make that call.

194
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,780
How about now?

195
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,780
Then...

196
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,450
How about this?

197
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,540
I'll only let him

198
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,319
guide you to the cargo hold
to find the jewelry.

199
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,549
One and a half hours

200
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,930
should be enough.

201
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,380
Fine.

202
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,330
Let's go.

203
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,330
What "Young General"?

204
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,970
More like a lovesick fool to me.

205
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,210
Your Lordship, over here.

206
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,210
Are you done
with your little act of charm?

207
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,509
Even real couples

208
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,540
don't cling to each other
every second of the day.

209
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,970
You're usually calm and composed.

210
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,749
But when it comes to acting out

211
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,500
love and romance,

212
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,050
you look like an amateur.

213
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,389
Real married couples
are respectful and polite.

214
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,149
But lovers are different.

215
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,439
They're all always clinging
to each other.

216
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,300
They won't take their eyes
off each other even for a moment.

217
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:45,040
♪I want to hide like the moon,
like a butterfly drawn to flowers♪

218
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,810
Is this enough?

219
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,970
You're a quick learner.

220
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:58,400
♪Like ink drops fading into my heart
that turns to longing♪

221
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:05,280
♪No battle tires me,
for I return to you with every thought♪

222
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,190
Working the night shift
is already hard enough.

223
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,420
Now, you're making
a single guy like me watch this.

224
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,970
At least you two can hug to keep warm.

225
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,050
What about me?

226
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,970
This ship has a draft of five meters.

227
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,970
The route back
to the capital is shallow.

228
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,549
Unbelievable.

229
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,970
This ship will surely run aground.

230
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,090
This ship is so unstable.

231
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,970
It's obvious someone removed
the ballast to destabilize it.

232
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,970
Ding Wei tried to cover it up.
It's solid evidence.

233
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,620
It's not enough.

234
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,669
Not enough?

235
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,660
Your Lordship,

236
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,740
one-quarter of the hour has passed.

237
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,620
Isn't stargazing
and moon-watching enough by now?

238
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,500
You should start looking
for those jewelry.

239
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,540
Lead us to the cargo hold.

240
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,239
Your Lordship, hurry up and find them.

241
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,690
So I can report back.

242
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,050
If someone comes later,

243
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:03,199
I'll distract them
while you sneak off the ship.

244
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,050
All right.

245
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,740
These fruits are covered in mold.

246
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,500
So is this bronze stove.

247
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,660
Yet the blades we saw that day
only had bloodstains.

248
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,050
There were no signs of corrosion.

249
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,330
It doesn't matter. None of it matters.

250
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,450
Good evening, sir.

251
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,090
Who's up there?

252
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,789
His Lordship and a courtesan.

253
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,990
They went to retrieve
their jewelry in the cargo hold.

254
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,599
Why did you give them the permission?

255
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,660
They had Eunuch Ding's
official document and badge.

256
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,500
Useless fools.

257
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,149
You guys, come with me.

258
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,090
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

259
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,300
These tea leaves are moldy too.

260
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,850
It proves the bandit's blades
weren't on the ship at all.

261
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,570
They were planted later.

262
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,140
This could all be used as evidence.

263
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,540
Song Mo.

264
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,930
Women can be as capable as men.

265
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,140
In books,
there are beauties like Yan Ruyu.

266
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,740
(It's him.)

267
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,090
Someone's coming.

268
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,300
Prepare yourselves.

269
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,660
Kill anyone who comes out

270
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,040
of that exit.

271
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:10,999
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

272
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,380
But that's a Duke's son.

273
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,930
I said kill anyone who comes out.

274
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,389
You there.

275
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,170
Get down there.

276
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:08,500
They're over there!

277
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,170
Take them down!

278
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,210
Bring the bows!

279
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,620
Jump!

280
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,930
Sir,

281
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,029
Song Mo and a woman boarded the ship

282
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,199
and went straight to the helm.

283
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,900
They were clearly investigating
the case.

284
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,020
Sir,

285
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,620
the blades were planted too hastily.

286
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,130
I'm afraid they'll find something.

287
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,940
Have they found a clue?

288
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,940
(What if I can get Dou Zhao to confess)

289
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,940
(that Miao Ansu
is behind the collusion?)

290
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,050
(Then)

291
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,330
(I'll report it to His Majesty)

292
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,500
(and secure your credit for it.)

293
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,370
Shoot, I fell for his trick.

294
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,180
Also, Eunuch Wang has arrived
at the Provincial Judicial Office.

295
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,220
He's summoned you to report immediately.

296
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,700
You can leave now.

297
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,460
Yes, sir.

298
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,780
I can't. How can I go?

299
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,850
All right.

300
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,509
Hurry home and pack up the valuables.

301
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,850
We need to leave.

302
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,439
Just go and do as I say.

303
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,370
All right.

304
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,180
Oh, no. I'm done for this time.

305
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:29,890
You're heavily injured.

306
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,220
It is only a scratch.

307
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,260
The arrow didn't go deep.

308
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,700
Let me help you bandage it.

309
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,940
No need.

310
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,020
I've always done it myself.

311
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,610
That won't do.

312
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,410
Just trust me.

313
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,130
Come here.

314
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,740
Are you shy?

315
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,780
Shy? Me? Don't be ridiculous.

316
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,740
Please bear with the pain a little.

317
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,780
If you can't, just scream.

318
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,850
"The Life of Luo Shan."

319
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,370
Miss Dou,

320
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,370
have you watched that play?

321
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,019
- Marvelous!
- Nice!

322
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:33,760
♪A lone eagle lands on the eaves,
the moonlight shining on the steps♪

323
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,810
(He shielded me from the arrow again.)

324
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,130
(But this time, neither of us died.)

325
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,810
No, I haven't.

326
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:55,069
♪Does the pain bind us tighter?♪

327
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,740
You didn't come aboard to find evidence.

328
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,360
You must already knew
that Ding Wei falsified everything.

329
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,109
Why did you put up an act with me

330
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,780
instead of arresting him outright?

331
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,050
Someone like Ding Wei

332
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,130
doesn't have the power
to kill Duke of Ding.

333
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,410
Did you notice
the archers on the ship today?

334
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,810
They were highly trained

335
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,610
and far from ordinary soldiers.

336
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,540
The mastermind behind this
must still be hiding.

337
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,650
Ding Wei is just a pawn.

338
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,540
You're using this move to lure them out.

339
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,260
Ding Wei knows of his crimes
and will definitely flee.

340
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,980
We must hurry back now.

341
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,890
Don't worry.

342
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,050
That's what I wanted.

343
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,399
Sir, I packed whatever I could.

344
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,309
No one noticed.

345
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,370
All right.

346
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,500
Sir.

347
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,780
Sir, which direction are we heading?

348
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,349
Any direction.

349
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,220
Just go.

350
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,090
Come on, let's go.

351
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,330
Sir...

352
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,300
Why are we stopping?

353
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,540
Turn around now!

354
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,890
Hurry!

355
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,410
I'm trapped.

356
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,260
Why do they look the same?

357
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,850
Su!

358
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,959
Fourth Young Lady instructed me
to get you out of here

359
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,209
if she didn't return by morning.

360
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:43,890
Let's go.

361
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,570
Get up slowly.

362
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,069
How dare you

363
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,090
break a prisoner out?

364
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,410
Stop!

365
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,130
Ding Wei falsified evidence

366
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,850
and is now fleeing with stolen goods.

367
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,490
This case will now be handled
by the Northern Pacification Bureau.

368
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,410
But, sir.

369
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,239
This woman has already signed
a confession.

370
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,570
We can't release her.

371
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,130
You're impressively stupid.

372
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,220
If she signed a confession,

373
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,980
there's bound
to be a letter retracting it.

374
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,300
If you don't release her,

375
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,370
are you planning
to share Ding Wei's crimes?

376
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,370
Release her now!

377
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,260
Are you all right?

378
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,410
Let me see.

379
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,850
I'm fine.

380
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,370
Thankfully, your fingers are unharmed.

381
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,050
Zhao,

382
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,330
I didn't betray you.

383
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,500
I know.

384
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,220
The charges against the Miao family
have been cleared.

385
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,890
You don't need
to take the blame anymore.

386
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,650
I'll take you home.

387
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,740
Come.

388
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,850
- Stay where you are!
- Young Lady!

389
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,850
Or I'll end her life with one strike.

390
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:26,300
The Duke's case is a massive affair.

391
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,370
From the Maritime Trade Bureau

392
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,540
to the Provincial Judicial Office,
and the Grand Coordinator Office yamen.

393
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,460
Who isn't under pressure?

394
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:36,090
Everyone wants this case closed.

395
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,500
Where are your men now?

396
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,130
They were flaunting
their power here that day.

397
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,890
Why haven't they come to rescue you?

398
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,740
Don't they care about your life?

399
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:49,919
I was too anxious

400
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,260
and got deceived by their lies!

401
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,589
But the Miao family members
are already in custody.

402
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,220
If they're released now,

403
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,570
how will the authorities face anyone?

404
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:01,700
Should the people
of Futing revolt or not?

405
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,940
Eunuch Ding,

406
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,610
you're truly a slippery eel
in the officialdom.

407
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,610
Even in a stagnant pond,

408
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,850
you can still find a way
to wriggle out and escape.

409
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,780
But my life is ultimately

410
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,980
in the hands of His Majesty
and Eunuch Wang.

411
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,700
Lord Song, your thirst for revenge

412
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,940
has clouded your judgment.

413
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,370
Eunuch Wang will see to it
that justice is served.

414
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,300
At this point,

415
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,029
continuing your act

416
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,500
is pointless, don't you think?

417
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,850
Tell me.

418
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,890
Who is the mastermind behind all this?

419
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,810
This matter has nothing to do with me!

420
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,780
What mastermind are you talking about?

421
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,940
Have you heard

422
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,780
about my skills using the blade?

423
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,570
General Song,

424
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,180
Duke of Ding is already dead.

425
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,540
Are you really willing

426
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,439
to risk

427
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,980
your career and life for this?

428
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,500
The human body has over
a hundred pressure points

429
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,260
and dozens of joints.

430
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,650
Do you know

431
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,180
which ones hurt the most?

432
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,220
This is just the first cut.

433
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,959
Fine! I'll tell.

434
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,940
I'll tell you.

435
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,890
I'm castrated.

436
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,890
My nephew is the only one left
to carry the bloodline.

437
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,879
A few years ago,
he was foolish to smuggle salt

438
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,399
and was caught by the Duke of Ding.

439
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,890
I begged and pleaded
with the Duke to spare his life.

440
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:38,540
I was also fine
even if he was exiled as punishment.

441
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,479
But he showed no mercy.

442
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,610
My family line ended because of him.

443
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,410
So

444
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,810
when he was being escorted
to the capital,

445
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,509
I seized the chance for revenge.

446
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,199
Stop trying to fool me

447
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,260
with half-truths.

448
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,540
The Duke's ship was guarded
by skilled Shadow Guards.

449
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,589
How could your useless lackeys

450
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,740
have succeeded?

451
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,220
I'll ask one more time.

452
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,300
Who is the mastermind?

453
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,410
Who lent you the assassins?

454
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,610
It was revenge for ending
my family line.

455
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,500
No one ordered me.

456
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:15,380
Is it the Chief Military Commission
or the Ministry of Imperial Ceremony?

457
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,090
Even if you say nothing,

458
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,370
as long as your heart is beating,

459
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,439
your muscles are moving,

460
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,050
and your face shows any expression,

461
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,780
I can guess most of it.

462
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,749
You received help from both

463
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,700
but they aren't the masterminds.
Am I right?

464
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,940
Someone from the Grand Secretariat?

465
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,740
Or maybe a member
of the imperial family?

466
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,940
You'd rather sever your tongue
than talk.

467
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,780
Then let's trade your life
for the truth.

468
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,650
Finally, you've shown up.

469
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,260
Drop your bow

470
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,050
or your precious woman
will pay the price

471
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,180
for your recklessness.

472
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,130
They actually believed the act
we've been playing.

473
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,500
I have nothing to do with this case

474
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,780
nor acquainted with him.

475
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,460
You've got the wrong person.

476
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,090
Stop pretending.

477
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,740
Song,

478
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,460
I know she's your woman.

479
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:43,410
What do you think

480
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,890
about trading her life
for Ding Wei's life?

481
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,410
She's just a pawn to me.

482
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,260
Her death means nothing.

483
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,789
You're lying!

484
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,130
Do you want to bet?

485
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,180
She has a frail little body.

486
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:00,610
It's as easy to pierce as paper.

487
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,050
Miss Dou,

488
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,180
I'll play a song in memory

489
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,850
of you to show my respect every year

490
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,650
during Qingming Festival.

491
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,560
A forehand strike, then a downward slash
from the upper right.

492
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:11,260
No wonder the wound is narrow
at the top and wide at the bottom.

493
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,130
It was you who killed Uncle.

494
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,810
Getting involved with Song Yuantang
always means trouble.

495
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,509
Do you think he'd care

496
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,789
about our Young Lady's life

497
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,740
when he risked everything
for the Duke of Ding?

498
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,700
I care.

499
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,370
So I'll go and save her.

500
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,960
(Imperial Edict)

501
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:57,220
I wanted to use Ding Wei as bait
to lure them out.

502
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,180
I didn't mean for you
to get caught up in this.

503
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,050
I'm sorry.

504
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,780
You helped me
and the Miao family get out of trouble.

505
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,850
Of course,
they think we're on the same side.

506
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,220
This isn't your fault.

507
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,300
Why are your hands shaking?

508
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,810
I'm fine.

509
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,090
Getting aimed by arrows twice
in two days

510
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:25,300
would scare any average person.

511
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,810
But

512
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:31,540
you're no average person.

513
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,180
When I was a child,

514
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:44,130
I had a dream
about being shot by an arrow.

515
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,650
A dream?

516
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,330
Those men are stalling you.

517
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,239
Their real plan
was to set the ship on fire

518
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,500
and silence everyone.

519
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,740
You didn't think I might be waiting
for them to do just that?

520
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,399
Drop your weapons.

521
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,810
Then I'll spare your lives.

522
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,349
You had this planned all along?

523
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,180
It's hard to pry the truth
out of one person.

524
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,610
But much easier with a group.

525
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,610
Next time we meet,

526
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,260
you'll have to tell me about your dream.

527
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,180
Are you all right?

528
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,180
I know you didn't plan
on making it out alive.

529
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,090
But living

530
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,410
beats dying a slow, miserable death.

531
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,540
A thousand cuts

532
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:07,410
can't match the gratitude
I owe my master.

533
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,890
Fine!

534
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,300
You're all brave, loyal men.

535
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,780
But are your parents,
your wives, and your children

536
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,700
as unyielding as you?

537
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,740
If we can't find your master,

538
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,090
do you think

539
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,890
we can't find your family?

540
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,500
Our Deputy Marshal is fair and just.

541
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:33,370
The Duke of Ding's death

542
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,980
wasn't your fault
as you were just following orders.

543
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,850
But now that you're captured alive,

544
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,589
think about what your master

545
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:41,460
will do to your family.

546
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,850
Give up the mastermind,

547
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,740
and I'll protect your loved ones.

548
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:48,700
A kindness this great,

549
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,980
I, Song Mo,

550
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,180
can afford to offer!

551
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,130
My daughter is only four...

552
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,500
I'll talk.

553
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,410
I'll tell you.

554
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,410
Tell us.

555
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,100
Dou Zhao!

556
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,010
Young Lady!

557
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,359
Eunuch Wang.

558
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,229
Are you hurt?

559
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,700
These men are the assassins
who boarded the ship to kill.

560
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,140
They're about to speak.

561
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,780
After a thorough interrogation
overnight, the truth will come out.

562
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,780
Lord Song,
you're truly brilliant and resourceful.

563
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:31,890
Thank you for your efforts.

564
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,709
Fourth Young Lady Dou,
I hope you weren't too shaken.

565
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,759
Official Ji,

566
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,850
please send her home first.

567
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,700
Come on.

568
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,709
Your Lordship,

569
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:49,479
come to the Provincial Judicial Office
for an interrogation

570
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:53,260
and to officially record your testimony.

571
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,300
Of course.

572
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,060
Lu Ming.

573
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:56,629
Yes, sir.

574
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,260
Hand them over.

575
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:58,990
Sheathe your weapons!

576
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,300
Wang Yuan, how dare you!

577
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,370
What are you doing?

578
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,370
It has been determined

579
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,780
that Duke of Ding and his clan
were involved in treasonous actions.

580
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,479
All male members are to be exiled,

581
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,930
and the women returned
to their ancestral home.

582
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:53,999
Duke of Ding's death
was solely Ding Wei's doing.

583
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,060
This case is now closed.

584
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,010
This is justice?

585
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,220
At least the Jiang family's lives
were spared.

586
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,300
You're here to silence the witnesses.

587
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,780
Song Mo, heir to the Duke of Ying,

588
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,100
obstructed official duties.

589
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,540
You are hereby ordered
to return to the capital immediately.

590
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,700
This is the imperial decree.

591
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,410
You...

592
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:23,850
Your every word and action
represents His Majesty.

593
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,300
His Majesty knows there's a hidden truth
behind Duke of Ding's death.

594
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,140
Why?

595
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,180
Why did you silence these witnesses?

596
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,100
Why are you covering up the truth?

597
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,260
What kind

598
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,410
of truth is so unbearable to reveal?

599
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,999
I am deeply indebted to His Majesty.

600
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,300
My life was never mine to have.

601
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,140
If you must vent your anger,

602
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,810
you can take my life.

603
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,330
But if you wish to uncover the truth,

604
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,330
not only the Jiang family,

605
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:00,260
but the Song family,

606
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,260
and even these elites from the Ding Army
who are defying orders,

607
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,370
will all pay the price.

608
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,060
The emperor shared decades
of friendship with Duke of Ding.

609
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,140
Planting seeds of doubt
in His Majesty's heart is nearly impossible.

610
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,279
Who could have commanded

611
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,790
someone like Ding Wei,
a man under the inner palace's control?

612
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:31,930
Only someone of unparalleled status
could mobilize such forces.

613
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,069
This person

614
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,450
isn't someone we can against.

615
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,300
Tell me why!

616
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,100
There is no why.

617
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,660
From the moment Ding Wei entered
the palace at aged seven

618
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:07,260
and addressed me as his godfather,

619
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,740
he has attended to me for twenty years.

620
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,890
If there had been any way to save him,

621
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:17,810
do you think I would have let him die?

622
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:21,450
Lightning and rain alike
are the emperor's grace.

623
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:25,700
If the ruler wants his subject to die,
to refuse is disloyalty.

624
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,580
Your Lordship,

625
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,700
I had no choice.

626
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,930
But you still do.

627
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,660
Get up!

628
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,390
Marshal spent his life safeguarding
the nation on the battlefield.

629
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,890
Why should he die in disgrace
and bear such a stain on his name?

630
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:34,620
(The Ding Army fought to repel enemies
and secure peace for the land.)

631
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,669
(They are the pillars of the court
and the backbone of the nation.)

632
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:41,109
By imperial decree,
I grant you this pair of twin blades

633
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:43,620
to honor your great victory.

634
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,069
- This is the imperial decree.
- Your Majesty,

635
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:47,549
I still prefer using the one

636
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,799
you personally forged for me

637
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,220
before your ascension to the throne.

638
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,100
I fear I might not get used
to these twin blades.

639
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,490
I came to reward the troops.

640
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,149
You reject my gift in front of everyone?

641
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,620
What about my imperial dignity?

642
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,970
You're right.

643
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:06,180
Then grant them to my successor.

644
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,970
Young Song Mo,

645
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,740
One saber for loyalty.

646
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,140
Take them.

647
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,780
The other, for filial piety.

648
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,399
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

649
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,069
I will uphold the Ding Army's legacy,

650
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,279
carry on my uncle's mantle,

651
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,620
and serve the court with loyalty
to repay imperial favor!

652
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,100
What loyalty is left

653
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,850
to give?

654
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,060
What country is there

655
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,450
to serve?

656
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,740
What purpose does it serve

657
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,520
to hold the borders
and protect the people?

658
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,450
(A lone young swan)

659
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,140
(beneath a boundless sky.)

660
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,410
(No wonder he only wielded his spear)

661
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,100
(that night)

662
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,370
(instead of the twin blades.)

663
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,580
(So this was the day)

664
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,410
(everything changed.)

665
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,360
(The day he abandoned
loyalty and filial piety)

666
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,220
(after his spirit was crushed,)

667
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,370
(clinging only to vengeance.)

668
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,370
This is an imperial gift.

669
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:24,740
Damaging it would be a crime
of great disrespect.

670
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:29,970
An emperor's affection is fleeting.
His justice is a facade.

671
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,970
Why should I remain loyal?

672
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,620
If Heaven wrongs me,

673
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:37,930
I shall defy Heaven.

674
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,740
If the path betrays me,

675
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,660
I shall renounce the path.

676
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:44,450
If loyal ministers and valiant generals
can die unjustly,

677
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,740
then why not let me, Song Mo,

678
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,450
become a traitor too?

679
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,460
This is the pass
required to retrieve the boat.

680
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,700
Take it and leave.

681
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,660
I won't drag you into this anymore.

682
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,100
All right.

683
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,700
Then let us never meet again.

684
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,260
My body is poisoned,
and my days are numbered.

685
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,620
(I only regret that before my death,
I failed to clear Duke of Ding's name,)

686
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,850
(and implicated you instead.)

687
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:44,700
(Staining your honor
and risking your life.)

688
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,999
Do you understand
the true essence of a blade

689
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,430
is not in the killing but in hiding?

690
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,620
From today on,

691
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:15,490
you are him.

692
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,220
I will pursue the truth to the end
and find the real culprits.

693
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,300
