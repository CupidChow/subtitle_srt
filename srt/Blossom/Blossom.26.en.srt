1
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,320
Spears are different
from swords or blades.

2
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,270
The shaft is eight feet long.

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,899
If you grip the end,
you won't have enough power.

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,070
Hold it in the middle.

5
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,110
Give it a try.

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,320
Ever since Cangbei Gang entered
the city,

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,360
Zhangru's been eager
to learn self-defense.

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,459
But she only let Chen Jia teach her.

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,080
I believe Chen Jia

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,870
wouldn't harm Zhangru.

11
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,110
Are you all right?

12
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,179
Again.

13
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,990
I have to teach you
how to properly handle it.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,960
Don't hurt yourself.

15
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,880
There

16
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,310
are three basic moves,

17
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,179
block, grab, and thrust.

18
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,910
Since you trust Chen Jia so much,

19
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,270
why don't we make a bet?

20
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,150
Let's see who's better
at judging people.

21
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,790
How about six months?

22
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,209
We'll see if you can win.

23
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,350
Deal.

24
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,790
Hold it in the middle.

25
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,160
Further back.

26
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,270
Lower your wrist.

27
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,150
Block, grab, thrust.

28
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,320
Block, grab, thrust.

29
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,430
You're the slowest learner
I've ever taught.

30
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:48,120
So, how many clever young ladies
have you taught before?

31
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,480
I've never taught
any young ladies before.

32
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,489
This move is called threshing wheat!

33
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,880
That one's for cutting pig feed!

34
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,150
And this is hanging laundry!

35
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,769
These moves aren't half bad.

36
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,669
So?

37
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,659
I have plenty of moves.

38
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,299
Who else have you taught?

39
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,790
- No one!
- Who are they?

40
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:06,790
Tell me!

41
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,999
=Blossom=
(Adapted from the novel "Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,260
=Episode 26=

43
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,980
(Baifu Restaurant)

44
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,070
Miss Miao.

45
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,160
Song Han?

46
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,280
What a coincidence.

47
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,950
Wipe your sweat.

48
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,070
You've given me a handkerchief
for the second time now.

49
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,790
Why are you still here this late?

50
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,849
Is this your shop?

51
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,899
Yes.

52
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,950
I'm about to check my nursery.

53
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,360
Would you like to join me?

54
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,800
Follow me.

55
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,470
Here we are.

56
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,640
Did you grow

57
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,590
all these yourself?

58
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,699
Yes.

59
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,470
I planted some new crops
under the night dew.

60
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,230
Ah, yes.

61
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,329
This one here is a bean from the West.

62
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,710
It flowers on the ground,

63
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,019
and after the petals fall,
the branches dip into the soil

64
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,360
and bear fruit.

65
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,000
When you eat it,
it leaves a pleasant aftertaste.

66
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,950
I've heard of it.

67
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,270
In the south, it's called groundnut
because the flowers fall to the ground.

68
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,830
You've been to the South?

69
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,560
There was a music teacher I once knew

70
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,560
who was from the coastal south.

71
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,950
But he's no longer around.

72
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,360
I'll give you

73
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,470
my first batch of peanuts.

74
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,329
I…

75
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,000
Just like these peanuts,

76
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,819
they will eventually bloom

77
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,270
and bear fruit

78
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,830
even though they grow in the dark.

79
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,310
Thank you.

80
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,329
My dear,

81
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,470
time to eat.

82
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,899
You go ahead.

83
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,440
I still need to balance the ledger.

84
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,510
Did you cook all these?

85
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,630
Why did you cook so many dishes?

86
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,969
You've worked hard these days.

87
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,270
So this is a treat for you.

88
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,169
I can't eat all of this by myself.

89
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,499
Wouldn't it be a waste?

90
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,030
If you enjoy it, it's not a waste.

91
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,440
If you can't eat much,

92
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,710
I can make smaller portions next time.

93
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,499
Even a bite from each dish is fine.

94
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,139
I can make plenty of different dishes.

95
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,270
I want you to try them all.

96
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,630
What's the rush?

97
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,070
We have all the time in the world.

98
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,760
I can try them slowly.

99
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,310
What's wrong?

100
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,400
Nothing.

101
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,470
By the way, look at these.

102
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,399
Several shops in the capital.

103
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,980
Across thirteen provinces,

104
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,420
there are iron mines in the north,
kilns in the south,

105
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,860
salt fields in the west,
and tea plantations in the east.

106
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,879
There are several ships

107
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,420
in remote places like Penghu.

108
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,620
I didn't know you were this rich.

109
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,620
Did you think

110
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,679
you married

111
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,460
an impractical poor husband?

112
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,479
My grandfather and mother

113
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,500
were worried
about me being away from home.

114
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,819
So they set up

115
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,260
these businesses for me.

116
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,980
You live simply,

117
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,700
don't spend much on drinks,

118
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,300
and have just a few outfits.

119
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,839
I grew up in the military

120
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,260
and don't have extravagant habits.

121
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,140
My shops have been idle.

122
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,020
So it's better
if I transfer them to you.

123
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,580
They are suitable
for the Zhaowen Bookstore's use.

124
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,260
Transfer everything to me?

125
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,439
I'll ask our head manager

126
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,599
to help you run them.

127
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,980
This way,

128
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,679
you can be hands-off like me

129
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,820
and not have to worry.

130
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,140
Yantang,

131
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,860
why are you suddenly transferring
all this property to me?

132
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,700
Did anything happen?

133
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,879
You're the lady of the house.

134
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,759
You should be managing these.

135
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,639
I've wanted to hand them over
for a while.

136
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,260
Plus, I could use a break.

137
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,839
If we had two or three kids

138
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,180
around with us,

139
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,500
it'd be even better.

140
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,260
I agree...

141
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,660
How about we have a daughter?

142
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,660
Sure.

143
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,540
As long as you're happy.

144
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,780
His Lordship wants us to stay
in the residence.

145
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,900
So don't cause any trouble.

146
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,700
No way.

147
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,500
Even if the Marshal tried
to persuade me,

148
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,760
I'm telling Madam everything.

149
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,119
All right, then.

150
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,119
Go ahead.

151
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,599
Also, decide if you prefer quarrying
in Liaodong

152
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,809
or fishing in Futing.

153
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,279
Do you have a place to go
after His Lordship kicks you out?

154
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,420
Go.

155
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,060
What should I do then?

156
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,239
He either goes out alone

157
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,660
or travels miles for a case.

158
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,820
Are we just letting him run wild?

159
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,500
With his current state,

160
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,660
he might collapse outside one day

161
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,730
- and won't be found.
- Stop talking nonsense.

162
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,940
- Who can't be found?
- Who...

163
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,420
- Madam.
- Madam.

164
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,380
I've seen Official Lu's prescription

165
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,500
and checked Yantang's pulse.

166
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,140
His pulse is strange.

167
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,340
It's hard to say what the problem is,

168
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,020
but something's definitely wrong.

169
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,900
Do you know what's going on?

170
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,340
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

171
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,119
Madam,

172
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,479
since Official Lu said
it was nothing serious,

173
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,780
then it should be fine.

174
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,300
Isn't that so, Lu Ming?

175
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,820
Yes.

176
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,060
What's the surprise? Why so mysterious?

177
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,260
We're almost there. Be careful.

178
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,719
All right.

179
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,039
(Diecui Pavilion)

180
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,999
We're here.

181
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,959
Can I open my eyes now?

182
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,100
Yes.

183
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,140
What's this?

184
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,300
Have a seat.

185
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,460
This is the "Life of Luo Shan"
we watched together when we first met.

186
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,180
In the play, Xu Jizu loses his mother,
seeks revenge on his father,

187
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,020
and is severed from his family.

188
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,300
It is truly unfortunate.

189
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,140
So

190
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,380
I wrote a happy ending for him.

191
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,940
How about you watch it?

192
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,300
But this misfortune follows him
throughout his life,

193
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,100
leaving his soul restless.

194
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,820
The first half of the play
is a tragedy destined by fate.

195
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,940
Can it really be undone?

196
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,220
There's always a way.

197
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,140
Go back to the past
and start all over again?

198
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,860
Though the destruction
of his family can't be repaired,

199
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,300
life isn't just about the first half,

200
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,420
and a person doesn't have
only one family.

201
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,959
That's why I added

202
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,660
a loved one for Xu Jizu.

203
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,380
They built a new home,

204
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,739
a home that keeps

205
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,020
all storms and suffering out.

206
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,060
A home that's priceless and unbreakable.

207
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,580
Yantang,

208
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,220
let's create such a home
for each other too.

209
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,860
Those who've experienced
hardship know better how to cherish it.

210
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,060
Two broken souls can piece together

211
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,580
a complete whole.

212
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,820
Shall we begin the play,
my dear audience?

213
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,180
What's going on?

214
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,460
Ms. Longevity,

215
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,980
you dream of a peaceful life,

216
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,420
enjoying the simple pleasures.

217
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,700
I once thought

218
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,860
I could protect you and keep you safe.

219
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,500
But now

220
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,140
I can't.

221
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,940
All I have left

222
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,580
are battles and revenge.

223
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,540
I've offended half the court,

224
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,620
turning everything upside down.

225
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,380
I know that.

226
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,860
I'll stay with you

227
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,740
through life and death with no regrets.

228
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,540
This turmoil will end someday.

229
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,940
When it's over,

230
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,420
we'll find

231
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,060
a quiet place

232
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,500
and set up a school.

233
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,660
I'll teach literature,
and you'll teach martial arts.

234
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,260
In spring, we'll enjoy the flowers
and go boating.

235
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,460
In autumn,

236
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,340
you can hunt for extra food.

237
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,479
Our children

238
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,620
won't suffer as we did.

239
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,340
We'll have a big family
and grow old together.

240
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,340
Ms. Longevity,

241
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,460
I know

242
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,020
your biggest wish
is to live well in this life.

243
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,980
So don't worry.

244
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,740
I'll clear all obstacles for you.

245
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,180
With or without me,

246
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,980
you can have a good life.

247
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,180
How can I live a good life

248
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,460
without you?

249
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,399
I'm not feeling well.

250
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,540
I should go.

251
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,140
Are you hiding something from me?

252
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,660
I want you to tell me yourself.

253
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,380
Ms. Longevity,

254
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,820
just trust me.

255
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,620
I can give you my life.

256
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,660
But your life is still yours to live...

257
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,740
As long as we're together,

258
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,220
your life

259
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,740
is mine too.

260
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,180
Why make a distinction between us?

261
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,540
Ms. Longevity,

262
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,100
trust me.

263
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,700
Has the play started?

264
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,140
Don't tell me it's over.

265
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,620
Zhao.

266
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,020
Ms. Longevity?

267
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,660
Good lad,

268
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,740
it feels powerful
even with a wooden blade.

269
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,140
Next year, use a real one.

270
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,620
But make sure to hold it steady

271
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,780
and swing down.

272
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,900
Keep practicing.

273
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,620
Mo,

274
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,740
I save you a piece
of peach blossom pastry.

275
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,340
Hidden in the light,
admired for its ink.

276
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,340
How about calling him Song Mo?

277
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,700
That sounds great.

278
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,300
Hey, Mo.

279
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:24,140
("The Life of Luo Shan")

280
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,679
(Exquisite Melodies)
- Good!

281
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,759
The play is excellent.

282
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,980
Too bad it is a tragedy.

283
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,559
Well, not necessarily.

284
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,140
People love to watch plays
because the plays always end up

285
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,679
with a reunion

286
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,260
no matter how deep the grudges.

287
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,300
Life, on the other hand,
is harder than that.

288
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,399
It's a drumstick.

289
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,540
Correct!

290
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,140
I'm surprised you know
about historical weapons.

291
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,860
Could you be a man dressing as a woman?

292
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,940
Well, women can be as capable as men.

293
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,180
Allow me to be bold enough
to guess what's on your mind.

294
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,980
I wonder if I am right.

295
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,500
Allow me to be bold enough
to guess what's on your mind.

296
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,660
I wonder if I am right.

297
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,700
Three years...

298
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,100
One year.

299
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,420
After one year,

300
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,260
my life will end.

301
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,620
What was completed

302
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,780
will be broken.

303
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,020
I gained and then lost.

304
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,940
Do you think hiding it
from me isn't breaking

305
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,660
or losing?

306
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,780
If

307
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,140
you only have a year left to live,

308
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,620
let's spend this year fully
as a married couple.

309
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,780
If you really die

310
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,100
in a year,

311
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,460
my heart will still break

312
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,260
whether we're together or apart now.

313
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,620
So I can't let go.

314
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,900
Every moment of this year,

315
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,420
let's live a day like it's a year.

316
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,580
A year

317
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,380
will be our lifetime.

318
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,780
I won't let my husband

319
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,860
face life and death

320
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,060
all by himself.

I was haunted by nightmares.

There was always a woman
with a lantern who guided me.

327
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,620
I later realized that the woman was you.

328
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,220
You're the one

329
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,100
I'd risk my life to protect,

We've been waiting
and why are you only here now?

Didn't you say you want
to watch the play with us?

337
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,540
The play is already half over.

338
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,580
I used to call you all fools
at the manor.

339
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,820
But it seems

340
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,100
I'm the biggest fool here.

341
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,380
You eat it.

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,580
All right.

343
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,980
Is friendship less

344
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,060
than romantic love?

345
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,159
What's wrong?

346
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,940
I've never seen you like this.

What love? What friendship?

348
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,199
Do you have feelings for Ms. Longevity?

349
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,340
Tell me more.

350
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,159
I don't have time for that.

352
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,380

I'll face any danger

356
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,180
to take her away.

357
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,740
This play is so boring.

358
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,420
How can you even watch it?

359
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,150
Strange as always.

360
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,980

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,860
I'll be the ox for you

375
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,420
this one time.

376
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,220
(Yizhi Hall)

377
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,359
My Lord, Madam.

378
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,239
We caught

379
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,260
this girl sneaking
around the back door of Yizhi Hall.

380
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,759
Have mercy, Your Lordship.

381
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,060
I'm not a bad person.

382
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,409
After Madam passed,

383
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,250
the Duke of Ying let me go back
to my village.

384
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,420
I came to ask for some travel money.

385
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,340
Madam?

386
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,180
You're Li Yaoniang's maidservant?

387
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,060
If you were Li Yaoniang's maidservant,

388
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,900
what were you doing when she died?

389
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,770
That night,
the Second Young Master visited Madam.

390
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,839
I was told to leave

391
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,300
and wasn't in the courtyard.

392
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,140
So I don't know what they talked about.

393
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,020
The next morning,

394
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,100
Madam Li hanged herself.

395
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,860
Are you saying

396
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,199
Song Han visited Li Yaoniang

397
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,820
the night before she died?

398
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,399
How can you not keep an eye on a cat?

399
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,820
Where did it go?

400
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,679
I've sent all the servants

401
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,759
to look for it.

402
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,900
Find it now!

403
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,180
How am I supposed to eat
without that creature?

404
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,980
Yes, Young Master.

405
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,380
The maids at Xixiang Place said

406
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,799
that Song Han has a habit

407
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,820
of feeding the cat before every meal.

408
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,700
It seems

409
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,180
this is more than just feeding the cat.

410
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,260
I'll take care of this.

411
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,580
Don't interfere.

412
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,340
Xingshuang, I told you...

413
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,380
Mo.

414
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,420
Your cat went to Yizhi Hall again.

415
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,940
Yes,

416
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,810
it's just mischievous.

417
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,260
I heard you haven't eaten all day.

418
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,540
Not many people would lose
their appetite

419
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,300
over a cat.

420
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,990
When you've kept it for a long time,

421
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,530
you get attached.

422
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,900
Also, I don't have much
of an appetite today.

423
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,300
Do you have anything to tell me

424
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,500
about my mother's death?

425
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,980
Mo,

426
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,900
what do you mean?

427
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,700
I don't know anything.

428
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,340
I'll give you one last chance.

429
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,580
Do you?

430
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,020
No.

431
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,860
Mo!

432
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,209
Mo!

433
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,759
I really don't know anything.

434
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,780
(Freedom from Worries)

435
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,420
I'll ask you one more time.

436
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,340
Do you have anything to tell me

437
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,140
about my mother's death?

438
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,759
I really don't know

439
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,460
who poisoned Mother.

440
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,220
I never said

441
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,180
Mother was poisoned to death.

442
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,340
I don't want to see a single lie

443
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,660
in your testimony.

444
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,580
This is your last chance

445
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,420
and also the last time I see you.

446
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,780
Mo, stop!

447
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,620
Mo.

448
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,940
If you don't believe me,

449
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,500
I'll prove my innocence with my death.

450
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,590
My Lord.

451
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,639
Mo.

452
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,700
Mo, it really has nothing to do with me.

453
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,500
It was Father.

454
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,460
Father asked me
to deliver medicine to Mother that day.

455
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,100
I didn't suspect anything
and gave it to her.

456
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,860
It was only after she died

457
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,990
that I found out
the medicine I sent to her

458
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,300
was poison.

459
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,460
I was afraid Father would poison me.

460
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,500
So I used the cat to test for poison.

461
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,740
I didn't tell you

462
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,780
because I was afraid our family

463
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,300
would fall apart.

464
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,359
Take him back.

465
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,500
Yes, Your Lordship.

466
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,460
Yantang!

467
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,980
Yantang!

468
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,500
Yantang!

469
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,980
Your pulse is very erratic.

470
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,860
I'm not sure if the poison
has affected your organs.

471
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,220
I'll send for Official Lu.

472
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,700
I'm all right.

473
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,300
There's no need to make a fuss.

474
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,940
It's only a rush of blood.

475
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,780
By the way,

476
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,989
I found some discrepancies

477
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,060
in Xixiang Place's ledger.

478
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,980
So I asked Mr. Chen to take my token

479
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,020
and inquire at the shops we frequent.

480
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,100
It turns out

481
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,999
that during your mother's illness,

482
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,580
the household purchased

483
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,580
large quantities of licorice
several times.

484
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,140
This matches our suspicion

485
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,060
that Mother's illness
was caused by licorice.

486
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,519
Qi Xia's current madness

487
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,300
must be related to her death.

488
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,140
Once Qi Xia regains her sanity,

489
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,020
we'll know what happened.

490
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,220
How do you plan to deal with Song Han?

491
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,820
Maybe I've misunderstood him.

492
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,300
He's just a frightened child.

493
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,999
Father,

494
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,620
how could you do such a thing?

495
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,719
She's my mother.

496
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,420
She's not your mother.

497
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,329
With Shuyao,

498
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,860
the three of us are a true family.

499
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,359
If it weren't for them,

500
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,220
I wouldn't be a child out of wedlock!

501
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,020
I am my mother's son.

502
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,799
I'm not Li Yaoniang's son!

503
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,180
Li Yaoniang was not qualified!

504
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,359
Han, but I am...

505
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,700
Madam Li, please mind your words.

506
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,160
You chose this path for me
as the Second Young Master

507
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,080
of the Duke's household.

508
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,380
Mother, it's time for your medicine.

509
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:44,239
I could have been a dutiful
and honorable son

510
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,380
and brother.

511
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,679
But now I live

512
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,290
in constant danger and unease.

513
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,300
Mother, don't eat it.

514
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,239
You can't eat it.

515
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,740
I don't know anything.

516
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,380
You doted on me the most.

517
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:01,159
No matter what I did wrong,

518
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,559
you would never blame me.

519
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,620
It's the same this time,

520
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,220
right?

521
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,540
You're right, Second Young Master.

522
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,420
I didn't consider it carefully enough.

523
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,420
I wasn't born out of wedlock.

524
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,260
I'm the Second Young Master

525
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:25,820
of the Duke of Ying's household.

526
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,919
Miss Miao,

527
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,340
Second Young Master hasn't eaten
for days.

528
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,660
He still throws the medicine
and drives people away.

529
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,500
Miss Miao, maybe you should leave.

530
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,220
Get out.

531
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,180
This is a snowflake pastry.

532
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,620
It's made
with top-quality flour, steamed,

533
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,980
and soaked in butter.

534
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,500
It's soft and sweet.

535
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,940
This is pepper and salt cake.

536
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,839
It's made with two jin of flour,

537
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,380
half a jin of sesame oil,

538
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,620
and two liang of salt.

539
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,980
It's crispy and fragrant,

540
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,580
spicy and delicious.

541
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,980
This is taro pastry.

542
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,599
It's made with raw taro
and glutinous rice flour.

543
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,990
When it's filled with red bean paste,
it's absolutely heaven.

544
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,380
If you don't like these,

545
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,959
I have other varieties.

546
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,180
I have chive cakes, white pastry cakes,
and sugar oil cakes.

547
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,919
I'm sure there's something you'll like.

548
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,060
Take a look.

549
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,140
Eat slowly or you'll choke.

550
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,580
This medicine is too bitter.

551
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,260
I won't taste it for you.

552
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,599
(Natural Grace and Talent)

553
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,900
By the mandate of heaven,
His Majesty decrees

554
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,739
that Song Mo has done well
in solving the case.

555
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,519
His Majesty is pleased.

556
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,079
(Song's Ancestral Hall)
Song Mo shall be promoted to Commander,

557
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,359
granted the right
to enter the palace with a sword,

558
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,340
and exempt from kneeling.

559
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,300
(Peaceful Family, Thriving Life)
Thus decreed by the Emperor.

560
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,740
Thank you, Your Majesty.

561
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,839
The emperor has another decree.

562
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,900
You can read it yourself, Your Lordship.

563
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,740
Sir, come this way.

564
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,180
What's the matter?

565
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,540
Song Yichun submitted a memorial,

566
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,380
confessing to abusing power
and harming the innocent.

567
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,420
He died of illness

568
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,780
in prison.

569
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,900
(Memorial Tablet of Song Yichun)

570
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,780
Han is still young.

571
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,300
Losing both parents in a short time

572
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,260
is truly hard to bear.

573
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,260
Han isn't the only one

574
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,060
to lose both parents.

575
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,940
My last meeting with Song Yichun ended

576
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,940
our father-son relationship.

577
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,780
From now on,

578
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,620
I only have a deceased mother,

579
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,380
no deceased father.

580
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,660
Once the funeral is over,

581
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,660
this matter will be settled.

582
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,940
What do you plan to do about Han?

583
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,540
Song Yichun wronged my mother.

584
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,420
Han is an innocent victim.

585
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:45,180
Let him continue living
at Xixiang Place.

586
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,580
Moments of happiness are short-lived.

587
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,990
The days gone by are filled
with so much sorrow.

588
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,620
(The past fades into mystery,
its wisdom lost.)

589
00:39:15,621 --> 00:39:19,420
(Yet the east wind stirs,
and rain brings a new dawn.)

590
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,540
Han,

591
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,820
I can't stay with you much longer.

592
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,300
From now on,

593
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,180
you must walk this path on your own.

594
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,980
My advice to you

595
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,020
is to stay away from the court

596
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,940
and live a simple life.

597
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,980
If being a commoner is so good,

598
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,780
why did you insist on becoming a Duke?

599
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,260
It's fine if you ruin your own life.

600
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,380
But why take away my chance
to climb higher?

601
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,140
I did it all

602
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,540
for your best interests.

603
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,540
How is this my best interests?

604
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,279
If you hadn't insisted on revealing
my lineage,

605
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,220
our family wouldn't have been destroyed.

606
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,220
I ended up in this miserable state

607
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:13,670
because of you!

608
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,020
You...

609
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,220
Father... Father.

610
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,380
What's the matter, Father?

611
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,340
- Father.
- My medicine.

612
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,860
My medicine...

613
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,319
(Memorial Tablet of Song Yichun)
(Father,)

614
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,500
(you had average achievements
all your life,)

615
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,820
(but you died with honor.)

616
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,220
(I'll carry on)

617
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,100
(your unfinished business.)

618
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,220
(Song's Ancestral Hall)

619
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:08,060
By the emperor's decree,

620
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,340
former Duke Song Yichun
was stripped of his title

621
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,780
(Meritorious Service)
for his crimes.

622
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,100
His demise has cleared his offenses.

623
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,940
His eldest son, Song Mo,
known for his virtue and loyalty,

624
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,260
and assist the nation with propriety,

625
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,300
shall inherit the title of Duke of Ying.

626
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:32,179
His wife, Dou Zhao,
is conferred the title Duchess of Ying.

627
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,620
Your Graces.

628
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,180
Your Graces.

629
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,260
Yantang,

630
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,079
the whole household

631
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,460
will be relying on you now.

632
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,380
You're being overly courteous.

633
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,459
We watched them grow up.

634
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,980
How can they not be filial to us?

635
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,460
First Aunt,

636
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,940
I don't recall us being
this close before.

637
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,580
Zhao,

638
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,959
I made new clothes for you.

639
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,380
See if you like them.

640
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,100
The ceremony is over.

641
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,620
The Duchess has other duties
to attend to.

642
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,300
Excuse us.

643
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,159
Third Aunt,

644
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,740
I apologize on behalf of Sister-in-law.

645
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,700
Brother has just been appointed Duke

646
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,700
and surely has much to handle.

647
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,399
Who does Dou Zhao think she is?

648
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,660
Acting so high and mighty.

649
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,799
Does she not know
how she became Duchess?

650
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,959
It was because Song Mo forced

651
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,780
his father to death in prison!

652
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,980
Enough, you should stop talking.

653
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,100
With this couple around,

654
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,020
we will have a hard time from now on.

655
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,759
If we don't get rid of Song Mo,

656
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,800
he will always be a threat.

657
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,760
If we can't make a move
against him on the court,

658
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:04,039
we'll strike from his household.

659
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,359
The Snow Ganoderma of Liaodong blooms
only once every 300 years.

660
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,990
It can bring people back
from the brink of death.

661
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,759
You are wise and astute.

662
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,159
If you won't be my ally,

663
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,119
