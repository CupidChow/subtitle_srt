1
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,180
Someone.

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,260
I want to see Dou Shishu.

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,340
I want to see Grandfather.

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,100
Official Wu had a good reputation
all his life.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,039
Because of you,
his reputation is ruined.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,720
He's too embarrassed
to show himself here.

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,719
Since this is Fifth Master's order,

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,170
Seventh Master, please be quick.

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,480
Please don't put me on the spot.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,700
Sure.

11
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,740
Seventh Master,

12
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,850
what orders did
Dou Shishu give you this time?

13
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,330
Mr. Wu,

14
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,290
it's me.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,490
Fourth Young Lady?

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,719
You guys can have a chat.

17
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,130
I'll feed the guards some soup.

18
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,900
Be careful!

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,700
We meet again.

20
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,220
This is the sixth time.

21
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,090
Mr. Wu,

22
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,660
did you know that it was a trap?

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,170
That possibility occurred to me once.

24
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,530
But what if it wasn't a trap?

25
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,100
Even if there's only a sliver of chance,

26
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,580
I'll grab it to save your life.

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,500
I don't regret saving you.

28
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,410
It's just that I've let
Grandfather down.

29
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,740
You would've led a peaceful life

30
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,100
like usual

31
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,940
if you hadn't encountered me.

32
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,890
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,610
You were implicated because of me.

34
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,439
That's not true.

35
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,170
I'm very lucky to encounter you.

36
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,500
If I didn't encounter you,

37
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,660
I'm afraid I would've led
a boring and simple life.

38
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,900
Fourth Young Lady,
don't be upset about my sentence.

39
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,970
In this world, human nature
and their schemes

40
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,060
are the most unpredictable.

41
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,530
Even if I have a second chance,

42
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,010
I'm afraid I still can't stand idly by.

43
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,079
(Natural Grace and Talent)

44
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,360
Official Wu,

45
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,990
if a prince commits a crime,

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,970
he's subject to the same punishment
as commoners.

47
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,460
Shengtian Prefecture
will handle this case appropriately.

48
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,639
Mr. Wu is a good guy!

49
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,940
That's right!

50
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,460
What crime has he committed?

51
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,810
Why are good guys
being punished instead?

52
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,100
I hope that His Highness
can make it in time.

53
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,530
I'm not here to make a plea
for my grandson.

54
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,220
I'm here to seek forgiveness.

55
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,010
This is my letter of resignation.

56
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,180
I am

57
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,060
old and muddle-headed now!

58
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,620
I should've retired and returned
to my hometown long ago!

59
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,290
I only came to my senses
after Song Mo resolved

60
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,780
the war issue in Liaodong!

61
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,940
We mustn't start a war!

62
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,100
Who can protect you

63
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,100
when I'm not around?

64
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,530
Who can protect the Wu Family?

65
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,970
Grandfather,
I shall strive to improve myself

66
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,660
and overcome our trials
together with you.

67
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:59,900
Your Majesty, please heed my advice!

68
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,410
If so, I shall die with no regrets!

69
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,019

71
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,960
(Execute)

72
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,260
Time is up!

73
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,480
Wu Shan, the criminal,

74
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,580
do you have any last words?

75
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,020
As per the Wu Family's rules,

76
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,140
serve the ruler above,

77
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,700
show kindness and generosity below,

78
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,780
know shame and disgrace,

79
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,460
and establish a reputation to behold.

80
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,700
Father has been hardworking
and loyal to the ruler all his life.

81
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,140
Both Heaven and Earth
can testify for him.

82
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,460
I would rather die than validate

83
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:19,510
the rumors fabricated
for the purpose of slander!

84
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,429
Even at this moment,

85
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,820
you're still being stubborn, huh?

86
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,450
Someone!

87
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,100
Proceed with the punishment!

88
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,060
Execute him!

89
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,360
(Loyalty)

90
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,320
(Execute)

91
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,719
Imperial decree!

92
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,720
(Imperial Bestowment)

93
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,460
Official Wu, please come to the hall.

94
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,719
Official Wu,

95
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,860
please.

96
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,410
As per His Majesty's oral edict,

97
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,050
the private meeting
has not broken any rules

98
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,610
or constitute the betrayal of one's kin.

99
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,650
It is not a serious crime.

100
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,510
Wu Shan shall be demoted to the
Vice Director of the Minister of Works.

101
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,539
He shall be sent to Jingmen

102
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,960
to oversee the restoration
of Yuanyou Palace for three years.

103
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,120
(Imperial Bestowment)
The case shall be closed.

104
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

105
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,740
Dezhen!

106
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,860
Stop the carriage.

107
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,100
This is our seventh encounter.

108
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,610
Mr. Wu,

109
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,460
I wish you peace and happiness.

110
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,510
Fourth Young Lady,

111
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,570
I'm lucky to encounter you.

112
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,970
I'm sure someone in this world

113
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,100
will surely dedicate their heart to you.

114
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,260
Freedom is something
that can be fought for.

115
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,580
Go and do the things you like

116
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,890
and love the person you love!

117
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,680
He was demoted to Yuanyou Palace
to create statues.

118
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,640
Now, at least Dezhen can pursue
his beloved craft of woodworking.

119
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,320
He's no longer a bird
trapped in a cage known as his family.

120
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,560
You don't need to be disheartened.

121
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,360
I'm not just disheartened
by Wu Shan's plight.

122
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,990
I'm just lamenting how difficult
it is to live in this world.

123
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,680
All of us are birds trapped in a cage.

124
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,440
The way of the world
is the largest cage of them all.

125
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,120
No one can grasp it or break free of it.

126
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,840
He wrote this in the cell
when he thought

127
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,400
that he wasn't able to see you again.

128
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,179
He told me to burn it.

129
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,000
But I think I should show it to you.

130
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,160
To share a heartfelt connection,

131
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,040
and to seek a destiny
of mutual companionship.

132
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,080
Sincerity can be proven
those with a pure and honest heart.

133
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,459
I believed that I could still win
the battle 1,000 li away

134
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,000
even though I was in the tent.

135
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,520
But in front of absolute power,

136
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,080
I realized how insignificant I was.

137
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,500
The world has been turned upside down
alongside principles.

138
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,790
However, people like Fifth Uncle

139
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,520
are the ones who dictate
the principles of the world.

140
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,990
People say that it's a case
of focusing on oneself selfishly.

141
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,890
But they're just compromising
for the sake of the greater good.

142
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,800
There's one more thing.

143
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,200
Dou Shishu will depart
for Lizhen immediately.

144
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,960
(Natural Grace and Talent)

145
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
The troops of Lizhen
have arrived at Zhenbei Pass.

146
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,520
Dou Shishu, the Minister of Rites,
is strongly advocating for peace.

147
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,640
He's skilled in foreign languages
and highly adaptable.

148
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,960
Lord Dou, is His Majesty

149
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,360
sending you to Liaodong
to make peace with Lizhen?

150
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,120
Your Lordship, could it be
that you recommended me to His Majesty?

151
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,290
Lord Dou, your abilities have gone
unrecognized for a long time.

152
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,000
This is an excellent opportunity.

153
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,400
Of course, I have to reserve it for you.

154
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,960
Your Lordship, you're well-versed
in the art of war indeed.

155
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,200
First, you retreated
in order to advance.

156
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,979
After that, you used me as a tool.

157
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,840
It was a brilliant move.

158
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,880
To think that I actually fell for it.

159
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,960
Lord Dou, you were so focused
on the Wu Family.

160
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,600
You didn't have time
to pay attention to me.

161
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,960
(Yangxin Hall)

162
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,720
Lord Dou, thank you.

163
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,680
Fine.

164
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,960
When I'm back,

165
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,660
I'll surely ask you for a cup
of celebratory liquor, Your Lordship.

166
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,920
The last envoy who was sent to Lizhen

167
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,560
was dead many years ago.

168
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,280
It's no wonder he couldn't sleep at all.

169
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,760
He left the residence
early in the morning.

170
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,080
No matter if it's freedom or justice,

171
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,800
they're meant to be fought for.

172
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,259
Who said birds must be trapped in cages?

173
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,990
Those who say
that life isn't worth living

174
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,899
just haven't walked out
of the mountain gorge

175
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,960
and haven't seen the sunrise
from the mountaintop.

176
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,360
Do you wish to stop here?

177
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,200
Or do you wish to continue hiking?

178
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,160
I'll continue my journey.

179
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,080
I'll keep you company.

180
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:53,160
(Three Months Later, Training Ground)

181
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,619
(Dong Qi)

182
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,499
Go!

183
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,539
- Excellent shot.
- Excellent shot.

184
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,680
Excellent shot.

185
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,339
He's using the ornate bow granted

186
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,539
by the late emperor.

187
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,099
Lord Dong is giving it his all

188
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,480
to win this time.

189
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,339
All these noblemen

190
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,979
always tried their best every time.

191
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,990
They're just showing off
in front of the experts.

192
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,040
Song Mo, am I right?

193
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,179
Hai Cangbo,

194
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,739
for the group hunt,

195
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,279
(Mu Youming, Hai Cangbo)
who do you think

196
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,699
(Mu Youming, Hai Cangbo)
has the highest chance of winning?

197
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,819
Isn't it obvious?

198
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,819
Of course, it's Dong Qi.

199
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,699
Look.

200
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,739
His steed is a Wusun horse.

201
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,760
Rumor has it that it can
travel 1,000 li per day.

202
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,179
Song Mo's father gave him
a sound beating.

203
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,360
I don't think
he's competitive this time.

204
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,520
Hai Cangbo,

205
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,720
even if His Lordship is not at his best,

206
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,120
he can still beat you up easily.

207
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,040
They're just petty clowns.

208
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,320
Why don't I get you
an ornate bow as well?

209
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,840
The Jiang Family has just been demoted.

210
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,880
If I show off my abilities
and receive the court's praises,

211
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,400
I'm afraid His Majesty
won't be able to sleep or eat in peace.

212
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,960
However, if I don't rise to challenges,

213
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,760
His Majesty might think
that I'm a coward.

214
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,560
Taking the mean path

215
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,360
is the hardest thing
to achieve in the world.

216
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,200
Be honest with me.

217
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,040
Has that female mentor of yours
taught you another excellent strategy?

218
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,680
Who did Fourth Young Lady Dou bet on?

219
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,240
Who did Fourth Young Lady Dou bet on?

220
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,680
You can ask her yourself.

221
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,739
The Ladies' Etiquette Contest is meant

222
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,640
to select the model
of a woman's conduct.

223
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,080
This is a cooking contest.

224
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,939
One's cooking resembles them.

225
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,200
Its color and taste are examined.

226
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,280
The examiners will choose the best dish.

227
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,200
Next up is an exam
of elegance and refinement.

228
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,200
Hanging paintings, arranging flowers,

229
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,840
burning incense, and brewing tea,
also known as the Four Elegances.

230
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,040
They serve to cultivate one's character.

231
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,640
You all have to know about them.

232
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,340
- Congratulations, Madam Wang.
- Madam Wang.

233
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,750
You're finally here.

234
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,990
I heard that Eunuch Wang was here
to announce the decree

235
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,830
and give out rewards.

236
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,440
Fifth Master Dou has rendered
great merit this time around.

237
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,190
His Majesty even granted the Dou family
seats to witness the ceremony.

238
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:30,850
That's right.

239
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,440
Thanks to His Majesty's fondness,

240
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,979
I came here today

241
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,760
to keep my two daughters in check

242
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,920
so that they won't misbehave
in front of the imperial family.

243
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,480
Madam, you're too modest.

244
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,840
Madam, you taught Ming how to cook well.

245
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,219
And, you bribed Madam Wei in secret.

246
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,680
I suppose we will win the contest.

247
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,939
Dou Zhao never learned
how to cook properly

248
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,240
when she was living in the manor.

249
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,480
Madam Wei is the judge
of the Ladies' Etiquette Contest.

250
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,720
Naturally, she's upset with her.

251
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,320
Shishu is gaining influence now.

252
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,400
Maybe Wei Tingzhen has
some tricks up her sleeves already.

253
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,059
She has nothing to be upset about.

254
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,360
It's just that Ming and Wu Shan
had met before.

255
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,200
It might damage Ming's reputation.

256
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,800
If Ming is able to win the contest,

257
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,560
she'll be able
to choose a great husband.

258
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:26,059
Our priority is to make Ming
stand out from the rest.

259
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,379
Grand Princess has arrived.

260
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,920
Grand Princess, what are you doing here?

261
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,400
(Grand Princess Shude)

262
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,099
Those two must be the Dou Sisters,

263
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,640
who caused Mr. Wu to be demoted
to a faraway place, right?

264
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,630
Indeed.

265
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,520
So, they could
still participate in the contest

266
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,619
without feeling embarrassed

267
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,040
even after what they did, huh?

268
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,019
You!

269
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,240
Sorry about this.

270
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,000
Fifth Young Lady Dou is disqualified.

271
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,880
Everyone is making meat dishes

272
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,760
while you alone are making
vegetarian dishes.

273
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,939
How could the noble examiners

274
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,840
like something like this?

275
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,920
The weather today is dry and hot.

276
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,200
It's not a good day to have meat.

277
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,390
Therefore, I've prepared
some sweet mashed potato cake.

278
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,600
Sweet mashed potato cake?

279
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,139
This is just an ordinary snack.

280
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,319
Everyone has heard of it.

281
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,459
This is a potato.

282
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,000
It's a Western produce.

283
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,360
You two have limited knowledge.

284
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,080
Naturally, you guys
don't know what it is.

285
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,160
You!

286
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,040
My dish!

287
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,400
Sixth Young Lady Liang is disqualified.

288
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,299
On the table, there's a bottle,
a plate, a vat,

289
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,299
a bowl, a basket, and a tube.

290
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,680
There are six types of containers.

291
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,870
Different containers require
different skills.

292
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,099
They represent different ideas.

293
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,160
Ladies, please make your choice.

294
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,720
His Majesty has already gotten himself
a black bear with his first shot.

295
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,619
All participants, please
head inside and begin the hunt.

296
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,240
Yes, Your Majesty!

297
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,760
Horsie!

298
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,259
Horsie!

299
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,400
Tingyu!

300
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,120
Tingyu!

301
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,920
You're already a marquis.

302
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,600
There's no need to compete
against these boys.

303
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,280
Duke, you look exceptional
when you ride the horse!

304
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
You knew that Tingyu
is bad at horseback archery.

305
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,880
Why did you provoke him?

306
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,299
I truly believe that the marquis
might have a hidden talent.

307
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,620
He might make a name for himself.

308
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,779
Madam, don't you think so?

309
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,920
You!

310
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,680
Let the match begin!

311
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,680
Which family is that lady from?

312
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,299
That's Fourth Young Lady
of the Western Dou Family.

313
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,440
Her name is Dou Zhao.

314
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,120
So, she's Dou Zhao, huh?

315
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,899
Mo,

316
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,240
this is obviously a hunt.

317
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,800
Why did they sound the horn?

318
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,690
Doesn't that alert the animals
to hide from us?

319
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,880
This is my first time
visiting the hunting ground.

320
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,040
Don't mock me.

321
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:00,000
The imperial family did this
to make an announcement.

322
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,240
Since ancient times,

323
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,880
all those who disobeyed
the imperial order and hid from them

324
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,080
were eradicated.

325
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,019
Lord Song.

326
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,120
The hunt has been going on
for some time.

327
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,219
Why are you still empty-handed?

328
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,800
Don't tell me you're going to surrender?

329
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,019
If you're that weak, you should join
the Ladies' Etiquette Contest instead.

330
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,240
There's no need to put on a front
and join us here.

331
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,680
Lord Dong Qi, you've lost
to my brother year after year,

332
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,400
yet you're still not giving up.

333
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,260
I wonder who's the one
putting on a front here.

334
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,600
Your brother got to where he is
all thanks to Duke of Ying.

335
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,320
Now, the Jiang Family is in shambles.

336
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,859
How is he still arrogant?

337
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,000
You!

338
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,459
Han, there's no need to argue with them.

339
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,299
Indeed.

340
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,200
Let's not bother Lord Song.

341
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,600
If not, he won't even get a wild hare.

342
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,480
I'll see how you'll
suffer defeat this year.

343
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,920
Brother, I've been practicing
horseback archery lately.

344
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,840
I'll go and make you proud.

345
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,840
Madam.

346
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,880
(First Place, Dou Zhao,
Second Place, Mu Ming)

347
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,590
This is the result
of the Ladies' Etiquette Contest.

348
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,680
First place,

349
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,440
Fourth Young Lady Dou Zhao
from the Dou Family.

350
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,120
Madam!

351
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,979
The imperial family held a group hunt.

352
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,720
How dare you place a bet?

353
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,050
You were taught to practice humility

354
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,699
and obedience, respect and caution, and
maintaining one's virtue.

355
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,619
You acted of your accord
and damaged your reputation.

356
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,040
You've also brought shame
to your parents and husband-to-be!

357
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,040
Many people place bets
during the group hunt each year.

358
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,760
It's just a sign of good luck.

359
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,539
Why can't I participate in it?

360
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,360
Only men can place bets.

361
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,659
You're a noble lady. How can you do so?

362
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,859
- You!
- If a man can do it,

363
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,600
I'm sure a woman can do it too!

364
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,680
Fine.

365
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,600
Very good.

366
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,179
Since you didn't mind your conduct,

367
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,520
I'll rescind your ranking
as the top participant.

368
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,440
Which rule states

369
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,640
that the winner of the contest
cannot place bets?

370
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,640
One shall be the top of the contest
as long as she has the highest score.

371
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,400
That's the rule set by His Majesty.

372
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,760
Madam, do you have any objections?

373
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,000
I dare not.

374
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,000
Men and women were distinguished
by etiquette since ancient times.

375
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,139
Men will compete in horseback archery
during the hunt

376
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,190
while women will join
the Ladies' Etiquette Contest.

377
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,859
I'm being cautious precisely because Dou Zhao
came in first place.

378
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,560
I don't want her to be
an embarrassment to us.

379
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,219
When I was the same age as Dou Zhao,

380
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,400
I could travel ten li on a horse

381
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,800
and shoot down a deer with my arrow.

382
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,720
How is there a distinction
between men and women?

383
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:19,320
I did join the group hunt
and place bets as well.

384
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,200
So, am I an embarrassment to you all?

385
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,080
Of course not, Grand Princess!

386
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,400
Please spare us!

387
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,880
Don't stare at me like that.

388
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,259
Don't think that I can't bear

389
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,780
to shoot you just because you're cute.

390
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,040
It's too cute.

391
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,920
I can't bear to do it.

392
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,880
Yeah.

393
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,680
It's too cute for you to shoot it.

394
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,440
I think its leg is injured.

395
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,699
It's not that I didn't shoot it

396
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,040
because of my poor archery skills.

397
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,960
I just think that it's too cute.

398
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,760
Bunny.

399
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,560
- Bunny?
- It's really cute.

400
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,560
You have a stubborn drive.

401
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,800
I like that.

402
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,960
I've always hated the demeanor
of all those noble ladies.

403
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:58,680
The more things you know,

404
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,200
the more jealous they are of you.

405
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,040
Your Highness,
sorry for the embarrassment.

406
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,499
Graceful postures, elegant demeanor,

407
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,790
the art of cooking, planting,

408
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,539
the art of burning incense
and brewing tea,

409
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,920
all of these are great.

410
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,760
I admire them.
But at the same time, I'm worried.

411
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:14,650
I'm especially worried

412
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,179
when people use them as their only
criteria for measuring women.

413
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,419
In my opinion, women shouldn't just

414
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,040
stick to one way of living.

415
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,219
They should be able
to make different choices

416
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,200
and lead good lives as well.

417
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,440
Excellent words.

418
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,600
The Dou Family is different indeed.

419
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,520
The hunt is over.

420
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,640
All families, please return
to your seats.

421
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,000
Guess who has the best result?

422
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,840
Dong Qi.

423
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,160
I remember

424
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,579
that when Song Mo first participated
in the group hunt,

425
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,400
he was the youngest participant.

426
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,259
He also achieved the best result

427
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,000
among noblemen
over the past few decades.

428
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,320
But now? What a shame.

429
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,840
Grand Princess,

430
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,880
I was guessing the ranking.

431
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,400
The one with the best hunting result
might not win the contest.

432
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,229
I'm sure Lord Song knows that too.

433
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,820
That's why he's reserving his strength.

434
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,510
I have watched over Song Mo since young.

435
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,400
He has a stubborn personality.

436
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,480
I never expected anyone
to keep him in check.

437
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,800
I guess no one is invincible, huh?

438
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,960
Your Majesty, I've not let you down.

439
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,960
I've managed to hunt a white tiger.

440
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,040
I've already handed it
to the zoo's director.

441
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,600
Excellent.

442
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,000
Why is he so snobbish?

443
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,299
Song Mo can drown you

444
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,520
with the eyeballs of
all the tigers he hunted.

445
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,000
Song Mo,

446
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,920
what have you hunted?

447
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,520
Your Majesty,

448
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,040
I've managed to hunt
a white venomous snake.

449
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,640
Filial son.

450
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,400
I almost thought you had hunted
a mystical beast like a drake.

451
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,640
A venomous snake? Are you kidding me?

452
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,680
How dare you put on airs here?

453
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:20,920
Venomous snakes
aren't included in the list of games.

454
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,880
Why did you hunt it?

455
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,840
Your Majesty, you hunted a black bear.

456
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,339
Its size and power are equal
to tigers and lions.

457
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,940
It can be considered the king of beasts.

458
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,199
And, it has a benevolent heart.

459
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,960
It rarely attacks people.

460
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,880
It exhibits the style of our court.

461
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,120
Although black bears
are strong and ferocious,

462
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:41,800
they're often troubled
by sneaky venomous snakes.

463
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,880
Your Majesty, my only wish
is to remove such ailments for you

464
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,120
and calm the tides by staking my life

465
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,080
in order to preserve
the empire's legacy.

466
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,339
Look over there.

467
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,290
Once we regain
the lost territories in the north,

468
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,160
you and I shall catch the sunrise there.

469
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,040
Jiang Meisun.

470
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,179
Yes, Your Majesty.

471
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,040
I shall grant you this pass
of absolute authority.

472
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,579
You're allowed to bring your sword
to court and not bow to me.

473
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,120
You and I aren't
a ruler and his subject.

474
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,480
There's no deceit toward
the ruler or anything of the sort.

475
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:22,619
Your Majesty,

476
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,800
he has neglected his archery skills
and let you down.

477
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,880
How dare you still make excuses?

478
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,160
Song Yichun.

479
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,400
Your Majesty.

480
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,200
It's been so many years.

481
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,520
Have you ever fulfilled
your duties as a husband

482
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,880
and a father?

483
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,960
During the group hunt
over two decades ago,

484
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,640
I granted you

485
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,880
and your wife, Jiang, a marriage.

486
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,360
She only passed away recently.

487
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,699
Do you really think

488
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,400
I don't know about the dirty affairs

489
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,800
your family had done?

490
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,280
Is this how you're repaying my grace?

491
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,899
I was inconsiderate!

492
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,640
Your Majesty, I've let you down!

493
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,440
Song Mo was outstanding
in the field of horseback archery.

494
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,400
No one was a match for him.

495
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,960
He wouldn't be this weak

496
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,280
had you not punished him
that severely at home.

497
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,960
Your Majesty,
thank you for understanding.

498
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,880
Now, the court needs
all the talents we have.

499
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,040
Song Mo,

500
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,040
do not dwell on
your emotional pain again.

501
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,360
I liked what you hunted.

502
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,200
I shall pardon you
from your period of filial duty.

503
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,480
You shall be the commander
of the Imperial Guard.

504
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,200
Thank you, Your Majesty.

505
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,680
What about Second Young Master Song?

506
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,360
I've hunted a deer and a leopard.

507
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,520
Not bad.

508
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,900
He shall receive
the same reward as Dong Qi.

509
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,259
Grant them the title of Cavalry Officer
and a jade belt each.

510
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,259
Thank you, Your Majesty.

511
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

512
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,560
Your Majesty.

513
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,360
Lord Dou...

514
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,720
Official Dou has returned.

515
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,720
He's waiting in the side hall.

516
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:58,000
His Highness is currently
questioning him

517
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,840
about the opening
of Liaodong's horse market.

518
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,240
Song Mo,

519
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,560
come here.

520
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,589
Yes, Your Majesty.

521
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,200
Shude, you too.

522
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,779
Farewell, His Majesty.

523
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,720
Farewell, His Majesty.

524
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,180
Dou Zhao shall follow us.

525
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,180
Lizhen has withdrawn their troops.

526
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,099
If we shut the pass
to stop them from escaping,

527
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,560
they'll attack us again eventually.

528
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,440
We just need to open a market
in Liaodong

529
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,659
and allow them to exchange their horses
for supplies like cotton and grain.

530
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,170
Only then will peace be preserved.

531
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,740
What if they attack us again
once their troops are well-rested?

532
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,990
The people living in the border areas
will suffer again!

533
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,790
Now, we lack soldiers
in the border areas.

534
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,360
Even if we do establish a horse market,
peace won't last long.

535
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:53,179
Now that the urgent issue
has been resolved,

536
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,570
we should attempt feigned diplomacy,

537
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,590
station our troops in secret,
and prepare for war.

538
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:00,080
Minister Wang, you only
intend to start a war.

539
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,560
So, is ignoring the people

540
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,349
your way of leading troops?

541
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:06,440
If so, Official Dou, do you intend
to rule the Six Ministries with this?

542
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,880
His Majesty has arrived.

543
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,280
I heard you guys arguing fiercely

544
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,720
even when I was outside the camp.

545
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,880
You guys are exaggerating it.

546
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:21,380
No matter if we're going to war
or opening a horse market, in the end,

547
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,360
it's all about money, right?

548
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,640
Members of the Ministry
of Revenue are here as well.

549
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,899
Director Dou,

550
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,200
please do some calculations.

551
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:36,680
We've carried out disaster relief
several times this year.

552
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,790
Do we still have enough
to wage a war in Liaodong?

553
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,040
You're the heir.

554
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,600
Tell me.

555
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,840
How should we carry out
our business with Lizhen?

556
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,790
Father, I'm ignorant.

557
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,850
It won't work unless money
falls from the heavens.

558
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,860
Otherwise, there's no way to balance

559
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,560
the situation.

560
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,480
Shude,

561
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,120
tell me your opinion.

562
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:02,059
Today, I wish to hear your opinions.

563
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,340
There's no need to be too formal.

564
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,139
I know nothing about war.

565
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,720
But when it comes to business,

566
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,079
the winner of this year's
Ladies' Etiquette Contest,

567
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,520
Fourth Young Lady Dou,

568
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,120
is a business prodigy
who's been hiding under womanhood.

569
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,720
She has excellent insights.

570
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,779
Just now,

571
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,840
she made a lot of money
from placing bets

572
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,120
on the group hunt.

573
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,459
Your Majesty, please spare us.

574
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,760
Your Majesty, please spare us.

575
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,040
Is that so?

576
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,680
Summon her.

577
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:37,920
Summon Dou Zhao, the first place winner
of the Ladies' Etiquette Contest.

578
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,680
Greetings, Your Majesty. I'm Dou Zhao.

579
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,239
Tell me.

580
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,640
How did you win the bet?

581
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,120
Your Majesty, please spare us.

582
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,960
I've incited the masses
to create momentum,

583
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,859
making Lord Song their preferred bet.

584
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,040
Most of the lords placed their bets
on Lord Song.

585
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,990
I was the only one
who placed a bet on Lord Song.

586
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,099
That's how I won.

587
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,240
Shut up!

588
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,019
Your Majesty,

589
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,459
I've failed to educate my daughter.

590
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,880
That's why she's misbehaving.

591
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,160
Dou Zhao, hurry and apologize
to His Majesty!

592
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,560
Director Dou, you're overthinking it.

593
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,600
My predecessors established
the empire through horseback archery.

594
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,529
It's common for people to place bets

595
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,200
on the imperial family's group hunt.

596
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,900
Besides,

597
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,960
the internal finances of all families

598
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,560
are handled by women.

599
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,560
How is this inappropriate?

600
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

601
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,680
I was too narrow-minded.

602
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,400
Mu Chuan, the Minister of Works,
mentioned your name before.

603
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:52,140
You've contributed to the case
relating to the cargo ships in Futing.

604
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,139
I assume you know
about the current issue

605
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,560
we're facing.

606
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,040
Tell me if you have any ideas.

607
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:05,200
Your Majesty, please allow me
to offer an item to you.

608
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,720
Permission granted.

609
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,219
Due to the maritime trade in Futing,

610
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,579
I found out about a rare
potato-like produce from the west.

611
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,720
They call them potatoes.

612
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,459
It has a texture similar to pastries.

613
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,750
Two or three of them
are enough.

614
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,579
They can grow anywhere

615
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,560
regardless of the weather
or the type of land.

616
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,219
The Miao Family in Futing
has planted 100 mu of them.

617
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,840
They've sold
several hundred jin of them.

618
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,600
Does that mean

619
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,939
it can be planted in the northern
and southern regions no matter

620
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,260
if there's a flood or a drought?

621
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,160
This produce can replace
half of the disaster aid's expenses.

622
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,600
It can save up to 500,000 taels.

623
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,000
The disaster victims

624
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,890
may swap out half
of their crops for potatoes.

625
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,360
They can be harvested twice per year.

626
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,619
It's best to plant them
during April or May.

627
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,539
If you plant them during fall,

628
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,560
you may generate 300,000 yuan
in tax revenue during spring.

629
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,760
The harvest will be
70,000 dan of potatoes.

630
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,970
If you intend to open
a market in Liaodong,

631
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,440
we can sell these
to the people of Lizhen.

632
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,200
We can exchange these for horses, huh?

633
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,760
Excellent.

634
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,080
This is a business idea
supported by the heavens themselves.

635
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,720
I can see why she's the winner
of the Ladies' Etiquette Contest.

636
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:29,600
Relay my order.

637
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,399
The Bureau of Agricultural Affairs
will handle this.

638
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,659
The Ministry of Revenue
will handle the accounts.

639
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,779
- Tell Liang Jifang to get to it now.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

640
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,579
Instruct the Court
of Imperial Entertainments,

641
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,739
the Court of Imperial Stud, and The Directorate
of the Imperial Stables

642
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,699
to send some men to Liaodong
to assist Youting in opening the market.

643
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,400
Recruit troops once
we have enough horses.

644
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:43,440
We may wage a war

645
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,920
anytime we like.

646
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,419
- But...
- His Majesty, but...

647
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,640
But what?

648
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,960
Get to it.

649
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,150
You guys should get up too.

650
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,260
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

651
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,600
Dou Zhao, since you're
the winner of the contest,

652
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,080
how should I reward you?

653
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,480
Both Dou Zhao and Song Mo
came in first place.

654
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,680
Brother, you should reward them.

655
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,360
They look quite matching.

656
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,990
Your Majesty, thank you
for not despising me.

657
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,640
I know how to do calculations

658
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,539
and how to plant potatoes.

659
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,720
I'm willing to serve our nation.

660
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,179
Your Majesty, please...

661
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,320
Your Majesty.

662
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:41,920
The Dou Family is small.

663
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:42,949
We don't have any sons.

664
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:45,880
My younger brother
only has two wonderful daughters.

665
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,120
Now, Dou Zhao is already
engaged to Duke Jining.

666
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,710
We can't just expect them
to move to Liaodong

667
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,880
and plant potatoes together with us.

668
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,480
Duke Jining?

669
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,880
- You mean Wei Tingyu?
- Indeed.

670
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:20,360
Where is he?
How's the battle report for today?

671
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,840
Duke Jining hasn't returned yet.

672
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,040
He comes from a family
of generals and warriors.

673
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:33,000
But he doesn't have the talent
that his family possess.

674
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:38,320
It's time for the Imperial Guard
to train themselves.

675
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,040
Yes, Your Majesty. I'll remember that.

676
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,680
Song Mo,

677
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,680
it's indeed time for you to get married.

678
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,480
Princess Jingyu
grew up together with you.

679
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,320
You do not fear her,

680
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,920
and you know how to deal with her.

681
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,160
Princess Jingyu has an eccentric temper.

682
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:00,320
Brother, you should think twice
before saying that.

683
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,680
The princess might fall out with you.

684
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,680
I guess I've spoiled the child.

685
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,029
Song Mo,

686
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,680
since I owe you a wish,

687
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,250
you can come to me

688
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,240
once you've made up your mind.

689
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,080
Thank you, Your Majesty.

690
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,720
After today's conversation,

691
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,860
I can see that your thoughts
are no inferior to men.

692
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,680
Congratulations, Your Lordship.

693
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,890
You've been promoted
to the commander of Imperial Guard.

694
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,800
Dou Shishu is using you as his chip.

695
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:44,680
Instead of dealing with it passively,
why don't you take the initiative?

696
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,720
Make him fear him.

697
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,840
My marriage was arranged
by my parents and the matchmaker.

698
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,760
It was arranged long ago.

699
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,539
If you're not willing
to fall out with them,

700
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,310
I can cancel the engagement
on your behalf.

701
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,160
Your Lordship,

702
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:01,920
I'll deal with this myself.

703
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:07,470
That's Duke Jining's signal flare.

704
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,660
Young Lady.

705
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:12,040
Ming is missing.

706
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,979
Madam has sent people
to search everywhere.

707
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,130
It's been two hours,
and they still haven't found her.

708
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,179
(She left when she wasn't selected.)

709
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,600
(She was never seen again.)

710
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,400
(Could they be together?)

711
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,240
The Imperial Guard is nearby.

712

I can cancel the engagement
for you.

the lighter my burden is.

725
