1
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,910
I have committed a crime!

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,160
Song Mo is innocent!

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,790
(Xianqing Gate)
I will testify in person!

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,699
Please clear Song Mo's name!

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,950
Stop it, Shiying!

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,650
- What are you doing?
- Get out of my way!

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,849
Have you lost your senses?

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,539
Has your son-in-law,

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,840
that rascal bewitched you?

10
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,070
Come to your senses!

11
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,800
You deceived your own brother

12
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,679
and framed your niece and nephew-in-law.

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,179
You should come to your senses!

14
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,320
You jerk!

15
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,870
I'll slap myself on your behalf.

16
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,350
For so many years,

17
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,440
how many people have been sacrificed,

18
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,990
how many mistakes have been made

19
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,840
just because I'm your younger brother?

20
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,929
I won't make any more mistakes!

21
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,890
You're using Dou Zhao
and Song Mo as sacrifices,

22
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,070
and sacrificing people's lives

23
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,819
for your ambition.

24
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,160
I won't allow it!

25
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,040
An elder brother is like a father.

26
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,870
As long as you bear the Dou name,

27
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,590
you'll do as I say.

28
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,320
Just now

29
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,630
was the last time
I'll ever call you brother.

30
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,600
I will repay you for raising me

31
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,600
with my blood.

32
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,120
What are you doing?

33
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,440
You...

34
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,400
Three strikes of the sword
would sever all ties.

35
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,070
After you strike me three times,

36
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,960
we'll go separate ways.

37
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,040
You and I will no longer be related!

38
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,710
You think I won't do it?

39
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,880
Fine.

40
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,760
I'll grant your wish today.

41
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,120
I've truly misjudged you.

42
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,790
From now on,
you and I are nothing to each other.

43
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,859
(Xianqing Gate)

44
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,209
The two Dou brothers

45
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,110
have fallen to such an extent.

46
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,719
=Blossom=
(Adapted from the novel "Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

47
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,940
=Episode 32=

48
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,019
Don't think you'll get away
with ruining Lord Qing's plans.

49
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,510
If His Highness finds out
you saved his enemy,

50
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:08,830
he'll kill you too.

51
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,760
When did His Highness order you
to target the Duchess?

52
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,499
Song Mo hasn't been convicted yet.

53
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,150
And you couldn't wait to make your move.

54
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,000
Do you think His Highness
won't see through your schemes?

55
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,910
Search!

56
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,920
It's just my beloved puppy.

57
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,000
I didn't think the Tengxiang Guards
would care so much.

58
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,330
By the way,

59
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,059
your childhood nickname must have been

60
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,470
Little Dog, right?

61
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,680
No wonder you grew up biting

62
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,560
anyone you see.

63
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,830
His Highness has spoken.

64
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,800
Since you like to play with fire,

65
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,270
it's only fitting I greet you
with flames.

66
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,470
If you admit to forging the contract

67
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,320
and framing Lord Qing,

68
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,320
wouldn't it be better to suffer less?

69
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,880
Eunuch Wang,

70
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,360
I've seen every trick in the book.

71
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,680
If I write a confession,

72
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,030
I'm as good as dead.

73
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,200
What other ruthless tricks do you have?

74
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,390
Just bring it on.

75
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,710
His Majesty hasn't approved torture.

76
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,169
If you were found out

77
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,030
of using coercion,

78
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,560
it would be improper.

79
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,150
Don't think you can play both sides.

80
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,680
So, what do you think I should do?

81
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,630
I wouldn't dare to suggest anything.

82
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,830
I know

83
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,440
you're a stubborn fellow.

84
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,880
But it won't help here.

85
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,560
This thing can melt

86
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,240
a stubborn heart.

87
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,680
The Emperor's whims are justice.

88
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,920
Aren't you afraid of death?

89
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,760
What about the 237 members

90
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,560
of your family, young and old?

91
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,830
Aren't they afraid of death?

92
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:37,950
- Yantang...
- Uncle.

93
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,000
- Uncle.
- It was you.

94
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,139
It wasn't me.

95
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,390
- Help me.
- Uncle.

96
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,600
Help.

97
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,160
Save me.

98
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,969
What did your parents and brother

99
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:54,969
do wrong?

100
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:56,510
Can your conscience rest easy

101
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,470
knowing they'll be executed
because of you?

102
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,000
Is one person's innocence worth

103
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:07,470
the lives of your loved ones?

104
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,169
Yantang,

105
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,470
what are you doing?

106
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,470
I don't need to know anything else.

107
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,390
I only need to stir your emotions.

108
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,190
Compared to a thousand cuts,

109
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,360
this incense will heighten
your emotions.

110
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,560
Combined with the poison of hatred,

111
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,830
it will make you wish for death.

112
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,470
Enjoy the slow agony
of the poison, Your Grace.

113
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,640

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,000

- Be careful.

How did I get here?

155
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,990
Jianming sent you here.

156
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,859
He has made the necessary arrangements.

157
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,640
He said this place is the safest.

158
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,950
Yantang.

159
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,880
Don't worry.

Yantang is a blessed child.

161
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,520
His Majesty is not a foolish ruler.

162
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,350
He'll make a wise decision.

163
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,710
The Cui Clan
has over a hundred officials.

164
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,750
You have a lot of people backing you.

165
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,149
Just focus

166
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,020
on recovering here.

167
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,670
How's my child?

168
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,560
Your child is safe.

169
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,440
The physician said

170
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,470
you're now overwhelmed
by your emotions and energy,

171
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,110
overly worried and anxious,

172
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,750
and your body is very weak.

173
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,790
You need to rest and recuperate

174
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,990
to avoid leaving any lasting effects
from this illness.

175
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,400
Come, lie down,

176
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,950
and get proper rest.

177
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,430
Grandmother.

178
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,880
Slowly.

179
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,809
(Xianqing Gate)

180
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:35,950
Stop it!

181
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,230
You can't just randomly strike
the Dengwen Drum!

182
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:42,200
It was set up by the founding emperor

183
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,440
to allow open speech

184
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,460
and ensure fairness.

185
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,960
The Ministry of Imperial Ceremony
has no right to stop me from pleading.

186
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,800
Song Mo set fires and hurt people.

187
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,800
So many witnessed it.

188
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,560
How can you call it unjust,
Official Dou?

189
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,729
You're publicly defaming the court.

190
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,639
Take him away!

191
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,070
- Give Song Mo a fair trial!
- Stop!

192
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,590
Facts lie in the hearts of the people.

193
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,560
The truth isn't for you to decide.

194
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,339
It was I

195
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,560
who allowed Official Dou
to strike the drum.

196
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,379
Eunuch Wang, do you intend

197
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,870
to take me away too?

198
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,440
I dare not.

199
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,440
Why are you still here?

200
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,040
Yes, Your Highness.

201
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,760
Let's go!

202
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,859
Official Dou.

203
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,290
Your Highness.

204
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,960
Thank you, Your Highness.

205
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,470
I acted on my own.

206
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,520
I dare not implicate Your Highness.

207
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,950
Song Mo is loyal and brave.

208
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,870
Official Dou,
you're a pure-hearted minister.

209
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,560
I should protect people like you
for the court's sake.

210
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,400
It's a blessing to the people

211
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,590
to have a Crown Prince like you.

212
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:11,350
I hope Your Highness
will convey to His Majesty

213
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,710
not to wrong

214
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,280
the loyal and virtuous.

215
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,339
(Harmony of Moral and Nourishing)
Rumors are spreading in the capital

216
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,859
that Yunfei Silverhouse
is engaging in corrupt activities.

217
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,810
The Dengwen Drum shouldn't
be sounded without a just cause.

218
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,040
It has been discovered

219
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,870
that Lu's Dental Clinic

220
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,360
is owned

221
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,230
by Lord Qing.

222
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,769
It is lavishly decorated
and extremely extravagant.

223
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:39,400
The silver stored there equals
half a year's taxes from Northern Zhili.

224
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,449
Brother claims to live simply
and frugally.

225
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,680
So,

226
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,560
where did all this silver come from?

227
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,099
The shop attendants also identified

228
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,200
those entering the secret chamber.

229
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,990
Grand Secretary Dou
and Grand Secretary Mu were both seen.

230
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,110
Such distortion of truth and slander

231
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,200
against the royal family
and court officials.

232
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,080
I ask that this must
be thoroughly investigated

233
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:05,969
to uphold justice.

234
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,980
Losing the people's trust means
losing the country.

235
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,009
Grand Secretary Dou,

236
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,200
do you still not understand
the situation?

237
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,780
The people are very agitated right now.

238
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,510
I advise you not to go
against the public will.

239
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,080
This petition is full of signatures.

240
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,950
This is the voice of the people!

241
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,170
The people's petition demands

242
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,799
a thorough investigation
of Yunfei Silverhouse's alliances,

243
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,360
corruption, and bribery cases

244
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,000
to uncover the truth for the public.

245
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:39,159
The guilty should be punished
and the innocent freed.

246
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,679
Whether they are royals
or high-ranking officials,

247
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,900
everyone should be treated equally
without leniency.

248
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,740
Grand Secretaries Dou and Mu,

249
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,140
what do you say?

250
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,500
Dou Shiying slandered the prince

251
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,980
and manipulated public opinion

252
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,940
to save his son-in-law.

253
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,420
Such interference in state affairs

254
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,660
deserves severe punishment.

255
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,580
If he succeeds,

256
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,060
what becomes
of the royal family's dignity?

257
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,380
Interfering with state affairs?

258
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,740
Are you talking about yourself
or someone else?

259
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,700
If only royals can handle royal matters,

260
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,919
perhaps you should step aside

261
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,029
and let me assist Brother
with his decrees

262
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,690
and reviews.

263
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,799
You've never cared about state affairs

264
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,279
and enjoyed a carefree life.

265
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,399
So,

266
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,980
why have you come to the Yuxi Palace
to joke around today?

267
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,060
I'm here out of concern for Youting.

268
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,980
Youting has been slandered so badly

269
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,140
that the royal family's dignity
and honor are already tarnished.

270
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,199
Of course,

271
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,500
we must investigate thoroughly

272
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,460
to restore
the royal family's reputation.

273
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,079
The Grand Princess makes a valid point.

274
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,719
The Censorate suggests delaying

275
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,719
the conviction of Song Mo

276
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,039
since the faction list circulating

277
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,399
among the people is unreliable.

278
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,369
But the bribery accounts presented
by Song Mo

279
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,530
are verifiable.

280
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,919
To calm the public,

281
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,119
I propose using these accounts
as a starting point

282
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,700
to audit the Six Ministries,

283
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,799
focusing on the Diannan Bureau
under the Ministry of Revenue

284
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,880
and the Auditing Office
under the Ministry of Works.

285
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,439
Liang Jifang, the Ministry of Justice,
and the Censorate

286
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,020
have been working tirelessly for days.

287
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,180
If they keep investigating,

288
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,580
Youting's involvement
in bribery will be concrete

289
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,940
and Song Mo's arson will seem justified.

290
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,119
The couple in Yizhi Hall

291
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,420
has truly played their cards well.

292
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,980
Your Majesty,

293
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,319
given the current situation,

294
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,620
there's no way to back out unscathed.

295
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,420
For the greater good,

296
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,220
His Highness must be kept out of this.

297
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,500
You mean

298
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,799
we should offer Liang Jifang
a new scapegoat?

299
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,919
Dou Shishu has been the one managing

300
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,060
Silverhouse's bribery, alliances,
and secret deals.

301
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,740
He even managed

302
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,500
the horse market trade.

303
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,119
I remember you had a fallout

304
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,180
with Dou Shishu over your son.

305
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,279
This is a grave matter.

306
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,399
I wouldn't dare use it
for personal revenge.

307
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,519
What I say is true.

308
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,919
No one but Grand Secretary Dou

309
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,279
can bear the weight of this matter.

310
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,359
Everything that I do

311
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,700
is for His Highness
and Your Majesty's sake.

312
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,220
Dou Shishu was recommended by Shude.

313
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,180
Let her accompany him

314
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,820
to the end,

315
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,700
so he won't be lonely.

316
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,210
It's been a long time

317
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,089
since I've seen you dress up
so meticulously.

318
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,750
Who are you meeting today, Master?

319
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,090
In one's lifetime,

320
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,680
one should arrive with dignity

321
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,600
and depart with dignity.

322
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,190
You don't have to come with me.

323
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,460
(Soaring to Great Heights)

324
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,740
May heaven bless
the Dou Clan of the North Tower

325
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,940
with high-ranking officials

326
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,620
and prosperity for generations,

327
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,420
illuminating all corners of the land,

328
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,500
where the old year ends
and the new one begins.

329
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,760
You've built yourself a Wenyuan Pavilion

330
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,559
just to secure the position
of Chief Grand Secretary.

331
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,340
You're completely obsessed.

332
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,140
I thought you said you quit.

333
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,540
Whenever I face difficulties,

334
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,860
I like to sit here and remind myself

335
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,420
to exercise restraint

336
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,580
and patience.

337
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,460
Only by truly sitting in this chair

338
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,660
can I relax.

339
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,300
Now,

340
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:24,060
I'm just one step away.

341
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,180
You must already knew
you can't cross that step.

342
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,220
Mu Chuan deliberately exposed flaws,

343
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:38,899
claiming I used Lord Qing's name
for corruption.

344
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,050
The Empress is sacrificing me

345
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,200
to save herself.

346
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,370
You've always been cautious.

347
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,700
Did you never consider

348
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,229
you might be used as a scapegoat
after all these years?

349
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,660
I find that hard to believe.

350
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:59,860
When the three Zhuge brothers joined
Wei, Han, and Wu, respectively,

351
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,300
how could I push Shiying

352
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,340
in the opposite direction

353
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,220
without being a scapegoat?

354
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,380
I submitted the evidence against me

355
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,660
to the Grand Secretariat

356
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,220
under Shiying's name.

357
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,960
He will be praised for his loyalty
to the throne

358
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,229
and rewarded for exposing me.

359
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,980
The Crown Prince
will admire and trust him.

360
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,980
In the next reign,
his name will surely

361
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,360
be among the ministers.

362
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,500
The Dou Family's future generation

363
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,120
will secure their place in that chair.

364
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,020
By the Empress's decree!

365
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,020
Arrest the traitor
Dou Shishu immediately!

366
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,180
I helped you back then

367
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,740
because your talent shouldn't be buried.

368
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,980
If you renounce your ways now,

369
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,260
I'll plead for your life
before the Emperor

370
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,799
and have you exiled to a quiet place,

371
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,140
so you can write your books in peace.

372
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,180
This time,

373
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,340
Your Highness can't help me.

374
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,380
But

375
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,540
I can do

376
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,260
one last thing

377
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,780
for Your Highness.

378
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,340
Put down your weapons

379
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,020
and tell Dou Shiying to come here.

380
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,399
Brother, drop the dagger.

381
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,540
They're framing you.

382
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,359
I'll go with you to the Censorate
and clear your name.

383
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,860
Don't pretend to care!

384
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,740
Dou Shiying,

385
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,959
I was blind to trust you.

386
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,119
I didn't expect that you had been collecting
evidence against me,

387
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,519
waiting to betray me

388
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,500
for wealth and power.

389
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,820
I supported and looked after you.

390
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,759
But you turned out

391
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,959
to be a venomous snake!

392
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,119
Brother, you...

393
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,210
Shut up!

394
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,990
The day you drew
the sword on me in public,

395
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,460
our brotherhood was severed!

396
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,140
Dou Shishu is holding a royal hostage.

397
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,700
Kill him on the spot!

398
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,060
Release the arrows!

399
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,980
No, don't!

400
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,060
Brother!

401
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,100
Yizhen,

402
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,980
stop opposing the Empress.

403
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,420
Return to your fief.

404
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,100
When the crape myrtle trees bear fruit,

405
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,900
eat some for me.

406
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,180
Yuanji.

407
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,340
Yuanji!

408
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,660
Yuanji...

409
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,620
Yuanji...

410
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,839
(Notice)

411
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,199
The traitor Dou Shishu abused his power

412
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,780
and embezzled the people's wealth.

413
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,220
His crimes were unforgivable,

414
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,839
and he has been executed.

415
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,930
The stolen funds
have been returned to the treasury

416
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,180
as a warning to others!

417
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,820
- Good!
- Well done!

418
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,279
He's better off dead!

419
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,620
- Nice work!
- That's right!

420
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,460
He caused chaos all his life,

421
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,780
and in the end,

422
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,100
he's just decorating this room.

423
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,599
(Weigh gains against losses,)

424
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,079
(success against failure.)
That quote from Zhuge Liang

425
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,220
(Dou Shishu)

426
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,860
was prepared for you
to take a different path.

427
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,180
Shishu wanted

428
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,540
to push me toward the Crown Prince

429
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,620
to ensure the future glory
of the Dou Family.

430
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,860
If I had taken on this burden earlier

431
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,180
to fight for the Dou Family,

432
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,540
Shishu wouldn't have made

433
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,180
so many mistakes.

434
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,140
Shiying,

435
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,060
we need to look forward.

436
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,380
Whether you take up the post in Zhanxi

437
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,460
or resign from the court,

438
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,620
just make a decision.

439
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,860
Shishu is gone.

440
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,740
Lord Qing and the Empress

441
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,020
won't let the Dou family off easily.

442
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,100
I cannot hide.

443
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,580
I must protect everyone
in this household.

444
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,020
The Crown Prince promised to protect us.

445
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,780
All the more reason

446
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,940
we can't let the Crown Prince

447
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,660
be accused of favoritism
in this turbulent time.

448
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,380
Good.

449
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,340
Use my disaster relief commendation

450
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,159
and join with the students
and officials of the Cui Clan of Ji'an

451
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,940
to submit a petition.

452
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,100
That's right.

453
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,380
Also, Ms. Longevity's
potato cultivation to combat famine

454
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,759
and Song Mo's achievements
in quelling the pirates

455
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,140
will all be brought up,

456
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,500
and let all the officials see

457
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,060
how much the Dou Family has done
for the court.

458
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,590
I will draft the petition now.

459
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,460
By the Empress's decree!

460
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,900
Song Mo is guilty of negligence,

461
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,180
resulting in the incident
on Changle Street.

462
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,540
However, considering his merits
in quelling the pirates,

463
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,799
he shall be released from prison

464
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,159
and immediately confined to Yizhi Hall,

465
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,660
awaiting further decisions!

466
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,500
Fifth Uncle is dead.

467
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,740
Grand Princess Shude returned

468
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,980
to her fief without a word.

469
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,660
Once His Majesty wakes up,

470
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,300
the court will surely change.

471
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,199
Fifth Uncle was supposed
to have the right connections,

472
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,740
a position of great power.

473
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,060
Though we couldn't expose
those behind him,

474
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,940
at least we've fought against fate.

475
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,820
As for when His Majesty will wake

476
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,900
and if he can help you,

477
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,900
I dare not make a guess.

478
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,580
I had hoped

479
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,580
we could see

480
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,660
the magnolias bloom together
at least once more.

481
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,220
But with all this snow,

482
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,980
I wonder

483
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,420
if the branches will survive.

484
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,020
If you feel like it,

485
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,140
I'll ask them to bring two cloaks,

486
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,860
and we can go see.

487
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,780
It's no use.

488
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,500
I've been stripped of my title

489
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,340
and confined to my residence.

490
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,980
Lu Ming and General Yan
are also imprisoned.

491
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,940
The place is surrounded
by Shadow Guards.

492
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,420
It's good that the Shadow Guard
is keeping watch.

493
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,980
The guards may restrict us.
But they also protect us.

494
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,540
At least, Yizhi Hall is safe.

495
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,740
After all these years of planning,

496
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,980
we've reached this point.

497
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,780
We've done everything we could.

498
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,060
Now, we can just wait

499
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,500
for the flowers to bloom

500
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,580
and enjoy some peace.

501
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,030
Give me your hand.

502
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:39,270
The court is in the midst of selecting
the head of the Imperial Guard.

503
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,140
It's a time of great unrest,

504
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,940
and if we are to move troops,

505
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,860
now is the best opportunity.

506
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,330
The forces in Liaodong
aren't fully prepared yet.

507
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:52,620
Wouldn't it be too soon to act now?

508
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,519
During the Xuanwu Gate incident,

509
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,490
Emperor Taizong used
only eight hundred soldiers.

510
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,950
It's not about the size of the army,

511
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,180
but

512
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,580
about the right timing.

513
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,210
What do you think, Commander Song?

514
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,580
As long as Song Mo lives,

515
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,700
he remains a threat.

516
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,540
This is also my concern.

517
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,479
Song Mo is heavily poisoned,

518
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,380
and his strength is greatly weakened.

519
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,300
His allies are imprisoned.

520
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,340
He can't stir up much trouble.

521
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,940
Song Mo and Dou Zhao seem calm now.

522
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,980
But it's all an act.

523
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,940
They surely have
something else up their sleeves.

524
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,970
I've sent people
to keep a close watch on them,

525
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,530
waiting for the right moment to strike.

526
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,180
Then I shall wait for your good news.

527
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,040
All we need now

528
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,660
is a good chance.

529
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,380
You seem to have

530
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,010
some hostility toward Song Han.

531
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,860
Is it because of Dou Zhao?

532
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,100
Dou Zhao and I share a close friendship.

533
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,780
Your Highness should understand this.

534
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,700
As for Song Han,

535
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,060
he's blinded by personal vendettas
and lacks foresight.

536
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,460
He doesn't think about the future.

537
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,460
Whatever he says to Your Highness

538
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,140
is of no concern to me.

539
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,580
Such grace from you, Teacher.

540
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,060
But aren't you worried?

541
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,100
The Duke of Ying is confined,

542
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:25,620
but he hasn't been convicted.

543
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,020
Chief Grand Secretary Liang Jifang
is also the Crown Prince's tutor.

544
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,860
They praise good deeds publicly

545
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,580
and correct mistakes privately.

546
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,759
Either Song Han mistreats
his brother and sister-in-law,

547
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,359
causing Song Mo to die from poison,

548
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,660
or Song Mo kills his brother in a rage
to protect his wife.

549
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,180
No matter how much blood is spilled,

550
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,860
it's a family affair
of the Duke of Ying's household

551
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,820
and has nothing to do
with Your Highness.

552
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,540
The Shadow Guards are keeping
a strict watch.

553
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,820
So they can't escape this cage.

554
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,700
Rather than worrying
about Song Mo and his wife,

555
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,940
Your Highness should think
about His Majesty's health.

556
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,660
If His Majesty wakes up

557
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,460
and issues a decree,

558
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,020
that would truly be detrimental
to Your Highness.

559
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,140
There's enough for everyone.

560
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,820
So please be patient.

561
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:19,319
Be patient. Everyone will have theirs.

562
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,359
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Here you go.

563
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,279
Princess,

564
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,300
why do you have
to serve the congee yourself?

565
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,959
You can leave

566
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,439
this task to the servant.

567
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,859
- Be careful.
- Thank you.

568
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,159
I used to do this often
when I was a merchant.

569
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,479
Now that I'm a princess,

570
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,559
I should do more.

571
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,140
That's the only way to live up
to the title His Majesty gave me.

572
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,980
- Here.
- You're so kind to the people.

573
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,260
It's truly a blessing for all.

574
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,860
(Besides, doing this helps atone)

575
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,460
(for Muyu's bloodshed.)

576
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,460
(Only by doing so,)

577
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,180
(can I find some peace.)

578
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,989
Next.

579
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:54,849
Here you go.

580
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,020
- Thank you.
- Don't drop it.

581
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,100
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

582
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,980
Thank you. Thank...

583
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,210
Wait!

584
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,500
Princess, what's the matter?

585
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,780
You don't look too well.

586
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,100
Are you not feeling well?

587
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,460
I'm fine.

588
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:25,020
He's just a mere
unarmed carriage driver.

589
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,980
After dispatching so many people

590
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,540
and such a long time,

591
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,940
you still haven't found him.

592
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,580
What's the use of having guards
like you?

593
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,260
That carriage driver
is as slippery as an eel.

594
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,340
He might've fled
outside the capital by now.

595
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,700
Should we expand the search

596
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,580
beyond the capital?

597
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,870
(Striving with Grace)
Are you teaching me what to do?

598
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,460
I dare not. Forgive me.

599
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,220
Princess.

600
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,100
Why did you come
without announcing yourself?

601
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,500
Your hand is so cold,

602
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,780
and you look pale too.

603
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,540
Come here.

604
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,340
I shall take my leave.

605
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,900
Did anything happen today?

606
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,759
Princess almost fainted
when she was serving congee

607
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,300
- at the alms booth.
- Directress Su,

608
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,020
please leave us.

609
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,460
Yes.

610
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,380
Directress Su exaggerated.

611
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,900
Maybe I almost fainted

612
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,740
because I stood too long
and got too tired.

613
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,100
My mother

614
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,620
was like that too.

615
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,820
Many illnesses
don't show symptoms at first.

616
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,559
This won't do.

617
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,980
I'm fetching the imperial physician.

618
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,180
It's all right.

619
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,660
I'm fine.

620
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,740
I know my own body well.

621
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,140
All right.

622
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,860
Anything you say.

623
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,060
(Yizhi Hall)
Thank you for working hard, officers.

624
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,159
This is wine brewed
in the Duke of Ying's Residence,

625
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,880
as a token of appreciation
for both of you.

626
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,799
It's such a fine wine!

627
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,780
Thank the Commander on our behalf.

628
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,940
Many thanks.

629
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,940
(To be read by Commander Song)
We couldn't eliminate them before.

630
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,620
With the Shadow Guards protecting them,

631
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,340
it's almost impossible.

632
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,900
I noticed you haven't eaten all day.

633
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,660
So I made you some dessert.

634
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,079
Didn't the Empress ask you

635
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,199
to keep Song Mo alive?

636
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,020
The Empress is probably worried
about Song Mo's old followers.

637
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,700
Such unnecessary compassion.

638
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,500
The Tengxiang Guard
is under my control now.

639
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,180
Why fear a bunch of defeated soldiers?

640
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,700
As long as we build solid connections
with the noble families in the capital,

641
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,060
even Lord Qing

642
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,950
won't dare challenge me easily.

643
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,620
Of course.

644
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,620
Socializing with nobles is costly.

645
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,519
Zhao holds a 70% stake

646
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,900
in Miao family's shop.

647
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,100
If she's willing to loosen her grip,

648
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,860
we'd be much better off financially.

649
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,460
Ansu,

650
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,100
I know what you're planning.

651
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,100
You want to use that money

652
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,460
to stop me from harming Dou Zhao.

653
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,220
Am I right?

654
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,900
Dou Zhao is cunning and full of schemes.

655
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,740
If I don't do anything,

656
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,359
she will harm us.

657
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,180
Zhao isn't like that.

658
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,799
Back in Futing, she helped me a lot.

659
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,639
When the Miao Family had nothing,

660
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,780
she stood by my side.

661
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,620
Honestly, I'm starting
to feel a bit jealous of her

662
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,500
for making you worry
about her this much.

663
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,420
Muyu,

664
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,100
promise me not to harm Zhao.

665
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,060
I'll talk to her
about the profit adjustment.

666
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,699
I'll make her understand the situation

667
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,100
and stop defying you.

668
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,719
(Yizhi Hall)

669
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,300
I need to go inside
to discuss some family matters.

670
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,319
(Contract. Miao Ansu)
Dou Zhao has goods with the Miao.

671
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,879
I need to sign this contract

672
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,039
with Dou Zhao today

673
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,540
and discuss the profit adjustment.

674
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,039
If you don't let me pass,

675
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,620
the business will suffer,

676
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,500
and I won't be able to explain it.

677
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,539
But...

678
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,519
Well...

679
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,199
I had this arranged with the Commander
of the Tengxiang Guard

680
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,950
to make Dou Zhao agree
to the profit adjustment.

681
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,999
If you don't believe me,

682
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,660
you can ask the Commander himself.

683
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,740
But if someone is to be blamed for this,

684
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,919
don't say I didn't warn you.

685
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,020
(Yizhi Hall)

686
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,860
Let her through!

687
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,100
Your Highness, come this way.

688
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,660
Please come in.

689
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,620
I didn't expect Song Han
to trust you so much now.

690
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,620
A courtyard
where he won't even let a fly get in,

691
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,370
he lets you in.

692
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,140
Zhao,

693
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,380
when the Miao family's ship
was seized back in Futing,

694
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,580
you paid to calm the angry crowd

695
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,220
and even covered the initial costs.

696
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,340
That's how we have
the Miao family's shop now.

697
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,620
You've always had a clear perspective.

698
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,620
But recently,

699
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:56,959
I've faced some situations

700
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,279
that I can't figure out.

701
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,540
My mind is a mess.

702
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,799
I need your guidance

703
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,420
on what to do.

704
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,940
Ansu,

705
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,300
I know you genuinely love Song Han.

706
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,220
But you need to see him for who he is.

707
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,959
What Song Han is doing

708
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,540
is treason.

709
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,740
This won't end well.

710
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,500
I know what you're trying to say.

711
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,980
But as a princess now,

712
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,060
every word and action of mine
is under scrutiny.

713
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,060
I have no freedom.

714
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,740
If you need help, seek out Chen Jia.

715
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,180
He knows what to do.

716
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,340
Chen Jia?

717
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,740
Weren't they just discussing
profit adjustments?

718
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:49,820
Why hasn't the Princess returned

719
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:51,780
at this hour?

720
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,060
Don't be afraid.

721
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,940
I didn't bring you here to harm you.

722
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,940
I only want to know

723
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,980
why did you run away
the moment you saw me?

724
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,300
Still not talking, huh?

725
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,020
Don't blame me for being ruthless.

726
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,900
All right, I'll talk.

727
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,780
Master sent

728
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,900
someone to come after my life

729
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,999
because...

730
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,740
Because of Young Master Anping.

731
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,959
Once the poison takes effect,
he won't recognize anyone.

732
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,199
Master has locked himself
in the bathhouse

733
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,730
