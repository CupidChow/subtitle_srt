1
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,790
This way!

2
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,700
Are you okay?

3
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,279
I'm fine.

4
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,960
Officer Chen, why are you here?

5
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,200
Why is my Pomegranate Jade with you?

6
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,369
It broke, right?

7
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,299
So, I wanted to fix it.

8
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,849
But I still couldn't fix it

9
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,430
despite working on it for so long.

10
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,350
But don't worry.

11
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,060
I'll get it fixed.

12
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,350
Where are they?

13
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,990
Check over there!

14
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,390
Hurry up!

15
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,550
Open the door!

16
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,020
(Qing)

17
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,899
Do you think you can get rid of me

18
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,560
with just a gold badge?

19
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,609
You wench, I'll kill you.

20
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,649
You fool!

21
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,649
Don't be so blind.

22
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,529
Sorry

23
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,670
for offending you.

24
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,439
=Blossom=
(Adapted from the novel "Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

25
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,700
=Episode 23=

26
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,470
Your Ladyship.

27
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,660
Our men are guarding
the outer east, west, and south gates.

28
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,430
Except for the corner gate that leads
to the Duke of Ying's Residence.

29
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,649
But that gate is always closed.

30
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,310
Is Duke of Ying
in his residence tonight?

31
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,560
According to his servants,

32
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,979
he is patrolling the south gate tonight.

33
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,160
So, he's not in his residence.

34
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,630
He went to the south gate for no reason.

35
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,560
And the northern city is on fire.

36
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,950
This is not right.

37
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,720
Open the gate!

38
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,790
Open the gate!

39
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,670
Wait!

40
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,550
Open the gate!

41
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,619
Who are you?

42
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,760
Your Ladyship.

43
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,529
I work for Duke of Ying.

44
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,920
There's a fire outside.

45
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,200
His Grace is worried about you.

46
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,240
So, he has sent us here to check on you.

47
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,150
Hurry up and get some poles
to bar the gate.

48
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,990
The Duke of Ying's Residence and
Yizhi Hall are united in public.

49
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,710
But we are actually sworn enemies.

50
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,810
My eldest uncle will not
send someone to check on us.

51
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,760
Open the gate!

52
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:57,699
- They are not his guards.
- Open the gate!

53
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,470
Your Ladyship!
Something bad has happened!

54
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,579
A group of bandits

55
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,499
are causing chaos on the street.

56
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,640
Bandits?

57
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,109
Open the gate!

58
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,980
(Yizhi Hall)

59
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,470
Open the gate now!

60
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,619
- Are you sure?
- Open the gate!

61
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,329
- The city gate should be closed.
- Open the gate!

62
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,680
How can the bandits enter the city?

63
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,939
I saw them on the roof.

64
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,059
Of course I'm sure.

65
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,800
Our backdoor is also blocked
by the bandits.

66
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,019
What about the corner gate that connects
us to the Duke of Ying's Residence?

67
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,940
There are many guards there
with more than enough weapons.

68
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,769
It's locked.
And no one is responding to us.

69
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,200
We are trapped here.

70
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,009
- Open the door now!
- Break it down!

71
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:29,929
Roger that!

72
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,260
(Yizhi Hall)

73
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,870
Hang in there.

74
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,209
You. Bring our men
from the west gate here.

75
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,340
- Roger that.
- Hurry up.

76
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,300
The Duke of Ying's Residence
must be behind this.

77
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,510
Should we fire a signal
to inform His Lordship?

78
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,769
I'll look for the flare.

79
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,619
Open the gate!

80
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,380
(Yizhi Hall)
Open the gate!

81
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,760
Wait.

82
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,230
Come back.

83
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,240
First, they lured him away
with the fire in the northern city.

84
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,169
Now, the bandits
have entered the Capital

85
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,440
with no one preventing them.

86
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,699
- Someone must have planned this.
- Break it down.

87
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,250
If His Lordship rushes back,

88
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,329
he'll be charged with deserting his duty

89
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,630
and deceiving His Majesty.

90
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,200
Worse, he can be charged with treason.

91
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,960
Hit it with all your might.

92
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,769
The rest of you, climb the wall.

93
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,910
Roger that!

94
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,089
- Hurry up!
- Hurry up!

95
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,230
Get up.

96
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,600
Watch it.

97
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,320
There's someone on the wall!

98
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,699
- Your Lordship.
- How's Her Ladyship?

99
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,880
Where's the Military Command?

100
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,899
Your Lordship.

101
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,740
The Military Command
hasn't sent any reports.

102
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,260
Criminals will take advantage
of this fire for sure.

103
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,570
Why hasn't he reported anything?

104
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,320
The Military Command is useless.

105
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,310
Your Lordship.

106
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,300
Her Ladyship has always
been wise and resourceful.

107
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,579
Besides, General Yan
is guarding the residence.

108
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,070
Her Ladyship has the flares with her.

109
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,029
If she's in danger,

110
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,630
she'll send us a signal.

111
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,839
If Ms. Longevity knows
that this is done on purpose

112
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,329
to make me be absent without leave,

113
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,150
she won't fire the flare.

114
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,530
I have to go back.

115
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,600
Your Lordship.

116
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,160
You can't do that, Your Lordship.

117
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,399
We are the Imperial Guard of the palace.

118
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,529
If we leave without informing
His Majesty about it,

119
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,800
we'll be charged for treason.

120
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,200
Hurry up! Push them down!

121
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,270
How long can we hold them back?

122
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,760
You hurt so many of my men.

123
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,350
Your Ladyship.

124
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,939
I'm told that you are a wealthy person.

125
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,880
We just want to make a living.

126
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,630
We just want to borrow some money.

127
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,030
If you give us the money,

128
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,690
- Your Ladyship.
- we'll spare your life.

129
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,950
Change into a maid's outfit.

130
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,579
My sister and I will do our best

131
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,950
to help you escape even
if it'll cost us our lives.

132
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,110
I'm the lady of the house.

133
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,579
If I leave,
people will lose their morale.

134
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,000
And everyone will die.

135
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,150
Besides, the street
is full of bandits now.

136
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,590
It may be safer in the residence.

137
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,329
There are three factors
in winning a fight.

138
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,459
First, courage.

139
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,329
Second, location.

140
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,179
And third, situation.

141
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,499
(Yizhi Hall)
This is our home.

142
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,020
All three factors are to our advantage.

143
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,409
If we give it our all to fight,

144
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,680
we may win.

145
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,699
Your Ladyship.

146
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,070
Just say the word

147
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:09,710
and we'll fight to the end with them.

148
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,379
Attack!

149
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,200
If they dare to barge in,

150
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,030
we'll eliminate them all.

151
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,600
Mr. Chen.

152
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,619
Your Ladyship.

153
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,630
You know the layout
of the residence the best.

154
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,390
Try and bring us some backups
from Zhaowen Bookstore.

155
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,529
Your Ladyship.

156
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,829
His Lordship entrusted your safety to me

157
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,340
when he left the residence.

158
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,320
I'll protect you

159
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,689
at the cost of my life.

160
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,830
This is an emergency.

161
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,169
I'll find a way

162
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:42,160
to inform Mr. Yan
to bring some guards with him.

163
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,939
But there are many bandits here.

164
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,660
I'm just worried
that they'll have a plan B

165
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,410
to take down Yizhi Hall.

166
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,289
I think the gate can hold
for a while longer.

167
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,990
Let's go according to my plan first.

168
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,640
I won't let you down.

169
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,099
Su Xin. Send someone to get
the firewood from the shed.

170
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,409
Pile it in the middle
of the courtyard and light it up.

171
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,090
When Mr. Yan and
the others see the fire,

172
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,180
they'll come and rescue us.

173
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,219
Yes, Your Ladyship.

174
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,169
Su Lan.

175
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:11,219
Send someone to wet
all the firewood sheds.

176
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,280
Then use heavy furniture
to block the door.

177
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,280
Ask the kitchen maids
to start boiling oil.

178
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,640
Yes, Your Ladyship.

179
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,920
Come with me.

180
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,920
Shh.

181
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,550
Hurry up.

182
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,830
Hurry up.

183
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,000
What are you doing?

184
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,190
Move aside!

185
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,449
Boss. The west gate has been breached.

186
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,289
Good.

187
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,569
(Yizhi Hall)
Continue to break this gate down.

188
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,859
Others, come with me.

189
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,769
Yes!

190
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,910
Let's go!

191
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,140
(Natural Grace and Talent)

192
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,590
Your Ladyship!

193
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,139
The west gate has been breached!

194
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,800
The bandits are pouring in now.

195
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,280
We can't fight them face-on.

196
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,219
Take the weak and women
to hide in the cellar.

197
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,139
Don't make any noise.

198
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,780
Others get into the firewood shed with me.

199
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,539
Let's go.

200
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,690
Let's go.

201
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,640
- Boss.
- Boss.

202
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,339
Ask our men in the east and west gate

203
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,529
to guard the gates.

204
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,649
You, go in and search for money.

205
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,400
- Yes, Boss!
- As for the rest, find the people here.

206
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,070
- Let's go!
- Yes, Boss!

207
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,560
Hurry up, over there!

208
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,440
General Yan, look.

209
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,640
Why is there smoke
coming out of Yizhi Hall?

210
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,040
She's at the end of the rope.

211
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,739
But she lit up a pyre

212
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,470
to light up the way for us.

213
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,049
Split up and look for them!

214
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,019
Yes, Boss!

215
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,099
Come with me.

216
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,240
- Roger that!
- Roger that!

217
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,040
Boss, over here!

218
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,440
They are all inside.

219
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,049
But this shed is wet with water.

220
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,979
We can't light it up so easily.

221
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,070
Your Ladyship,
there are many of them outside.

222
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,400
Just some women hiding inside in fear.

223
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,320
They can't escape.

224
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,480
Your Ladyship.

225
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,110
You are quite the heroine.

226
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,110
Unfortunately, someone wants you dead.

227
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,800
This is my first time.

228
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,070
It's okay.

229
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,550
Focus.

230
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,800
Stare at your target.

231
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,000
Aim.

232
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,710
It's normal to be scared
for the first time.

233
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,990
But the more afraid you are,
the calmer you should be.

234
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,640
Clear your mind.

235
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,680
Don't worry. I'm with you.

236
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,850
I just need to take down
the ringleader first.

237
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,529
We don't know who will die here today.

238
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,160
Boss, are you okay?

239
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,500
You are so useless.

240
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,630
Why didn't you tell me
that they have a hand cannon?

241
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,199
Your Ladyship.

242
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,870
You hit the person beside him.

243
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,980
Attack.

244
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,280
What kind of residence is this?

245
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,990
They have five hand cannons.

246
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,040
Aren't they afraid
that their weapons will be confiscated?

247
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,190
Shoot!

248
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,990
Those with shields, attack!

249
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,470
Your Ladyship, we only have
one shot left. What should we do?

250
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,800
We stay still for now.

251
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,040
As long as they stay back
for fear of us,

252
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,230
someone will come to our rescue.

253
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,979
- Come with me to rescue Her Ladyship.
- Roger that.

254
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,870
- The rest, protect the villagers.
- Roger that!

255
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,449
- Where's Her Ladyship?
- She's still in the residence.

256
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,280
Let's get rid of these bandits first.

257
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,480
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

258
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,619
Boss.

259
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,859
We are in trouble.

260
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,830
Someone is attacking
from the west and main gate.

261
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,409
Boss.

262
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,499
We are tricked.

263
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,289
They are just trying to buy time.

264
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,640
Let's retreat now.

265
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,390
Darn it.

266
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,880
Looks like

267
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,680
I've been set up
by Wang Yingxue again.

268
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,240
Retreat!

269
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:05,800
Your Ladyship, they have retreated.

270
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,120
Ms. Longevity!

271
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,400
Your Lordship.

272
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,689
Where's her Ladyship?

273
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,920
She's in her room.

274
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:22,979
Your Lordship.

275
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,809
It was unfortunate that you weren't here

276
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,780
to witness her magnificence.

277
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,409
She managed to hold them back with just
some servants and maidservants.

278
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,339
What's our casualty?

279
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,200
Eight guards are hurt
and two are crippled.

280
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,090
They managed to hold back
dozens of bandits.

281
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,049
Do these bodies belong to the bandits?

282
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,190
Yes.

283
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,410
You don't have to follow me anymore.

284
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,859
- Your Lordship.
- Is her Ladyship inside?

285
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,000
Yes.

286
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,360
Ms. Longevity.

287
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,339
Why are you back?

288
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,680
I saw that the city was on fire.

289
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,990
So, I came back in case
you were in trouble.

290
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,040
The servants told me

291
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,680
that my heroine

292
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,950
commanded them fiercely
and defeated the bandits

293
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,400
despite their greater number.

294
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,350
You were amazing.

295
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,750
Why are you crying?

296
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,280
I don't know.

297
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,040
I didn't want to cry
when I faced the bandits.

298
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,950
But I want to cry when I see you.

299
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,689
I'm sorry.

300
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,870
It was my fault.

301
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,640
I should've come back earlier.

302
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,790
Back then, I married you

303
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,030
to protect you.

304
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,230
But now, you were in danger

305
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,400
because of me.

306
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,030
How do you know it was because of you?

307
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,630
Maybe

308
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,470
the bandits were just interested
in my dowry?

309
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:19,830
By the way,

310
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,969
aren't you supposed to guard
the Western Mountain Palace?

311
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,470
Why did you come back out of the blue?

312
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,440
Don't worry.

313
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,270
I came back alone.

314
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,980
The Imperial Guard
will protect the palace.

315
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,950
We are the Imperial Guard of the palace.

316
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,600
If we leave without informing
His Majesty about it,

317
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,499
we'll be charged for treason.

318
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,640
Lu Ming, here's my order.

319
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,059
Yes, Your Lordship.

320
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,470
Lead the Imperial Guard
to protect the palace.

321
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,850
Make sure to guard the palace well.

322
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,440
Your Lordship.

323
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,899
So, the elites of the Ding Army

324
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,750
are in the Capital.

325
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:57,929
Yes.

326
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,779
It doesn't matter if they are
in Futing or the Capital.

327
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,200
They will always serve their country

328
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,030
and defend our people.

329
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,030
I know that.

330
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,299
But you can't let anyone know

331
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,859
that the elites of the Ding Army

332
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,590
are in the Capital.

333
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,840
You better get back
to the Western Mountain Palace.

334
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,920
I don't want anything to go wrong.

335
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,100
(Peace and Harmony)

336
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,950
May God protect us.

337
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,510
May the Duke of Ding protect us.

338
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,099
Your Lordship.

339
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,200
Please come back quickly.

340
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,590
Your Lordship.

341
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,000
Who is it?

342
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,630
Your Lordship.

343
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,000
Interrogate them.

344
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,339
Let's see if they are bandits or moles.

345
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,189
Yes, Your Lordship.

346
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,449
(Duke of Jining's Residence)

347
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,590
Your Ladyship.

348
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,339
- Look.
- Kneel.

349
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,680
She's trying to run away.

350
00:20:58,730 --> 00:20:59,880
It's chaotic outside.

351
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,880
Where are you going to escape to?

352
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,899
Where does the money come from?

353
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,739
Your Ladyship.

354
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,830
Your Mother, Madam Wang,

355
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,040
asked me to take His Lordship's
badge to leave the city.

356
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,799
I don't know about anything else.

357
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,169
I'm sorry.

358
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,080
(My mother took
His Lordship's official badge?)

359
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,370
Ready a carriage for me right now.

360
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,859
- It's chaotic outside.
- Your Ladyship.

361
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,249
Your Ladyship, where are you going?

362
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,089
- I need to get to His Lordship.
- Your Ladyship.

363
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,470
Let me go on behalf of you.

364
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,579
You can't save His Lordship.

365
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,429
How about this?

366
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,859
Bring all the guards with us

367
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,759
to escort us.

368
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,900
Yes, Your Ladyship.

369
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,310
What?

370
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,200
We agreed on 30 to 40 people

371
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,510
who would leave after killing Dou Zhao.

372
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,510
But more than 200 bandits came.

373
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,640
That's treason.

374
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,440
It was indeed quite a mess.

375
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,160
But that wench must be dead

376
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,080
after getting attacked
by so many people.

377
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,310
We are doomed too.

378
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:54,080
Something so major has happened
under His Majesty's watch.

379
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,819
They'll get to the bottom of this.

380
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,160
Don't worry, Madam.

381
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,899
The commanders of the Military Command
are at the Drunken Bordello.

382
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,449
When they realize it,

383
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,139
the bandits will be gone by then.

384
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,920
They won't be suspicious of us.

385
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,310
You are right.

386
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,510
I need to thank you

387
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,030
for this.

388
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,790
This is just my job.

389
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,489
Your Ladyship,
I've gotten the information.

390
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,420
His Lordship is drinking
at the Drunken Bordello.

391
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,470
Okay. Hurry up.

392
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,360
Hurry up!

393
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,480
Stop right there!

394
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,710
Stay away!

395
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,729
Stop that carriage!

396
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:04,160
We can't go back empty-handed.

397
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,480
Stop the carriage!

398
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,360
(Duke of Jining's Residence)
It's the Duke of Jining's carriage.

399
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,299
You are Wang Yingxue's
youngest daughter.

400
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,339
Catch her!

401
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,510
Run, Your Ladyship!

402
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,030
May I escape the fire pit of hell

403
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,950
and have my sins erased.

404
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,910
Tingyu.

405
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,360
Little girl.

406
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,440
You have nowhere to run now.

407
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,169
Come home with me.

408
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:10,579
I can give you as much money
as you want.

409
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,990
I don't want money.

410
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,230
I want you.

411
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,920
You wench.

412
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,510
You'll pay for your mother's sins.

413
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,950
Blame your mother for this.

414
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,150
Let's go.

415
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,920
Your Lordship.

416
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:16,490
Let's go.

417
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,339
- Let's drink until we drop.
- Let's continue.

418
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,409
Let's drink until we drop.

419
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,720
- Let's go.
- Let's keep drinking.

420
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,090
- Let's keep drinking.
- Let's go.

421
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,600
- Great!
- Great!

422
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:15,220
(Zhou Jiaxin)

423
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,040
Your Lordship.

424
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,720
Your Lordship.

425
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,480
Eunuch Wang.

426
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,990
Why are you here so late at night?

427
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,160
Your Lordship.

428
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,030
Her Majesty has asked me
to bring you some food.

429
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,249
Thank you, Eunuch Wang.

430
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,639
Relay my thanks to Her Majesty.

431
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,220
(Flow of Colors)

432
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,070
Your Ladyship.

433
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,249
General Yan.

434
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,339
We have locked them up
and interrogated them.

435
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,030
They work for the Duke of Ying.

436
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:27,969
Also,

437
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,959
we found this from the Cangbei Gang.

438
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,700
(Wei Tingyu)

439
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,120
Wei Tingyu.

440
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:37,339
The Military Command
is supposed to be on duty.

441
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,640
But we've received news

442
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,649
that the Duke of Jining
and his troops

443
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,969
are drinking and enjoying themselves
in the southern city.

444
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,670
It's no wonder that they can't hear
the pleas coming from the northern city.

445
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,680
Those commanders
are used to having it their way.

446
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:50,650
I'm afraid that their subordinates
didn't even dare to report it to them.

447
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,619
Your Ladyship, what happened?

448
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,729
That's what I want to ask you.

449
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,209
Why are you questioning me instead?

450
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,190
Your Ladyship, it was our fault.

451
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,749
We were focused on putting out the fire.

452
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,050
So, we opened the corner gate
and the bandits managed to get in.

453
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,059
I don't know what Mr. Yan

454
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,489
found out

455
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:08,600
from those bandits.

456
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:11,299
But don't let it drive a wedge between
the Duke of Ying's Residence

457
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,120
and Yizhi Hall and break
His Lordship's heart.

458
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,500
When the bandits were attacking,

459
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,619
we went to the Duke of Ying's Residence
to borrow some weapons.

460
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,540
But it was bolted down.

461
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,929
When Her Ladyship
secured the south gate,

462
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,299
the corner door was left open
and the bandits came out of nowhere.

463
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,819
It was too much of a coincidence.

464
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,299
Your Ladyship, yes.

465
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,169
From what I know,
the bandits from Cangzhou

466
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,449
were targeting your dowry.

467
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,480
Your Ladyship, please stop.

468
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,680
You scoundrel.

469
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:47,230
Where did the bandits come from?

470
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,649
Didn't they know

471
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,880
whose residence is this?

472
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,790
They went crazy over money.

473
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,360
Cousin-in-law.

474
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,640
Don't worry.

475
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,230
Yantang will take over this matter soon.

476
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:10,550
Butler Lyu opened the corner gate
to get water to put out the fire.

477
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,600
It's unfortunate
that something went wrong.

478
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:18,470
Do you know how many people
were killed and injured

479
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,880
by the bandits tonight?

480
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,929
Everyone in Yizhi Hall

481
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,649
almost lost their lives.

482
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:26,339
It's not an issue that can be dropped

483
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,120
just by saying that it was a mistake.

484
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,840
Someone needs to be held responsible
for the lost lives.

485
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,929
Mother, this is their family's matter.

486
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,409
Our uncle is using us as a shield

487
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,729
between them.

488
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:45,870
We better

489
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,160
stay out of this.

490
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:55,120
After all, I'm from a humble family.

491
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,310
I don't know the severity
of this matter.

492
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,099
Go and bring me

493
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,009
my matching token.

494
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,150
Yes, Madam.

495
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,200
I'm not capable enough to handle this.

496
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,750
Please take over
the Duke of Ying's Residence

497
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,360
and settle this issue
to help a fellow relative.

498
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,070
Cousin-in-law.

499
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,460
(Duke of Ying's Residence)

500
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,250
Your Ladyship.

501
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,750
Are you from the northern city?

502
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:36,649
Yes.

503
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,850
Why didn't you report it
when the bandits entered the city?

504
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:41,209
Military Command officers
were drinking in the backyard.

505
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,310
We were ordered not to disturb them.

506
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,819
We are just low-rank officers.

507
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,540
We didn't dare
to go against their order.

508
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,160
I'll take you to them.

509
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,760
Nice!

510
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,819
- None of you are allowed to leave
- Good!

511
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,409
until you've finished all the wine here.

512
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:03,200
Nice. Cheers!

513
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:05,750
Cheers!

514
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,929
Let's have another one.

515
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,920
- Come, Duke.
- Refill their wine cups.

516
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,710
Refill their wine cups.

517
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,259
Come.

518
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,870
Let's drink another cup.

519
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,920
Dou Zhao?

520
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:37,999
Your Ladyship.

521
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,439
Are you trying to kill an official

522
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,320
just because your husband
holds a lot of power?

523
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:44,210
The duties of the Military Command
are to take down criminals

524
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,740
and protect the city.

525
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,380
Now, hundreds of bandits
have entered the city

526
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,310
to attack and plunder
the houses of our people.

527
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,780
But all of you are
enjoying yourself here.

528
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,220
You are wasting their hard-earned money
to entertain yourselves.

529
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,780
Death is something you deserve.

530
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,940
My arrow didn't pierce your heart
because the people of the northern city

531
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,159
need you to come to their rescue.

532
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,799
She's telling the truth.

533
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,919
Many criminal gangs

534
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,810
and hundreds of bandits

535
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,670
have entered through the northern gate
under Official Wei's jurisdiction.

536
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,579
They have been burning
the city for four hours.

537
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,649
What?

538
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,060
Why didn't you report it sooner?

539
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,140
You told us

540
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,980
that drinking is to be enjoyed.

541
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,519
The sky won't fall.

542
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,780
But your good mood will be gone
once it's ruined.

543
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,119
As a man, you should admit
your mistake and punish yourself.

544
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,460
Do you need me to help you?

545
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,699
What bandits are you talking about?

546
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,320
I don't know anything.

547
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:42,119
I found this from the bandit
who was ordered to kill me.

548
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,460
(Wei Tingyu)

549
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,239
I bring this official badge with me
everywhere I go.

550
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,620
How did the bandits get hold of it?

551
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,839
The official badge needs
to be checked when the soldiers

552
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,320
of the Military Command switch shifts.

553
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,990
How did the Cangbei Gang
that loaned money

554
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,660
to your mother-in-law get it?

555
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,780
If you really know nothing of it,

556
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,820
it means that your badge was stolen.

557
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,340
Your Lordship,
something bad has happened.

558
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,380
Something happened

559
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,700
to Her Ladyship.

560
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,780
Ming.

561
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,399
Ming, I'm here.

562
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,399
Wake up.

563
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,540
Ming.

564
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,780
Ming.

565
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,340
Ming.

566
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,900
Tingyu.

567
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,980
I knew

568
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,180
that you would come to me.

569
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,980
Do you still remember

570
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:45,140
what you told me when you sneaked

571
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,479
into my courtyard back then?

572
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,799
I do.

573
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,319
The heaven will be my witness.

574
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,940
I, Wei Tingyu, hereby vow

575
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,900
that I'm willing to fire
all the maids in my residence.

576
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,500
From now on,

577
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,700
you will be the only woman I draw.

578
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,319
If I break this vow,

579
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,660
my heart will be punctured
and I'll die in the wild...

580
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,710
Don't talk. I'll get you a physician.

581
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,770
I'll get you a physician.

582
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,159
Go and get me a physician!

583
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,420
Tingyu.

584
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,620
Ming.

585
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,540
You said

586
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,580
that I would be the only woman you drew.

587
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,980
I know.

588
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,959
If you break that vow…

589
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,260
My heart will be punctured

590
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,620
and you'll die in the wild.

591
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,820
The curse

592
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,500
has fallen on me

593
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,980
and I have broken it

594
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,140
for you.

595
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,740
Ming.

596
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,260
Ming.

597
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,060
Ming.

598
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,400
Ming.

599
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,660
(Wealth and Luxury)
How dare them!

600
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,620
Our country is at peace.

601
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,900
But the bandits dared break into
the Duke of Ying's Residence.

602
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,790
What was the Magistrate
of Shengtian doing?

603
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,540
Where was the Military Command?

604
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,900
Go.

605
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,799
Bring me the Magistrate of Shengtian

606
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,499
and the commanders

607
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,820
of the Military Command.

608
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,980
They dare rob
the Duke of Ying's Residence today,

609
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,500
they'll rob me tomorrow.

610
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,620
Your Majesty.

611
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,140
Please give me the permission
to arrest the criminals.

612
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,420
Bring me my sword.

613
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,639
Song Mo.

614
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,490
Yes, Your Majesty.

615
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,580
Lead the Imperial Guard
to investigate this matter.

616
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,500
Get to the bottom of it.

617
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,510
Find out who was so bold enough

618
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,319
to rob nobleman
who is serving the country.

619
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,180
Find out who did this under my watch!

620
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

621
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,499
(Letter of Confession: I led the bandits
into the Capitol City and I regret it.)

622
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,140
(This is my letter of confession.
I've sinned. Zhou Jiaxin.)

623
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,020
It was always Madam who stayed
in touch with the bandits.

624
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,660
I was just the messenger.

625
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,740
I saw with my own eyes

626
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,460
that she killed my mother-in-law.

627
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,180
How dare you!

628
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,719
You are her daughter-in-law.

629
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,150
You used my name to commit this crime

630
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,950
and now, you are trying
to shift the blame onto me.

631
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,879
Nanny Zhou's
letter of confession is here.

632
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,180
Are you going to deny it?

633
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,220
Yingxue.

634
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,919
Back then, I had a rough time
with my career.

635
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,380
And you imitated others' handwriting
a few times to help me out.

636
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,260
I can recognize your handwriting.

637
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,660
Father.

638
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,340
Two of the ministers
from the six ministries are here.

639
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,500
Grand Secretary Wang.

640
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,780
If you plead to His Majesty for mercy,

641
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,900
I'll do the same

642
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:17,020
to spare Yingxue
from getting the death penalty.

643
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,420
I've doted on you so much

644
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,060
that I've turned you into a monster.

645
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,940
As your father,

646
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,580
I doted on you because I felt guilty.

647
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,879
But I've turned you into a monster

648
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,340
who takes human lives lightly.

649
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,980
I will ask His Majesty
to punish you severely.

650
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,900
Xingyi.

651
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,860
Calm down.

652
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,860
Say no more.

653
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,919
You just want me
to infuriate His Majesty

654
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,900
over my daughter.

655
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,180
I'll let you

656
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,540
be the Grand Secretary.

657
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,500
I've failed in disciplining my daughter.

658
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,580
I will resign from His Majesty.

659
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,500
As for the rest,
it's your family matter.

660
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,900
You can do whatever you want.

661
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,340
Father.

662
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,079
If I die,

663
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,740
the rest of your life
will be a nightmare.

664
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,700
You'll regret it immensely, Father.

665
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,980
What a sin.

666
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,260
- What a sin!
- Father!

667
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,959
I've done so much for you all my life.

668
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,420
I didn't do anything wrong!

669
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,580
We have both the witness
and the evidence here.

670
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,900
You've been obsessed
with this your whole life.

671
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,660
For what?

672
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,500
Shiying.

673
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,900
Are you going to force me
to admit to my crime too?

674
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,660
What have I done wrong, Shiying?

675
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,660
The government has had trouble
eliminating the Cangbei Gang,

676
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,420
the Chimen Gang, and the Five Yamas.

677
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,380
And it's all because of you.

678
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,980
Leading the bandits into the city
is unheard of.

679
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,100
Yingxue.

680
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,660
Don't drag us down with you
if you seek death.

681
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,980
Just admit to your crime.

682
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,100
(Military Command)

683
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,760
No.

684
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,980
Wei Tingzhen holds

685
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,660
half of the capital money.

686
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:43,900
The Duke of Jing's residence
is Her Majesty's original family.

687
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,279
Her brother is the one
who lost his official badge.

688
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,439
Are you trying to ruin

689
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,620
the reputation of the royal family
by doing so?

690
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,660
Think about it.

691
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,580
Why isn't Wei Tingzhen here yet?

692
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,580
The Wei family

693
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,540
can break its ties with me.

694
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,260
But you can't.

695
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,660
If you force me to admit to my crime,

696
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:04,860
fine.

697
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,159
I'll admit

698
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,660
that I committed treason
that will wipe out the entire family!

699
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,319
You have gone mad!

700
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,839
How dare you say you committed treason?

701
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,180
Why not?

702
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,380
I did everything for the Dou family
my whole life.

703
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,660
Now, you want to get me killed.

704
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,159
Why shouldn't I drag you down with me?

705
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,009
You!

706
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,170
Yingxue.

707
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,740
The first person got killed
because of you

708
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,100
is Ming.

709
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,100
Father knows

710
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,020
that you are taking good care
of the family.

711
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,760
I'm indeed useless.

712
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,369
But I don't want you

713
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:17,420
to risk so much for me.

714
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,740
If I can't be together with him forever,

715
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,260
I'll meet him in the afterlife.

716
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,260
If the bandits were not here,

717
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,700
no one would've died.

718
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,540
- This is karma.
- Ming.

719
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,679
I'm sure you know

720
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,900
- Ming.
- whose sin it is.

721
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,580
Ming.

722
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,260
You are still alive, right?

723
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,900
Ming.

724
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,060
Look at me.

725
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,940
I'm your mother.

726
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,420
This is their fault.

727
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,500
This is their fault.

728
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,740
They are forcing me
to admit to my crime, Ming.

729
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,880
Wake up, Ming.

730
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,180
Be good.

731
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,700
Ming, wake up. Ming.

732
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,620
I didn't kill you.

733
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,100
It's them.

734
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,919
You are dead because of them!

735
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,140
Now, they want to kill me too, Ming!

736
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,220
Greed is your downfall.

737
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,660
You know who killed her.

738
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,900

I'm not the only one in the Capital

741
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,700
who wants you dead.

742
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,300
I'll make you live a life of suffering

743
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,140
forever!

744
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,540
She has gone mad.

745
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,220
Take her away.

746
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,319
Our relationship will be bound by love

747
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,940
and we'll stay united forever.

748
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,220
Dear.

749
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,220
Do you think it'll come true for us?

750
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,559
The bandits are vicious.

751
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,999
You have to come back safe and sound

752
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,079
