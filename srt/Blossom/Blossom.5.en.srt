1
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:11,280
(Ding)

2
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,020
You need to get proper rest.

3
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,650
It's a head injury.

4
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,100
It's not a trivial matter.

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,170
It's only a minor injury.

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,570
I've already recovered.

7
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,679
But your old shoulder injury acts up

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,210
every time it rains.

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,700
It has been five years already.

10
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,090
I'm fine.

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,310
Futing gets a lot of rain
and has a high humidity level.

12
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,300
Maybe a trip to the capital

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,420
will actually do me good.

14
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,170
Officer Chen,

15
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,940
why did His Majesty summon

16
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,020
Duke of Ding to the capital?

17
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,940
I dare not guess

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,100
His Majesty's intentions.

19
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,740
Sir, please be rest assured.

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,940
Duke of Ding is someone we all respect.

21
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,940
His visit is just a routine matter.

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,970
We ensure Duke of Ding's safety.

23
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,530
Yuantang,

24
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,730
stop scaring him.

25
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,380
Don't frown all the time.

26
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,730
It's all right.

27
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,309
Most likely,

28
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,749
His Majesty summons me back

29
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,330
to report on the maritime disaster.

30
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,650
Remember

31
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,450
to take care of my wife.

32
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,340
Let's go, Duke of Ding.

33
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,479
Marshal, though the hurricane
and tsunami have passed,

34
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,949
over a hundred household
still haven't repaired their homes.

35
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,390
How do we handle the relief efforts?

36
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,730
Soldiers of the Ding Army,
heed my orders!

37
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,620
Even if the sky has fallen,

38
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,380
do not stop the relief efforts!

39
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,060
Once the drainage is done,

40
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,639
we need to help
the people plant their crops.

41
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,250
Only when the seedlings are planted

42
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,340
will the people's hearts be at ease.

43
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,039
Do you understand?

44
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,180
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

45
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,500
Marshal!

46
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,639
The Duke of Ding's Resident

47
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,359
is surrounded by the Shadow Guard.

48
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,620
No one can get in or out.

49
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,340
How could this happen?

50
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,340
I'm afraid this case
isn't as simple as it seems.

51
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,780
Sir,

52
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,759
(Duke of Ding's Residence)
the front and back are guarded,

53
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,380
with about forty or fifty men in total.

54
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,340
If the emperor only wanted
a simple audience,

55
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,180
why would he go to such lengths?

56
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,189
Sir,

57
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,039
let's charge in

58
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,639
and rescue Duke of Ding's family.

59
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,780
Yes.

60
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,340
Don't act rashly.

61
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,639
Wait here for me.

62
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,780
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

63
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,519
=Blossom=

64
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,379
(Adapted from the novel
"Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

65
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,640
=Episode 5=

66
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,160
(Half a Month Later)

67
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,370
I apologize for disturbing you so late.

68
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,050
My master's surname is Mei
and a merchant from the south.

69
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,860
We're passing through this area
and need a place to stay for the night.

70
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,060
Young Lady, you're up.

71
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,220
What's the hour now?

72
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,290
Just past three-quarters
after the Yin hour.

73
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,300
Young Lady,

74
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,100
a group of merchants arrived
at the manor.

75
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,020
The head calls himself, Mr. Mei.

76
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,719
But I noticed everyone
in the group walks quietly,

77
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,170
with calloused palms.

78
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,189
Mr. Chen has sent people here
multiple times,

79
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,660
to ask if you've woken up.

80
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,290
Bring Mr. Chen here.

81
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,700
The servants inside the manor
are very tight-lipped.

82
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,730
All we know is that the one in charge
is called Fourth Young Lady.

83
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,900
Fourth Young Lady?

84
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,709
We're probably in trouble now.

85
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,959
Those visitors are no ordinary people.

86
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,460
They're from Duke of Ding's forces.

87
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,170
How can you tell?

88
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,170
The scholar in green
who calls himself the accountant,

89
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,100
is Yan Chaoqing.

90
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,479
He's one of Duke of Ding's

91
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,530
most trusted subordinates.

92
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,530
Do you know him?

93
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,260
I'm grateful for your kind attention.

94
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,260
I've kept

95
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,260
some of my past hidden.

96
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,610
But I won't mistake him.

97
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,749
He used to be an advisor to Zhang Kai,
Futing's former Grand Coordinator.

98
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,359
I know his real name isn't Chen Qushui,

99
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,580
but Chen Bo.

100
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,220
The one my uncle executed
on the battlefield?

101
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,460
Fifteen years ago,

102
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,970
Dongyu pirates besieged Futing.

103
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,189
- Official Zhang Kai abandoned the city
- Stop right there!

104
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,260
but was captured and executed
by Duke of Ding.

105
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,780
My former superior

106
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,170
was Zhang Kai.

107
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,669
The shame of abandoning the city.

108
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,799
Yan Chaoqing would definitely see me

109
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,410
as a dishonorable person.

110
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,370
I've caused you trouble.

111
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,770
I...

112
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,539
Please get up, Mr. Chen.

113
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,159
(Graceful and Refined)

114
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,140
When I appointed you as my advisor,

115
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,610
I promised not to ask about your past.

116
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,690
Your former superior
was afraid of death.

117
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,340
It wasn't something you could stop.

118
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,610
What I'm worried about

119
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,490
is that Zhending has no food to give out

120
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,170
or troops to lend out.

121
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,820
Why are they here
with their identities hidden?

122
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,930
That Mr. Mei is carrying a baby.

123
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,500
A baby?

124
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,180
(The lonely subject glances
at the cold sea waves.)

125
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,970
(Ten years guarding the southeast
with a cold heart.)

126
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,870
(Only regret being caught in a rainstorm
during a long and endless night.)

127
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,863
(Duke of Radiant Sea)
(Where can the crying orphan)

128
00:08:42,864 --> 00:08:44,700
(Duke of Radiant Sea)
(find refuge?)

129
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,990
Caught in a rainstorm
during a long and endless night.

130
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,850
Where can the orphan find refuge?

131
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,999
Something bad has happened to Duke of Ding.

132
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,450
Madam.

133
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,970
does the baby still spit out
the milk before sleeping?

134
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,420
He's much better after being indoors.

135
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,189
It's just that we've been traveling
for several days,

136
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,919
and with the heavy rain and rough roads.

137
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,580
If we didn't stop to rest,

138
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,250
I was afraid the baby wouldn't hold up.

139
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,650
Don't worry, we're almost there.

140
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,340
The mind of a monarch
is hard to understand.

141
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,250
Your uncle's fate is uncertain.

142
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,610
Under these circumstances,

143
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,220
it looks like the whole family
won't be able to escape.

144
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,919
(Madam Liu, Duchess of Ding)

145
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,100
He's your uncle's only bloodline.

146
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,189
Aunt, I'll take both of you away with me.

147
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:45,490
No one can leave

148
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,940
under this circumstance.

149
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,700
You knew that.

150
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,940
Protect him for me.

151
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,780
Aunt,

152
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,180
I swear on my life

153
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,850
that he won't shed
a single drop of blood.

154
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,159
The Duke is deeply favored
by the emperor.

155
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,189
He also won a great victory
at the Boat Island earlier this year.

156
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,069
When Futing was hit by the hurricane,

157
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,799
he personally led the troops to aid
in disaster relief.

158
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,540
The scribes at the capital

159
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,519
didn't even hear anything about this.

160
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,340
Duke of Ding is a duke of the highest rank,

161
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,520
with Ding Army of fifty thousand men
under his command.

162
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,159
If something really happens,
a secret order will be issued

163
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,650
to let the Shadow Guards take charge.

164
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,119
Otherwise,
it will stir up a military uprising.

165
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,799
How will the imperial court deal
with that, then?

166
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,890
How do you know about this?

167
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,700
It has always been like this

168
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,280
when a ruler is threatened
by a great person.

169
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,820
Speaking of the baby,

170
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,429
in the Ninth month of last year,
we received a letter from Futing

171
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,820
mentioning

172
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,060
that Duke of Ding's Residence
was purchasing baby supplies.

173
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,850
The one expecting must be the Duchess.

174
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,580
If the family is really
on the brink of collapse,

175
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,340
it is hard to entrust the orphan.

176
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,820
I make things even worse in an instant.

177
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:08,490
They won't leave any loose ends.

178
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,490
So, so you know Mr. Mei?

179
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,650
Mr. Mei may be young.

180
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,610
But he carries himself
with an imposing presence.

181
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,540
The others treat him
with exceptional respect.

182
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,970
A young person like him

183
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,730
is able to mobilize Duke of Ding's
elite forces at a time like this.

184
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,060
In this situation,

185
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,370
only Song Mo can do it.

186
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,730
Song Mo?

187
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,429
The one who led a surprise attack
on Yu Island at just thirteen

188
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,220
and secured a great victory
at Boat Island

189
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,180
earlier this year amidst a crisis.

190
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,940
If it's really him,

191
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,610
we have no chance of escaping.

192
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,060
I've scouted around.

193
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,850
There are forty-two women,

194
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,420
twenty servants and attendants,

195
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,829
and one elderly woman
being cared for by a maid.

196
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,970
She has gone to bed.

197
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,580
Lu Zheng and Lu Ming
are guarding the exits.

198
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,490
Everything is in place.

199
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,879
Fourth Young Lady,

200
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,340
about ten people
from the merchant convoy are missing.

201
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,100
They have surrounded the manor's exits

202
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,130
and planned to wipe us out.

203
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,420
Let it be.

204
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,549
It all started because of me

205
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,220
so I'll take responsibility for this.

206
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,730
I'll go and find them

207
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,850
and let them kill only me.

208
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,780
Mr. Chen,

209
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,220
hiding a noble orphan is punishable
by the extermination of the entire clan.

210
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,540
If it were me,

211
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,090
for the child,

212
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,490
for my subordinates,

213
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,780
and for my family,

214
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,580
I would eliminate everyone who knew too.

215
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,700
To avoid drawing attention,

216
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,180
they'll make their move
before dawn and the rain stops.

217
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,340
We don't have much time left.

218
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,170
Go and tell Ms. Tuo
to secure all the doors and windows.

219
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,940
Don't alarm Grandmother.

220
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,960
(Bide Time, Gather Strength)

221
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,120
Hush.

222
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,799
Your Lordship,

223
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,949
they're making a move.

224
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,220
Do you want us to...

225
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,940
I know you never harm women or children.

226
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,340
But to protect the Young Lord,
there's no other choice.

227
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,890
That Chen is vile and dishonorable.

228
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,700
I'm sure those with him are the same.

229
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,370
If this matter gets out,

230
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,100
the consequences will be unimaginable.

231
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,850
Uncle only has this one son.

232
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,180
I've sworn to Aunt
that I'd keep him safe.

233
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,970
If heaven punishes me
or I end up in hell for this,

234
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,300
so be it.

235
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,420
Make it quick and quiet.

236
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,220
Don't wake the children.

237
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,380
Yes, sir.

238
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:15,210
Fourth Young Lady,

239
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,100
you're heading out on this rainy night.

240
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,970
Where are you going in such a hurry?

241
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,220
It's such a stormy weather.

242
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,650
I can escort you all the way.

243
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,090
Fighting them is futile.

244
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,010
No one within a hundred steps

245
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,580
can escape from the military crossbows.

246
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,420
Forgive me.

247
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,970
Your Lordship, this move

248
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,340
is a serious mistake.

249
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,650
What did you call me?

250
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,850
Duke of Ding defied the imperial order

251
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,999
and raided homes without authorization
to provide disaster relief.

252
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,400
He's being escorted back to the capital
under charges of treason

253
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,730
with all his family members
being detained.

254
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,420
You and Duke of Ding
are close like father and son.

255
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,010
You travel with a baby
on this stormy night.

256
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,940
Are you trying to hide away

257
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,770
Duke of Ding's only bloodline?

258
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,420
Who are you?

259
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,060
I'm from the Palace Surveillance
of Palace Women.

260
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,850
His Majesty knew
you would make this move

261
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,069
so he sent me here

262
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,420
to deliver his oral decree.

263
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,700
So, do you intend

264
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,730
to share Duke of Ding's guilt for treason?

265
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,700
Chen Shun has always been in charge
of the Palace Surveillance.

266
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,370
Are you one of his people?

267
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,460
No need to test me, Your Lordship.

268
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,220
There's no one by the name of Chen Shun

269
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,300
within the six services and the office.

270
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,860
Where's your official badge?

271
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,570
(Official badge?)

272
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,810
Song Mo.

273
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,060
Since you knew my name,

274
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,770
you would how many corrupt officials
and pirates I've interrogated.

275
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,589
You could fake it to a certain extent

276
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,460
because you know a little
about those in the palace.

277
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,740
But when it comes to the finer details,

278
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,060
your uneasiness gives you away.

279
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,340
Your palm is sweaty.

280
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,580
You couldn't have orchestrated it alone.

281
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,770
Who are you working for?

282
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,570
Tell me

283
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,400
and I'll leave you a whole corpse.

284
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,200
Young Lady!

285
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,850
We got them!

286
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,730
You're here to distract me to buy time.

287
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,400
You tricked me.

288
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,880
I meant no harm.

289
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,709
This was the only way

290
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,019
to get you to sit down

291
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,490
and have a proper conversation with me.

292
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,189
There's no need to waste words
with them, Young Lady.

293
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,080
We have the child in our hands.

294
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,429
We'll escort you out of here.

295
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,629
What can they possibly do?

296
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,770
Fine!

297
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,640
Then wake the elderly lady up
in the main hall!

298
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,360
You can all die together!

299
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,670
(Eternal Passage of Time)

300
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,949
Your Lordship, wait!

301
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,120
Do not speak recklessly!

302
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,210
Taking the baby hostage is a way
to make a deal to satisfy both sides.

303
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,970
Not to flee.

304
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,560
Whether a massacre or making a deal,

305
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,010
it's up to you to decide.

306
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,550
(Twilight in Spring)

307
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,690
Duke of Ding is still being escorted

308
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,770
with his fate remains undecided.

309
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,709
Yet here you are,
risking exposure to the yamen,

310
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:41,149
or even the Ministry of Justice
and the Court of Judicial Review,

311
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,780
attempting to slaughter everyone here
to silence them.

312
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,010
That can only mean the person

313
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,770
you wish to entrust the child to
is nearby, correct?

314
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,400
Tan's Manor is far
from the imperial court

315
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,770
and they have a reputation
for loyalty and righteousness.

316
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,450
It's said the Tan Family
is indebted to Duke of Ding.

317
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,770
They would indeed be an ideal choice.

318
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,339
This woman is calculating

319
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,770
and full of schemes.

320
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,189
Your Lordship,

321
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,880
don't waste time with her.

322
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,110
There's no need to see me
as your enemy, Your Lordship.

323
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,800
I have always held great respect
for Duke of Ding and the Jiang Clan.

324
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,450
I wonder what the situation is like now.

325
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,539
I only ask

326
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,469
because the decisive issue here

327
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,840
isn't the child,

328
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,770
but the Duke of Ding himself.

329
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,730
If Duke of Ding can be freed from danger,

330
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,770
the child will naturally be safe.

331
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,010
Then Your Lordship won't have to resort
to such dishonorable actions.

332
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,320
Duke of Ding's loyalty and bravery
are known to all.

333
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,770
Those in court who can see clearly

334
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,429
will petition on his behalf.

335
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,400
You don't have to worry
about this, miss.

336
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,339
I'm sure Duchess Ying

337
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,250
is already rushing around

338
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,770
to gather old acquaintances
to submit joint petitions,

339
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,640
pleading for justice. Is that correct?

340
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,770
Under normal circumstances,
this would be the proper approach.

341
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,840
But Duke of Ding is no ordinary person.

342
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,160
Such good intentions

343
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:03,290
might only end up
as a death sentence for Duke of Ding.

344
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,290
How dare

345
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,010
a country girl speak such nonsense?

346
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,290
You...

347
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,400
Fourth Young Lady,

348
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,770
please continue.

349
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,709
But back in the day,
when Wang Jian asked for land,

350
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,660
Emperor Qin Shi Huang brushed it off
with a laugh.

351
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,010
Xiao He defamed himself,

352
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,669
and Emperor Gaozu of Han
never doubted him.

353
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,189
Zhou Yafu had achievements
in conquering seven kingdoms.

354
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,010
But he died unjustly

355
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,010
over a few slanderous words.

356
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,610
Why?

357
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,200
When one's success
overshadows the ruler,

358
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,400
there will always be envious people
who will spread lies,

359
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,690
with the intention to mislead the ruler.

360
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,490
As Su Ziyun once said,

361
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,490
"First, there is doubt,

362
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,469
and then slander takes root."

363
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,400
If His Majesty
hadn't already harbored suspicion,

364
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,469
those lies wouldn't have succeeded.

365
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:54,360
What does a traitor like you know

366
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,010
about loyalty between ruler and subject?

367
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:00,250
A mass petition will only be seen
as a challenge to imperial authority,

368
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,059
a faction pressuring the throne.

369
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,909
Do you think
His Majesty would feel more assured

370
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,250
or more threatened by that?

371
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,250
What do you think

372
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,320
we should do?

373
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,690
In my opinion, it would be better
to take the opposite approach.

374
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,580
Let the officials turn against Duke of Ding
and push him further into isolation.

375
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,210
When Duke of Ding appears to stand alone

376
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,400
without any support,

377
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,970
His Majesty's suspicion
will naturally ease.

378
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,530
Out of consideration
for their friendship,

379
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,930
the emperor would likely settle
for a small punishment.

380
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,930
In the interest
of political stability after that,

381
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,970
the emperor might even rely
on Duke of Ding more in the future.

382
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:40,210
But who can truly understand
the emperor's thoughts?

383
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:43,770
Isn't this approach too risky?

384
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,930
You live far away
from the imperial court.

385
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,400
But you sure know
how to read the situation

386
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,080
and understand people's minds.

387
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,080
How do you know so much
about Duke of Ding's case?

388
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,010
Who exactly are you,

389
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,360
and why are you living here in hiding?

390
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,130
Madam!

391
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,800
Sulan, put down your weapon.

392
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,210
Do not act rashly.

393
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,010
Lu Ming, tell the wet nurse to come in.

394
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,690
The hiccup isn't stopping.

395
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,530
Has it always been like this
since birth?

396
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,730
Cold and sweating excessively?

397
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,469
Suxin, warm up the goat milk
I usually prepare

398
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,539
and bring it over.

399
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,680
Yes.

400
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,120
You're an unmarried young lady,

401
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,050
and yet you know how to care for a baby?

402
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,320
I've cared for many babies in the manor.

403
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,880
Naturally, I know more
about this compared to men like you.

404
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,250
He's drinking now.

405
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,160
He was born prematurely so he's weak.

406
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,700
He can't digest breast milk that well.

407
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,280
So he needs to be fed with goat's milk.

408
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,160
My manor is the only one within a hundred li
that raises goats.

409
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,770
I'll deliver it
to Tan's Manor on time after this.

410
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,810
Sir...

411
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,930
Since everyone's hungry,

412
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,560
how about putting down the weapons

413
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,120
and we go and have a meal?

414
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,000
That's a great idea.

415
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,360
Move aside and let me do it.

416
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,019
Bring several plates over here.

417
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,160
All right.

418
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:15,629
Move it here.

419
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,210
All right, the food is here.

420
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,040
- Nice.
- That smells delicious.

421
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,200
They smell tasty.

422
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:25,400
Come and have a meal.

423
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,010
Please enjoy.

424
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,299
This is delicious.

425
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,880
Help yourselves with more food.

426
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,560
Now, you're already involved
in this mess.

427
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,730
If the Shadow Guards find out
that your manor is involved,

428
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,880
do you know it's a grave crime
for failing to report this?

429
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,640
Won't you regret it?

430
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,840
You have people
you're willing to risk your life for.

431
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,200
So do I.

432
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,320
If I don't take this risk,

433
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,260
I won't be able
to protect everyone in the manor.

434
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,210
Besides, Duke of Ding is someone
I respect deeply.

435
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,970
(I'm already poisoned,
and my time is running out.)

436
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,490
(What I regret is not being able
to clear Duke of Ding's name before I die.)

437
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,010
(Instead, I implicated you.)

438
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,360
I don't want to see
someone being pushed onto a path

439
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,160
they can't return from because of fate.

440
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,210
- Let's go.
- Move it. Hurry.

441
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,960
Sulan.

442
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,490
Tan Manor's master is here!

443
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:59,670
(Unclouded Mind)

444
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,120
I owe my current position to the help

445
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,800
of Duke of Ding in the past.

446
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,220
Please rest assured, Your Lordship.

447
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:08,010
I will protect his young son
with my life!

448
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,290
Your righteousness is admirable.

449
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,730
But today, things are different.

450
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,629
During the flood, Fourth Young Lady helped
with disaster relief and provided food,

451
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,880
offering kindness and aid.

452
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,259
If it weren't for her,

453
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,120
Tan's Manor wouldn't
have survived this crisis.

454
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,560
I, Tan, boldly ask for a favor.

455
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,050
We are willing
to stake our lives to vouch

456
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,540
that Fourth Young Lady is a person
of great righteousness and honor.

457
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,160
She would never leak
this secret to anyone!

458
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,909
Please spare her life, Your Lordship!

459
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:37,930
- Please spare her life, Your Lordship!
- Please spare her life, Your Lordship!

460
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,000
Fourth Young Lady,

461
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,290
your manor

462
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,600
is safe.

463
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:01,150
(Twilight in Spring)

464
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,189
This is called dog-tail grass.

465
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:05,539
See how it looks wagging back and forth

466
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,010
like a dog's tail?

467
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,640
Really?

468
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,690
So this is called dog-tail grass.

469
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:14,869
Oh,

470
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,669
why are you here?

471
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,080
Why aren't you going home?

472
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,909
Because I have no home.

473
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,539
Everyone has a home.

474
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,520
Why don't you?

475
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:30,010
Not everyone has a home.

476
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,250
(He seems like
a completely different person)

477
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,530
(from the one last night.)

478
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,210
I've heard of your exceptional talents,
Mr. Chen.

479
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,840
Would you consider becoming my advisor?

480
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,970
Mr. Chen may have followed
the wrong superior back then.

481
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,560
The decision to surrender
and abandon the city wasn't his.

482
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,690
He's been with me
for over ten years now.

483
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,909
He wouldn't act dishonorably.

484
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,050
What if

485
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,450
I insist?

486
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,250
(Does he want to take a hostage?)

487
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,530
(He's still wary about me.)

488
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,690
Zhao!

489
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,530
If you're still concerned,

490
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,010
how about letting General Yan stay
at the manor?

491
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,299
Once the situation calms down,
we can arrange an exchange.

492
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,819
Wouldn't that be better for you?

493
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,690
General Yan is one of my closest men.

494
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,290
How could he leave my side?

495
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:34,530
What if I insist too?

496
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,709
They've prepared some snacks for you

497
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:38,909
in the kitchen.

498
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,180
- Go and have some.
- All right.

499
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,160
Madam.

500
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,920
Your Lordship,

501
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,819
Young Lord just finished his goat's milk

502
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,400
- and has fallen asleep.
- Good.

503
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:15,050
Once we cross this river,
we'll reach Tan's Manor.

504
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,450
The Young Lord will soon
be safe and sound.

505
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,709
So, what did you find out?

506
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:28,579
Your Lordship,
we manage to find out something.

507
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,149
She's the legitimate eldest daughter
of the Dou family in the capital.

508
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,290
Her name is Dou Zhao.

509
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:33,260
Her grandmother comes
from the prestigious Cui Clan.

510
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,429
They say she's been ruthless
and scheming since childhood

511
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,570
for trying to seize her family's wealth.

512
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,650
That's why her family abandoned
her here at the manor.

513
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,290
Abandoned?

514
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,560
Didn't my father also cast me aside
and drive me away?

515
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,010
What good can come out

516
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,560
of a woman's household quarrels?

517
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:51,360
She's sharp, quick-witted,

518
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,730
and highly adaptable.

519
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,819
Her way of handling things

520
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,800
is nothing
like the average sheltered woman.

521
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:58,189
Also, the farmers in her manor

522
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,669
are actually trained warriors.

523
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,059
Even her two maids

524
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,290
are skilled in martial arts.

525
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:05,299
Her father works
in the Ministry of Revenue,

526
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,059
and her uncle, Dou Shishu, was promoted
to an official in the Ministry of Rites.

527
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:11,050
Last night's events weren't
as simple as they seemed.

528
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,690
His Majesty and Duke of Ding shared
a ruler,

529
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,360
which they split into two halves
and they each kept one.

530
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:23,530
It's a symbol of trust and duty
to advise that will never change.

531
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,490
Perhaps, the ruler's heart

532
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,360
has always been indifferent
to his subjects.

533
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,890
Your Lordship,

534
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,050
when Duke of Ding returns to the capital,

535
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,290
why not present the ruler
to His Majesty

536
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,050
as a gesture of humility?

537
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:42,360
Perhaps seeing the old relic

538
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,490
might soften the emperor's heart
and show Duke of Ding mercy.

539
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,560
She looked at me

540
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,890
in a strange way,

541
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,690
as if we had met before.

542
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,210
I can't see through her for now.

543
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:00,259
I've been away for too long
so I'm not up to date on court affairs.

544
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,149
We need to investigate
the Dou family thoroughly,

545
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:03,290
just to be safe.

546
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,850
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

547
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,440
Here.

548
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,429
You were calmed
when the sword was aimed at you.

549
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,949
Now that things have settled,

550
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,539
why worry and fear?

551
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,730
That calmness was just for show.

552
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,229
I heard he's skilled
in reading facial expressions.

553
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,690
His gaze can pierce
through someone's very bones.

554
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,059
Now that I think about it,

555
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,690
my heart still races with fear.

556
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,080
I never want to see those eyes again.

557
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:41,930
He's so ruthless.

558
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,600
Why did you help him?

559
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,010
You haven't seen him
at his most ruthless yet.

560
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,770
If Duke of Ding really died unjustly,

561
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,080
with his temperament,

562
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,490
he could do even more extreme things.

563
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,600
Then that would bring even
greater danger.

564
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,189
By the way,

565
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,080
did anything happen
with Grandmother last night?

566
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,530
Before going to bed,
Old Madam burned some benzoin

567
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:07,240
Since she fell into a deep sleep,
she shouldn't have noticed anything.

568
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,450
- That's a relief.
- Zhao!

569
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,920
Ansu?

570
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,800
- Zhao.
- Ansu.

571
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,579
Aren't you supposed
to go to Futing with Zhangru?

572
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,160
Ms. Longevity! Su!

573
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,339
Zhangru.

574
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,709
Go to the front hall. We have good news.

575
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,779
What good news?

576
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,920
Just follow me.

577
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,229
Congratulations, Old Madam Cui.

578
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,989
Mr. Ji has ranked third place
in the palace examination,

579
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:34,730
becoming the youngest first-class
metropolitan graduate.

580
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,579
That's the first one.

581
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,219
Secondly, Seventh Master Dou has learned

582
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:42,540
of Old Madam Cui's generous efforts
in disaster relief.

583
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,749
He has visited the local community

584
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,970
and secured a commendation for you
from the imperial court.

585
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,229
Usually,

586
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,730
we all benefit greatly
from your support.

587
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,709
We'll surely stop by
for the celebration tomorrow

588
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,450
to share in the joy!

589
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,729
All right.

590
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:59,259
Well, we'll take our leave for now.

591
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,640
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

592
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,220
You don't have to see us off, Old Madam.

593
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,550
- Come on out.
- Did you hear that?

594
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,080
As a family,

595
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,010
we should be open and honest.

596
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,520
Let's go.

597
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,730
- Grandmother.
- Grandmother.

598
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:20,120
Did you all hear that just now?

599
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,899
Originally,
Fourth Young Lady was worried

600
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,200
about your relationship
with Seventh Master Dou.

601
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,720
But it's all good now.

602
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,339
As long as there's an intention,

603
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,299
there's no grudge

604
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,450
that cannot be mended
between a mother and a son.

605
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,589
Father has shown
his sincerity this time.

606
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,410
Grandmother should be pleased now.

607
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,560
Small favors

608
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,410
don't matter to me

609
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,280
She may not admit it.

610
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,259
But this morning,
she made shepherd's purse dumplings

611
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,810
and sent them to Seventh Master Dou.

612
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,549
Why can't you be more tight-lipped?

613
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,410
Do you have to tell them everything?

614
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,109
Ah, it's my fault. I'm sorry.

615
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,419
But didn't Grandmother just say

616
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,749
that we should be open
and honest as a family?

617
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,709
That's right.

618
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,379
I've never seen you this happy.

619
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,560
Why don't you just admit it?

620
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,149
You little rascals.

621
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,600
Fine, I can't win against you.

622
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,120
(Dou's Residence)
The teacher has been praising

623
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,410
Ming's poetry lately.

624
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,810
Shiying, why not test her a little?

625
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,890
Ming learns the four arts

626
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:21,050
for her own joy and relaxation.

627
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,890
Testing her would only spoil the fun.

628
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,120
You're right about that.

629
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,250
My dear,

630
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,530
how about taking a break

631
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,330
and having some dessert?

632
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:36,109
Mother sent shepherd's purse dumplings
this afternoon.

633
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,530
I already had a few extra bowls.

634
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,330
I really can't eat any more right now.

635
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,370
Father,

636
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,339
Mother knows you've been busy
with work lately

637
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,480
and feeling a bit heated.

638
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,509
She spent the whole afternoon making
this Golden Osmanthus Taro Milk.

639
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,890
It's perfect for soothing
and boosting energy.

640
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,240
Serve a bowl for me.

641
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,760
A sweet treat

642
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:11,280
after a hearty meal is perfect.

643
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,859
So you like shepherd's purse dumplings.

644
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,370
I'll make them more often for you
from now on.

645
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,370
When I was little,
I often had indigestion.

646
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,589
Mother would make
these dumplings for me.

647
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,760
They always helped.

648
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:30,050
After Mother moved to the manor,

649
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,720
no one could make them

650
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,600
the same way.

651
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,029
In a few days,

652
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,850
the commendation
for Mother will come through.

653
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,490
It'll be the perfect time

654
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,709
to ask her to come
with me to the capital

655
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,150
so I can take care of her
and fulfill my duty as a son.

656
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,410
What do you think?

657
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,979
You've been running around tirelessly

658
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,280
for this commendation.

659
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,280
If you two can reconcile,

660
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,160
it would be a blessing
for the whole family.

661
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,050
To know you think that way
puts my mind at ease.

662
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,999
Master, Provincial Administration Commissioner,
Official Lu is here.

663
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,390
Please invite him to Tongwen Hall
and serve him some tea.

664
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,920
Yes, Master.

665
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,250
I'll excuse myself.

666
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,120
Master.

667
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,560
I'm fine.

668
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,290
Mother,

669
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,229
Father still cares about you.

670
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,339
He was clearly full

671
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,280
but he still drank
your Golden Osmanthus Taro Milk.

672
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,280
He wasn't caring about me.

673
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,530
He was clearly playing favorites.

674
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,200
When that old woman
really brings Dou Zhao back here,

675
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,200
do you think we can still speak up
in Dou's Residence?

676
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,310
(Cui's Residence)

677
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,240
Fifth Uncle took ten years
to pass the imperial exam.

678
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,979
But Ji's different.

679
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,280
He's young

680
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,050
and he ranked third on his first try!

681
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,749
If it were me, I'd throw a big banquet

682
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,600
and show off to all the relatives.

683
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,920
But him?

684
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,390
He doesn't even bother to come back.

685
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,890
He was never fond of celebrations.

686
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,680
He will only think
that they're boring and a waste of time.

687
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:12,050
Only you understand
his weird personality.

688
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,589
Still, making it to the top ranks
is a good thing, right?

689
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,819
But look at his letter.

690
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,150
It's all complaints and frustration.

691
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:19,259
The emperor asked him
about his ambitions in court.

692
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,459
He said he aimed to become
the Grand Secretary within ten years

693
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,149
and overhaul
the court's corrupt practices.

694
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,560
Bold aspirations indeed.

695
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,229
This isn't some theatrical play.

696
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,379
His ambition is too much.

697
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:30,149
The Emperor scolded him for being
too ambitious, chasing fame and power.

698
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,410
Overhauling the court

699
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,589
would make all the officials
in the court seem like a problem.

700
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,730
Who would tolerate him?

701
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,160
His Majesty didn't make him
the top scholar

702
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,970
or let him join Hanlin Academy.

703
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:42,160
Instead, he was sent
to oversee things in Futing.

704
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,970
With Ji Yong's pride,

705
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,520
he can't endure that long.

706
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,829
Forget it.

707
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:47,669
Someone like him cannot be brought

708
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,640
into the Zhao Family
as a matrilocal husband.

709
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,090
Or else I would never figure
him out in a lifetime.

710
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,629
Aren't you eating?

711
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,680
No. I want to reply to his letter first.

712
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:18,110
(Revere Heaven and Ancestral Wisdom)

713
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,330
Your Majesty,

714
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:22,069
it was because Duke of Ding
misused his power

715
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,259
and was indulgent

716
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,459
that Futing became full
of corrupt officials,

717
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,890
leading to flooding
and the suffering of the people.

718
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,080
I urge everyone to submit a petition

719
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,600
to impeach Duke of Ding tomorrow
for his abuse of power

720
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,770
and indulgence.

721
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,459
- Yes.
- Yes.

722
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,300
Surely you haven't forgotten, right?

723
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:42,200
(Liang Jifang, Minister of Revenue)
It was Duke of Ding's influence

724
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,979
that Futing's sea trade remained smooth
for a decade without incident.

725
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,519
(Wu Yifen)
Are you saying

726
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,419
(Grand Secretary of Grand Secretariat)
Are you saying

727
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,760
that it was Duke of Ding's work alone?

728
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,379
Here.

729
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,240
Your father
is the Minister of Personnel.

730
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,819
(Gu Yu, Earl of Yunyang)
Just tell your father to scold Duke of Ding

731
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,859
for being lazy and tyrannical
in governance.

732
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,000
All right.

733
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:59,280
Your father is the Vice Minister
of Revenue.

734
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,080
Let him say Duke of Ding neglects

735
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,189
his wife and family.

736
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,589
Lazy and tyrannical.

737
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,970
Neglects his wife and family.

738
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,749
You've mixed them up.

739
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:07,890
Your father...

740
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,680
Wait, mixing them up works too.

741
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,509
Duke of Ding's lazy
and tyrannical governance

742
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,109
should be punished.

743
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,339
He should be sent to a remote border

744
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,309
to avoid causing further trouble.

745
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:20,379
Duke of Ding commands the Ding Army.

746
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,819
Yet, he neglects his wife and family

747
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,899
and abuses others,

748
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,259
(Zhu Siyuan, the Emperor)
resulting in no heir.

749
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,410
That makes him unfilial as well.

750
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,530
I must disagree with you, minister.

751
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:31,450
It's a serious crime for the Ding Army
to embezzle military pay.

752
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,930
I ask Your Majesty
to punish him severely

753
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,560
to protect the nation.

754
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,160
I delivered your words exactly
as you instructed.

755
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,890
But I still don't understand.

756
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,490
Putting aside the impeachment.

757
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,330
The accusations from both sides

758
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,419
contradict each other.

759
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,560
That's the point.

760
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,509
When His Majesty sees
them making up baseless

761
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,459
and nonsensical charges,

762
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,459
he'll realize Uncle is a loyal official

763
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,600
with no faction.

764
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,010
His suspicion and distrust
will naturally fade away.

765
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,930
Contradicting each other.

766
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,280
Utterly nonsense.

767
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,600
Your Majesty.

768
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,099
When you think about it...

769
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,270
That's right.

770
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,200
Official Wu. Official Wu.

771
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,120
It wasn't intended for you.

772
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,709
When the emperor asks,

773
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,970
I can only speak honestly.

774
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,640
Honestly, huh?

775
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,029
As long as
it's for the court's stability,

776
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,550
it's all well and good.

777
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,490
But this concerns major matters
in the southeast.

778
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:53,450
Doesn't it seem unrelated
to the Ministry of Rites?

779
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,890
With the Dragon Boat Festival
approaching,

780
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:03,760
why don't you go home
and rest for a few days?

781
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,410
I shall comply

782
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,330
with your command.

783
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,029
Mr. Wu Shan is unconscious.

784
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,189
Fourth Young Lady ordered someone
to carry him to the back yard.

785
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,149
How dare you harm

786
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:47,229
Official Wu's only grandson?

787
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,229
Mr. Wu would be dead

788
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,709
by the time the physician arrived.

789
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:52,200
Dou Zhao, are you trying
to get the entire family killed?

790
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,859
Since you're skilled
in reading facial expressions,

791
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,370
you will know I'm not lying.

792
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,959
