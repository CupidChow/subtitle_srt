1
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,159
Your Grace.

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,230
Eunuch Wang, how is His Majesty?

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,920
Please come inside.

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,710
Meisun...

5
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,430
His Majesty is sinking fast.

6
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,590
What is this item doing here?

7
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,840
Official Ji must have left it

8
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,120
when he visited His Majesty.

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,500
I want to teach you
the 13 Acupuncture Spots of the Demons.

10
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,910
There's a point
on the tongue called Haiquan.

11
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,289
Administering a needle here
can have miraculous effects

12
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,609
on those on the brink of death

13
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,350
from a severe collapse.

14
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,990
Ji Yong

15
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:08,680
is always playing tricks

16
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,710
and never speaks clearly.

17
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,710
It turns out what he taught me
was meant for today.

18
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,400
So everything is part of his master plan

19
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,630
to root out traitors and restore order.

20
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,690
He was appointed as the Administrator
of Lord Qing's Residence

21
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,400
and appeared to have turned against us.

22
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,270
But it was actually
under His Majesty's orders.

23
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,840
When investigating the case in Futing,

24
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,480
His Majesty already knew

25
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,150
that the Duke of Ding's death

26
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,249
was Lord Qing's doing.

27
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,040
So, he can only

28
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,790
let Lord Qing commit treason

29
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,179
to lure all the hidden conspirators

30
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,539
to reveal themselves one by one

31
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,790
and be eradicated in one stroke.

32
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,840
Ji Yong deceived everyone,

33
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,350
even Song Mo and me.

34
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,040
However, the number
of court officials supporting Lord Qing

35
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,320
was greater
than His Majesty had anticipated.

36
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,120
Some princes even

37
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,329
openly sided with Lord Qing.

38
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,240
The one truly commanding

39
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,960
the entire scheme

40
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,350
was actually the one closest
to His Majesty,

41
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,110
leading us to today's dead end.

42
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,630
It might not be a dead end.

43
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,019
Eunuch Wang,

44
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,950
help me lift His Majesty.

45
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,799
=Blossom=
(Adapted from the novel "Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

46
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,060
=Episode 34=

47
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,510
Maintain the Yuanyang Formation!

48
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,670
Prepare to break through the siege!

49
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,950
They're at their limit.

50
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,190
Charge!

51
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,350
Leave none alive!

52
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,790
Kill them all!

53
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,260
(Qianqing Palace)

54
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,240
Here comes my reinforcement.

55
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,720
Your Highness.

56
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,200
You have been deceived by traitors

57
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,630
and raised an unjust rebellion.

58
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,510
I promise you this.

59
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,209
Lay down your weapons

60
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,000
and return to the right path,

61
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,030
and you will not be punished.

62
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,960
Otherwise,

63
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,270
the imperial forces will crush you.

64
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,200
Traitors

65
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,270
will never find peace!

66
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,710
Listen, Tengxiang Guards!

67
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,150
Your Commander, Song Han,

68
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,800
has deceived you

69
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,800
and dragged you into treason!

70
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,390
His Majesty has long set up

71
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,030
this trap for you.

72
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,600
You have

73
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,070
no chance of winning!

74
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,760
No one retreats!

75
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,910
Anyone who falls back

76
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,550
will be executed!

77
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,760
Father,

78
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,320
the Crown Prince has been assassinated.

79
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,360
According to protocol,

80
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,390
I should inherit the throne!

81
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,880
Brothers!

82
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,560
We've endured years of suffering

83
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,680
for this day!

84
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,040
Quell the rebels

85
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,950
and protect the nation!

86
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,849
It's now or never.

87
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,379
Quell the rebels and protect the nation!

88
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,699
There's no chance for us to retreat now.

89
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,769
Attack Qianqing Palace
and seize the imperial seal.

90
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,390
Once we succeed, glory and titles await!

91
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,550
Attack!

92
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,400
Meisun,

93
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,030
I won't fail you

94
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,710
this time.

95
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,270
Your Highness, bad news.

96
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,699
The Crown Prince
and the Earl of Yunyang's forces

97
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,169
are attacking from the southern gate.

98
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,329
Wang Xingyi and Official Ji

99
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,000
are also leading large forces here.

100
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,619
Father,

101
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,200
forgive me for my delayed rescue.

102
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,640
On your knees!

103
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,590
Please return to the palace,
Crown Prince!

104
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,590
Please return to the palace.

105
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,550
Dou Zhao wanted me
to give this to Your Highness.

106
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,720
It's urgent.

107
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,040
(The Empress plans to stage a coup
during the Lantern Festival banquet)

108
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,640
(while you're away to the South.)

109
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,000
(After reading this letter,)

110
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,649
(return to the palace immediately
to quell the rebellion)

111
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,990
(and ensure the safety of the nation.)

112
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:44,219
Your Majesty, I lead 40,000 troops
from the three major camps

113
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,360
to defend the throne.

114
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,710
Lord Qing,

115
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,640
your forces outside the capital

116
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,040
have been completely subdued.

117
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,590
Surrender yourself!

118
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,929
The Duke of Jing, Lord Jihuai,
and Lord Yu'an

119
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,560
have all confessed their crimes.

120
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,430
Your Highness,

121
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,750
the battle is lost.

122
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,320
Everyone, get up!

123
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,830
I said, get up!

124
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,360
Get up!

125
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,520
Get up!

126
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,280
I said, get up!

127
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,590
Ji Yong,

128
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,339
I treated you
with the respect of a mentor

129
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,750
and tolerated everything you did.

130
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,950
Why did you betray me?

131
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,870
I sought fame and power

132
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,049
to cleanse the corrupt court,
eliminate factions,

133
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,710
and save our dynasty from its ailments.

134
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,160
No matter how you treated me,

135
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,379
you were nothing

136
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,800
but the rot that needed
to be cut away first.

137
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,710
The injustice done to the Duke of Ding

138
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,990
and the suffering of the people

139
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,950
must be avenged.

140
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,160
Since when does vengeance have anything
to do with the people?

141
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,560
What a joke!

142
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,160
We did it.

143
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,830
Justice is something
we have to fight for.

144
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,879
(Revere Heaven and Ancestral Wisdom)

145
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,290
Let me go! I said, let me go!

146
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,520
Your Majesty, the Crown Prince has returned
to the palace safely.

147
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,049
Please spare my aunt

148
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,400
from the death penalty.

149
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,950
The Empress's situation

150
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:12,110
is a matter of state.

151
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,070
It's not up

152
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,950
to you

153
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,200
or me to decide.

154
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,750
Step back.

155
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,750
You fought your way into Qianqing Palace

156
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,870
for this?

157
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,520
I'll give it to you now.

158
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,040
Take it!

159
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,569
Even you know

160
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,710
your merits aren't enough
to bear the weight of the throne.

161
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:30,640
I can't do it,

162
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,520
but perhaps Mother can.

163
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,320
Once I ascend to the throne,

164
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,830
with her guiding the court,

165
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,110
we may surpass the greatest emperors.

166
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,870
You owe her this!

167
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,350
Your mother has suffered
for half her life.

168
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,339
I always remember that well.

169
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,259
That's why she is the Empress.

170
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,590
She is the Empress.

171
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,590
But she not only tended
to you day and night

172
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,280
but also drafted responses
on your behalf.

173
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,409
When you were gravely ill,

174
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,950
she ruined her eyesight
managing state affairs.

175
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,400
But have you ever considered
her your wife?

176
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,590
You feared her

177
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,590
just as you feared Jiang Meisun.

178
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,000
Youting,

179
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,619
do you know why you failed?

180
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,890
When luck is on your side,
everything works in your favor.

181
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,200
If it's not, even those with power

182
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,160
find themselves powerless.

183
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,350
In Father's heart,

184
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,169
the Duke of Ding and Her Majesty Wan

185
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,950
are worlds apart
in their contributions to the nation.

186
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,670
So,

187
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,320
is all of this...

188
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,950
Is all of this for Jiang Meisun?

189
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,649
Meisun emptied his wealth

190
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,010
for the people,

191
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,680
risked his life for the country,
and formed no allies or factions.

192
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,680
What did you and your mother do?

193
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,280
Who caused

194
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,950
my illness to worsen?

195
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,240
Before you punish me,

196
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,320
I have one question.

197
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,710
When did you

198
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,070
start planning this?

199
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,070
The ruler.

200
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,190
Investigate.

201
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,070
Who used torture?

202
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,680
Who harmed Meisun?

203
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,070
No one should be spared!

204
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,219
And the new era name.

205
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,400
(By the mandate of heaven,
the Emperor declares.)

206
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,680
An auspicious sign has descended.

207
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,400
The era's name changed to Fengming.

208
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,110
Fengming?

209
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,350
How about using this
as the new era name?

210
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,330
Honor past achievements
as guidance to the future.

211
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,090
Clarify doubts
about laws and regulations.

212
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,640
Uphold the legacy of our ancestors

213
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,090
and benefit the lives of the people.

214
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,159
With firm laws,

215
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,950
we restore peace
and fairness to the people.

216
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,859
I wonder if those old officials
in the Ministry of Rites will approve.

217
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,040
Who cares if they approve?

218
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,690
As long as we remember it,
that's enough.

219
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,470
Yes, as long as we remember it.

220
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,200
"Survey the land,

221
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,800
remove unnecessary officials,

222
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,590
curb war,

223
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,830
restrain the powerful,

224
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,870
the ambitions of the past."

225
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,350
Until his death,

226
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,920
I did not achieve these.

227
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,520
Before I die,

228
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,230
I must at least try.

229
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,049
But he was just an unrelated official.

230
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,390
Yet this unrelated official risked

231
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,230
his life to save the nation.

232
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,750
You, my own flesh and blood,

233
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,800
tried to kill me to seize the throne
and harm loyal subjects.

234
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,420
Do you think

235
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,799
people like Mu Chuan
and the Duke of Jing

236
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,640
truly value you

237
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,810
and support Her Majesty Wan
to become the ruler?

238
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,070
They only want to use you

239
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,200
to secure their own endless prosperity!

240
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,200
Those corrupt officials in court

241
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,529
are connected to one another

242
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,750
and even entangled

243
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:26,230
with the noble clans
and imperial relatives.

244
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,280
When I suppressed

245
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,950
the Futing docks case back then,

246
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,570
I already knew

247
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,350
you weren't the only guilty one.

248
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,200
I wanted
to make you all reveal yourselves

249
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,320
to uproot you in one go.

250
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,280
How ruthless you are.

251
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,680
You're willing
to ruin your wife and son,

252
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,279
and make your uncles and brothers,
meritorious officials for generations

253
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,680
give up their power and be punished.

254
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,449
You staged countless acts

255
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,860
of self-sacrifice for this grand scheme.

256
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,579
Your Majesty,

257
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,400
Lord Qing's treason is undeniable.

258
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,950
Should we summon the Shadow Guards?

259
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,169
Your Majesty,

260
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,080
I believe
I've done something worthy tonight

261
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,230
and boldly request Your Majesty

262
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,080
to issue two imperial decrees.

263
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,200
Do you want me

264
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,360
to execute him?

265
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,680
Those who dare to commit treason

266
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,360
have already dismissed life and death.

267
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,680
His true ambition lies
in power and dominance,

268
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,600
stepping over his father and his kin.

269
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,690
I request Your Majesty

270
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,360
to confine Lord Qing
to the Western Garden for life

271
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,859
and lock him in a three-foot room
without daylight.

272
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,440
Every day, inform him
of Your Majesty and the Crown Prince's

273
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,360
achievements.

274
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,000
No, not that!

275
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,059
Anything but that! Father.

276
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,059
Take him away.

277
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,200
Just kill me! Father!

278
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,880
- Take him away now!
- Please kill me!

279
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,040
Father!

280
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,600
Father, I beg you! Just kill me!

281
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,649
Father!

282
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,310
Father!

283
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:21,640
Even if Jiang Meisun is here,

284
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,920
he wouldn't dare to convict a prince
on my behalf.

285
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,510
You've got quite the nerve.

286
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,920
So what else do you want?

287
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,009
Song Mo!

288
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,160
What are you doing?

289
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,950
I request to renounce all titles
and military achievements.

290
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,240
I beg Your Majesty

291
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,120
to clear the Duke of Ding

292
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,990
and the Jiang Clan's name.

293
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,929
Of course, I will clear
the Duke of Ding's name.

294
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,070
But you...

295
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,379
What are you doing?

296
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,200
What I ask for isn't for myself

297
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,080
but for justice.

298
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,280
I've lived my life

299
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,990
for loyalty and filial piety.

300
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,950
Then for revenge.

301
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,510
It was not until I met Dou Zhao.

302
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,160
She made me realize

303
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,600
that the hunter must be patient

304
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,480
when he sees prey.

305
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:29,400
One must be open-minded

306
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,840
when he sees a mountain.

307
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,080
My time is running out.

308
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,920
I want to live for myself,

309
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,360
to see that wide horizon.

310
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,990
Little Song Mo,

311
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,590
take these.

312
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,160
Little Song Mo,

313
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,790
are you really leaving me?

314
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,100
(Peace and Prosperity)

315
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,480
Ansu.

316
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,250
Ansu,

317
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,280
I knew

318
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,270
you would stay by my side.

319
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,590
Ansu,

320
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:43,920
why did you wait

321
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,310
for me to fall in love with you

322
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,640
before betraying me?

323
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,750
Muyu,

324
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,270
I truly cherished you

325
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,600
once,

326
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,080
that boy who handed me a handkerchief

327
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,550
when I was in distress.

328
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:09,409
How condescending.

329
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,790
What's wrong with being a merchant?

330
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,030
Earning money with her own skills

331
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,420
is far better than being a lapdog
to the wealthy.

332
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,510
You understood my vulnerability

333
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,990
and knew my struggles.

334
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,400
Here, wipe your sweat.

335
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,969
This is the second time

336
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,440
you've given me a handkerchief.

337
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,200
That boy

338
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,790
who curled up alone,

339
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,030
gazed at the lonely moon

340
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,640
during the festive celebrations.

341
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,790
I once knew you

342
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:46,649
and admired you.

343
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:49,200
I'll ask His Majesty
to annul our engagement.

344
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,960

(Xuanyue Palace)

366
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,080
You've already guessed the whole thing

367
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,160
about the Silverhouse case.

368
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,160
Rather than guess,

369
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,360
I would say it was a gamble.

370
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,080
If I lost,

371
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,030
I'd just die a little faster.

372
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,440
If you get what you want and gain power,

373
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,270
you won't let me live long either.

374
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,790
Every time I see you,

375
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,950
I see myself before entering the palace.

376
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,310
No,

377
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,790
we're not the same.

378
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,400
I trust the person

379
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,160
I love in this life.

380
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,000
Your Majesty,

381
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,880
His Majesty summons you.

382
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,120
Given everything that's happened,

383
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,600
I feel disgusted just thinking
about seeing him.

384
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,440
His Majesty said,

385
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,310
if you can't face him,

386
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,200
you are to move to Qianxi

387
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,099
and never step foot

388
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,230
outside again.

389
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,680
He's not deposing me?

390
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,270
His Majesty is merciful.

391
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,160
But I don't want to continue
this charade any longer

392
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,550
or

393
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,640
this fake marriage.

394
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:11,400
In life or death,

395
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,310
I hope to never see him again.

396
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,969
Tell him

397
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,710
I willingly renounce my title as Empress

398
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,650
and request to be demoted to a commoner.

399
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,160
I ask for death.

400
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,480
Dou Zhao,

401
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,590

I don't want to see

(Revere Heaven and Ancestral Wisdom)

426
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,520
Your Majesty,

427
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,360
why did you give the only snow lingzhi

428
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,880
to Song Mo?

429
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,310
That is your life-saving lingzhi.

430
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:07,440
The snow lingzhi has indeed been extinct
for centuries.

431
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,400
Only the founding emperor

432
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,360
once gifted it to the Wanfo Temple.

433
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,360
I risked leaving the palace

434
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,920
for this.

435
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,859
While we have the snow lingzhi,

436
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,920
the poison of hatred is a human toxin.

437
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,209
Formulating an antidote requires
great care

438
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:26,030
and cannot be done overnight.

439
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,230
I am already at the end of my life.

440
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,230
I don't need it anymore.

441
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,840
I gave it to Yantang,

442
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,160
so he could protect Yousheng forever.

443
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,550
You're not young anymore.

444
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,400
Yet you still act like a child.

445
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,169
I can't even remember

446
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,640
the last time you cried.

447
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,270
That was more than fifty years ago.

448
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,310
Yes,

449
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,880
it was more than fifty years ago.

450
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,990
I want to walk alone for a while.

451
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,500
(Qianqing Palace)

452
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,300
(The way of heaven is not distant.)

453
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,310
(The admonition is not false.)

454
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,790
(The people's wrongdoings rest)

455
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,950
(with me alone.)

456
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,400
(Now I deeply regret my actions.)

457
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:50,030
(How can I allow slander to take root,)

458
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:54,440
(causing loyal ministers to be wronged
and the Jiang Clan unjustly exiled?)

459
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,470
(The divine retribution has come,
and I failed to awaken in time.)

460
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,640
(The people's resentment has risen,)

461
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,360
(yet I was blind to it.)

462
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,970
(The Emperor issued
a self-punishing edict)

463
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,400
(to clear the names
of the Duke of Ding and the Jiang Clan.)

464
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,440
(Lord Qing's supporters
were all executed for treason.)

465
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,779
(The following year,
the Crown Prince ascended the throne,)

466
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,110
(granting a general amnesty.)

467
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,730
(Ji Yong was promoted
to the Minister of Personnel.)

468
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,120
(He's the first Chief Grand Secretary
of the new dynasty.)

469
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,100
(Wu Shan is the Assistant Minister
of the Ministry of Works now.)

470
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,139
(The new dynasty implemented reforms,)

471
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,390
(emphasizing agriculture,
returning land to the people,)

472
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,990
(and rigorously scrutinizing
government officials.)

473
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,510
(The political and societal structure
has been transformed.)

474
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,700
(Tiancang Festival, Five Years Later)

475
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,180
(Abundance)

476
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,200
Fetch the beans.

477
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,720
Here you go.

478
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,840
Let me grab some.

479
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,750
A bountiful harvest!

480
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,550
Granaries overflowing with harvest.

481
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:20,920
It's hung quite high this time.

482
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,310
Yours is even higher!

483
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,040
Not bad.

484
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:35,030
Now that the world is settled,

485
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:38,920
and the court is reformed
with many challenges ahead,

486
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,230
why are you retiring?

487
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,539
Once, I believed
that ordinary physicians heal diseases

488
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,090
while great physicians heal the nation.

489
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,950
Becoming the Chief Grand Secretary
was my life's ambition.

490
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,710
Now that I've achieved it,

491
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,990
I find it rather boring.

492
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,270
A life of quiet cultivation
suits me better.

493
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,310
Letting go of obsessions

494
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,510
brings true freedom.

495
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,470
Now that your emotions
are fully engaged,

496
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:06,510
your thoughts are tied
to just one person.

497
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,990
All things are empty,

498
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:12,950
but cause and effect are real.

499
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,920
These worldly affairs
are like fleeting clouds.

500
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,360
I hope you can understand
the cause and effect in the world,

501
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,550
and your worries will disappear.

502
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,030
Father! Mother!

503
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,619
Wake up, Father! Play with me, Mother!

504
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,990
Your daughter is calling you.

505
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,840
Yesterday, she climbed trees
and went to catch some fish.

506
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,360
She's only slept a few hours.

507
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,440
Father! Mother!

508
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:02,059
Father. Mother.

509
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,729
Get up and play with me.

510
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:04,689
Father! Mother!

511
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,729
- Get up and play with me.
- All right, I'm up.

512
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,710
Father. Mother.

513
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,680
Go play in the courtyard for a while.

514
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,040
I'll be right there.

515
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,969
Father and Mother, hurry up.

516
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:19,859
Go on.

517
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,160
Don't run too fast.

518
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:25,960
Raising a child

519
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,710
is harder than doing business.

520
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,850
It's more exhausting
than fighting a battle.

521
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,710
We used to say

522
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,560
that once the world was at peace,

523
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,560
we would go and travel together.

524
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,390
But now,

525
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,299
one day,

526
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,609
the walls fall,

527
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,859
and the garden explodes next.

528
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,520
Year after year,
there's always something.

529
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:48,339
But Grandmother, she's been
to so many places these past years.

530
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,000
She'll be home soon.

531
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,150
This time,

532
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,560
we can definitely go.

533
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,179
How so?

534
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,129
Have you forgotten?

535
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,930
Lianjun is going to school soon.

536
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,400
How can I forget that?

537
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,960
Make the arrangements, then.

538
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,580
Let's go.

539
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,040
Mr. Feng comes from a scholarly family

540
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,270
and is ranked second in the palace exam.

541
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,739
How could a man from a poor family

542
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:14,310
be worthy of our Princess Anyu?

543
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:18,259
I came to evaluate the officials
of the Ministry of Revenue,

544
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,750
not to choose a husband.

545
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,430
You'll find one after some picking.

546
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,259
The eldest son of Taiyuan Bank,
Young Master Zhang.

547
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,259
Third Master Wan
of Dongting Chamber of Commerce.

548
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,969
They truly love you.

549
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,699
So what if they have wealth?

550
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,449
Together, those three can't compare
to Princess Anyu's wealth

551
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,870
that can't be kept track.

552
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,840
The son of Marquis Dongping, Lord Han.

553
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,530
A man of both literary
and martial skills.

554
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,520
This is a match worthy of the princess.

555
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,529
- Wealth still matters.
- Mr. Feng is the best.

556
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:49,529
Lord Han is the best.

557
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,710
Ladies,

558
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,659
where are you your manners

559
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,040
for bickering like this?

560
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,009
Gentlemen, as for this item in the drawing,

561
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,449
it can be used both as a staple food

562
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,630
and to make sugar, brew wine,
or grind flour.

563
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,440
It can be grown
in both the north and south.

564
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,699
Whoever can calculate

565
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,279
the cost and profit

566
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,040
of growing and selling it for one year,

567
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,560
I'll choose him.

568
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,270
They don't work with their hands
and have no knowledge of farming.

569
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,710
No wonder people say
scholars are useless.

570
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,160
You're even more useful by my side.

571
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,640
Dismiss them all.

572
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,449
Please don't.

573
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,200
You must choose a prince consort.

574
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,120
That's the Empress's order.

575
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,160
These wheat grains are really big.

576
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,179
No matter what Su brings back,

577
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,929
it can't beat me, a great cook.

578
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,350
Hurry up and remove the grains.

579
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,560
I want to stir-fry some.

580
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:52,680
Can lotus root and wheat

581
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:53,969
really go together?

582
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,899
Sometimes things
that don't seem to go together

583
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,830
end up having an unexpected flavor
when combined.

584
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,390
Don't you understand this principle?

585
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,150
Yes,

586
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,160
just like us.

587
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,200
What are you talking about?

588
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,960
Nothing.

589
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,000
Everything you say is right, my dear.

590
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,560
Stop flattering me.

591
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,790
Hurry up. Grandmother will be here soon.

592
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,129
You've been traveling

593
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,560
for a full three months.

594
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,899
It's unfilial of me

595
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,040
not to accompany you.

596
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:28,820
Next time you go on a trip,

597
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,390
I'll join you during my leave.
Is that all right?

598
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:33,969
My body

599
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,680
is still strong.

600
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,000
Madam Tuo takes good care of me.

601
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,710
So you don't have to worry.

602
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,020
You've been promoted

603
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,180
and are helping
His Majesty compile historical records.

604
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,719
How do you have any free time?

605
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,210
Filial piety is paramount.

606
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,290
There's always time to accompany you.

607
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,730
I just hope

608
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,980
you won't find me a nuisance.

609
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,100
I've heard recently

610
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,290
that quite a few court officials
have tried matchmaking for you.

611
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,140
But you turned them all down.

612
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,140
At my age,

613
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,250
can we leave this topic alone?

614
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,290
Lately,
I've been dreaming of Guqiu often.

615
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,410
The magnolia tree at the old house

616
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,180
finally bloomed this year.

617
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,120
I brewed some magnolia wine.

618
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,450
If she were still here,

619
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,620
she would have loved it.

620
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,589
Ms. Longevity and I made a deal

621
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:34,330
to keep the matchmaking a secret.

622
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:36,020
How did you find out?

623
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,340
Great Grandmother! Grandfather!

624
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,690
- My dear great-granddaughter.
- Sweetie.

625
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,199
Great Grandmother knows everything.

626
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,029
But you don't.

627
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,770
Great Grandmother has spies
in the household.

628
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:51,540
Let me carry her instead.

629
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,509
Old Madam,

630
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:55,690
didn't you buy gifts for Little Miss?

631
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,330
Ah, yes.

632
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,639
My dear great-granddaughter,

633
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,770
shall we go and take a look at them?

634
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,780
Mother, what spy?

635
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,600
I... I bought a lot of local produce.

636
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:12,109
This famous official is known
for his stern character

637
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,509
and frugal lifestyle.

638
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:18,679
The court granted him a carriage
for his convenience to go to court.

639
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,730
His son, however,
used it to go to school.

640
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:24,020
Yang Zhen stopped the carriage

641
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,429
and scolded his son
for using the court's carriage.

642
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,679
If he's too lazy to walk to school now,

643
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,270
how will he endure hardships
as an official?

644
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,380
Exactly.

645
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,020
Yes, indeed.

646
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,810
Reading thousands of books

647
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:44,799
is not as good
as traveling thousands of miles.

648
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,290
Serving as an official

649
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:48,080
is about seeking the welfare
of the people.

650
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,940
Jiang Shu,

651
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,819
when did Lianjun leave?

652
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,239
(Jiang Shu, son of Duke of Ding)
She slipped away

653
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,239
when you started talking

654
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,850
about reading thousands of books.

655
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,410
Just like her mother.

656
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,410
A place full of flowers,

657
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,820
cups brimming with wine,

658
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,890
and freedom in the waves of a vast lake.

659
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,250
The scenery, along the way,

660
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,690
is beautiful,

661
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,730
just as you wish.

662
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:32,939

666
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,980
Father-in-law's homemade brew.

667
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,609

671

Ms. Longevity,

672
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:59,089
how about we make another wish?

673
00:40:59,090 --> 00:40:59,979

It's not that great.

731
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,469
My mother already told me

the stories in her book.

00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:06,660

what you wrote in yours.

00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:09,770
That's not quite right.

00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,029
The stories in this book

736
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:12,850
might have happened once.

737
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:16,730
Maybe somewhere in this world,

738
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,660
someone extraordinary changed
the fate of those in the book.

739
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:23,020
They changed not only the people
who were in the book

740
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,500
but also those who were never mentioned.

741
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:26,980
On that land,

742
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:29,359
so many lives were touched

743
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,140
and had their fate changed,

744
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,549
That's why

745
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:36,660
the stories in this book
aren't the same.

746
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,679
I don't get it.

747
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,429
I think you're a swindler.

748
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,319
I'm leaving now.

749
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,949
Don't ever lie to children again.

750
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:44,980
I'll tell my mother if you do.

751
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,029
Wait, little girl.

752
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:49,500
If you don't like that book,

753
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,989
other than "Blossom,"

754
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:56,140
("Blossom" Series)
I have the sequels of "Blossom."

755
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,199
Every sequel has a different ending.

756
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,180
Aren't you curious
about the ending of other sequels?
