1
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,300
I just want to break free
from this cage,

2
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:13,060
to live without going against my heart.

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,940
Is that too much to ask?

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,740
You see your grandfather

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,019
as a cage?

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,358
Can't you see

7
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,358
how I shield you from hardship
every day?

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,019
Do you think tinkering
with those things every day

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,900
will make everything go your way?

10
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:37,900
You're naive to the point
of foolishness.

11
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:41,860
All under heaven is the emperor's land.

12
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,979
When fame and fortune turn to emptiness,

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,500
a true cage will await you.

14
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:23,679
Sir,

15
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,179
Physician Li has arrived.

16
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:38,940
Please invite Physician Li
to see the young master.

17
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,259
Yes.

18
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:46,580
Send the physician away.

19
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,598
I won't see him.

20
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,639
The physician told us

21
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,759
to present this item

22
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,780
if the young master refuses to see him.

23
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,819

(Adapted from the novel "Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

24
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,040
=Episode 9=

25
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:28,459
Today, we part ways, Mr. Chen.

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,878
If there has been any neglect
or offense,

27
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,619
please forgive us.

28
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,219
You are too kind, Lord Song.

29
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,300
I am merely a commoner in coarse robes.

30
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,519
I have troubled you for so long
at your residence.

31
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,380
I feel deeply ashamed.

32
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,100
Though I don't favor your character,

33
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,100
I must admit you are a rare talent.

34
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,059
Why lower yourself to serve
a girl from a rural manor?

35
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,878
I am a sinner, tainted and disgraced.

36
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,219
Now, in my old age,

37
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,598
the Fourth Young Lady
for not abandoning me,

38
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,019
taking me as her aide,

39
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,239
and allowing me to live out
my days in peace.

40
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,540
For that, I am content.

41
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,660
Your loyalty to the Fourth Young Lady

42
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,059
only piques my curiosity about her.

43
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,340
Thankfully, the chill
hasn't reached the lungs.

44
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:36,739
From now on, take two doses
in the morning and evening.

45
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,679
Young master, you must
take your medicine.

46
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,600
My lady risked danger to come here.

47
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,538
Do not disappoint her.

48
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:43,420
Mind your words.

49
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,719
I thought I made myself clear last time,

50
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,499
young master.

51
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,780
All worldly matters pale
in comparison to life itself.

52
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,379
Why trouble yourself, young master?

53
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,719
I didn't mean to use my illness

54
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,020
to coerce you.

55
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,619
It's just that your question last time

56
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,300
struck a chord with me.

57
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:17,059
I understand how you feel.

58
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,838
But, Mr. Wu,

59
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:21,220
did your grandfather consult you

60
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,900
when he assigned you
to the Ministry of Rites?

61
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,059
Even you have no control
over your own fate.

62
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,900
Why think about protecting someone else?

63
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,660
I have always respected my grandfather.

64
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,100
He was never wrong about anything.

65
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,259
But when it comes to marriage,

66
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:44,139
I cannot base it solely
on right or wrong

67
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,819
and ignore my own wishes.

68
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,220
If I weren't born into this
prestigious family,

69
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:58,139
and instead became a humble carpenter,

70
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,780
would I be freer?

71
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,660
Though men and women are different,

72
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,499
when it comes to marriage,

73
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,420
you and I face similar struggles.

74
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,300
You liken yourself to this wooden bird,

75
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,739
I understand.

76
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,540
But have you ever considered

77
00:06:19,662 --> 00:06:21,780
that in the Grand Secretariat,
people come and go,

78
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,078
yet your grandfather
struggles tirelessly

79
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:25,660
to maintain order in the court.

80
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,980
Regardless of whether you marry,

81
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,980
he needs your support.

82
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,198
Had you excelled in your career

83
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,100
and restored power to the Wu family,

84
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,260
he would have no reason
to pressure you to marry.

85
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,059
You can earn your freedom,

86
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,259
no matter what family you're born into.

87
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,780
I've been too narrow-minded,

88
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,780
trapped in my own dead-end thinking.

89
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,819
Opposing my grandfather

90
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,540
will only hurt us both.

91
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,540
If I can gain the Emperor's favor

92
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,780
and restore the Wu family's power,

93
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,100
then I will have the right
to choose for myself.

94
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,059
Humans are not lifeless objects.

95
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,619
Even if trapped in a cage,

96
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,259
we must nurture our strength

97
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,780
so that we may fend for ourselves.

98
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,499
Dawn is breaking.

99
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,340
I must take my leave.

100
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,379
Lord Song,

101
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,300
my lady specifically sent me
to fetch Mr. Chen.

102
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,140
She didn't come herself?

103
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,900
Did something urgent come up?

104
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,438
I am only following orders,

105
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,679
I know nothing else.

106
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,939
Please understand.

107
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,819
Our young lord has always
been accommodating,

108
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,059
but sending a maid
instead of coming herself

109
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,780
seems a little disrespectful.

110
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:12,980
Lu Ming,

111
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,860
send the gift back

112
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,420
to Fourth Young Lady as well.

113
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,278
Yes.

114
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,318
Farewell.

115
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,259
Wait.

116
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,619
Physician Li.

117
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,638
The Fourth Young Lady disguised herself
as Physician Li.

118
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,878
I've captured Su Lan.

119
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,459
She's in the carriage right now.

120
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,840
(Report)

121
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,758
Physician Li, thank you
for your hard work.

122
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,158
You may leave for now.

123
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,699
Thank you, my lord.

124
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,179
Lu Ming.

125
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,300
Yes.

126
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,819
Go invite the Fourth Young Lady here.

127
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,500
Yes.

128
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,740
Fourth Young Lady.

129
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,500
Can we meet for a fifth time?

130
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,540
Even if you don't change your mind,

131
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,900
I'd be happy

132
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,140
just to see you again.

133
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,140
If you could live happily and freely,

134
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,260
wouldn't that be better than seeing me?

135
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,420
Take care.

136
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:57,939
Old Master Wu.

137
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:00,020
After you, Physician.

138
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,819
Wait.

139
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,579
Grandfather.

140
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:12,740
She's the imperial physician
Song Mo invited.

141
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,020
Imperial physician?

142
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,420
Would you mind turning around
and let me take a look?

143
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,660
Physician Li.

144
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,780
Old Master Wu.

145
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,398
Lord Song and Physician Li

146
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,119
have arranged to meet at Guanghe Tower.

147
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,099
He sent me to invite Physician Li.

148
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,540
Since that's the case,

149
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,459
I won't hold you up any longer.

150
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,020
You're finally willing to see
a physician.

151
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,660
I'm guessing

152
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,620
her surname is Dou?

153
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:18,059
Now that you've seen her,

154
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,620
be sure to rest well.

155
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,300
Grandfather.

156
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:29,260
I was wrong.

157
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,059
Since my early education,

158
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,620
everything in my life
has been decided by you.

159
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,099
What books to read, whom to befriend,

160
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,859
which teachers to study under,

161
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,219
and where to serve as an official.

162
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,699
Even what I eat for breakfast
is arranged by you.

163
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:55,780
Sometimes, I truly envy Dou Zhao,

164
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,900
and also Song Mo,

165
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:03,020
for their freedom
and lack of constraints.

166
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,900
Grandfather,

167
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,380
I know the court is treacherous

168
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,740
and unpredictable.

169
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,540
Our entire family relies solely
on your strength.

170
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,380
I will strive diligently

171
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:34,620
to weather these challenges with you.

172
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,859
Under Dou Shishu's order,

173
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:56,979
the Ding Army has been fully disarmed.

174
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:59,278
The army is accused
of harboring rebellious intent

175
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,380
and has been sent back
to their hometowns.

176
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,900
The Fourth Young Lady
kept you occupied here,

177
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:07,939
and even tied up Physician Li.

178
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:23,500
The court has acted against
the Ding Army.

179
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,740
It's Fifth Uncle.

180
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,839
Previously, I took great risks
to save Song Mo,

181
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,660
and through our interactions,
his hostility had all but disappeared.

182
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:33,339
But in the end, it was all in vain.

183
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,380
My lord,

184
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:41,620
the Fourth Young Lady's carriage
will arrive shortly.

185
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:44,740
Good.

186
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,620
Convey my regards to her.

187
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,020
Yes.

188
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,020
Fourth Young Lady, there's an issue.

189
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,420
Openly do one thing while secretly
planning something else.

190
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,260
Very clever, Fourth Young Lady.

191
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:17,939
On behalf of Lord Song,

192
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,380
may I request

193
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,500
an explanation?

194
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,059
There's nothing to explain.

195
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,579
My lord says,

196
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,918
since the pact is broken,

197
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:59,459
we will not return Chen Qushui.

198
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:00,620
Next time we meet,

199
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:03,179
you'll be considered an enemy.

200
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:16,579
My lady, why didn't you
explain yourself?

201
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,158
It was all Master Dou Shishu's doing,

202
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,620
and has nothing to do with you.

203
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,780
If he trusts me,

204
00:15:24,412 --> 00:15:25,740
there's no need to explain.

205
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,339
If he doesn't trust me,

206
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,380
an explanation is useless.

207
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,579
Better to remain silent.

208
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,140
Miss, don't blame yourself.

209
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,420
The imperial will is not something
we can defy anyway.

210
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,036
My lord,

211
00:15:42,037 --> 00:15:43,537
are you letting it go just like that?

212
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,540
The truth of the matter

213
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,140
is still uncertain.

214
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:50,339
If her intention was to first
show kindness and then scheme,

215
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,179
why would she console Dezhen?

216
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:56,500
Let's wait and see.

217
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,599
My lord, despite all your precautions,

218
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,099
your emotions are still vulnerable.

219
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,620
The Fourth Young Lady is unpredictable,

220
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,179
and you are soft-hearted.

221
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,079
Why not just marry her
and keep her at home?

222
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,939
That way, you'd be safe.

223
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,158
Are you itching for a beating?

224
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,199
Want a taste of the rod?

225
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,059
I...

226
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,099
There you are.

227
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:21,420
The Shadow Guards have found
the travel records.

228
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,219
As expected,

229
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,219
one person slipped through.

230
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:40,260
Owing 300 taels
and still daring to cheat?

231
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,059
Addicted.

232
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,420
And bold as well.

233
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,540
I told you,

234
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:49,199
someone will settle my debt.

235
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,900
Do you think I'm a fool?

236
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,059
If you kill him, you'll get nothing.

237
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,500
Our young master has questions.

238
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,979
Please clear the place for us.

239
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:05,940
There's the person
who will settle my debt.

240
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,780
You used to be a junior officer
in the Shadow Guard.

241
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,339
Given your former rank,

242
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,379
your annual stipend
was no more than ten taels.

243
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:18,180
In just a few days, you've incurred
a debt of 300 taels.

244
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,740
No wonder you were dismissed.

245
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,300
Compared to the information you seek,

246
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,300
300-tael debt is insignificant.

247
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:32,059
Cheat the house,

248
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,700
and you lose your finger.

249
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:35,300
Cheat me,

250
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,220
and you lose your life.

251
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,659
Of course.

252
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,379
Surely, you've looked
into my background.

253
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,490
According to the records
of the Pacification Bureau,

254
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,379
there were eight Shadow Guards assigned
to escort southward.

255
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,639
I traced the waterways
outlined in the travel records

256
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,099
in order to identify
these eight individuals.

257
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,339
But the travel record shows

258
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,619
that there was a ninth person.

259
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,540
And you

260
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,700
are that ninth person.

261
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,719
(Zhaowen Bookstore)

262
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,700
Ansu,

263
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,740
why did you come here so suddenly?

264
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:15,339
(Urgent letter to Dou Zhao)
Mr. Ji sent a letter from Futing.

265
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,118
Officials from the Maritime Trade Bureau
detained our ship and imprisoned my family.

266
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,740
Fifth Master sent word to the manor,

267
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,419
ordering you to sever ties
with my family

268
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,460
and end all business dealings.

269
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:30,118
But on that ship,

270
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:32,038
there were only eight
Shadow Guard corpses.

271
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:33,879
I remember every single face

272
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,659
among them.

273
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,139
Except for you, Chen Jia.

274
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,379
You weren't on that ship.

275
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:50,540
Your memory is truly eidetic,

276
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,959
just as everyone says.

277
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,099
Enough chatter. Tell us the truth!

278
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,679
Chen Zuxun, the commander responsible
for escorting the Duke of Ding,

279
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,899
was my adoptive father.

280
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,300
My name was not listed
in the official roster.

281
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,460
He wanted me to redeem myself
through merit and took me along.

282
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,980
That night, as we traveled
through the Cangzhou Canal,

283
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,899
we docked to rest briefly.

284
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,659
A group of people boarded the ship.

285
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,460
I was at the stern getting fresh air

286
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,980
when I suddenly heard a clash
in the cabin.

287
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,020
They wielded the swords
of Dongyu bandits,

288
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,500
but their technique was different
from Dongyu bandits.

289
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,099
Their skills were extraordinary,

290
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,180
even the Shadow Guards
couldn't match them.

291
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,859
They even killed my adoptive father.

292
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,980
I was no match for them.

293
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,220
I escaped by jumping into the water
during the chaos.

294
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:57,419
Who were those people?

295
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,540
If you want to know more,

296
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,460
a thousand taels may not be enough.

297
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:11,139
You clearly don't know,

298
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:14,260
yet you dare bargain with me.

299
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,700
Ring finger or little finger?

300
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:19,940
I'm a gambler by nature.

301
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:23,419
I've endured enough cold stares
and debts.

302
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,679
The only one who ever treated me
as human, my adoptive father,

303
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,819
died a wrongful death.

304
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,659
Whether it's my fingers or my life,

305
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,379
take whatever you want.

306
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:44,859
A dog salivates at the sound
of a bowl being struck.

307
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,819
A gambler relapses at the sound
of dice shaking.

308
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,679
With your skills, you could've built
a decent future.

309
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,190
That's probably why your adoptive father
never gave up on you.

310
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:55,819
It's a pity he made such a poor choice.

311
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:58,180
You have no right to talk
about him like that.

312
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,700
A child's debt to his parents
is immeasurable.

313
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,118
The people who killed him

314
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:06,339
are the same people who killed my uncle.

315
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,700
Instead of seeking vengeance
or repaying his kindness,

316
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,598
you squander your days gambling

317
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:11,980
and live without purpose?

318
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,139
I saw through the lies a long time ago.

319
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,300
Whether a junior officer

320
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,500
or a commander,

321
00:21:26,839 --> 00:21:29,659
the Shadow Guards are merely tools
at others' disposal,

322
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,300
ants to be crushed at will.

323
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:35,980
As for revenge,

324
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:39,780
I will never achieve it
even if I risk my life.

325
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:43,099
I don't know who those people were,

326
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,710
but the leader wore
crimson official robes,

327
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,586
so he must be at least
a fifth-rank official.

328
00:21:47,587 --> 00:21:50,399
Even my adoptive father allowed him
to pass and addressed him as "sir."

329
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,199
He must be a high-ranking
court official.

330
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,558
Why did the Shadow Guards
torture my uncle?

331
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:56,640
Secret orders.

332
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,598
The instructions were to force
the Duke of Ding

333
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:00,159
to confess to raising a private army.

334
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,460
Whose secret orders?

335
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,020
My adoptive father never disclosed it.

336
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:13,619
My lord.

337
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:17,379
I didn't have the courage before.

338
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,300
But after meeting you today,

339
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,020
and hearing your words,

340
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,518
I no longer wish

341
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:26,220
to live disgracefully.

342
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:30,020
I want revenge.

343
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,659
I want to live with dignity and purpose.

344
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,919
Please grant me this chance.

345
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,558
I am willing to stake my life.

346
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:40,260
How can I trust the words
of a cheating gambler?

347
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:50,659
Ask the Earl of Yunyang to help

348
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,740
reinstate him into the
Northern Pacification Bureau.

349
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:54,118
Yes.

350
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,899
From now on, you are one of my men.

351
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,300
Keep your finger.

352
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,419
You're going to need it to fight for me.

353
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,619
Zhao, don't worry.

354
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,479
The Maritime Trade Bureau
has always been

355
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,159
all bark but no bite.

356
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,819
They just want a little bribe.

357
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,619
I'll go to Futing to handle it.

358
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,879
After all, this concerns your principal

359
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,819
and profits.

360
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,139
I'll go with you.

361
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,980
What about Mr. Chen?

362
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,220
Knowing Song Mo,

363
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,579
he won't simply harm Mr. Chen.

364
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:31,758
No.

365
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:33,540
Fifth Master has already sent a message.

366
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,750
If the Maritime Trade Bureau
were only seeking bribes,

367
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:38,059
Fifth Uncle wouldn't have known about it.

368
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,780
Since he knows,

369
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,260
that means it must involve
court politics.

370
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,270
I have to go.

371
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,119
Futing hasn't yet recovered
from the disaster.

372
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,262
The troops are frustrated,

373
00:23:47,262 --> 00:23:49,310
even the Ministry of Imperial
Ceremony is involved.

374
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,099
It's clearly in a perilous situation.

375
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,260
That's all the more reason
you shouldn't go, Zhao.

376
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,619
No matter what happens,

377
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,619
I will ensure your principal
is returned.

378
00:23:58,119 --> 00:23:59,700
What nonsense are you talking about?

379
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,980
I don't care about money.

380
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,579
I care about your family
and our business.

381
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,399
We can't let them

382
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,220
manipulate us like this.

383
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,619
I'll go.

384
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,020
At least I can try to negotiate
a way out.

385
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,560
(Duke of Ying's Residence)

386
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,819
Song Mo.

387
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,300
Mother.

388
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,260
Why are you out here?

389
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,659
General Yan said

390
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,260
you were going to Futing to retrieve
old family belongings.

391
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,020
It may fool your father,

392
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,419
but not me.

393
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,159
Is it about your uncle?

394
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,619
Did you find any clues?

395
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,300
This involves someone
with high rank and authority.

396
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,819
I must leave immediately.

397
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,379
If I'm late,

398
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,139
I fear all evidence and clues
will be lost.

399
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,339
You're just like me,

400
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,460
once you've made up your mind,
no one can stop you.

401
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,780
The Emperor has put Wang Yuan
in charge of this matter.

402
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:06,439
When you go,
no matter what you uncover,

403
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,659
do not oppose Eunuch Wang directly.

404
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,020
General Yan,

405
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,540
I leave this to you.

406
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,659
Please don't worry, Madam.

407
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,619
Mother,

408
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,419
rest assured.

409
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:19,980
Stay safe.

410
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,260
Don't push yourself too hard.

411
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:27,540
I've already lost my brother.

412
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,859
I can't lose you too.

413
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,619
Here, take this cloak.

414
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,360
♪The army halts at your command♪

415
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,579

♪The golden fiery steed

I'll be back.

425
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,899
What's wrong with Zhao?

426
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,619
She's been like this
since meeting Lord Song.

427
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:48,118
She's probably worried

428
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:49,659
because Mr. Chen hasn't returned.

429
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,798
Zhao,

430
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:53,919
why don't you eat something?

431
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,220
You haven't eaten all day.

432
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:58,819
I'm not hungry. You all eat first.

433
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,220
I wonder how the manor is doing.

434
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,819
Will there be any trouble?

435
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,758
The Fourth Young Lady's pulse
is strong and steady.

436
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:21,598
It seems there's nothing wrong.

437
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,078
How could there be nothing wrong?

438
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:25,180
Dou Zhao is covered in blisters
and itching terribly.

439
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,339
Are you a quack?

440
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,180
Why don't you check again?

441
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,740
Wait.

442
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:37,318
Her pulse is fluctuating.

443
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:38,859
Peculiar...

444
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,020
Very peculiar indeed!

445
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,719
By the way, Fourth Young Lady,

446
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,159
could I take a look

447
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,518
at your blisters?

448
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:46,118
Take a look?

449
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:47,639
She's an unmarried young lady.

450
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,159
How audacious of you.

451
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,479
Get out.

452
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:49,919
No, I...

453
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,919
Go prescribe medicine.

454
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,139
Easy...

455
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,339
Grandmother.

456
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,639
How is Dou Zhao doing?

457
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,740
Let me see her.

458
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,959
Please don't.

459
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,318
Dou Zhao has chickenpox.

460
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,639
If you catch it,

461
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,598
we'll all be worried.

462
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:02,679
The doctor has already gone
to prescribe medicine.

463
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,479
She should recover in ten days or so.

464
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,038
Medicine alone won't help.

465
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:08,619
This disease is terribly painful
to endure.

466
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:10,220
Let me take a look at her.

467
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:11,278
Grandmother...

468
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:11,879
Wait,

469
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,220
don't come in.

470
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,139
You haven't fully recovered yourself.

471
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,059
If you catch chickenpox from me,

472
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,940
I'll feel even more guilty.

473
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:20,479
See?

474
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,358
That's why I said,

475
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:22,639
since I've had chickenpox before,

476
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,518
let me take care of her.

477
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:27,159
You should go back and rest.

478
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,959
Don't worry,

479
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,719
I promise to return Dou Zhao to you,
healthy and plump in a few days.

480
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,679
- Are you sure?
- Go.

481
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,579
You too, go.

482
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,619
Don't worry. I've got this.

483
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:39,220
Oh, heavens, gods of fortune,
and Guan Yu,

484
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,500
please bless Dou Zhao and Ansu
with a safe return.

485
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,278
Fifth Master has been promoted
to Right Censor-in-Chief,

486
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:48,260
and Mr. Wang has joined the Secretariat.

487
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,540
We'll be interacting with them often
from now on.

488
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,798
Our lives

489
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:53,879
will only improve
with Madam Wang's help.

490
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,099
We just need to sit back and watch

491
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,940
the money we entrusted to her grow.

492
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,659
I win!

493
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:05,139
Seventh Madam.

494
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,339
Excuse me for a moment.

495
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:13,899
Whose turn is it to draw a tile?

496
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,300
Seventh Madam.

497
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:17,959
Someone saw Fourth Young Lady

498
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,220
and Miss Miao leaving the city gate

499
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,940
and heading south.

500
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,460
Understood. You may leave.

501
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,339
Yes.

502
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,659
They're probably heading to Futing.

503
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,758
The Miao family's merchant ships

504
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:37,339
were detained in Futing
by the Maritime Trade Bureau.

505
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,859
Of course they're anxious,
their source of income has been cut off.

506
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,150
A young lady leaving the household
without permission,

507
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:45,139
isn't that a disgrace to the family?

508
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:46,959
She's practically handing us

509
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,659
leverage against her.

510
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:51,020
Let's bring her back
and hold her accountable.

511
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,300
No need to rush.

512
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,619
If we capture her now,

513
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,260
her punishment would be

514
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:00,059
a few days of kneeling at most.

515
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:02,659
Then Dou Shiying will pity her again.

516
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,220
That girl likes to stir up trouble,
doesn't she?

517
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,700
Futing is now like a tiger's den.

518
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,980
Let's see how capable she really is.

519
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,840
(Futing)

520
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,339
Spare us some food, please...

521
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:34,300
We'll trade tea for rice.

522
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:36,139
Eight measures of tea
for one measure of rice.

523
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,698
No shoving. Here, take it.

524
00:30:37,699 --> 00:30:38,498
Step back, everyone.

525
00:30:38,499 --> 00:30:39,259
No shoving, please.

526
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,119
There's enough.

527
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,838
Here.

528
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,038
No shoving.

529
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:43,358
There's enough for everyone.

530
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,159
Here.

531
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,339
No shoving.

532
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,540
No shoving.

533
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,479
How did Futing become like this?

534
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,379
The people can't even get a proper meal.

535
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:02,139
In recent years, the maritime trade
boomed, and tea trading was profitable.

536
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:04,500
Everyone switched
from growing rice to tea.

537
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,220
After the Duke of Ding's death,
the maritime trade ceased.

538
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,500
Now, they can't sell the tea at all.

539
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,819
Exactly.

540
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,020
And the government does nothing?

541
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,200
Who would dare intervene?

542
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:18,998
Anyone who does is accused of colluding
with the Miao family merchants.

543
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:20,518
Several major tea firms invested

544
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:21,740
in the Miao family's ships.

545
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:22,959
Now the ships are detained,

546
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,959
the money is gone,

547
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,780
and the goods are still
being held on board.

548
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,399
It's all my father's fault
for being greedy and ignoring advice.

549
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,530
He even got the townsfolk
to invest in shipbuilding,

550
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,900
and now so many people are harmed.

551
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,899
Mr. Miao didn't intend
to deceive anyone.

552
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,180
It's not fair to call it harm.

553
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,780
Halting trade and detaining ships

554
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:41,859
is what truly cuts off
people's livelihoods.

555
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,700
Once we enter the city,

556
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,260
we should meet with Ji Yong first.

557
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,318
He knows the situation
in Futing's bureaucracy

558
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:49,999
and the Maritime Trade Bureau's motives

559
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,579
better than we do.

560
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,419
Su Lan,

561
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,679
go buy some dry rations.

562
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,859
We still have a journey ahead.

563
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:56,700
Got it.

564
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:03,940
Stop!

565
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:05,139
Stop right there!

566
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:10,500
No. Keep moving.

567
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:13,980
Let's go.

568
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,339
Are you Miss Miao?

569
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:24,579
Supervisor Ding Wei of the
Maritime Trade Bureau summons you.

570
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,419
And you,

571
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,220
you must be Dou Zhao.

572
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,460
Take them away.

573
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,659
Ji Yong.

574
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,880
(Futing County Office)

575
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,980
Untie them.

576
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,139
The Miao family colluded with pirates,

577
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,740
the evidence is irrefutable.

578
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,300
If you sign, you're admitting guilt.

579
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:33,020
If you don't sign, the punishment
will be even worse.

580
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,260
Impossible.

581
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,540
My father would never commit treason.

582
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:40,220
The Miao family runs maritime trade.

583
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,220
The pirates plunder our seas
and kill our people.

584
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:43,339
We despise them.

585
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:45,139
Why would we collude with them?

586
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,518
During the previous maritime ban,

587
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,139
how many unruly merchants
colluded with pirates?

588
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,999
Your father must have taken bribes
from some pirates

589
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,740
to engage in such a heinous act.

590
00:33:58,739 --> 00:33:59,518
Are you suggesting

591
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,990
the Miao family colluded with pirates
to kill the Duke of Ding?

592
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,999
Murdering a pillar of our nation
is a grave crime,

593
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,379
how can you simply accuse us?

594
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,339
Besides, Eunuch Wang Yuan is in Futing.

595
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,739
How will you explain yourself if this
leads to a miscarriage of justice?

596
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:16,060
Insolence!

597
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:18,979
You know this is a serious crime,
yet you're still so defiant.

598
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:20,939
Bring in the evidence.

599
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:24,859
Take a good look.

600
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:26,558
These pirate swords were found aboard

601
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:27,979
your family's merchant ship.

602
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,419
They're identical to the one
that killed the Duke of Ding.

603
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:35,339
This is irrefutable proof
of your murderous crime.

604
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,819
Impossible.

605
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,419
I personally kept
the merchant ship's logs.

606
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:42,238
For this journey, we carried only tea,
fruits, silks, and porcelain.

607
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,518
There were absolutely no weapons.

608
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:44,598
The escort, Xue Ping,

609
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:45,799
the goods inspector, Li Gui,

610
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,038
and the Maritime Trade Bureau clerk,
Liu Limu,

611
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:49,100
can all testify.

612
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,939
Lord Ding, may I ask you,

613
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:53,078
where are the witnesses?

614
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:54,238
Yes, where are they?

615
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,319
Where's the testimony?

616
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,660
Where are the witnesses?

617
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,118
Bring them out!

618
00:34:58,119 --> 00:34:59,399
We can't wrong the innocent!

619
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,499
Silence!

620
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:01,919
It's not your place to tell me

621
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,379
how to conduct my investigation.

622
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:05,539
You want witnesses?

623
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:07,819
Aren't you witnesses yourselves?

624
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,300
Guards, take them to the county jail.

625
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,040
Interrogate me if you must,
but don't touch her.

626
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:17,070
She is the granddaughter
of the Cui family of Ji'an

627
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,919
and the eldest daughter
of the Dou family.

628
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,220
How dare you lay hands on her?

629
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,660
Your family's affairs are my affairs.

630
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:25,100
I was sent by my family to resolve
this misunderstanding.

631
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:27,340
The rest of my family
will arrive shortly.

632
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,220
Do you still intend
to fabricate charges?

633
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:32,260
The relatives of high officials?

634
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:35,740
Perhaps I'll uncover evidence
of factionalism and corruption too.

635
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,319
That would earn me even more merit.

636
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,339
Take them away!

637
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,560
(Prison)

638
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:55,899
Stop.

639
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,899
Why isn't the questioning conducted
in the public court,

640
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:06,499
before the eyes of the citizens?

641
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,539
Are you aware this is an abuse of power?

642
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,539
Using torture to extract a confession
is a serious crime.

643
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,700
Fourth Young Lady Dou,
you're a clever person.

644
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,539
All I need is a confession in writing.

645
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,539
If you admit to the
Miao family's crimes,

646
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,580
you'll be released immediately.

647
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:27,060
The Miao family has done nothing wrong.

648
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:29,100
What is there to confess?

649
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:33,339
Then you leave me no choice

650
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,620
but to say you had your chance.

651
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,859
I interrogated

652
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,539
Miao Ansu.

653
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,379
I pulled out all ten of her fingernails.

654
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,859
Take a good look.

655
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,060
She confessed everything.

656
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:10,700
Sisterly bonds?

657
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,220
If you don't confess,

658
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,118
you'll be the one

659
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:16,220
who bears all the blame.

660
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:20,339
Why are you laughing?

661
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,620
I'm laughing at your stupidity.

662
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,419
Before accusing someone, shouldn't you
do your research first?

663
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,459
Even if someone were to betray me,

664
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,180
Miao Ansu would be the last person
to do so.

665
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:38,379
Lord Ding, all you're missing
is a witness.

666
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,140
Without it, you can't close the case.

667
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:43,999
So you're trying to muddle through

668
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,740
by finding a scapegoat.

669
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:49,180
Very well.

670
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,319
It seems you won't confess

671
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,118
without torture.

672
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:55,859
Let's see if you dare.

673
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,979
He doesn't dare to.

674
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,660
But I do.

675
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:09,220
Song Mo!

676
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,180
Lord Song.

677
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,499
Fourth Young Lady.

678
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,620
We meet again.

679
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,859
Lord Ding, finger torture

680
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:23,060
is child's play.

681
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,060
What can you uncover with it?

682
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,078
Your reputation for interrogation
precedes you, Lord Song.

683
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:35,060
No one in the world can rival you.

684
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,780
So tell me,

685
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,740
what method should I use?

686
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,740
Acid, when it touches an open wound,

687
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,180
is excruciatingly painful.

688
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,060
Song Mo is no longer in the military.

689
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,518
Why show him courtesy?

690
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:44,118
He may no longer hold a position,

691
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:46,558
but he's still the Duke of Ying's son.

692
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:48,118
Since the day he was born,

693
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,620
I've had to show him respect.

694
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:50,979
Yes.

695
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:52,740
He is enemies with the Dou family,

696
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,859
so letting him settle this matter

697
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,379
might actually be better.

698
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,660
True.

699
00:39:58,559 --> 00:39:59,859
My uncle's death...

700
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:01,580
Your deception...

701
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,140
Today,

702
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:05,979
we'll settle the score.

703
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,140
The Miao family and I were able

704
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,220
to run a profitable business

705
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,780
because the Duke of Ding
kept the pirates at bay.

706
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,859
Why would I harm him?

707
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,780
You may think so,

708
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,780
but your uncle, Dou Shishu,

709
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,439
had ambitions beyond his reach.

710
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,620
By killing my uncle,

711
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,078
he could throw the court into chaos

712
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:31,379
and seize the opportunity
to rise to power.

713
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:33,580
Power

714
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,718
leads to wealth.

715
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:36,859
I told you,

716
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,499
don't lump me together
with my fifth uncle.

717
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,359
You befriended me

718
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,220
in order to leak information
to your uncle,

719
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,919
causing the Ding Army to be disarmed.

720
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,899
Shouldn't I doubt you?

721
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:02,220
Lord Song grew up on the battlefield.

722
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,459
He is truly a savage.

723
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,158
Even toward a helpless girl,

724
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:08,979
he showed no mercy.

725
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:14,899
This medicinal powder from the military

726
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,140
will help your hand heal.

727
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,700
At least make some noise.

728
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:30,859
Be serious, they are listening.

729
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:32,319
Scold me.

730
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,100
Scold you?

731
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,140
Yes, scold me.

732
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:38,539
Are you a snake?

733
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:40,140
You only know how to bite, don't you?

734
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,100
It's my uncle who's scheming.

735
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:43,780
Why don't you interrogate him?

736
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,499
Why do you only pick on me?

737
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:49,419
Can't you see he's trying
to cover himself?

738
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:50,779
I can see that.

739
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,759
But do you have evidence?

740
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,799
Take me to the ship.

741
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,060
I'll find the evidence.

742
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,740
So twisted.

743
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,979
I like it.

744
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,180
There's one more thing.

745
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,939
Sixteen years ago,
before the maritime trade opened,

746
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:21,660
Futing merchants were struggling
to make a profit.

747
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,060
You were just a young girl in Zhending.

748
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,700
Why did you decide to invest
a huge sum in Futing?

749
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,019
If it wasn't premeditated,

750
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:33,019
how could you have known my uncle
would eliminate the pirates

751
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,718
and earn massive profits?

752
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,379
It was Mr. Chen's suggestion.

753
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:38,979
The Duke of Ding was courageous.

754
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:40,419
He was bound to succeed.

755
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,459
Miao Ansu defended you,

756
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,879
saying that at the start of the year,

757
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,959
you had already said
maritime trade was peaking

758
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,439
and the Futing business
had to be withdrawn quickly.

759
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,459
It seemed

760
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,539
you knew my uncle would die.

761
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,839
I can see it.

762
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,620
You're hiding something from me.

763
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,060
Why won't you tell me?

764
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:06,419
Speak.

765
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:27,939
The emperor is cold and unkind,
repaying loyalty with betrayal.

766
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:30,339
Loyal ministers and brave generals
die in vain.

767
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,499
So why can't the traitor

768
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:35,459
