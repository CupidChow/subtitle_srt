00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:12,970
Zhao,

2
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,820
I'm glad

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,420
that you're home safe and sound.

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,320
(Picturesque Scenery)

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,650
You truly have a way with things.

6
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,060
As the Matron of the household,

7
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,130
of course, I'll take care

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,810
of the eldest daughter's marriage.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,380
I'll be sure to repay this favor.

10
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,410
Ms. Longevity!

11
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,170
- Zhangru.
- You're finally home.

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,579
It was her...

13
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,639
All right, Zhangru.

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,190
Let's go and check on Grandmother first.

15
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,810
I've prepared some herbal packs
for Grandmother's usual ailments.

16
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,479
When I'm not here,

17
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,690
just brew them as needed.

18
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,340
All right.

19
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,330
The weather is cold.

20
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,140
Make sure Grandmother's blankets
are extra warm.

21
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,740
Also, burning mugwort is good
for improving circulation too.

22
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,509
Do it regularly during the day.

23
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,020
I'll do that.

24
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,779
By the way, Seventh Uncle brought

25
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,059
a special herbal tonic from the town.

26
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,280
It's said to be excellent for migraines.

27
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,800
Father is thoughtful.

28
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,579
Grandmother.

29
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,720
Grandmother!

30
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,880
Grandmother, you're awake.

31
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,520
Ms. Longevity?

32
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,080
I'm back.

33
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,160
I'm glad that you're home.

34
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,059
I'm so sorry

35
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,600
for making you worry.

36
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,200
Thankfully, it's not serious.

37
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,640
Otherwise, I'd never forgive myself.

38
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,280
Here, slowly.

39
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,600
Don't blame yourself.

40
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,659
That scheming woman
exaggerated everything,

41
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,160
knowing I'd get flustered.

42
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,619
I was muddled by my migraine

43
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,520
and worried something
might happened to you in Futing.

44
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,800
That wretched Wang Yingxue

45
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,499
secretly signed the marriage contract

46
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,080
while Zhao was away in Futing.

47
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,200
Is it with the Wei Family?

48
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,000
Those scoundrels.

49
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,709
I'll go find those two defiant sons
to break off the engagement.

50
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,900
Grandmother,

51
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,320
I've grown up now.

52
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,259
Let me handle

53
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,240
this matter myself.

54
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,720
I'll head to the Capital tomorrow
and settle it.

55
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,280
You just got back,
and now you're leaving again?

56
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,240
Since it can't be avoided,

57
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,440
I'd rather face it head-on.

58
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,120
I can not only solve this
returning to the Capital,

59
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,219
but also

60
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,089
broaden my mind

61
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,930
just as you've always wanted for me.

62
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,240
It'll widen my view there.

63
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,520
Ms. Longevity,

64
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,000
it's my failing health

65
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,160
that I failed to protect you.

66
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,160
Grandmother, don't say that.

67
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,840
Like you've taught me,

68
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,640
we can't always live
under the other's protection.

69
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,520
This time,

70
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,920
let me protect you.

71
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,339
With your wit,

72
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,480
I'm sure you'll handle
everything well in the Capital.

73
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,920
But remember,

74
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,280
be cautious and know your limit.

75
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,440
Old Madam,

76
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,960
look.

77
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,789
Grandmother,

78
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,419
remember when Ms. Longevity and I tried

79
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,059
to make lotus root dumplings

80
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,200
for you when we were kids?

81
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,960
The moment you two put them into a pot,

82
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,640
the fillings fell apart.

83
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,419
This time,

84
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,440
we made them for you again.

85
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,160
Please have a taste.

86
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,339
How's the taste?

87
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,480
Try it.

88
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,920
Give one to me.

89
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,900
They didn't break apart
this time, right?

90
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,640
Is it good?

91
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,320
Yes, it is.

92
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,640
Fourth Young Lady,

93
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,280
these are clothes preferred
by the Capital's noble ladies.

94
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,760
Fifth Master insists
you change into them.

95
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,560
I'll take my leave.

96
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,289
He just doesn't want you
showing up in plain clothes

97
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,240
and embarrassing him in the Capital.

98
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,140
Your birthday is coming up.

99
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,610
In previous years,
we've always listened

100
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,260
to "Plum Blossoms at Ge Creek" together.

101
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,560
But it seems we won't get
to celebrate together this year.

102
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,280
Why is there music?

103
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,000
Maybe it's a passing musician playing

104
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,720
for their own pleasure.

105
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,520
Let this tune

106
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,080
be our celebration for my birthday.

107
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,720
This song reminds us not
to waste our youth.

108
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,680
You've said

109
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,800
that you've been confined here
the whole life.

110
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,200
You never get
to see the great world outside.

111
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,480
Once I've taken care of things
in the Capital,

112
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,800
we'll make the wish come true.

113
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,760
We'll row a boat, pick flowers, and travel
across the rivers and mountains together.

114
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,680
Take me too.

115
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,480
You cannot leave me out.

116
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,739
Here.

117
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,339
Grandmother, Zhangru.

118
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,600
Promise

119
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,090
to wait for my return.

120
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,540
- Promise.
- I will.

124
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,720
Aren't you going to show yourself?

125
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,600
A man broke into the courtyard
on a quiet night.

126
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,600
Why aren't you afraid?

127
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,520
I wasn't afraid
because I knew it was you.

128
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,240
Thank you for the song you played

129
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,960
and the protection you provided
along the way.

130
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,400
I only intended to stay hidden,

131
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,280
not disturb you.

132
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,000
It's rare for you to listen to me.

133
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,440
So it was quite unexpected.

134
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,100
It is also rare to meet a woman

135
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,130
who understands the situation
as clearly as you do.

136
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,400
You're the most insightful woman

137
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,120
I've ever met.

138
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,400
I'm not as insightful as you think.

139
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,760
The troubles at home weigh on me.

140
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,480
Yet I lack the courage to deal
with them decisively.

141
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,219
At best, I'm someone

142
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,280
who can help others but not myself.

143
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,600
That's why

144
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,360
I've decided to learn
from your decisiveness

145
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,000
and return to the Capital
to handle my family affairs.

146
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,090
Instead of being controlled by others,

147
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,440
I should take the initiative.

148
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,539
Good.

149
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,720
Then I wish you success
in overcoming all obstacles.

150
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,080
Thank you.

151
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,000
Surely

152
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,419
you didn't come all this way

153
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,640
just to flatter me?

154
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,400
I came to say goodbye.

155
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,360
I'm leaving for Liaodong tonight

156
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,960
and won't return for some time.

157
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,520
Before I set out,

158
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,960

I believe they can.

so many unfamiliar servants around?

184
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,019
There's been a lot of work these days,

185
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,160
so they hired new servants.

00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,539
It seems the Duke
has assigned him a task.

188
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,780
I haven't seen him for a while.

189
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,989
Put these away.

190
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,400
- Put it away.
- Yes.

191
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,400
Madam is seriously ill,
so she has no appetite.

192
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,699
Why bring these greasy foods
that make her vomit blood?

193
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,019
Are you trying to get her killed?

194
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,960
I was only assigned
to Madam's room today.

195
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,960
I didn't know her dietary restrictions.

196
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,480
How is she doing now?

197
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,659
Madam doesn't like
the new bitter medicine.

198
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,600
The kitchen is preparing
her favorite preserved fruits right now.

199
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,379
This girl willingly admits her mistakes
and returns to the Capital.

200
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,379
I'm sure she has many schemes lined up.

201
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,040
Madam, you must be careful.

202
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,219
Why didn't you inform me

203
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,280
that you were coming back?

204
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,040
Then we could've been better prepared.

205
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,680
I thought you and your mother
had planned this in advance.

206
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,360
The wedding is approaching.

207
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,580
So I need to come back to prepare.

208
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,259
It was you

209
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,000
who found me such a good match,
after all.

210
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,419
This is also Fifth Uncle's wish.

211
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,739
We're family, to begin with.

212
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,259
You should have come back long ago.

213
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,790
I'm glad you've come to terms with it.

214
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,160
That's right.

215
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,379
After all, we are family.

216
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,800
You've been living away from home
for so long.

217
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,560
It might take you some time to adjust.

218
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,019
She'll get used to it.

219
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,160
It doesn't matter.

220
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,739
Don't just stand around.

221
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,920
Hurry inside the house.

222
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,379
- Gao Sheng.
- Yes, Master.

223
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,939
Tell them to get ready for dinner.

224
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,080
Yes, Master.

225
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,680
Move the things inside.

226
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,080
You're kind and gentle.

227
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,579
If you see me

228
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,520
as a burden,

229
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,080
then I truly have no way out.

230
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,619
Now that you're back,

231
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,960
you'll follow the rules
of this household.

232
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,400
You need to hold in
the wild behavior you developed

233
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,280
while living on the manor.

234
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,680
I was mischievous before.

235
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,600
But now I've realized my mistakes.

236
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,200
From now on, I'll follow your teachings
while I'm in the Capital.

237
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,640
In that case,

238
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,120
you can start by copying scriptures.

239
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,040
Wang Yingxue is truely a wicked woman.

240
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,680
You're just back.

241
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,419
But you have to
copy scriptures every day.

242
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,859
And you have to copy it ten times.

243
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,939
Our life was so carefree
at the manor in Zhending.

244
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,600
Why come to the Capital to suffer?

245
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,579
Fourth Young Lady
doesn't even say a word.

246
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,160
Yet, you're complaining non-stop.

247
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,659
Since you love staying at the manor,

248
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,099
I'll send you back to the manor

249
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,870
to serve Old Madam.

250
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,899
Please don't send me back.

251
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,360
I'll just stop complaining.

252
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,010
Who is it?

253
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:42,069
Fourth Young Lady, Manager Zhao from
the calligraphy shop asked me to deliver

254
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,840
some new Xuan paper
and an inkstone for you.

255
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,920
He also said

256
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,440
some matters
among the items require your attention.

257
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,699
(The Duchess of Ying is seriously ill.)

258
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,899
(The servants were changed.)
This is from Mr. Chen.

259
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,790
(The heir's close attendants
have gone missing.)

260
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,880
(Most of the servants have served
the family for generations.)

261
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,200
(Why would they suddenly replace
so many of them)

262
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,360
(while the Matron of the house is ill? )

263
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,360
(Song Mo, Star of Doom)
(A strike cuts through the heaven.)

264
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,600
(Discarded after the purpose is served.)

265
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,320
(Blood is spilled
and what remains is resentment.)

266
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,640
(Injustice and hatred fester within
and are hard to erase.)

267
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,640
(Song Mo will kill his father
and brother this year.)

268
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,400
(The upheaval in the Duke of Ying's
Residence is unusual.)

269
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,480
(Could there be another hidden reason
behind his drastic change)

270
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,840
(other than Duke of Ding's injustice?)

271
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,320
(I must have Mr. Chen
look deeper into this.)

272
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,280
Who's there?

273
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,360
Zhao, it's me.

274
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,840
This is steamed bass

275
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,040
and here's the ham
and fresh bamboo shoot soup.

276
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,880
I saw you had a second helping
at the family dinner.

277
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,440
So I thought you might like it.

278
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,240
I made these myself.

279
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,240
The soup is delicious.

280
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,280
Let's eat together.

281
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,250
Your mother punishes me
with scriptures copying, grounds me,

282
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,600
and does not allow visitors.

283
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,000
Aren't you afraid of being punished
for coming here?

284
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:48,760
It's my fault for being incompetent
and making her upset about everything.

285
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,440
That's why she's keeping
a close eye on you

286
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,390
and worried Father might be partial
toward you.

287
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,080
I've copied
some of the "Lessons for Women" for you.

288
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,560
I also brought some books,

289
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,459
(Annotated Collection of Du Fu's Poems)
stories, and plays

290
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,120
for you to pass the time.

291
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,800
You're new to the Capital.

292
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,099
I know where

293
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,139
all the most popular rouge shops,
fabric stores,

294
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,280
and calligraphy shops are.

295
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,619
We can even rent a boat

296
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,339
to tour the lake

297
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,160
and listen to music while we're at it.

298
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,840
That's something from before I was born.

299
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,960
But I've heard the elders mention it.

300
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,840
How could I know all of that?

301
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,459
After you're no longer grounded,

302
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,120
I'll go with you.

303
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,880
Do you not like touring the lake
and listening to music?

304
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,560
It's not like that.

305
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,520
It's just you're so different

306
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,160
from how you used to be.

307
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,400
How I used to be?

308
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,840
Someone's coming.

309
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,920
Hurry.

310
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,240
Let's stop copying for today.

311
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,800
I'm tired and need to rest.

312
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,760
He left.

313
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,200
He already left.

314
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,440
Then I'll take my leave first.

315
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,480
I won't disturb you anymore.

316
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,189
It's strange.

317
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,360
How did they know
you have to copy scriptures?

318
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,320
This one's from Ming.

319
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,539
It looks like she thinks
the same as the rest.

320
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,680
She is quite thoughtful.

321
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,200
Ming's small script is neat.

322
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,120
Wang Yingxue
will definitely recognize it.

323
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,240
We shouldn't implicate her.

324
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,120
But I appreciate her help.

325
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,000
This one is Mr. Wu's writing.

326
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,309
Can we use this?

327
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,720
(Lessons for Women)

328
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,259
(Fulfill one's duties
in family and society.)

329
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,219
His handwriting is delicate and proper.

330
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,600
The reverse strokes are elegant.

331
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,800
But it looks like a man's handwriting,
doesn't it?

332
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,469
You can tell.

333
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,579
But Wang Yingxue probably won't notice.

334
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,280
Who would check so carefully?

335
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,459
Why is Mr. Ji's handwriting

336
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,759
all crooked?

337
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,459
(Lessons for Women)

338
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,459
(Fulfill one's duties
in family and society.)

339
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,160
Jianming knows I hide
the sharp edge when I write.

340
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,329
I've been writing letters

341
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,520
with my left hand
instead of the right one.

342
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,670
He can almost imitate
my handwriting now.

343
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,880
Does it mean we can use this?

344
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,659
There's also one from Lord Song.

345
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,440
It's crooked, too.

346
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,800
(I owe my wisdom to my mother
and female mentors.)

347
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,509
Wait, he wrote this wrongly.

348
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,379
Look at the "Spring and Autumn Annals."

349
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,360
The "Autumn" character
is missing a stroke.

350
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,560
(Autumn)

351
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,979
Young Lady,

352
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,280
is there something wrong?

353
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,960
This is almost exactly the same
as when I write with my left hand.

354
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,520
I leave out that little stroke
in the "Autumn" character

355
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,640
to avoid using my late mother's name.

356
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,440
(Autumn)
He really knows how to read people.

357
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,360
So, do you think we can use both?

358
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,259
There's no conclusion
after all this deliberation.

359
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,920
In my opinion, both should be kept.

360
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,960
(Perpetual Bloom)

361
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,520
(Liaodong)

362
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,040
The Jiang Clan is brave and admirable.

363
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,200
I've always respected them.

364
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,940
But the imperial decree
has just been issued.

365
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,619
If we give them special treatment now,
we might attract criticism.

366
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,139
(Zhu Youting, Lord Qing)

367
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,680
What do you think, Mr. Ji?

368
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,189
Lord Song is a brave and capable man.

369
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,600
Your Highness values talent.

370
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,320
If Your Lordship could help
His Highness,

371
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,800
it would be a win for both sides,

372
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,280
don't you think?

373
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,440
Lizhen has been causing trouble.

374
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,160
His Highness
has been busy preparing for war.

375
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,440
Lord Song,
with his reputation as a young general,

376
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,080
must be excellent in training.

377
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,379
People of Lizhen grew up on horseback.

378
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,400
So it will undoubtedly
be cavalry battles.

379
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,719
They're not like

380
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,360
these lifeless stationary targets.

381
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,720
Distance is twenty zhang.

382
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,600
Impressive.

383
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,189
The sky is filled
with auspicious clouds,

384
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,360
which is a good omen.

385
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,320
It seems the stars are watching over us,

386
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,680
ensuring the border's safety.

387
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,200
Your great reputation

388
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,680
is truly well-deserved.

389
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,219
Shi Chuan.

390
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:11,139
Yes, Your Highness.

391
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,280
Send someone to repair
the Jiang Clan's houses.

392
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,899
Take a doctor with you.

393
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,040
Yes, Your Highness.

394
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,320
Yantang, why not stay here

395
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,760
to help train the army for me?

396
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,760
It will also be easier
to take care of the Jiang Clan.

397
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,040
I can ask Father for permission.

398
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,520
Thank you for your kindness,
Your Highness.

399
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,760
But I just received an urgent report
from the Capital

400
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,339
that my mother's condition has worsened.

401
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,480
I'm afraid...

402
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,640
Report!

403
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,419
Your Highness,

404
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,499
Lizhen has attacked again.

405
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,899
The forces are ten times stronger
than usual.

406
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,040
This isn't just a raid this time.

407
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,579
Issue orders to all the divisions
to assemble the troops

408
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,840
and prepare for battle.

409
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,679
Send the military reports
to the court immediately.

410
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,539
Yes, Your Highness.

411
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,680
I'm on my way back to the Capital.

412
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,160
I'll take care of the official report.

413
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,400
I just hope we can have a proper talk

414
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,640
when this is all over.

415
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,680
I supposed
Your Lordship has owed me a favor.

416
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,400
Official Ji, you used me
to flatter His Highness.

417
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,520
Who's owing who here?

418
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,560
I don't think
it's twenty zhang as you said.

419
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,739
Young Lady,

420
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,280
things are critical
at Duke of Ying's Residence.

421
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,880
How can you still focus
on copying scriptures?

422
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,240
Rushing won't help.

423
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,480
What we need most
is a calm and steady mind.

424
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,699
Manager Zhao has sent word

425
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,980
that Lord Song left the palace
after sending the official report.

426
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,960
But...

427
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,280
what if Manager Zhao can't stop him?

428
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,200
(If Zhao Liangbi can't stop Song Mo,)

429
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,840
(we'll have no choice but to go all in.)

430
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,800
Pull!

431
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,560
Your Lordship, please wait!

432
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,699
Are you Fourth Young Lady's man?

433
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,019
That's right. She told me
to stop you no matter what.

434
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,259
She also said things won't end well

435
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,040
if Your Lordship returns home now.

436
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,800
My mother is critically ill at home.

437
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,099
As a son,

438
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,019
I must return.

439
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,869
Move aside.

440
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,020
Your Lordship!

441
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,560
Express my thanks to her.

442
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,520
Your Lordship!

443
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:49,560
(Funeral. Duke of Ying's Residence)

444
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,899
Young Master,

445
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,800
you've finally come home.

446
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,440
Madam passed away the night before

447
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,379
and we've just finished setting up
the mourning hall.

448
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,520
Young...

449
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,040
Mo,

450
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,440
you've finally returned.

451
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,219
(Virtuous Wife,
Madam Jiang's Memorial Tablet)

452
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,440
Before Mother passed,

453
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,480
she refused to take the medicine
I gave her

454
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,040
and kept calling your name.

455
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,240
It's my fault.

456
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,840
I came back late.

457
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,360
(Mother,)

458
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,680
(I have returned.)

459
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,200
(I'm a bad son.)

460
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,080
I failed as your son.

461
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,280
Young Master,

462
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,760
the Duke has been heartbroken
these past few days

463
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,320
and is desperate to see you.

464
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,760
Mother,

465
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,480
I will be right back.

466
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:37,080
(Virtuous Wife,
Madam Jiang's Memorial Tablet)

467
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,520
Duke of Ying.

468
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,040
Father.

469
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,960
Every time I see this comb,

470
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,360
it feels like Huisun is still here.

471
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,200
She's just off to admire the flowers

472
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,760
and will return soon.

473
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,939
Father,

474
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,080
I've failed as a son.

475
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,600
I failed to be with Mother
in her final moments.

476
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:28,320
Take a look at this.

477
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,440
Do you recognize it?

478
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,480
Yes, I do.

479
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,680
This is the mutton fat jade
Grandfather had before he passed.

480
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,320
One for me,

481
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,080
and the other one for Han.

482
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,280
I haven't carry it with me,

483
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,120
so it's been long since I last saw it.

484
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,640
I'm glad you recognize it.

485
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,400
This jade piece

486
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,640
was found on Meirui.

487
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,160
Meirui?

488
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,080
The shoulder width
is one and a half feet.

489
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,480
The maid who served my mother?

490
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,760
How did she get it?

491
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,160
How did she get it?

492
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,640
Why don't you ask her yourself?

493
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,760
Someone, carry her inside.

494
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,920
How did this happen?

495
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,760
Young Master, just admit it.

496
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,320
People have seen you sneaking
around with Meirui.

497
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,040
This jade

498
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,720
must have been your token of love.

499
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,960
Father,

500
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,400
I didn't do it.

501
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,939
After Madam's death,

502
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,720
that girl took her own life.

503
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,360
We thought
it was out of loyalty at first.

504
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,160
But the physician said

505
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,800
she was three months pregnant.

506
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,160
When she died, she was clutching

507
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,480
this very jade.

508
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,920
Three months ago,
you returned to the Capital.

509
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,320
You disappeared every day.

510
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,040
I thought

511
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,920
you were busy handling
your uncle's affairs.

512
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:19,160
I never imagined
you'd do something disgraceful as this!

513
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,259
Father,

514
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,179
I didn't do it.

515
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,640
Lu Zheng has been here the whole time.

516
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,880
He can clear things up for me.

517
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,360
Also,

518
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:29,320
the maids and the caregivers
who cared for Mother.

519
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,040
- I'm willing to face...
- You good-for-nothing!

520
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,899
When your mother was gravely ill,

521
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,459
you dared to commit
such disgraceful acts?

522
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,539
How can you even justify yourself?

523
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,419
Lu Zheng has been your trusted attendant
for ten years.

524
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,339
Of course, he'll cover for you.

525
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,280
Let alone those servants!

526
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,320
If your mother knew of this
from the afterlife,

527
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,840
how could she not be heartbroken?

528
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,680
Father.

529
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,080
You must believe me.

530
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,139
I didn't do this.

531
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,400
This is completely untrue.

532
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,819
I must teach you a lesson

533
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,480
for her sake!

534
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,000
Father.

535
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,440
Take this!

536
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,619
Master, stop.

537
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,699
Young Master,

538
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,499
the Duke is angry
because he cares about you.

539
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,979
Stop arguing.

540
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,339
Let him vent first,

541
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,299
then explain yourself.

542
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,539
Enough talk!

543
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:16,240
Someone! Drag this defiant child out and
punish him according to the family rule!

544
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,979
- So, how did it go?
- He failed to stop him.

545
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,160
Failed...

546
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,219
So, is the gate
at the Duke of Ying's Residence closed?

547
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,360
Yes.

548
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,640
If they were receiving condolences,
why would they close it?

549
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,259
Something's definitely wrong.

550
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,619
You're still grounded.

551
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,920
If that's true,

552
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,680
do we still have to be involved?

553
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,819
We've already done our duty

554
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,560
by warning him.

555
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,000
No.

556
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,840
I want to save him.

557
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,139
Inform Mr. Chen

558
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,480
to make the final move.

559
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,560
(Please,)

560
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,240
(let me take the punishment
in place of my father.)

561
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,640
(It violates no military law)

562
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,360
(and remains loyal and filial!)

563
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,379
The whole court knows

564
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,800
that I have to

565
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,379
rely on my good son.

566
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,400
It's also all thanks
to Jiang Meisun's mercy!

567
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,939
(His Majesty even praised you,)

568
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,200
(saying you have Jiang Meisun's
noble spirit!)

569
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,080
Whose son are you exactly?

570
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,120
(Righteous and Unyielding Spirit)

571
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,360
You gave me life.

572
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,360
If you want it, take it.

573
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,600
If you don't want to see me,

574
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,960
I'll never return to the Capital

575
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,240
or come home.

576
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,080
But at least tell me

577
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,640
why are you treating me like this?

578
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,280
Why?

579
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,800
Why?

580
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,400
Lock him up.

581
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,800
Song Mo's disgraceful conduct

582
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,000
cannot be tolerated.

583
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,360
Tomorrow, invite First Brother
and Third Brother here.

584
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:39,530
I want to hold a family tribunal
and remove him from the family register.

585
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,000
Then report to His Majesty

586
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,520
to strip Song Mo of his title as heir.

587
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,360
(If your family is still around,)

588
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,200
(why not compromise and give it a try?)

589
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,480
(Like doing something
that brings joy to your parents.)

590
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,040
I see.

591
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,840
I understand it now.

592
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,840
Mother.

593
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,240
Go.

594
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,160
Your Lordship,

595
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,120
are you awake?

596
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,800
His Lordship is awake.

597
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,520
Everything is fine so long he's awake.

598
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,400
Then I'll deal with the other things.

599
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,800
Your Lordship.

600
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,720
Fourth Young Lady,

601
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,200
what is this place?

602
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,760
This is Zhaowen Bookstore.

603
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,499
Good thing
you detained Mr. Chen last time.

604
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,120
Otherwise,
I couldn't have saved you by myself.

605
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,720
Your master is already half-dead.

606
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:12,760
Tomorrow, the family tribunal
will strip him of everything.

607
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,000
If you still can't see
the situation clearly,

608
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,680
I'll write the confession for you.

609
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,240
All you need to do is sign
with your fingerprint.

610
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,320
Can you even write,

611
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,720
you fool?

612
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,160
(Create diversion
and rescue during the chaos.)

613
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,520
(Meet at the corner gate
and escape to safety.)

614
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,920
Or do you want to go first?

615
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,520
Stop! Stop it!

616
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,080
The Duke wants to drive us
to our deaths?

617
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,880
Then I'll take you all down with me!

618
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,640
Hurry.

619
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,760
This way. Hurry up.

620
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,299
Come on. Hurry.

621
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,480
Young Master has escaped!

622
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,619
This way!

623
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,760
Catch them!

624
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,409
Go now!

625
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:05,679
- Lu Ming, hurry!
- Leave now!

626
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,940
Get out of here now!

627
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:25,659
Zheng!

628
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,579
Leave!

629
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,809
Lu Ming, leave now!

630
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,050
Zheng!

631
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,000
Protect His Lordship!

632
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:38,909
Zheng!

633
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:41,099
We must leave now!

634
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,319
(Create diversion
and rescue during the chaos.)

635
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,600
(Meet at the corner gate and escape.)

636
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,720
Father and son sit side by side
but do not understand each other.

637
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:54,400
Strangers risk their lives to save me.

638
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,000
You sneak out in the middle of the night
to meet a man.

639
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,720
Do you know the consequences

640
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,659
if your stepmother
and Fifth Uncle found out?

641
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,960
The situation was urgent.

642
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,560
Since I've already saved you,

643
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,360
I have my ways of handling it.

644
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,000
Besides, you saved me before.

645
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,720
Saved you?

646
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,360
I mean,

647
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,320
you saved me back in Futing.

648
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,640
Now that Mr. Chen has returned,

649
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,400
we no longer owe each other anything.

650
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:46,560
Your handwriting
isn’t as messy as it used to be.

651
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,520
It seems strangely familiar.

652
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,419
(Create diversion
and rescue during the chaos.)

653
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,880
(Allow me to be bold enough
to guess what's on your mind.)

654
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,000
You're avoiding my gaze.

655
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,840
Do you still remember

656
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,160
the incomplete play
of "The Life of Luo Shan"

657
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,960
at Guanghe Tower
during the Tiancang Festival Festival?

658
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,240
You've mistaken me for someone else.

659
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:22,320
I don't watch plays.

660
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,000
You're heavily injured.

661
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,400
Stop overthinking.

662
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,560
I'll apply some more medicine for you.

663
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,360
(Gray hair.)

664
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,000
(It's her.)

665
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,920
(It has always been her.)

666
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,520
(She risked her life to save me
but refused to admit about it.)

667
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,040
(Why is she avoiding acknowledging me?)

668
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,680
(What kind of secret is she hiding?)

669
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,520
These bloodstains are turning purple.

670
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,360
They aimed to kill.

671
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:13,920
The injury affects the internal organs.

672
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,480
So the blood is naturally dark.

673
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,280
What is the hour now?

674
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,640
It's the Zi hour.

675
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,960
I've been unconscious for six hours.

676
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,520
I thought you would remain unconscious.

677
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,459
I must return.

678
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,320
How can you go back with such injuries?

679
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,800
If they proceed to expel me
from the family registry,

680
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,400
the family rules take precedence.

681
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,760
His Majesty would also strip me
of my title as the heir

682
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,800
and I would be in a hopeless situation.

683
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,280
It's better to push forward
with determination

684
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,560
than to hesitate.

685
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,960
With such injuries,

686
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,560
you'll need at least a month to recover.

687
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,360
I can't afford to wait anymore.

688
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,360
The guard's life is hanging by a thread,

689
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,800
and my mother's just passed away.

690
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,120
What I need the most

691
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,360
is not to heal,

692
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,000
but to be able to hold my weapon.

693
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,520
(Duke of Ying's Residence)

694
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,840
Fourth Young Lady has been punished
by Fifth Master Dou

695
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,339
for meeting a man at night.

696
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,339
That was me.

697
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:47,620
- Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship.

698
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,120
Fourth Young Lady,

699
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,739
It was my reckless behavior

700
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,520
and my disgraceful actions.

701
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,339
Fourth Young Lady Dou
had nothing to do with it.

702
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,560
So, Minister Dou,

703
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,550
you can punish me instead.
