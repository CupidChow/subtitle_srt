1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,640
This is the pass
required to retrieve the boat.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,940
Take it and leave.

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,180
I won't drag you into this anymore.

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,940
Then let us never meet again.

5
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,620
You're abandoning Loyalty.
What about Filial Piety, then?

6
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,540
You're wallowing in sorrow

7
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,090
and tormenting yourself.

8
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,140
Do you think Duke of Ding
can rest in peace?

9
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,140
When a person dies, they're gone.

10
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,140
He will never know about it.

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,370
You're inferior to him.

12
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,500
Indeed.

13
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,979
Duke of Ding,

14
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,709
(Noble Spirit Among The Clouds,
His Heroic Spirit Lasts Forever)

15
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,890
you're the marshal
of the army in Futing.

16
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,170
I'm able to lead
a wealthy and carefree life

17
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,980
all thanks to you.

18
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,730
The territory of Futing is kept safe.

19
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,530
Its people are living in peace.

20
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,250
It's all thanks to your sacrifice.

21
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,370
Thank you.

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,780
Rest in peace.

23
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,340
His Majesty has killed the witness

24
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,099
and closed the case
with an imperial decree.

25
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,500
How can I change everything
if I don't let him forge a new empire?

26
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,919
Do you only use your eyes

27
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,370
to interrogate me?

28
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,420
If His Majesty truly wanted
to frame Duke of Ding,

29
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,039
why would he spare the entire Jiang Clan

30
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,450
because of a disciplinary ruler?

31
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,580
Believe me.

32
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,650
I'm sure His Majesty knows the truth.

33
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,450
He has no choice but to close the case

34
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,860
under the circumstances.

35
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,429
Does that mean I have to head back
and apply for a high position

36
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,850
while enduring all the humiliations
and containing my hatred?

37
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,990
You lost your position
and left the Capital years ago.

38
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,170
You don't know much
about the court situation.

39
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,990
How can you overturn the case
when you know little about your enemies?

40
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,660
Now, not only have we lost all leads,

41
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,799
but the entire court
know about your ambitions

42
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,010
and character.

43
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,749
Now that everyone has known

44
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,420
your sharp personality.

45
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,629
Do you know that the true essence
of wielding a blade

46
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,190
lies not in the taking of lives
but the unsheathing of the blade?

47
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,870
You have to keep yourself
in the scabbard

48
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,709
and contain your brilliance

49
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,700
so that you can find out the truth.

50
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:43,810
Only then will you be able
to decide how to proceed.

51
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,170
Duke of Ding sacrificed his life

52
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,730
to protect the land of Futing

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,399
and preserve peace among the people.

54
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,580
He's not just highly regarded by you.

55
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,170
He's highly regarded by everyone.

56
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,820
Each word you utter

57
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,490
and each technique you use

58
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,700
were taught by your uncle himself.

59
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,290
Song Mo,

60
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:20,610
listen closely.

61
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,980
From today onward,

62
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,580
you are him.

63
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,139
=Blossom=
(Adapted from the novel "Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

64
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,400
=Episode 11=

65
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,130
Your Lordship, you're here indeed.

66
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,410
Your Lordship,

67
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,400
I've received news about Duke of Ding
from the palace after probing around.

68
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,860
How did it go?

69
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,560
Some of the eunuchs in Ministry
of Imperial Ceremony were saying

70
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,719
that His Majesty is still talking
to the disciplinary ruler.

71
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,300
His Majesty couldn't sleep in peace.

72
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,880
Imperial physicians and sorcerers
visited the palace more often.

73
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,930
Seems like His Majesty feels guilty
toward you, Your Lordship.

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,690
Why don't you use this
to your advantage?

75
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,220
(Dou Zhao hit the nail
on the head again this time.)

76
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,370
(I'm afraid the Jiang Clan
would've been executed)

77
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,690
(without the remaining
disciplinary ruler.)

78
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,900
(How did she manage to predict this?)

79
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,949
His Majesty can't bear to see
Duke of Ding suffer a wrongful death,

80
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,490
yet he ended the case hastily.

81
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,020
Who exactly is behind this

82
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,570
to make the ruler
cover up for his crime?

83
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,020
You see, when we gamble,

84
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,100
sometimes, we have to lose

85
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,370
in order to win the bigger games.

86
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,930
As a ruler,

87
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,420
his wager is too huge.

88
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,860
His wager is the imperial court
and the world.

89
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,460
After the southeastern gale struck,

90
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,719
His Majesty wanted
the crown prince to relief,

91
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,130
but was refuted by Duke of Ding.

92
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,300
Duke of Ding did it himself.

93
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,189
Are you saying that Duke of Ding
was the target of his vengeance

94
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,230
since he wasn't willing
to support the crown prince?

95
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,570
Your Lordship, are you saying

96
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,540
that His Majesty hid the incident
from him on purpose to stabilize

97
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,420
the crown prince and his faction?

98
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,860
How did the princes react

99
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,130
when Duke of Ding
was escorted back to the Capital?

100
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,479
Only the crown prince and Lord Qing
came to inquire about him.

101
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,620
They didn't act.

102
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,919
Your Lordship!

103
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,690
Something happened
at Futing's military camp.

104
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,480
(Loyalty and Filial Piety)

105
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,039
We mustn't be disbanded
before Deputy Marshal's return!

106
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,130
- Yeah, we mustn't.
- We mustn't!

107
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,629
That darned imperial court
killed Marshal!

108
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,930
Let's not serve them!

109
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,239
Rather than bear the infamy
and endure this humiliation,

110
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,799
why don't we become outlaws?

111
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,039
- Yeah!
- That's right!

112
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,340
Let's become outlaws!

113
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,420
These words could cost you your head!

114
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,300
Do not say that again!

115
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,719
- Deputy Marshal.
- Deputy Marshal.

116
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,320
I was removed from my position as well.

117
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,730
I'm no longer your deputy marshal.

118
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,170
I'm here to bid farewell.

119
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,490
From now on, we will go on separate ways

120
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,370
and lead our own lives.

121
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,210
Deputy Marshal!

122
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,239
All of us are soldiers.

123
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,429
None of us fear death!

124
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,510
If we become cowards
without clearing Marshal's name,

125
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,799
we'll let him down forever!

126
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,400
All of us wish to avenge Marshal!

127
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,719
It's fine even if we have to die!

128
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,999
We would've sought revenge

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,429
had we known who the culprit was!

130
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,629
- Deputy Marshal!
- Deputy Marshal!

131
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,770
Deputy Marshal!

132
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,780
If you guys still take me
as your deputy marshal,

133
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,970
this will be an order.

134
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,300
From today onward,

135
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,130
the Ding Army will be disbanded!

136
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,570
What?

137
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,770
Disbanded?

138
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,780
Those with rank of deputy general
and above, follow me.

139
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,020
- I'm not leaving.
- Yeah.

140
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,220
Guys, all of you are loyal to my uncle.

141
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,300
I dare not hide this from you guys.

142
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,870
Although the imperial decree
has been issued,

143
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,340
the mastermind is someone else.

144
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,020
I intend to investigate the case
and end the culprit myself.

145
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,970
It'll be dangerous.

146
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,050
From now on, you guys
are no longer soldiers.

147
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,210
You guys can only be secret operatives.

148
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,500
Deputy Marshal, I knew
you wouldn't abandon us.

149
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,900
We've been protecting the borders
for the last decade or two.

150
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,140
We know nothing
about the situation in the Capital.

151
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,090
Therefore, we were set up
time and time again.

152
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,500
Now, no matter if it's
for the sake of overturning the case

153
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,260
or retaining the Ding Army,

154
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,090
we have to plant our men
in the imperial court.

155
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,380
Deputy Marshal, just tell us
if you need anything.

156
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,650
Get us the liquor!

157
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,780
Fifty thousand is too much.

158
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,930
Pick 500 of the most elite soldiers
and follow me to the Capital.

159
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,799
The other soldiers have to

160
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,020
take up their posts
and biding their time.

161
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,690
We shall accumulate strength
that can level plains.

162
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,269
All 53,000 members of the Ding Army

163
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,500
will serve you with our lives!

164
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,359
We will serve you with our lives!

165
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,269
Bottoms up!

166
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,410
Bottoms up!

167
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,080
(Miao Family's Warehouse, Futing)
Stop it!

168
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,599
- The government office released us!
- Stop it!

169
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,269
We're victims of the incident as well!

170
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,690
Our names have been cleared!
We aren't traitors!

171
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,869
You guys are robbing us!

172
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,869
Don't grab!

173
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,879
Don't grab!

174
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,729
Don't do this!

175
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,900
Mrs. Liu!

176
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,319
You only invested ten taels in us!

177
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,079
This bag of accessories
is worth at least 50 taels!

178
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,839
Your family didn't repay
your debt on time.

179
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,330
I have to charge you some interest.

180
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,530
Go away!

181
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,679
According to the law, those who attempted
to rob the establishment

182
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,079
- Zhao.
- and fail to do so

183
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,190
will be flogged 20 times
and be banished for 3 years.

184
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,020
Those who succeeded

185
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,210
shall be exiled or executed
according to the severity.

186
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,019
Since you all did this
under broad daylight,

187
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,399
your sentence will be more severe.

188
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,090
It's only natural
for them to repay their debt.

189
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,810
It's only natural for them

190
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,450
to repay their debt, huh?

191
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,570
What should we do if you guys
have hurt someone?

192
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,810
Those who injure other people

193
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,420
will face severe punishment.

194
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,140
We're desperate too!

195
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,239
The cargo ship was seized.

196
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,359
All of our goods
are stuck rotting in the ship!

197
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,140
We purchased them
with our hard-earned money!

198
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,549
That's right.

199
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,690
Yeah.

200
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,900
I'm Dou Zhao, Fourth Young Lady
of the Capital's Western Dou Family.

201
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,690
I'm also the head of the Miao family.

202
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,050
Now, I shall draft a contract.

203
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,570
I shall repay our debt in ten days.

204
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,970
This jade bangle is a family heirloom.

205
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,210
I'll hand it
to the government office as a mortgage.

206
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,210
I'll definitely give you guys
an account in ten days.

207
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,269
That's the last item
your mother had left for you.

208
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,410
You mustn't do this.

209
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,130
Those who are willing to trust me

210
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,450
may leave your thumbprint here.

211
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,260
Those who are not willing to trust me,

212
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,319
follow me to the government office.

213
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,369
Let's see whether
the Miao family owes you guys more

214
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,930
or you guys have to pay more
for the damages you caused here.

215
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,860
I'll leave my thumbprint.

216
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,100
Me too.

217
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,100
I'll do it too.

218
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,320
(He Yueye, Leng Yueyun)

219
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:13,920
(Dou Zhao)

220
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,660
Bear with it.

221
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,810
Luckily, the wound isn't deep.

222
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,140
Zhao, I can't afford to let you
use your jade bangle as a mortgage.

223
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,389
You came to Futing personally
because of me.

224
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,150
I'm already grateful enough
to you for that.

225
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,300
I should bear the responsibilities.

226
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,740
I'll find a middleman

227
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,719
and mortgage our shop and warehouse.

228
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,260
I'll redeem your jade bangle for you.

229
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,170
Middlemen don't know
what they're losing out on.

230
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,239
The shop and warehouse

231
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,660
aren't as precious as you.

232
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,170
Why don't you
mortgage yourself to me, then?

233
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,850
That will do.

234
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,239
Based on the salary of the shop manager,

235
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,500
Zhao, I have to work under you

236
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,390
for 3,224 days.

237
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,199
I should be able
to clear my debt by then.

238
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,780
That's about eight to nine years.

239
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,850
I'm just joking.

240
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:08,789
Mother will surely

241
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,909
be happy to know that her jade bangle

242
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,450
is being put to good use.

243
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,330
Don't worry about it.

244
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,119
I'm sure the fortune
of the richest family

245
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,910
is enough to redeem
a jade bangle like this.

246
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,359
Here, it states that a 6% interest
is charged for stock purchases.

247
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,860
However, the accounts aren't tallying.

248
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,170
Where are the goods?

249
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:37,180
I invested in a restaurant
using our goods instead of money.

250
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,860
You invested in a restaurant
when we were plagued by disasters, huh?

251
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,450
Mister, this dealing of yours

252
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,000
has netted you a lot of profit indeed.

253
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,510
We still have the dowries
meant for my sister's wedding, right?

254
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,570
You useless fool!

255
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,509
Don't even think about
touching her dowries.

256
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,580
She's at the age when she's
supposed to get married.

257
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,780
How can she get married
without any money?

258
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,149
I know Ansu needs to get married.
But what about Anping?

259
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,700
Anping needs to take
the imperial exam.

260
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,300
Do you expect him to beg for money
so that he can take the exam?

261
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,990
- I...
- As long as it can repay our debt,

262
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,050
you can sell

263
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,460
anything I have.

264
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,500
I'm only able to have dowries
all thanks to Zhao.

265
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,170
I'll put them to use

266
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,570
so that we can repay our debt
without implicating her.

267
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,319
I'm not just doing it for Anping's sake.

268
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,389
Ansu,

269
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,660
are you serious?

270
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,660
I refuse.

271
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,890
Zhao.

272
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,839
There are plenty of goods
on the cargo ship.

273
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,180
Have you done an inventory check?

274
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,869
The incident just occurred.

275
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,079
The yamen of Futing is still in chaos.

276
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,850
We haven't got the time to do it.

277
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,749
(Dou's Residence, The Capital)

278
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,890
Shishu,

279
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,959
Yingxue insisted on
asking me to inquire about

280
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,780
Ming and Dezhen from you.

281
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,540
She said Mr. Wu might speak
if we manage to make Father-in-law

282
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,930
our mediator.

283
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,959
A letter from Mu Chuan?

284
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,900
Mu Chuan has just joined the cabinet.

285
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,620
Most of Duke of Ying's old acquaintances
in the Grand Secretariat

286
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,960
have been retired
and sent back to their hometowns.

287
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,660
Wu Yifen is old now.

288
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,900
How long can he last?

289
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,660
Shishu, do you mean...

290
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:21,170
The time of those old ministers
will come to an end soon.

291
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,780
The Wu Family

292
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,900
will lose their influence eventually.

293
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,499
What's the point of establishing
a marriage alliance with them?

294
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,500
You should tell Yingxue

295
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,850
to tend to her relationship
with the Wei Family.

296
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,360
(Cui's Residence)

297
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,770
Come.

298
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,439
Since you have delivered the gifts,

299
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,629
you guys should hurry back

300
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,239
so that you guys won't blame Zhao

301
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,750
for falling sick.

302
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,790
How could you guys chase us away
upon delivering the gifts?

303
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,169
Even if Fourth Young Lady
cannot meet us now,

304
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,040
she should greet us
or give us a gift in return.

305
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,690
This concerns the Dou's Residence.

306
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,959
Young Lady,
I don't think you have the right

307
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,909
to interfere.

308
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,050
- I will...
- What about me?

309
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,500
Grandmother.

310
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,740
You guys are behaving suspiciously
in the middle of the day.

311
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,850
It's been more than a decade,

312
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,440
and you rarely
deliver festival gifts to us.

313
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,910
Now, Shougu and I are sick.

314
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:34,500
What are you guys up to?

315
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,900
Mother-in-law, you misunderstood us.

316
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,439
I heard that Zhao contracted chickenpox.

317
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,140
Therefore, I requested
a smallpox deity statue from the temple.

318
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,020
This statue is very particular.

319
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,130
Zhao has to worship it herself.

320
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,590
If not, it won't work.

321
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,699
I never believed in things

322
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,259
like deities and Buddhas.

323
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,499
Take it back.

324
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,089
Mother-in-law, we shouldn't do so.

325
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,139
It's easier to raise the devil
than to lay him.

326
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,739
If we disrespect the deity statue,

327
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,600
it'll harm the family's
fortune and luck.

328
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,080
I'm sure Zhao doesn't
want that to happen.

329
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,420
Fourth Young Lady, you should...

330
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,880
Stop your nonsense!

331
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,939
One who has chickenpox
needs to avoid the wind.

332
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,200
Hurry and shut the curtain.

333
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,520
Yes, Grandmother.

334
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,440
All right. I'll accept it
on Shougu's behalf.

335
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,680
I assume you guys are busy
with business in the capital.

336
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,059
I won't keep you guys here.

337
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,200
You guys should head back
if there's nothing else.

338
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,080
Don't come again.

339
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,440
Old Madam,

340
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,539
Madam means well.

341
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,800
- So...
- Nanny Zhou.

342
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,619
If so, Mother-in-law,

343
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,880
please hand this deity statue
to Zhao, then.

344
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,080
We shall take our leave.

345
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,080
- Move aside.
- But Grandmother...

346
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,240
Move aside!

347
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,480
What's going on?

348
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,360
Shougu, she...

349
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,899
She went to wash up. She'll return soon.

350
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,640
You better tell me the truth.

351
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,160
Shougu, she went to Futing.

352
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,840
Right now, Futing
is a key area involved in the case.

353
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,360
What is she doing there?

354
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,640
She...

355
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,440
Is she related to the case as well?

356
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,080
The Maritime Trade Bureau had seized
the Miao family's cargo ship.

357
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,139
Shougu is worried about Ansu
since she's going there alone.

358
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,280
That's why she...

359
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,520
How could she do this?

360
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,339
You guys…

361
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,470
How could you guys do this?

362
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,360
All right now.

363
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,539
Madam, are we leaving already?

364
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,280
Shouldn't we probe deeper?

365
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,160
Didn't you see it just now?

366
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,000
The hand she extended had smooth skin.

367
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,539
How could there be no rashes

368
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,600
if she contracted chickenpox for real?

369
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,320
We made the right choice
by coming here today.

370
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,800
I see.

371
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,680
Come on. Let's return to the Capital.

372
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,569
(Dou's Residence)

373
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,000
Zhao is truly audacious.

374
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,280
As a noble lady, not only did
she reveal herself in public,

375
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,560
but she also went to
Futing without permission.

376
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,899
Futing

377
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,840
is in chaos due to

378
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,280
the Duke of Ding's case.

379
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,899
It's said that there's been
an uprising of refugees too.

380
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,040
Zhao is...

381
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,819
Master, Madam,
Duke of Jining sent us an invitation.

382
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,499
They intend to hold a gathering
by setting up a banquet

383
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,680
for Seventh Master, Madam,
and the young ladies.

384
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,840
Why are they holding a gathering
at such a time?

385
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,920
Since they're setting up a banquet,

386
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,960
it might be a discussion for marriage.

387
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,779
Reject them.

388
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,700
We can talk about it
after I bring Shougu back.

389
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,280
Someone, prepare my carriage.

390
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,320
Master, you mustn't reject them.

391
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,939
If people hear that Zhao

392
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,480
is in Futing now,

393
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,259
forget about herself,

394
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,320
I'm afraid Ming will find it difficult
to find a husband as well.

395
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,520
How about we tell them

396
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,779
that you and the ladies are sick.

397
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,700
I will attend the banquet
as our representative.

398
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,920
All right. I'll leave it to you.

399
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,460
You should keep your wits about you.

400
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,600
I'll make a move first.

401
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,920
Yes, Master.

402
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:21,280
This side dish is quite unique.

403
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,440
Is this a specialty dish of Futing?

404
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,800
When we were clearing the stock,

405
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,840
we found that lots
of the food are spoiled.

406
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,170
Only a box of Western
potato-like produce is still edible.

407
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,360
I wanted to roast them
and give them a try.

408
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,960
They're delicate and fragrant.

409
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,920
It resembles yam.

410
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,699
But many of them have sprouted.

411
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,920
We can't consume or sell them.

412
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,520
We may not be able to consume them,

413
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,280
but we can plant them.

414
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,019
If they can sprout
in a dark and damp place

415
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,019
like the ship's cabin,

416
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:54,080
they must be hardy plants.

417
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,520
If we plant it right now,

418
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,920
we'll be able to harvest them
in around three months.

419
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,299
Therefore, you don't need to repay

420
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,080
the capital to me as of yet.

421
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,420
You can use the money to rent a land
and plant the potato-like produce on it.

422
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,779
Many areas were hit by the flood.

423
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,480
The nation is lacking in food supply.

424
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,459
As long as you plant enough of them,

425
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,360
not only can we feed the people,

426
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,840
but we can also expand
the types of food products.

427
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,840
I'm sure all grain merchants
will buy them.

428
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,760
Based on the price
of 50 wen per jin of white flour,

429
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,560
we can produce 300 jin of
potato-like produce on 1 mu of land.

430
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,520
If we have ten mu of land per year,

431
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,840
we can make over 100 taels.

432
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,240
This is a great idea.

433
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,760
Zhao, I'll follow your instructions.

434
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,160
What are you guys doing?

435
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,080
Ji Yong,

436
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,600
you're trying to scare us again.

437
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,360
Is it something delicious?

438
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,560
Try it. Here.

439
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:55,920
It's pretty good.

440
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,490
It's just that it isn't sweet enough.

441
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,419
Mr. Ji,

442
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,400
what's with you and the scary mask?

443
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,440
It attracts fortune.

444
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,080
I'm here to deliver wealth to you.

445
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,939
Have you clinched the deals?
What price did you offer them?

446
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,080
Who are the buyers?

447
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,760
Beg me if you wish to see it.

448
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,419
Pretty please?

449
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,760
You actually did it, huh?

450
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,720
This is no fun.

451
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,440
Look.

452
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,179
(40,000 silver taels)

453
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:27,619
(600,000 silver taels)

454
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,490
The Ministry of Construction is offering
such a high price for the ships?

455
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,190
The imperial court has never bought
any civilian-owned ships before.

456
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,300
I wouldn't have proceeded with the deal

457
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,570
if it wasn't a remarkable feat.

458
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,979
I submitted a proposal to Mu Chuan,

459
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,200
proposing a reform plan
for maritime trade.

460
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,770
We sell civilian ships to the government

461
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,790
and bring the foreign maritime trade
under the control of the imperial court.

462
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,250
Not only can we solve the difficulty,

463
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,390
but we can also contribute
to the national treasury.

464
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,840
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

465
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,979
You don't need to thank me.

466
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,760
It's Dou Zhao who issued a notice
in the Dou family's name.

467
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,490
That's why Mu Chuan
is willing to see me.

468
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,539
Zhao...

469
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,760
There's no need
to be this courteous with me.

470
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,619
This is great.

471
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,799
The crisis has been resolved.

472
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,760
Let's head back together tomorrow.

473
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,800
Zhao.

474
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,040
I can't return with you.

475
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,240
Every year when the voyage begins,

476
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,539
my parents and I will come here

477
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,080
to refuel the ships and polish them,

478
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,920
from small boats to large ships.

479
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,840
Now, we've lost everything.

480
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,760
It's time for me to grow up.

481
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,980
Do you intend to remain in Futing
to help your family with their business?

482
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,920
Zhao,

483
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,120
I won't let you down.

484
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,560
What I've lost today,

485
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,360
I'll earn them back in the future.

486
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,880
Okay.

487
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,360
If so, may our wish come true.

488
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,560
To a smooth future
and a free and content life.

489
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,960
To a smooth future
and a free and content life!

490
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,160
To a free and content life.

491
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,600
Greetings, Minister Mu.

492
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,320
Greetings, Lord Mu.

493
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,520
(Mu Chuan, Minister of Construction)

494
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,960
Lord Mu, over here, please.

495
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,600
Selling the ships is a brilliant idea.

496
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,560
I owe you a huge favor.

497
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,360
What favor? It's just a game.

498
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,040
It's more satisfying to enjoy a game
than make a lot of money.

499
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,299
My reform proposal did well.

500
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,600
Mu Chuan liked it.

501
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,330
In exchange,

502
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,350
he recommended me to the
prince's residence as Chief Historian.

503
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,090
Chief Historian? That's a lowly position
with plenty of chores to do.

504
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,059
Not only must you guide
and advise the prince,

505
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,340
but you also have to report
to His Majesty periodically.

506
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,080
It's a thankless job.

507
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,899
The harder the task is,

508
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,440
the easier it is to stand out.

509
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,619
I like to get more with less.

510
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,190
I don't want to be stuck
in a position,

511
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,560
like the goods in the cargo ships.

512
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,859
Since the crown prince isn't favored,

513
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,200
I shall make a huge bet

514
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,880
and support the other princes.

515
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,520
Do you intend to head
to Lord Qing's Residence?

516
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,000
Empress Shen, the crown prince's mother,

517
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,539
came from a lowly background
and passed away when he was young.

518
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,820
There aren't many officials
that support the crown prince.

519
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:17,390
Lord Qing is a well-educated gentleman.

520
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,960
And, he commands the troops of Liaodong.

521
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:21,299
His mother, Empress Wan,
is also favored by His Majesty.

522
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,440
And now, there's me.

523
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,490
He has a high chance
of defeating the crown prince.

524
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,760
(I once heard that Lord Qing
beat the crown prince to the throne)

525
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,459
(all because of
an intelligent strategist.)

526
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,659
(Ji Yong, Prodigious Monk)

527
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,579
(Could it be him?)

528
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,659
(Loyalty, Treachery,
Gratitude, Vengeance)

529
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,200
(Ji Yong will head to Liaodong
to assist Lord Qing.)

530
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,040
(Will he suffer a tragic death
because of this?)

531
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,699
I have some advice for you.

532
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,440
You should think twice.

533
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,760
I won't keep you in suspense any longer.

534
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,899
Lord Qing is rebellious.

535
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,200
He'll surely attempt a rebellion.

536
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,980
You shouldn't forget why you joined
the officialdom in the first place.

537
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,600
You got it opposite.

538
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,120
That's precisely why
I joined the officialdom.

539
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,000
So, you knew that long ago?

540
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,880
Regarding the future,

541
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,600
only Heaven, Earth, you,
and I know about it.

542
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,280
We should engage things
without being bound by them.

543
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,779
Kings and nobles are nothing

544
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:20,240
but telescopes to me.

545
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,120
The imperial court is corrupt.

546
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:24,680
Our enemies have
their eyes on our nation.

547
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,000
What I desire is recognition from
other potential candidates.

548
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,520
I want them to do a reform.

549
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,120
Treating a patient is easy.

550
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,960
But when it comes to treating a nation,
I have plenty of strategies

551
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,200
that can help our empire
to last for another 100 years.

552
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,499
Minister Mu,

553
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,640
this is the place.

554
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,160
Are these the hardy potato-like produce

555
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,080
you mentioned in the latter?

556
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,080
The people of Futing call them potatoes.

557
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:01,579
Due to the long delay, most of the goods
and produce have spoiled.

558
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,960
However, they didn't.

559
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,040
If that's the case,

560
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,360
these produce are more valuable

561
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,880
than the entire ship of goods.

562
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,600
Here.

563
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:21,280
You can only have strawberry ice cream
in Futing, you know?

564
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:23,580
You won't be able to have them
when we head to Liaodong.

565
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,880
Didn't you say that ice cream is cold
and bad for the stomach and spleen?

566
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,320
Didn't you say that it's easy
to get giddy after having it?

567
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,350
Your thinking is so rigid.

568
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,480
I can seek treatment
if I fall sick from consuming it.

569
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,080
Eat up.

570
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,459
Men should consume liquor and meat.

571
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,299
Buns for sale!

572
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,080
Look at him. He's a man,

573
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,600
yet he likes sweet desserts
preferred by women.

574
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,259
Huh, since when were food preferences
categorized according to gender?

575
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,400
So childish.

576
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,179
I see that you two
are consuming liquor and meat.

577
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,890
So, can you guys
conquer the battlefield?

578
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,600
Or can you guys rule a nation?

579
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,480
He's arrogant beyond belief.

580
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,680
Miss,

581
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,530
he doesn't suit you.

582
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,420
Yeah.

583
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,979
Unlike you two. You two suit each other.

584
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,120
You!

585
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,739
Calm down.

586
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,859
Let's drink.

587
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,000
Let's drink.

588
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,619
Come.

589
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,760
Oh yeah.

590
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,600
This is for you.

591
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,580
The snow in Liaodong is heavy,
and there are many hunting pits.

592
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:23,160
I always see you squinting your eyes
on a regular basis.

593
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,920
I suppose you have poor vision.

594
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,899
I found this after searching through

595
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,080
the shops in the Capital.

596
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,520
Treat it as a parting gift.

597
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,480
You actually noticed that, huh?

598
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,720
Upon closer inspection,

599
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,880
I realize that you aren't ugly.

600
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,779
Fine.

601
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,160
I'll give you a gift in return.

602
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,939
I couldn't bear to consume the strawberries
on the ice cream every time.

603
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,920
I'll leave them until the last.

604
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,080
Here you go.

605
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,480
Shougu.

606
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,720
Father?

607
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,560
- Are you okay?
- What are you doing here?

608
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,240
If we don't hurry,

609
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,960
you're probably going to destroy Futing.

610
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,059
Fifth Uncle.

611
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,640
You're something else, aren't you?

612
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,100
You ruined the family's reputation
and eloped with someone.

613
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,520
So, you found your Mr. Right, huh?

614
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,880
Ms. Longevity.

615
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,249
You're a noble lady,

616
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,889
yet you came to Futing all by yourself.

617
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,860
Do you know how worried
your family members are?

618
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,600
Father, Fifth Uncle.

619
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,220
This is Ji, the cousin from
Ji'an's Cui Family.

620
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,979
He's also Lord Ji,
who's also in charge of

621
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,400
the Maritime Trade Bureau's case.

622
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,660
So, he's the child of Master Ji.

623
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,680
Greetings, uncles.

624
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,699
You came all the way to Futing

625
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,240
just to ruin our family's reputation.

626
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,779
I came to Futing

627
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,520
to help the Mu Family
resolve their crisis.

628
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,960
I funded Ansu's

629
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,920
maritime trading business.

630
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,520
I can't just sit idly by
when she's in trouble.

631
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,570
What emotion or reason could possibly
outweigh morality and personal honor?

632
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,370
You're a woman.

633
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,899
You should wait to get married at home.

634
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,990
But you came here to show yourself
in public instead.

635
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,739
Such indecency!

636
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,939
The Miao family

637
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,400
- were merely servants at the clan manor.
- Tidbits for sale!

638
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,560
Now, they're doing business.

639
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,079
Even so, there's a difference.

640
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,400
You don't have a sister like her!

641
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,900
Didn't the Dou family
first start out as peddlers as well?

642
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,230
The noble and the lowly
were only distinguished after that.

643
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,200
Then were there Eastern
and Western Dou Family.

644
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:32,049
Don't tell me we have
to disregard our ancestors now?

645
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:35,070
How dare you bring up our ancestors
and the family business?

646
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,280
Are you trying to rebel here?

647
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:37,019
Shishu!

648
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,509
Shishu, calm down.

649
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,499
Fifth Uncle,

650
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,320
Dou Zhao has also played a role
in resolving the maritime trade crisis.

651
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,110
She can be considered
a meritorious official.

652
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,330
You mustn't give her a beating.

653
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,480
Don't interrupt.

654
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,400
Unfilial child.

655
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,939
Do you know
that your grandmother fell sick

656
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,120
all because of you?

657
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,520
What's wrong with Grandmother?

658
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,499
What happened to Grandmother?

659
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,160
Your grandmother became bedridden
because of her longing for you.

660
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,920
Yingxue is helping us
to look after her now.

661
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,240
Wang Yingxue?

662
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,720
Since you're that creative and capable,

663
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,019
I suppose the death of an elder
means nothing to you.

664
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,099
Fifth Uncle,

665
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,320
I know my fault now.

666
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,669
I should be punished for
coming all the way to Futing.

667
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,440
Fifth Uncle, you may
punish me as you wish.

668
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,160
I only hope that I can return soon
to tend to Grandmother.

669
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,060
Send this letter to the local officials.

670
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,379
Tell them the daughter of the Dou family

671
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,819
has never been to Futing before.

672
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,960
Yes, Father.

673
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,680
Father, Fifth Uncle.

674
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,360
I know Grandmother's condition the best.

675
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:44,869
This is urgent.

676
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,440
Why don't we depart right now?

677
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,500
Now, you're anxious, huh?

678
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,409
Your mother is looking after the manor.

679
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,550
They'll be fine.

680
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,179
But your father and I

681
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,680
have traveled a long way
to look for you.

682
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,320
And, we've pulled many strings as well.

683
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,240
We did everything

684
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,560
to take care of our family members.

685
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,960
Fifth Uncle, I understand.

686
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,459
I'm willing to hand over
my assets in Futing

687
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,080
to the family

688
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,360
to atone for my mistake.

689
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,600
What a joke.

690
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,950
Did you think your father and I
came all the way here

691
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:21,200
just because we wanted
your meager assets?

692
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,600
That's not what I mean.

693
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,979
I'm willing to reflect upon
my actions at home

694
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,040
and heed my elders' words
from then onward.

695
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,960
Shougu is doing this
out of filial piety.

696
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,859
Fifth Brother,

697
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,600
why don't we depart now?

698
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,400
It was an exhausting trip.

699
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,560
We were supposed
to rest here for a few days.

700
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,900
Forget it.

701
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,040
Let's take a break.
We shall depart at the fifth watch.

702
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,600
Thank you, Fifth Uncle.

703
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,729
We buy fish nets!

704
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:53,719
Vegetables for sale!

705
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,079
Vegetables for sale! Take a look!

706
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,400
Vegetables for sale!

707
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,980
We buy fish nets!

708
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,579
(Tea)

709
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,720
Sir.

710
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,520
What would you like?

711
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,080
We could've spent the night at Wu Town.

712
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,760
You just had to depart overnight.

713
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,120
Now, we're stuck
in the middle of nowhere.

714
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,419
Shishu,

715
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,880
have a drink. Don't be angry.

716
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,680
Shougu is just anxious
to return to her grandmother's side.

717
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,240
She's a filial child.

718
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,019
Since everyone is exhausted,

719
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,280
let's set up camp here tonight.

720
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,360
Fifth Master, Seventh Master.

721
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,680
There's a military tent ahead.

722
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,520
Are you two Fifth Master Dou
and Seventh Master Dou?

723
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,560
Indeed.

724
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,139
General, you are?

725
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,219
Greetings, my lords.

726
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,310
We are stationed at the outskirts
as frontier troops.

727
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,619
The camp ahead is a resting place

728
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,000
provided by our army for travelers.

729
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,000
My lords, you all may rest there
with peace of mind.

730
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,840
General, we dare not
interrupt your military affairs.

731
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,019
My lords, it is our duty

732
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,400
to serve you two well.

733
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,259
We shall serve you all
liquor and food later.

734
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,320
My lords, please don't refuse us.

735
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,609
If so, please accept our thanks.

736
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,750
Please.

737
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,819
The journey has been long
and exhausting. It must've been tough.

738
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:01,280
General, sorry for the trouble.

739
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,640
- You're too courteous.
- Please.

740
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,360
The dishes are pretty scrumptious, huh?

741
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,280
It's too scrumptious.

742
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,520
The military would never
do something like this.

743
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,940
Thank you.

744
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,030
Here, let me fill your cups.

745
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,080
All right.

746
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,779
Young Lady, your tummy is acting up
due to the rushed trip.

747
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,499
You shouldn't take oily food.

748
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,760
I'll ask them if they have congee here.

749
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,000
This is...

750
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,840
Sir,

751
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,320
what time is it?

752
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,859
Fourth Young Lady,

753
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,040
it's the hour of Yin.

754
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,840
Fourth Young Lady?

755
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,840
They're troops from Futing.

756
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,840
If I'm not mistaken,

757
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,419
they should be the Ding Army.

758
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,880
What is the Ding Army doing at Hanzhou?

759
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,560
We can talk later.

760
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:32,120
(Yuzhou)

761
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,979
Show me your travel permit.

762
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,110
Where are you delivering to?

763
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,040
The marketplace.

764
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,120
Thank you.

765
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,859
Seventh Master, outlaws have been
running rampant in Yuzhou City lately.

766
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,960
To enter the city, we need
a travel permit.

767
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,880
We left in a hurry.

768
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,760
We don't have any travel permit.

769
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,680
Su Lan, I predict that someone
has notified them to let us pass.

770
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,040
Tell Gao Shen to come.

771
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:07,880
Young Lady?

772
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,000
Later, tell the troops

773
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:12,880
that the officials of the Ministry
of Rites are returning to the Capital.

774
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:13,979
We're passing by the city.

775
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,060
See if they can let us pass.

776
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,850
There's nothing wrong
with the goods, right?

777
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,000
Nope.

778
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:21,240
Sir, can you please allow
our lord to pass by the city?

779
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,539
Who's your lord?

780
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,840
Dou Shishu, a court official
of the Ministry of Rites.

781
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,500
Dou Shishu of the Ministry of Rites?

782
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,680
Indeed.

783
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,840
Let them pass! Hurry!

784
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,080
Get out of the way!

785
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,640
I've never seen such a grand scene

786
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,680
whenever I pass by
Yuzhou City in the past.

787
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,840
What's going on?

788
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,980
Fifth Master, I heard from them
that their superior ordered them to do so.

789
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,290
They're prioritizing Dou Shishu
of the Ministry of Rites.

790
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,720
Is that so?

791
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,000
Trust me.

792
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,360
This has nothing to do with us.

793
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,059
Fourth Young Lady,

794
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,360
the wheel is stuck in the mud.

795
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,080
Why did we stop?

796
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,090
Fourth Young Lady's carriage
is stuck in the mud.

797
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,880
Someone! There's a robbery!

798
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,080
Ms. Longevity!

799
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,120
Lend us a hand! Hurry!

800
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,640
One, two, three!

801
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,240
One, two, three!

802
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,240
One, two, three!

803
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,160
You guys are?

804
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,080
We're villagers from the village nearby.

805
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,619
The village path is uneven.

806
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,579
Many carriages

807
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,560
get stuck here whenever it rains.

808
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,800
We're just here
to help people like you all out.

809
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,160
Thank you, everyone.

810
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,579
Su Lan,

811
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,659
distribute money to them.

812
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,160
Please take them as our thanks.

813
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,659
We don't do it for the rewards.

814
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,040
We're only doing it to help people.

815
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,320
More of our men are ahead.

816
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,360
Fourth Young Lady,
may you have a smooth trip.

817
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,299
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

818
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,440
Let's go.

819
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,840
How did they know
that you're Fourth Young Lady?

820
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:26,080
Stop talking. Get in the carriage.

821
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,379
I rarely leave the city.

822
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,960
Now, it seems like the world
is peaceful and prosperous indeed.

823
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,440
Peaceful and prosperous?

824
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,440
All of them are here
because of your daughter.

825
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,280
Where did she make acquaintances
with these boorish men?

826
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,960
Fourth Young Lady is kind.

827
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,180
She's blessed by the heavens
no matter where she goes.

828
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,120
Shishu, you must be joking.

829
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,440
Why would Shougu know people like them?

830
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,280
Let's continue.

831
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:07,880
(Cui's Residence)

832
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,920
Shougu.

833
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,280
Shishu.

834
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,400
Don't you intend to visit Mother?

835
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,360
You still wish to stay at the manor?

836
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:26,790
Are you disregarding your duties
at the Ministry of Revenue?

837
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,160
But Mother is still sick.

838
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,160
We aren't physicians.

839
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,900
Do you think
she'll recover from our visit?

840
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,030
It'll be fine as long as Dou Zhao
and her mother look after her.

841
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,280
Father, Fifth Uncle, I'll head inside
to visit Grandmother first.

842
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,160
Since you've already signed
the marriage certificate,

843
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,200
from now on, you need
to stick to your womanly duties

844
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,960
and wait for your marriage.

845
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,480
Marriage certificate?

846
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,320
Didn't your father tell you about it?

847
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,480
When you were in Futing,

848
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:57,480
your parents had already signed
the marriage certificate on your behalf.

849
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,440
It was an emergency.

850
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,850
Initially, I wanted to discuss it
with you after your return.

851
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,000
But I didn't expect Yingxue

852
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,880
to bring back the signed
marriage certificate already.

853
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,240
Shougu.

854
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:15,560
The fifth and seventh son
of the Dou Family are heartless.

855
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,130
Your Lordship, they aren't
as compassionate as you.

856
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,060
You escorted Fourth Young Lady
all the way back,

857
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,960
yet you didn't even say hi to her.

858
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,400
Since she said she wasn't
willing to see me again,

859
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,440
there's no need to bother her.

860
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,560
But it's good that I can help her
see her grandmother

861
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,280
sooner.

862
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,040
Zhao,

863
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,720
you've returned safely.

864
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,400
I can rest at ease now.

865
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:06,179
Song Mo murdered his father and brother
just this year.

866
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,980
Could it be that there were other reasons
for his drastic change

867
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,180
in character other than
Duke of Ding's wrongful death?

868
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,859
My bodyguards are in danger.

869
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,659
And, Mother died not long ago.

870
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:15,939
(Duke of Ying's Residence)
Since I'm cornered,

871
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,560
what I require now

872
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:20,040
is the ability to wield a sword.
