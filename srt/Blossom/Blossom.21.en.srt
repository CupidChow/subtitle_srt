1
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,080
If the household keeps spending
without income,

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,790
no matter how wealthy we are,
we'll run out of money.

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,559
That's why my mother asked
my grandfather

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,959
to get His Lordship a position
at the North Warden's Office

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,919
as the Deputy Commander.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,060
(Appointment Letter)

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,860
This is the appointment letter.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,159
I wanted to share this piece of news

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,500
together with the Duke and you.

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,190
That's more like it.

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,759
Remember this well.

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,939
As a wife,

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,639
the greatest virtue

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,300
is to help your husband succeed
in his career.

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,660
Do you understand?

16
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,199
His Lordship was supposed
to collect this appointment letter

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,849
at the Ministry of Personnel in person.

18
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,380
But my grandfather already got it.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,879
His Lordship only needs to meet
the one from the Ministry

20
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,220
to take up the post.

21
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,380
All right.

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,839
You must never forget

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,820
to remind him about this appointment.

24
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,460
I won't.

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,919
My Lord,

26
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,439
the sky is about to clear up.

27
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,620
Why are you packing up
the paintings in a rush?

28
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,399
I've made plans with Youming
to do landscape painting in Jiaozhou.

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,479
What?

30
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,719
Are you planning a long trip?

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,370
You can't go.

32
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,450
Grandfather has arranged a meeting
with the Ministry of Personnel.

33
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,500
You must meet with them.

34
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,460
Let's discuss the meeting

35
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,820
when I get back.

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,980
I'm leaving now.

37
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,780
My Lord,

38
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,639
aren't you going to ask
what it is about?

39
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,159
Grandfather secured a position for you.

40
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,759
It's a position at the Warden's Office.

41
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,659
He'll be leaving for Liaodong
in a few days.

42
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,009
We must meet

43
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,359
to finalize the details.

44
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,500
Ming,

45
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,340
I've already made plans
to go landscape painting.

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,940
If I don't go,
I'll be breaking my promise.

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,860
Just wait until I return.

48
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,900
My Lord.

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,959
Sister-in-law hopes

50
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,639
you can rise in your career.

51
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,300
If you don't take up this position,
she'll start complaining again.

52
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,620
Just let her complain.

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,220
It's not worth being a corrupt official
who seeks power.

54
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,190
My Lord!

55
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,060
My mother begged my grandfather
for several days to secure this position.

56
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,020
Ming,

57
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,060
don't you know me?

58
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,300
I've never cared
for titles or official positions.

59
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,839
Are you forcing me

60
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,300
to become someone I despise?

61
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,380
My Lord!

62
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,239

64
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,140
(Yizhi Hall)

65
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,670
You've been reviewing these ledgers
for several days.

66
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,219
You should get some rest.

67
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,360
Let me help you do it.

68
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,200
Are you sure?

69
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,520
Inventory?

70
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,250
This is the inventory for my ledgers.

71
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,460
My ledgers are over there.

72
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,660
(Ledgers)

73
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,580
You have so many businesses?

74
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,940
How did you manage to keep it hidden?

75
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,220
Do you know Mr. Zhaoning
from the Capital?

76
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,959
Of course.

77
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,679
Mr. Zhaoning's businesses
are all over the Capital.

78
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,820
Everyone knows that.

79
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,279
Mr. Zhaoning has a name,

80
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,319
properties, and a family lineage.

81
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,420
But this person doesn't exist.

82
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,940
How did you know?

83
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,540
Don't tell me you're...

84
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,700
I have too many businesses

85
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,220
and no one to trust.

86
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,660
To avoid drawing attention,

87
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,879
I registered all my businesses

88
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,100
under Mr. Zhaoning's name.

89
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,439
So no matter how people investigate,

90
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,060
they can't trace it back to me.

91
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,420
When Wang Yingxue married my father,

92
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,260
my mother passed away.

93
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,490
My grandmother wanted
to give me something to rely on,

94
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,159
so she asked both the Dou Family
and the Wang Family

95
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,660
to give me three thousand taels each.

96
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,759
Later, I moved to the manor
in the countryside

97
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,380
to live with my grandmother.

98
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,940
But I couldn't spend the money
without making some.

99
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,199
So I invested the money

100
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,940
in the Futing's sea trade.

101
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,020
Thanks to the Ding Army
for eliminating the pirates.

102
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,359
Since then,

103
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,159
my business has flourished,

104
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,620
growing bigger and bigger.

105
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,580
What's the matter?

106
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,220
The happier you talk about it,

107
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,500
the sadder I feel

108
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,100
about not meeting you earlier.

109
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,780
Since you were young,
you grew up enduring hardships

110
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,380
with no one to rely on.

111
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,180
When we first met,

112
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,540
I even bullied you.

113
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,380
I should be punished for that.

114
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,060
I'll hold you to that later.

115
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,559
I'll note it down in the ledger.

116
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,820
I'll do it now.

117
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,660
Yes, do it now.

118
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,260
You don't have to write
with your right hand anymore.

119
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,940
You can switch back to your left hand.

120
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,020
In Yizhi Hall,

121
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,740
feel free to do as you please.

122
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,220
You're so good to me.

123
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,540
I don't even know how to repay you.

124
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,020
How about

125
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,380
I give you half my wealth?

126
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,620
That's not right.

127
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,860
Your father has only just started
to approve of me.

128
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,279
If I take half your wealth,

129
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,900
won't he turn against me?

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,680
I'll go to the kitchen and make you
a bowl of calming herbal soup.

131
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,740
Come back soon.

Don't go inside.

140
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,500
Ms. Longevity

141
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,919
was up all night.

142
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,999
Let her sleep a little longer.

143
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,420
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

144
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,929
Let's go.

145
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:21,799
One more thing.

146
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,999
Instruct the kitchen
to prepare chicken soup

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,279
and pigeon soup

148
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,500
for her to regain her strength.

149
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,940
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

150
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,140
Did they...

151
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,560
- Do you have any other instructions?
- Do you have any other instructions?

152
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,039
The bed was also dirty last night.

153
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,300
When Ms. Longevity wakes up,

154
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,079
tidy up and change the bedding.

155
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,580
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

156
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,380
- Little Lord...
- We're having Little Lord soon.

157
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,170
It could be a Little Young Lady.

158
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,889
Madam,

159
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,599
we're done changing the bedding.

160
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,140
We'll take our leave, then.

161
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,580
All right.

162
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,079
Why

163
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,740
did you wake me up so late?

164
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,719
His Lordship ordered us not
to disturb you.

165
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,340
He wanted you to sleep in.

166
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,540
How improper.

167
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,420
I have a pile of ledgers to review.

168
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,260
Plus, we're staying at Yizhi Hall.

169
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,660
If this gets out,

170
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,779
there will surely be gossip again.

171
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,950
Everything is fine
between you and His Lordship.

172
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,210
You don't need to worry
about such things anymore.

173
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,199
She's intelligent,

174
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,820
and they are so perfectly matched.

175
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,199
She brought so many dowries.

176
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,660
No one in the Capital can match that.

177
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,540
No wonder His Lordship holds
Her Ladyship in such high regard.

178
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,759
I heard

179
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,319
His Lordship and Her Ladyship
were up until dawn.

180
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,660
The lights in their room
didn't go out until almost dawn.

181
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,980
Madam, the soup is ready.

182
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,140
Soup?

183
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,180
Chicken soup.

184
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,820
Pigeon soup.

185
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,900
Did he tell you to prepare these too?

186
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,740
He even had the bed linens
cleaned separately.

187
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,380
Why?

188
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,719
The servants are all saying

189
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,839
that you and His Lordship
are very affectionate.

190
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,599
They estimate there might be a baby
on the way soon.

191
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,999
What nonsense.

192
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,159
It's because I was too tired

193
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,060
from reviewing ledgers last night.

194
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,940
As for the bed linens,

195
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,460
I don't know why he did that.

196
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,500
Song Yantang is ruining my reputation!

197
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,599
Young Lady,

198
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,799
you're his wife now.

199
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,479
How is this ruining your reputation?

200
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,559
But we...

201
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,119
We were reviewing the ledgers,

202
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,759
nothing else.

203
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,599
I understand.

204
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,559
Next time, when you
and His Lordship review ledgers,

205
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,159
we'll make sure not to disturb you.

206
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,279
Reviewing ledgers means
reviewing ledgers.

207
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,319
It doesn't imply anything else.

208
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,439
Madam,

209
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,460
the more you try to explain,
the worse it sounds.

210
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,479
I understand it now.

211
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,519
So reviewing ledgers

212
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,799
is just a cover

213
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,359
for a pleasant company.

214
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,639
What are you talking about?

215
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,679
You're getting more and more shameless,

216
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,940
- aren't you?
- Oh, please forgive me.

217
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,660
What are you all chatting about
so happily?

218
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,140
Have a seat.

219
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,540
Su Lan,

220
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,500
serve the soup to His Lordship.

221
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,420
Yes, Madam.

222
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,580
Another bowl.

223
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,980
Another one.

224
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,260
- My dear...
- You're busy with official duties.

225
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,780
This morning, you instructed
the servants to prepare the soup

226
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,180
and took the time to worry
about the bedding.

227
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,700
With such thoughtfulness,

228
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,340
you should have more of the soup.

229
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,540
Have another bowl.

230
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,780
It's all right.

231
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,220
Just have some more.

232
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,919
Fill it up.

233
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,060
Yes, Madam.

234
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,980
Here you go.

235
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,140
I'll tell the kitchen not
to make too much next time.

236
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,359
His Lordship didn't report for duty?

237
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,879
I heard he's gone on a trip.

238
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,060
She even helped him pack.

239
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,260
Bring Dou Ming here.

240
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,540
Yes, Your Grace.

241
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,780
Sister-in-law.

242
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,100
So tell me what happened.

243
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,740
His Lordship has a stubborn temper.

244
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,839
I hope you can persuade him.

245
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,639
You can't even handle your own husband!

246
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,580
What kind of mistress are you?

247
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,519
You don't have any money.

248
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,300
You can't even support your husband.

249
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,479
Tell me.

250
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,359
What's the point of the Wei Family

251
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,740
to have a daughter-in-law like you?

252
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,119
The family's prosperity depends

253
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,900
on the lady of the house.

254
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,900
Look at Dou Zhao!

255
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,070
Boxes and boxes of gold and silver

256
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,990
are being moved
to the Duke of Ying's Residence.

257
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,500
And look at you!

258
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,460
Do you resemble the lady of the house?

259
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,380
Well, it's not surprising.

260
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,020
The apple doesn't fall far
from the tree.

261
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,559
You're just like your mother!

262
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,700
Sister-in-law,

263
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,839
you can criticize me.

264
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,980
But don't insult my mother!

265
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,380
She dared to do those disgraceful things

266
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,180
but couldn't bear
to let others talk about it?

267
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,660
You must have learned
the habit of talking back

268
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,980
from your mother, right?

269
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,700
From now on,

270
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,540
you should follow me

271
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,300
and learn some rules.

272
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,740
His Lordship is not at home.

273
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,420
Learning the rules can wait

274
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,159
until His Lordship returns.

275
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,300
Why?

276
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,820
As the Duchess of Jing,

277
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,039
I can't teach you?

278
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,799
Madam, say it directly
if you're not happy with something.

279
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,380
Why do you have to humiliate...

280
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,240
How dare you interrupt?

281
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,650
What right do you have to hit her?

282
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,460
I'm hitting the servant!

283
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,260
Since you are a daughter-in-law
of the Wei Family,

284
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,620
you must follow the Wei Family's rules.

285
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,380
Madam,

286
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,580
are you all right?

287
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,759
With your care,

288
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,100
I'm fine.

289
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,780
But Madam, you have to do the morning
and evening greetings every day.

290
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,060
You're going to have a hard time.

291
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,279
Let Wenxiang accompany me

292
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,300
to the greetings every day.

293
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,660
So as not to anger Sister-in-law.

294
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,080
What kind of sense is it
for a married daughter of the family

295
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,660
to return and impose her own rules?

296
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,559
The Duchess of Jing

297
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,639
is clearly unhappy with her own life.

298
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,940
So she's tormenting you

299
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,780
as the Duke is away.

300
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,900
It's all right.

301
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,100
I can take it.

302
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,740
The sound of that abacus has been
clattering on for over ten days now.

303
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,020
I can hear that annoying sounds
even in my dreams.

304
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,420
When will it ever end?

305
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,380
What is it again?

306
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,220
(Lofty Morality)

307
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,260
Why are you here?

308
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,660
I heard Yantang's wife is expecting.

309
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,319
What nonsense is this?

310
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,790
They've only been married a few days.

311
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,420
The imperial physician from the palace
already checked her pulse,

312
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,470
and said she was expecting twins,
a boy and a girl.

313
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,540
That's right.

314
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,639
Who said that?

315
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,439
It came from the wet nurse

316
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,479
of Imperial Physician Li's

317
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,420
third son's second aunt.

318
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,060
Lyu Zheng!

319
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,700
Someone!

320
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,140
Bring Butler Lyu here!

321
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,799
Yes, Your Grace.

322
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,540
The entire neighborhood...

323
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,759
I mean

324
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,620
half of the capital is saying

325
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,580
His Lordship and his wife
are very affectionate.

326
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,599
Every day, he instructed the kitchen

327
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,740
to prepare soup to nourish her.

328
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,020
They're saying...

329
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,660
What did they say?

330
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,140
They're saying the Duke's household
will soon have a baby.

331
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,559
You fool!

332
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,860
Calm down, Your Grace.

333
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,599
I asked you to investigate
about the money.

334
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,020
Yet, you bring me these baseless rumors!

335
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,399
It's not entirely baseless.

336
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,599
Think about it.

337
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,620
If Her Ladyship gives birth to a son,

338
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,919
wouldn't Second Young Master
have even less hope?

339
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,340
Get out of my sight.

340
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,759
I said, get lost!

341
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,180
Get lost!

342
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,060
Come back here!

343
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,340
That matchmaker was certain

344
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,879
that Dou Zhao was nothing more
than a boorish country woman,

345
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,340
headstrong and unruly.

346
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,700
But now it's clear

347
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,340
there's something suspicious
about her background.

348
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,340
Go and dig deeper.

349
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,380
Find out exactly who she really is.

350
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,180
Yes, Your Grace.

351
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,039
(Tea)

352
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,759
Dou Zhao is the richest person
in Zhending.

353
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,159
She has countless businesses

354
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,479
and is extremely wealthy.

355
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,519
That's right.

356
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,660
Wait.

357
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,510
Didn't you say she lost all her money

358
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,879
and handed over her businesses
to her stepmother to manage?

359
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,279
You heard wrong.

360
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,460
The businesses handed to her stepmother
are the ones losing money.

361
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,900
On Fourth Young Lady Dou's wedding day,

362
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,719
the dowry procession stretched
for miles.

363
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,879
It was grander

364
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,279
than the weddings of many noble families

365
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,719
in the Capital.

366
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,079
Fourth Young Lady Dou is known
for her kindness.

367
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,359
Everyone in Zhending knows her.

368
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,439
That year, Zhending had heavy rains.

369
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,519
If Fourth Young Lady Dou

370
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,220
hadn't waived some of the rent
at her manor,

371
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,399
many families would have been forced

372
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,679
to sell their children.

373
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,399
But you said she was a shrew.

374
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,420
You called her an ingrate.

375
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,519
You misheard us.

376
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,839
Madam Wang is the shrew and the ingrate.

377
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,199
Fourth Young Lady Dou

378
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,479
was raised well
and is known for her filial piety.

379
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,500
Everyone in the area knows that.

380
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,060
Young Master Pang disguised himself

381
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,820
as a bandit

382
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,159
to force her into marriage.

383
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,380
It was like a toad dreaming
of dining on caviar!

384
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,359
Wasn't it Fourth Young Lady Dou

385
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,220
who forced herself
to marry Young Master Pang?

386
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,100
You got it wrong.

387
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,079
Not at all.

388
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,479
Fourth Young Lady Dou is upright

389
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,959
and generous.

390
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,119
Everyone in the area

391
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,479
- has benefited from her kindness.
- That's right.

392
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,420
Young Master Pang even dared to file
a complaint at the county office.

393
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,519
But in the end, he got punished himself.

394
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,940
There's no mistake in that.

395
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,980
I get it now!

396
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,060
You all conspired to deceive me!

397
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,780
No...

398
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,580
Who is this disgusting thing asking

399
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,340
about Fourth Young Lady Dou?

400
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,700
We're from the Duke of Ying's Residence.

401
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,500
Who are you?

402
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,540
How dare you kidnap me?

403
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,420
How dare you impersonate members
of the Duke of Ying's household?

404
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,020
Slap him.

405
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,079
Mercy, Old Madam!

406
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,999
I was just trying to make a living

407
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,719
and only following orders.

408
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,460
Then I'll ask you one more time.

409
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,980
Are you
from the Duke of Ying's Residence?

410
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,599
Yes, I am.

411
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,799
We're from the Duke of Ying's Residence.

412
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,940
Slap him!

413
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,620
Never mind.

414
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,860
Stubborn fool.

415
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,199
Drown him in the pond?

416
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,340
Yes, Old Madam.

417
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,220
No, don't!

418
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,180
I'm not
from the Duke of Ying's Residence.

419
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,820
The Duke of Ying's household and I
are sworn enemies!

420
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,300
Now, that's more like it.

421
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,660
Let him go.

422
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,540
You didn't reveal

423
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,740
that I sent you there, did you?

424
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,340
Your Grace,

425
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,340
I would rather die

426
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,980
than divulge even a word
about the Duke of Ying's Residence.

427
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,599
I only said I was a matchmaker
from far away,

428
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,740
here to propose a marriage.

429
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,900
So, is Dou Zhao truly
the richest person in Zhending?

430
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,919
The entire area around Zhending
has benefited from her generosity?

431
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,359
Yes.

432
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,919
Fourth Young Lady Dou

433
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,719
is not some country girl.

434
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,180
They're all in cahoots.

435
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,900
I risked my life

436
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,980
to bring this news to you,
Your Grace.

437
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,060
I fell for it!

438
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,930
I can't believe that I,
a dignified Duke,

439
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,449
was deceived by this rebellious child.

440
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,319
I personally handed over a golden goose

441
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,859
to this brat's hand, which allows him
to train his private army,

442
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,099
win people's hearts,

443
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,209
and have the money

444
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,289
to support his spies

445
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,220
when he had none earlier!

446
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,879
I've practically prepared my neck

447
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,940
for this brat to chop off!

448
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,300
Is there anyone more foolish
than me in this world?

449
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,660
No.

450
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,220
Your Grace! Your Grace!

451
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,999
Someone! Help!

452
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,380
(Duke of Jining's Residence)

453
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,940
What's wrong? Can't stand up straight?

454
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,780
Feeling wronged?

455
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,300
As the lady of the house,

456
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,660
you need to act like one.

457
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,119
You can't just do

458
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,500
whatever you want.

459
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,879
Forgive me, Sister-in-law.

460
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,260
I was careless for a moment...

461
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,420
I think you've been spoiled by Peijin!

462
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,599
You can't even keep him in line.

463
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,719
You promised an appointment,
but it turned into a complete mess.

464
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,919
Now you can't even handle
a pair of chopsticks.

465
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,780
What can you even do?

466
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,620
You are right.

467
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,900
I heard from my daughter
that you've fallen ill.

468
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,860
So I came to visit.

469
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,899
How are you feeling?

470
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,640
It's just a minor illness.

471
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,810
I dare not trouble you.

472
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,999
(I've been courteous)

473
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,500
(and respectful.)

474
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,340
(Why is he still scowling?)

475
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,799
(Was he involved in the plan)

476
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,060
(to have Dou Zhao marry
into the Song Family?)

477
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,340
(How much does he know?)

478
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,159
(Could he be the mastermind)

479
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,860
(behind the whole affair?)

480
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,820
No matter how upset Your Grace gets,

481
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,600
His Lordship always speaks kindly.

482
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,860
True filial piety isn't just
about obedience.

483
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,540
But also respect and demeanor.

484
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,820
That's rare, truly rare.

485
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,820
Your Grace.

486
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,820
Let me do it.

487
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,599
Your Grace,

488
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,860
you must take good care of your health.

489
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,060
Do you and my unfilial son
get along well?

490
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,260
Naturally.

491
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,100
With Yantang being so capable,

492
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,900
you should take it easy

493
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,380
and enjoy life.

494
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,860
Let Yantang handle things.

495
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,380
(Is he implying
I should give up my Duke title?)

496
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,199
As for Ms. Longevity,

497
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,799
I know my daughter well.

498
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,900
She is a well-behaved
and sensible child.

499
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,140
She has been preparing medicine

500
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,700
for you in the kitchen
these past few days.

501
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,959
I am fine.

502
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,100
It's all right.

503
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,260
This...

504
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,420
Your Grace,

505
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,740
take good care of yourself.

506
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,220
You must take the medicine on time

507
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,940
to get better.

508
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,780
I'll go and check on my daughter.

509
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,220
Lyu Zheng.

510
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,900
Lyu Zheng, where are you?

511
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,359
Your Grace,

512
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,580
I'm here.

513
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,999
Has Dou Zhao been preparing
my medicine all this time?

514
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,239
Yes, she knows medicine.

515
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,620
She has been personally preparing it.

516
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,340
You fool!

517
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,580
How could you let her do that?

518
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,860
Are you trying to get me killed sooner?

519
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,420
Remember this.

520
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,820
From now on,

521
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,980
prepare my medicine yourself.

522
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,140
Yes, Your Grace.

523
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,780
Come back here!

524
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,900
Throw away all the herbs

525
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,540
we have now

526
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,719
and buy new ones.

527
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,860
Yes, Your Grace.

528
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,900
Gentler.

529
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,060
The "Lessons for Women" teaches

530
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,460
humility, respect, proper conduct,
and self-discipline.

531
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,020
Madam Jin,

532
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,100
keep an eye on her for me.

533
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,940
If she dares to slack off,

534
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,799
you can punish her on my behalf.

535
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,940
Yes, Your Grace.

536
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,180
Stand up straight against the wall.

537
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,359
Heads up.

538
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,500
Tuck in your stomach.

539
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,740
Straighten your legs.

540
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,220
"Lessons for Women" emphasizes

541
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,020
humility, respect, proper conduct,
and self-discipline.

542
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,020
Open your eyes.

543
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,300
I said, lean against the wall.

544
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,900
Don't even think about slacking off.

545
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,620
I've got this ruler ready for you.

546
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,919
Madam! Madam!

547
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,300
What is it?

548
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,660
She's...

549
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,700
Madam, look!

550
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,119
If I had known she was pregnant,

551
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,879
I wouldn't have punished her.

552
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,740
How do I explain this now?

553
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,159
This is Tingyu's first child.

554
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,039
Madam,

555
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,799
how is this your fault?

556
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,839
Dou Ming has
her wet nurse attending to her.

557
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,959
Is Madam Zhou here only for a display?

558
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,300
Whether she's pregnant or not,
they should have known better.

559
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,839
You're right.

560
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,199
I've always had the family's
best interests at heart.

561
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,799
I'm not at fault.

562
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,109
But Dou Ming knew

563
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,300
she was pregnant

564
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,039
and didn't say a word about it.

565
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,940
Now, she's had a miscarriage.

566
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,060
This is the Wei Family's
flesh and blood.

567
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,820
It's infuriating.

568
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,079
Madam,

569
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,639
you have a kind heart.

570
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,479
But we can't let the Dou Family

571
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,479
throw this blame

572
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,679
onto our family.

573
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,879
Remember, it was your kind heart

574
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,079
that allowed Fifth Young Lady

575
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,820
to marry the Duke
in place of Fourth Young Lady.

576
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,860
As the Duchess of Jing,

577
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,060
I can't make the same mistake twice.

578
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,969
Write them a visiting card.

579
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,380
I need to go to the Dou's Residence

580
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,740
to demand an explanation.

581
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,679
Madam,

582
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,139
I failed to look after the young lady,

583
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,919
causing the tragic loss

584
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,060
of her unborn son.

585
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,260
This isn't your fault.

586
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,860
It's that greedy Wei Tingzhen's fault.

587
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,220
This is all her doing.

588
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,300
Now, the gap in the loan
can't be filled.

589
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,500
She's desperate

590
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,580
because she can't get
the dividends promised to her.

591
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,900
If it weren't
for Dou Zhao telling Master,

592
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,300
how could it not be filled?

593
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,420
This won't do.

594
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,580
We need to think of a solution.

595
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,980
Otherwise, Ming's days

596
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,380
will be even harder.

597
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,199
If it wasn't

598
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,460
for Ming's happiness,

599
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,500
I wouldn't have taken
such desperate measures.

600
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,500
Now, if we can't fill this gap,

601
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,380
not only will that greedy woman,

602
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,460
but even the Cangbei Gang

603
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,620
won't spare us.

604
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,999
Did your grandmother send

605
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,860
these flowers and plants from the manor?

606
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,180
She specifically instructed me

607
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,740
to take good care of them

608
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,940
so they can take root, grow,

609
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,340
and blossom in the capital.

610
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,860
Mother is so thoughtful.

611
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,820
I heard His Lordship personally helped
you transplant them.

612
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,839
Seeing you two support
each other like this

613
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,020
puts me at ease.

614
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,380
Father,

615
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,820
did something happen?

616
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,540
The family just reported

617
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,900
that Ming

618
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,999
had a miscarriage.

619
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,140
What?

620
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,740
You taught your daughter well!

621
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,260
Not only does she defy
her sister-in-law,

622
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,260
but she also hides her pregnancy

623
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,140
and harms the Wei Family's heir.

624
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,180
Take Ming back with you.

625
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,940
Our household is too small

626
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,580
to accommodate such a difficult person.

627
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:03,940
The nerve of you.

628
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,860
I haven't even asked you
for an explanation.

629
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,420
Yet, you're turning the tables

630
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,380
to accuse me first.

631
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,700
It was Wei Tingyu
who agreed to this marriage.

632
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,700
If he wants to break the engagement now,

633
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,820
he should be the one to speak up.

634
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,740
I've just arranged
a respectable post for him,

635
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,919
and now you want
to turn your back on us?

636
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,860
My brother dismissed all his concubines
for your daughter.

637
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,900
Who else in the Capital can do that?

638
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,500
I know exactly

639
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:35,430
what you're plotting.

640
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,020
Ming's child was lost

641
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,940
because of you.

642
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,220
If you can't give me
an explanation today,

643
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,719
we'll take this to the Shengtian Court.

644
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,940
Sure!

645
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,159
The Governor of Shengtian
can settle this too.

646
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,559
The agreement was
for the Fourth Young Lady to marry.

647
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,580
But the bride on that day
was Fifth Young Lady.

648
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,199
If you hadn't swapped the bride,

649
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,260
would this miscarriage have happened?

650
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,059
If Dou Zhao had married into our family,

651
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,199
there would be no trouble,

652
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,660
no jealousy, and no resentment.

653
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:07,060
Madam Wang, do you still remember

654
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,580
what you owe me?

655
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,039
Madam, the bride swap is one thing,

656
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,119
but the loan shark issue

657
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,220
cannot be taken to the authorities.

658
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,999
Dou Ming

659
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,700
has no demeanor as the head lady.

660
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,340
She defied her elders

661
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,119
and used the child to spite us.

662
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,180
With such a vicious heart,

663
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,119
even if we go to Shengtian Court,

664
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,479
- it will end up in a divorce!
- You!

665
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,260
Duchess of Jing,
your words are truly strange.

666
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,340
Why would Ming harm her own child?

667
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,580
As a woman,

668
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,839
don't you know that a miscarriage
is like a serious illness?

669
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,540
And one carelessness can be fatal?

670
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,540
Ming just married Duke of Jining,

671
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,100
and they are still in love.

672
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,180
Why would she risk her life?

673
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,300
Even a tiger doesn't eat its own cubs.

674
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,239
If it weren't
for the Duchess' punishments,

675
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,660
Her Ladyship wouldn't
have had a miscarriage.

676
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,220
You insolent servant!

677
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,380
Who gave you the right to speak?

678
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:18,080
So the Duke of Jining's household
has such strict rules.

679
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,900
To torment the daughter-in-law,

680
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,870
you don't even care
about the family's heir?

681
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,020
That's...

682
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,140
That's just nonsense.

683
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,660
Our family already has few descendants.

684
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,740
Dou Ming was having Tingyu's child.

685
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,820
Why wouldn't my brother
and I don't want the child?

686
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,620
The child is lost,

687
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,199
and everyone thinks it's Ming's fault.

688
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,420
Duchess of Jing,
you're aggressively assertive.

689
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,700
Those who know might think

690
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,980
you're concerned about the lineage.

691
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,460
But those who don't might think

692
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,300
you're taking the chance
to humiliate your sister-in-law.

693
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,830
- Dou Ming had a miscarriage.
- No, it's not like that.

694
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,700
The Dou Family haven't said anything.

695
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,759
Yet you keep insisting on going

696
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,380
to the Shengtian Court.

697
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,679
Conveniently, Governor Dai is an old
acquaintance of my Fifth Uncle.

698
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,140
Let's go ask for his judgment.

699
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,599
- I... No...
- Su Lan.

700
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,439
Yes, Young Lady.

701
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,580
Send someone

702
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,100
to the Shengtian Court.

703
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,500
Yes.

704
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,380
No...

705
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,580
Madam!

706
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,559
Madam!

707
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,660
Why aren't you sending a physician?

708
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,340
Since the Duchess is unwell,

709
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,100
she should rest in the warm room
next door.

710
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,380
We will discuss this another day.

711
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,700
Madam...

712
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,900
Swapping the best for the worst.

713
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,260
Unbelievable!

714
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,740
Ming was determined
to marry into this family.

715
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,340
And I already knew this would happen.

716
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,460
Ming has been obedient since childhood

717
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,760
and insists on marrying
as your replacement.

718
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,500
She endured her sister-in-law's torment

719
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,260
and now suffered a miscarriage.

720
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,740
All of this

721
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,079
is because of you.

722
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,300
I came here for two reasons.
First, for the Dou Family,

723
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,540
and second, to avoid making Father sad.

724
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,100
If you repay kindness with ingratitude,

725
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,020
then it's my own fault for interfering.

726
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,700
What a hypocrite.

727
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,620
Let's go

728
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,140
and bring Ming home.

729
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,860
Why are you here?

730
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,420
I've been following you
since you arrived here.

731
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,100
At first, I was worried.

732
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,460
But seeing you handle the situation
with such eloquence and ease,

733
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,140
I am now at ease.

734
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,599
Would I suffer grievances

735
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,060
in my own home?

736
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,239
No.

737
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,980
I just love seeing
my wife handle matters so skillfully.

738
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,100
Don't worry.

739
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,959
These are just disputes
among the women in the household.

740
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,460
I can handle it.

741
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,980
This is Wei Tingyu's problem.

742
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,940
I've already sent someone to find him.

743
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,820
Yantang,

744
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,300
I want to see Dou Ming.

745
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,300
Madam, you should drink a little.

746
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,220
Your health is most important.

747
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,239
I'll feed her.

748
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,380
Madam.

749
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,140
Here.

750
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,040
What's the matter?

751
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,980
I just faced
your sister-in-law's temper at home,

752
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,140
and now I have to see yours.

753
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,340
I know what you want to say.

754
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,020
No need to say more.

755
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,980
A miscarriage is like a serious illness.

756
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,700
A simple bowl of sweet water

757
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,500
cannot restore her health.

758
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,460
It might leave side effects.

759
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,070
Ming,

760
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,980
why not come back with me?

761
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,900
I'll help you recover well.

762
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,500
You're the only one

763
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,420
who treats this impoverished household
like treasure.

764
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,119
Ming,

765
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,620
no need to worry.

766
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,180
I will take care of everything.

767
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,700
The most important thing

768
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,540
is to recuperate well, understand?

769
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,180
Mother.

770
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,380
Mother.

771
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,420
Take this money.

772
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,020
Buy some tonics for Ming

773
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,399
and keep the rest for yourself.

774
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,399
Remember,

775
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,140
don't give all of it to Ming,

776
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,180
or that greedy woman will take it away.

777
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,919
Yes, Madam.

778
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,839
But Madam,

779
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,199
this money is
for filling the gap in the loan.

780
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,660
If the Cangbei Gang
doesn't get their money...

781
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,000
She's right.

782
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,430
I'm worried that the untrustworthy ones
might come looking for us.

783
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,719
If we can't get rid of them,

784
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,060
it will be a big problem.

785
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,399
Use it for Ming first.

786
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,100
I'll figure out the rest.

787
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,140
(Duke of Jining's Residence)

788
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,319
Zhao...

789
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,460
Ming.

790
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,740
Wei Tingyu is truly unreliable.

791
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,580
How could he let this happen to you?

792
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,759
If he hadn't let his sister control
the household affairs,

793
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,420
this wouldn't have happened.

794
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,980
I don't blame him.

795
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,780
His Lordship has always preferred
the vast outdoors.

796
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,460
Being confined in this house

797
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,740
always makes him unhappy.

798
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,860
You've told me

799
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,900
that His Lordship wasn't a good husband,

800
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,220
and the Duke of Jining's Residence
isn't a good place to settle.

801
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,180
But I always thought

802
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,500
that no matter
how difficult things were,

803
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,180
as long as the two of us were united,

804
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,260
we could live a good life
behind closed doors.

805
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,140
Do you regret it?

806
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,980
Divorce him, Ming.

807
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,020
This is your best chance to escape.

808
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,260
Zhao.

809
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,679
If you and Lord Song

810
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,500
ever find yourselves
in a similar situation,

811
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,660
what would you choose?

812
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,829
Lu Ming exhausted three horses

813
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:03,460
to find this scoundrel in Jiaozhou.
