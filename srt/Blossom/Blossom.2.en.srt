1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,460
(Capital City)

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:09,870
Zhao Si,

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,750
this is the Dou's Residence.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,320
I'm the clan leader

5
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,830
and Shiying's older brother.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,960
If you wish to attend the wedding,
do come.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,760
(Dou Shishu, Dou Family's Fifth Master)
Otherwise, do as you please.

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,300
(Zhao Si, Zhao Family's Eldest Son)
Do as I please?

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,120
My silly sister,

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,070
do you understand that now?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,640
When your husband was studying
in Chanxi,

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,150
your best friend took
very good care of him.

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,790
Now she's marrying into the Dou Family.

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,350
What kind of wedding is this?

15
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,300
Guqiu,

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,900
(Wang Yingxue)
you know

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,070
how I've struggled all these years
in Chanxi

18
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,430
and being treated with contempt.

19
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,280
Recently, my father was promoted.

20
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,280
I could've easily married into
a noble family.

21
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,060
But I value Shiying's kindness.

22
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,940
(Dou Shiying,
Dou Family's Seventh Master)

23
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,760
I'm willing to marry into the Dou Family
as a concubine

24
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,110
because of the deep bond
we shared as best friends.

25
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,120
It's normal for a man
to have multiple wives.

26
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,390
Rather than someone else,

27
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,480
why not let it be you and me
who understand each other?

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,840
Understand each other?

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,480
Is this how you repay my understanding?

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,750
You know she is my close friend.

31
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,590
You know he is my husband.

32
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,230
How could you…

33
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,280
Why not?

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,360
Scholars of Shiying's age

35
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,590
already have many children.

36
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,310
You've been married for almost ten years

37
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,540
and you only have a daughter.

38
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,680
If he doesn't take a concubine,

39
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,670
do you want to break

40
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,120
the Dou's bloodline?

41
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,230
Shishu,

42
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:53,940
stop it.

43
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,560
According to our law,

44
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,840
a concubine can only be taken
with the main wife's consent.

45
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,200
My sister has the right to not allow it.

46
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,480
Miss Wang's father, Wang Xingyi,

47
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,840
is the current Grand Secretary,
Wu Yifen's student.

48
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,640
He has just been promoted
to a fourth-rank official.

49
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,960
Marrying into the Wang family

50
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,350
would be a great help
to Shiying's career.

51
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,680
How could you not allow it?

52
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,400
So it turns out you think
the Zhao Family is insignificant

53
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,840
to be of any help.

54
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,680
Guqiu,

55
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,960
I never meant that.

56
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,630
A husband leads and his wife follows.

57
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,590
This is the natural order of things.

58
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,590
The Dou Family needs

59
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,070
this marriage.

60
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,750
Nonsense!

61
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,070
Over the years, how much money

62
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,240
did the Zhao Family contribute

63
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,190
to Dou Shiying's studies and career?

64
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,350
How much of that is shady?

65
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,240
Is that part of natural order too?

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,680
If you dare pressure my sister again,

67
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,470
I will submit a formal petition.

68
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,470
Zhao Si,

69
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,440
stop being reckless!

70
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,470
Are you willing

71
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,720
to destroy everything for your sister?

72
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,190
You can try me.

73
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,030
Times have changed.

74
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,870
If it comes to that,

75
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,470
let's see who has no way out.

76
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,400
I didn't lie to you, right?

77
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,870
Ms. Longevity, don't worry.

78
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,350
You can rely on my father.

79
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,560
This concerns the Dou clan's future.

80
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,590
Fifth Uncle won't give up easily.

81
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,840
We need to solve this quickly.

82
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,000
Or it'll be too late
when Wang Xingyi arrives.

83
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,560
I only wanted a place to belong.

84
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,870
I never expect to hurt my best friend

85
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,800
or put Shiying in a difficult spot.

86
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,680
Guqiu,

87
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,470
if you really can't forgive me,

88
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,470
then grant me a strip of white silk
so I can end my life.

89
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,560
Stop pretending.

90
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,590
If you really want to die,

91
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,030
take it.

92
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,960
Guqiu,

93
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,920
when did you become so cold-hearted?

94
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,800
Yingxue!

95
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,240
Throw it away.

96
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,440
- Yingxue.
- Let me die!

97
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,920
My love,

98
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,760
let me die!

99
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,660
Father.

100
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,400
Ms. Longevity?

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,270
I missed you.

102
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,160
Who is this lady on the floor?

103
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,120
Tell her

104
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,040
who is that woman to you.

105
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,910
She...

106
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,630
She is a guest here
to offer her congratulations.

107
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,910
Shiying...

108
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,950
Then why are both of you unhappy

109
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,310
because of this guest?

110
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,880
- We're not.
- We're not.

111
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,680
Father, Mother.

112
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,760
Ms. Tuo,

113
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,120
please escort this lady out first.

114
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,190
I wish to speak
with Father and Mother for a while.

115
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,200
Ah, that's right.

116
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,560
Since she is a guest,
let's send her off for now.

117
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,270
- After they're done talking,
- Please get up.

118
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,390
- we will inform her.
- I'm not leaving.

119
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,310
Come on, get up.

120
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,240
Let me go! I'm not leaving!

121
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,080
- She...
- Yingxue!

122
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,440
Yingxue.

123
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,390
I can't catch my breath.

124
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,480
Yingxue, it's all right. I'm right here.

125
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,600
You're having an asthma attack.

126
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,800
Yingxue developed asthma
after closely tending to me

127
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,240
when I had a cold.

128
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,150
Guqiu,

129
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,440
I can't just ignore her.

130
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,490
=Blossom=

131
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,300
(Adapted from the novel
"Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

132
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,340
=Episode 2=

133
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,300
(Perpetual Bloom)
Seventh Madam,

134
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,600
it's the main wife's duty to hold
the ceremony of taking a concubine.

135
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,240
Fifth Master had me send these over.

136
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,960
So please prepare accordingly.

137
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,920
My aunt hasn't agreed
to take a concubine yet.

138
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,940
Why should she prepare for it?

139
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,920
Get out! Leave.

140
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,880
Mother.

141
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,510
If you refuse to accept,

142
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,680
with Miss Wang's family background,

143
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,160
they would never allow her

144
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,630
to be an unacknowledged mistress.

145
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,120
Even if she were willing,

146
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,070
her father, Wang Xingyi,

147
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,310
would never agree.

148
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,360
If things drag on,
this matter will left unsolved.

149
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,470
Ms. Longevity,

150
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,040
why are you so mature for your age?

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,840
My father says

152
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,040
Uncle is a bad man.

153
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,920
You should divorce him

154
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,360
and save yourself from all this torment.

155
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,000
Divorce is always seen

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,750
as a trivial matter to a man.

157
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,710
But for Ms. Longevity and me,

158
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,040
it would mean a lifetime
of gossip and disgrace.

159
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,390
I can't ruin Ms. Longevity's future.

160
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,000
Besides, after a divorce,

161
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,280
children always belong to the husband.

162
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,560
How could I bear that?

163
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,310
I'm not afraid of anything else

164
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,110
but of you feeling tormented.

165
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,880
If you want to divorce,

166
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,560
I will go with you.

167
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,110
Uncle is well-versed in the law.

168
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,710
He will find a way to work this out.

169
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,190
I'll go and ask Uncle now.

170
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,350
I'll come with you.

171
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,950
Have the kitchen prepare tea
that soothes the lungs

172
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,400
and have someone clean
the room thoroughly.

173
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,550
Make sure no dust or lint remains.

174
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,600
Yes, Master.

175
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,470
It's no big deal, my love.

176
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:07,990
The pouch contains ephedra
that helps with breathing.

177
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,310
It works.

178
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:15,040
But the magnolias in the courtyard

179
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,760
are in full bloom.

180
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:19,950
That's right.

181
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,070
You can't come into contact with pollen.

182
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,110
Don't shake off the flowers.

183
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,640
- Please stop shaking them off.
- This side.

184
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,640
Why are you shaking off the flowers?

185
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,710
- Keep shaking them off.
- Please stop!

186
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,340
(Perpetual Bloom)
Stop it! Stop it!

187
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,230
Ignore her. Keep shaking them off.

188
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,160
Stop shaking them off! Stop it!

189
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:15,790
Madam.

190
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,470
Who told you to shake off the flowers?

191
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,880
I did.

192
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,600
Guqiu.

193
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,640
This is just a temporary measure.

194
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,760
Is taking a concubine also
a temporary measure?

195
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,070
Or

196
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,920
is the talk of heirs
and career advancement all lies?

197
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,350
But the truth is you
have feelings for her.

198
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,280
Am I right?

199
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:47,910
Guqiu,

200
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:49,280
Yingxue has asthma.

201
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,760
These flowers cannot stay.

202
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,070
Cannot stay, huh?

203
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,310
All these years,

204
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,560
I thought I was the only one

205
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,400
who could make you smile

206
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,920
and the only one
who could weigh on your heart.

207
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,440
But I was so wrong.

208
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,560
It turns out someone else can too.

209
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,230
I'm begging you.

210
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,520
Just this once.

211
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,830
Go.

212
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,950
Shake off the flowers.

213
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,310
I knew you would understand me, Guqiu.

214
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,160
Thank you, Guqiu.

215
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,190
Hurry!

216
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,520
- Shake off the flowers.
- Yes, Master.

217
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,360
Get rid of all the flowers.

218
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,000
Shake them off.

219
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,880
This side too.

220
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:08,790
Hurry.

221
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,230
This side and that side too.

222
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,920
Magnolias bloom without leaves.

223
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,520
When there are leaves,
there are no flowers.

224
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,280
They symbolize purity and loyalty,

225
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,070
just like you and me.

226
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,000
In this life,

227
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,680
you're my only one.

228
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,640
Be gentle.

229
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,280
Don't damage the branches.

230
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,680
They'll bloom again next year.

231
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,470
(The hibiscus blooms in the morning
and withers by evening.)

232
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,440
(I am no different from the flowers.)

233
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,550
Eat some.

234
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,160
Zhangru, I don't feel like eating.

235
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,950
This won't do.

236
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,920
Father told me

237
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,070
to take good care of you two.

238
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,230
Bad person! We don't need you to push.

239
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,950
Do you also think that I'm a bad man?

240
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,680
I don't know.

241
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,190
But you built this swing for Mother.

242
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,440
Will Miss Wang be the one
who rides it after this?

243
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,000
No.

244
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:46,190
This swing

245
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,680
will always belong to you and Guqiu.

246
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,280
No one else can have it.

247
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,590
It's already a bit cramped

248
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,920
when Zhangru and I sit on it together.

249
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,040
If Mother and Miss Wang sat on it,

250
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,830
how could they sit comfortably?

251
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,520
I know

252
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,800
that part of your heart is for Mother

253
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,560
and part for Miss Wang.

254
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,110
But have you ever asked yourself

255
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,280
who's more important?

256
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,310
Of course, it's you

257
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,880
and your mother.

258
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,920
Then why would you rather hurt Mother

259
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,560
to keep Miss Wang here?

260
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,950
Is… is taking her
as a concubine really the only way?

261
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,720
Bad person!

262
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,830
Ms. Longevity!

263
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,980
(Tranquility and Serenity)

264
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,830
Are you regretting it now?

265
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,640
Are you trying to settle this
with money?

266
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,310
If I must choose,

267
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,310
I truly cannot bear

268
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,160
to see both Guqiu
and Ms. Longevity heartbroken.

269
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,030
It's already too late.

270
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,280
Zou Er, tell him.

271
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,400
Yes.

272
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,120
Seventh Master,

273
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,750
the physician who treated Ms. Wang

274
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,720
says

275
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,230
her fainting wasn't
because of asthma alone.

276
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,070
She's been pregnant for over a month.

277
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,110
I've let both Guqiu

278
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:16,590
and Yingxue down.

279
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,040
But if you don't take her in,

280
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,280
you're dishonoring Father's memory.

281
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,280
Do you remember

282
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,110
the vow we made before his passing?

283
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,710
To expand our lineage

284
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,400
and restore the family's prestige.

285
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,950
I'm glad you still remember.

286
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,680
I've already lost two wives.

287
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,280
Even if I wanted to remarry,
there's no suitable family left.

288
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,190
All our hopes now rest on you.

289
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,040
I will treat your children

290
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,780
as my own and raise them with care.

291
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,000
Shiying,

292
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,680
take her as a concubine.

293
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,040
It's the perfect solution

294
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,640
for both your career and your lineage.

295
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,230
Something bad has happened!

296
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,280
Why is it so noisy?

297
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,640
Fifth Master, Seventh Master.

298
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,070
Seventh Madam is...

299
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,820
(Serene)

300
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,030
Madam...

301
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,680
Mother, why?

302
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:23,790
Madam...

303
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,280
Issue my orders.

304
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,480
Secure the gates

305
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,310
and make sure no word of this gets out.

306
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,310
At once, Seventh Master.

307
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,560
Master...

308
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,950
(The pristine magnolia,)

309
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,190
(untouched by the impurities
of the world.)

310
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,310
(My dear husband,)

311
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,560
(every flower that blooms)

312
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,280
(will eventually wither.)

313
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,710
(Our marital fate has come to an end.)

314
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:03,790
(I don't blame you.)

315
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,270
(Perpetual Bloom)
(The only thing I feel guilty of)

316
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,320
(and cannot let go of)

317
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,680
(is Ms. Longevity.)

318
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,790
(I need you to protect her
for the rest of her life.)

319
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,160
(Make sure no one ever harms her.)

320
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,790
(You must do this.)

321
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,120
Mother stepped on this to hang herself.

322
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,030
This is the surprise
she prepared for you.

323
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,400
It's the Zhuangyuanhong wine
she buried on your wedding,

324
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,950
wishing you success
in the imperial exams.

325
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,880
She made your dreams

326
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,880
her own!

327
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,060
I should be punished.

328
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,750
I spoke out of turn.

329
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,710
When I found out
that Wang Yingxue was pregnant,

330
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,080
I couldn't contain my anger
and told Madam.

331
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
- I am to blame.
- Quiet!

332
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,470
What nonsense!

333
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,790
She was jealous and took her own life.

334
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,120
She did it out of resentment.

335
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,440
I won't let her ruin
the Dou Family's name.

336
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,190
Listen carefully, all of you!

337
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,840
Madam Zhao died of illness.

338
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,510
Anyone who dares to speak recklessly

339
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:01,790
will be beaten to death.

340
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:04,360
Adultery within the marriage

341
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,710
and driving the wife to her death!

342
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,790
Mr. Zhao, calm down...

343
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,710
You got an heir you wanted

344
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,080
- and ascended to noble connections!
- Mr. Zhao.

345
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,510
Why don't you step over her corpse
and hold your wedding?

346
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,950
I will risk my life and reputation

347
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,880
to fight you to the bitter end!

348
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,550
(The flowers have fallen.)

349
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,480
(Mother,)

350
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,190
(I thought you died
from a malicious plot.)

351
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,320
(I didn't expect
that you would rather end your life)

352
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,510
(than accept betrayal.)

353
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,460
(Dou's Residence)

354
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:46,260
(Funeral)

355
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,710
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- I'm sorry for your loss.

356
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,710
Thank you for your condolences,
Mr. Li. Mr. Liu.

357
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,470
It's a tragic loss for the family.

358
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,270
Madam Zhao
had always been weak in health.

359
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,790
We thought it was just a slight cold.

360
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,710
No one could have expected

361
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,030
that she would pass away so suddenly.

362
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,240
(Mother,)

363
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,030
(your flowers won't fall anymore.)

364
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,430
This is a place for kin.

365
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,790
Are you from the Zhao or the Dou Family?

366
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,950
Who are you to be here?

367
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,840
Ms. Longevity, don't cry.

368
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,790
Your mother has passed away.

369
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,270
From now on, I will take her place
and care for you.

370
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,640
I will treat you like my own daughter.

371
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,390
Yingxue.

372
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,240
Father.

373
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,080
A life is lost

374
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,990
and Dou Shiying spends
the whole day drinking in despair,

375
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:50,920
only knowing to avoid.

376
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,603
(Wang Xingyi, Vice Censor-in-Chief)
All the blame is

377
00:20:52,604 --> 00:20:54,270
(of the Right Censorate)
on you.

378
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,360
Instead of being looked down upon
in the future,

379
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,120
it would be better for you
to return with me now.

380
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,440
I would rather my daughter
remain unmarried her entire life

381
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,470
than become a concubine.

382
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,990
Xingyi, it's a misunderstanding.

383
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,440
We've announced to the public
that Madam Zhao died from illness.

384
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,160
So your daughter will naturally take
her place as the main wife.

385
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,550
The marriage will follow
the proper formalities and rites

386
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,030
and the wedding banquet
will be held with full respect.

387
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,680
The child she carries
is the legitimate heir of the family.

388
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,550
The Dou Family will surely cherish it.

389
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,750
This is the token to the treasury
of the Dou's Residence,

390
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,950
which has always been kept
by the matron of the household.

391
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,550
Now, I'll entrust it to your daughter.

392
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,160
Whatever betrothal gifts,
or wedding items you need,

393
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,440
Madam Zhao's bridal gifts
and personal belongings

394
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,950
are at your disposal.

395
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,220
(Dou's Residence)

396
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,720
Send the list to my room later.

397
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,960
From now on,
all the gifts from other families

398
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,400
should be checked by me
before they are put into storage.

399
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,390
- Yes.
- Yes.

400
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,310
Mr. Zhao,

401
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,510
why didn't you tell me you're coming?

402
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:08,830
Perfect timing.

403
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,990
I've made some fried dough.

404
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,080
Let Dou Zhao and Zhangru have some.

405
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,230
These are Guqiu's bridal gifts.

406
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,190
That's the bracelet Aunt wore
when she was alive.

407
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,160
Oh, really?

408
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,680
- You!
- Listen here, Zhao.

409
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,680
Now that Guqiu is dead,

410
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,270
the marriage bond between the Zhao
and Dou Family has ended.

411
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,160
I am now the legitimate wife.

412
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:42,320
If you upset me,

413
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,510
do you think
you can be here all the time?

414
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,710
Aren't you afraid
I will vent all the frustration

415
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,850
I've endured from you on Dou Zhao

416
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,120
after you leave?

417
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,950
It's tasty.

418
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,400
Eat up if you think it's tasty.

419
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,960
Just tell me what you like to eat.

420
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:07,960
I'll make them for you.

421
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,990
Ms. Longevity is really innocent
and naive.

422
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:14,750
She forgets everything
when she sees a little snack.

423
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,680
Miss Wang,

424
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,320
my stomach really hurts.

425
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,110
What's wrong?

426
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,590
Ms. Longevity!

427
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,680
You wicked woman!

428
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,120
What did you give her?

429
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,990
- Get the physician!
- Go quickly.

430
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,160
- Go now.
- Ms. Longevity, spit it out!

431
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,240
Come on.

432
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,440
Poor child.

433
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,420
(Old Madam Cui of the Dou Family)
I'm glad you're awake.

434
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:53,830
Ms. Longevity,

435
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,550
this is Madam Cui,

436
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,400
your grandmother.

437
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,190
Grandmother.

438
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,830
Come.

439
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,950
I don't blame you
for not recognizing me.

440
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:11,400
I've long been estranged
from those two vile sons.

441
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,190
If Guqiu hadn't written to me
before she hanged herself,

442
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,600
asking me to watch over you,

443
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:17,940
I can't imagine

444
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,600
how many more people
they would have harmed.

445
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:22,870
Ms. Longevity,

446
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,190
what exactly had happened just now?

447
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,470
Miss Wang smashed
my mother's bridal gift.

448
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,160
She said I could get more snacks
if I was obedient.

449
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,640
The physician said

450
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,790
Ms. Longevity was poisoned by ephedra.

451
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,160
Ephedra has a strong medicinal effect.

452
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,910
For Wang Yingxue,
who suffers from asthma,

453
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,860
it is a remedy she cannot be without.

454
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,660
But it's poisonous to children.

455
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,750
She wants to get rid of the child

456
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,900
and seize the family's wealth.

457
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,380
(Poisoned by ephedra)
You wicked woman!

458
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,940
Both witnesses and evidence are present!

459
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,620
You're still denying it!

460
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,660
My daughter would never
do such lowly things.

461
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,900
If there's any misunderstanding,

462
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,180
we can sit down and discuss it.

463
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:03,100
According to the law,

464
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,900
those who poison others
shall be executed.

465
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,340
If the victim survived,

466
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,940
they shall be punished with 100 strokes
and a prison sentence of three years.

467
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,420
All three families are officials.

468
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,700
If this matter is brought
to the emperor,

469
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,860
can you tell His Majesty
that it's a misunderstanding?

470
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,020
I did not poison her.

471
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,580
I don't know
how she ended up eating ephedra.

472
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,860
You've resided at the manor\
for a long time.

473
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,620
How could you blame me

474
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,580
based on a one-sided story?

475
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,700
I cannot accept this.

476
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,540
Since Old Madam is your mother-in-law,

477
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,220
you should not defy
a senior family member.

478
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,140
Old Madam is the only daughter
of the Ji'an Cui Clan.

479
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,420
Her ancestors were meritorious officials
who helped found the kingdom

480
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,460
and are revered in the imperial shrine.

481
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,220
The Cui Clan has held
prestigious positions for generations,

482
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,340
and half of the court officials

483
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,940
are alumni of the Cui Clan Academy.

484
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,500
This matter is reasonably justified.

485
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,060
How can you not accept it?

486
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,100
So Old Madam Dou is...

487
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,260
My last name is Cui.

488
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,740
I do not take my husband's last name.

489
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:54,980
Please sit.

490
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,980
If this goes to court,

491
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:59,260
we all know what the outcomewill be.

492
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,380
Mr. Wang,

493
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,460
you risked being demoted

494
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,560
to speak up against the horse market,

495
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,420
which was known
among the scholars for your integrity.

496
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,540
But just after your reinstatement,
you let your daughter act violently.

497
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,580
What do you think
His Majesty would make of that?

498
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,380
Your daughter forced a marriage

499
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,020
that led to the main wife's suicide,

500
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,220
poisoned the legitimate daughter,
and embezzled family assets.

501
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,660
How should these three crimes

502
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,220
be addressed, Mr. Wang?

503
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,980
What do you suggest

504
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,500
should be done about this?

505
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,340
If the Dou and Wang families can
settle privately and offer compensation,

506
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,940
it would give Ms. Longevity
a secure future.

507
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,860
I've already ordered my son

508
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,300
to transfer all of Guqiu's bridal gifts

509
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,580
to Dou Zhao's name

510
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,580
with 3,000 taels in compensation.

511
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,740
The Wang Family should match
that amount.

512
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,740
That's impossible.

513
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,220
The Dou Family was originally
a merchant family.

514
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,060
Of course, they could afford
to offer that much.

515
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,420
But my father just got reinstated.

516
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,820
How could he fork out that much money?

517
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,740
If you don't have it, you can borrow it.

518
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,220
Over the years,
my sister had given you allowances

519
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,020
worth at least over a hundred taels.

520
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,100
Your father is a fourth-rank official.

521
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,500
Borrowing a thousand taels
in cash shouldn't be difficult.

522
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,940
As for the balance,

523
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,900
you can write a promissory note

524
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,380
to pay it within five or ten years.

525
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,900
You'll eventually clear
the balance anyhow.

526
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,700
But Ms. Longevity is still young.

527
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,700
How could she manage these finances?

528
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,380
You don't need to worry about that.

529
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,540
The one suffering is Ms. Longevity.

530
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,700
What others say doesn't matter.

531
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,940
Go and ask Ms. Longevity

532
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,660
what she thinks.

533
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,220
Yes, Madam Cui.

534
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,420
The one truly suffering isn't me

535
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:50,180
but my mother.

536
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,700
She died
with a broken heart and regrets.

537
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,300
If Miss Wang marries into the Dou Family

538
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,180
and be my mother,

539
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,380
how can my mother rest in peace?

540
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,260
Ms. Longevity wants

541
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,020
Miss Wang to kneel

542
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,620
and mourn for her mother
for three years

543
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,140
without marrying into the Dou Family.

544
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,260
This is not right, Mother.

545
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,660
If she doesn't marry into the family,

546
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,260
how can her child
be properly recognized?

547
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,020
We can't allow
the Dou Family's bloodline

548
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,260
to wander outside aimlessly.

549
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,460
If it's about status,

550
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,940
a remarriage contract would suffice.

551
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,900
I'm carrying the Dou Family's bloodline.

552
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,900
What if the kneeling harms the child?

553
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,900
After you marry into the household,

554
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,580
you should meditate
at Youmin Temple for three years

555
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,380
to repent and nurture your character.

556
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,780
Don't let the karmic debt
affect the child.

557
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,180
After the child is born,

558
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,020
find a wet nurse
who knows how to educate children.

559
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,170
Shiying,

560
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,800
say something.

561
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,020
I've failed Guqiu.

562
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,860
I am willing to observe
the mourning period

563
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,740
and live separately from the new wife.

564
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,180
Yingxue will go to Youmin Temple.

565
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,420
I will move into Guqiu's room.

566
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,140
I will burn incense for her
and chant scriptures day and night.

567
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,020
Forgive me.

568
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,980
I am truly sorry for my mistakes.

569
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,500
We will pay the compensation.

570
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,620
Mother, please spare the child
in my womb.

571
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,460
(Perpetual Bloom)

572
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,700
Forgive me, Ms. Longevity.

573
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,500
I can no longer stay
to watch you grow up.

574
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,460
Mother, I don't blame you.

575
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,300
I don't want to be your burden

576
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,380
and see you suffering day and night.

577
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,940
Don't worry about me.

578
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,420
I will take good care of myself.

579
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,220
(The magnolia has withered.)

580
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,380
(The swing is covered in dust.)

581
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,620
(This place is no longer your home,)

582
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,020
(nor is it mine.)

583
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,020
(Mother.)

584
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,580
(If your spirit still lingers,)

585
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,540
(I wish you could fly beyond
these high walls,)

586
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,460
(over the courtyard,)

587
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,900
(and find your freedom and peace.)

588
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,300
(Cui's Residence)

589
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,260
- Madam Cui.
- Madam Cui.

590
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,740
Good.

591
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,860
(Zhending, Cui Clan's Manor)

592
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,020
This manor looks beautiful.

593
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,060
- Greetings, Old Madam.
- Greetings, Old Madam.

594
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:34,100
Ansu, hurry and greet the Old Madam.

595
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,140
Greetings, Old Madam.

596
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,300
These are Mr. and Mrs. Miao.

597
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,860
They are our neighboring households
around the manor.

598
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,940
When a new resident moves in,

599
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,380
we sweep away the dust first.

600
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,740
Get rid of the past
to make way for new beginnings.

601
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,300
Then blessings and fortune will follow.

602
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,060
This is yours.

603
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,300
This is yours.

604
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,380
You have one too.

605
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,660
Grandmother, what flower is this?

606
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,260
Purple crape myrtle.

607
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,020
They are wildflowers
not worth mentioning.

608
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,900
Peonies and orchids
are delicate beauties.

609
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,100
But they compete fiercely for nutrients.

610
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,940
They cannot endure heavy rain

611
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,460
or drought

612
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,980
and constantly require human care.

613
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,940
Wildflowers are entirely different.

614
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,900
They don't need favorable weather
or fertile land.

615
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,780
Just scatter their seeds,
and they'll grow across the hills.

616
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:30,380
You took the poison yourself
that day, didn't you?

617
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,940
Ephedra is bitter.

618
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,540
At a toxic dose,

619
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,500
it would be so bitter
that one could hardly swallow it.

620
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,020
This child is precocious

621
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,420
and must hate me deeply.

622
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,820
She'll be hard to manage in the future.

623
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,660
She cannot be allowed to stay.

624
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,980
Don't you have ephedra on you?

625
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,620
That herb doesn't harm adults

626
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,220
but not children.

627
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,380
Even in small amounts,

628
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,460
long-term use can drain

629
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,820
one's energy, and weaken the lungs
and overall health.

630
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:05,140
I will take great care of her

631
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,580
and look after her in every way.

632
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,060
I will look like a virtuous wife.

633
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,940
Wang Yingxue leaves me with no choice.

634
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,100
Instead of waiting for her to harm me,

635
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,060
it's better to swallow
this bitterness myself

636
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,660
to protect myself.

637
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,740
Grandmother,

638
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,620
I'm not a cruel person.

639
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,540
I'm willing to risk my life

640
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,460
to repay those who treat me well.

641
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,220
If there's a grudge or hatred,

642
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,020
even if it means hurting myself,

643
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,820
I will return it.

644
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:48,890
Ms. Longevity,

645
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,740
you must remember this.

646
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,540
You're not allowed to do this again.

647
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,580
I took you away from that house

648
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,020
because you're mature and intelligent.

649
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,620
If you're trapped in family conflicts,

650
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,540
you will become narrow-minded

651
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,060
and focus on small and petty matters.

652
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,220
Then you will miss out on
broader opportunities and growth.

653
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,740
I want your intelligence
to go beyond that house,

654
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,820
the mountains, rivers,

655
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,580
and even the world.

656
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,260
Those are the places

657
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,940
where you can truly shine.

658
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,500
My mother's bracelet.

659
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:31,500
Broken things can shine again.

660
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,100
Grandmother,

661
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,580
I understand it now.

662
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:36,740
I came to the countryside

663
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,780
not to seek protection and dependence.

664
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:43,540
But like the purple crape myrtle,
I'll be strong, resilient

665
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,420
and able to withstand wind and rain.

666
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,460
(From now on,)

667
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,380
(I want to live a good life
for myself.)

668
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,700
(I wish to study under a wise teacher)

669
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,220
(Chen Qushui)
(to understand worldly matters.)

670
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,460
Are you going to give or not?

671
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,100
Are you deaf?

672
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,660
Great comeback!

673
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:13,380
Serve them right!

674
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,300
Let me go!

675
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,350
Let me go!

676
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,760
Good job!

677
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,340
(Then hire servants
who are trained in martial arts)

678
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,620
(Sulan. Suxin)

679
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,460
(for self-protection.)

680
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,300
(Ultimately, I will make my way
into various businesses)

681
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,780
(and prosper wherever I go.)

682
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,120
Be careful.

683
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,990
Give me a hand here.

684
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,820
(Stable Foundation, Stable Nation)

685
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:06,820
(Ding Army Barracks, Futing)

686
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:12,860
Move it!

687
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,220
Next!

688
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,540
(Ding)

689
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:28,660
Marshal,

690
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,380
a kid came forward
to enlist in the army.

691
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,220
Quick!

692
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,500
We are guarding the border

693
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,940
so that children can stay
with their families

694
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,780
and free from harm.

695
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,140
I do not take children in here.

696
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,500
Send him away.

697
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,543
(Yan Chaoqing)
Marshal,

698
00:36:39,544 --> 00:36:41,020
(Deputy General of the Ding Army)
you should take a look first.

699
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,060
(Jiang Meisun, Duke of Ding)

700
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:45,900
Keep up!

701
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,900
(Young Song Mo)

702
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,740
Hello, Marshal.

703
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,740
Are you here to enlist in the army?

704
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,380
You've lost your mind, kid!

705
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,580
Did you run away from home
to join the army?

706
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,740
Stop right there!

707
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,980
Uncle, calm down.

708
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,020
I didn't run away from home.

709
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,420
I'm really here to join the army.

710
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,260
Do you think joining the army is a game?

711
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,820
Stop right there. Do you hear me?

712
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:12,940
Kid,

713
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,260
your father will ground you for a year

714
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,410
if he finds out about this,

715
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:16,520
and I'm not going to plead for you.

716
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,500
You only have two options now.

717
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,770
Either you leave on your own,

718
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:19,720
or I'll take you back myself.

719
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,700
Pick one.

720
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,180
Then you'll have to tie me up first.

721
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,020
Are you trying to mess with me?

722
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,100
Someone, get him and tie him up!

723
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:25,940
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

724
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,780
Marshal,

725
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,540
you need more men to catch him.

726
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,460
I didn't expect him to be that fast.

727
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,220
Why are you still here?

728
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,300
Go and help out!

729
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:47,380
Yes, sir.

730
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,700
Your Lordship,

731
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,540
with your build,

732
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,500
you're still no match
for the pirates and their weapons.

733
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,100
Do you think you can take on
the pirates?

734
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,060
That's a bit...

735
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,700
Am I able to fight the pirates now?

736
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,340
Quite extraordinary.

737
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,940
- Extraordinary indeed.
- Outrageous!

738
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,220
Get down.

739
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,660
Give me the dagger.

740
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,340
You think you're that capable, huh?

741
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,820
Send him home.

742
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,300
Uncle.

743
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,300
If you chase me away,

744
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,660
I will truly be homeless.

745
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,380
Did your father throw you out again?

746
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,660
Ridiculous.

747
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,460
What kind of father is Song Yichun?

748
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,300
Uncle.

749
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,140
I mean,

750
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,140
Marshal,

751
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,220
please take me in.

752
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,860
I would go through fire and water
without hesitation for duty.

753
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,180
Go through fire and water, huh?

754
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,980
Can you even light a fire and cook?

755
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,260
A cook?

756
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,860
- How about something else?
- Do it, or leave.

757
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,220
All right. I'll do it.

758
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,340
Start working, then.

759
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,220
Jiang Meisun,

760
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,380
just you wait.

761
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,780
One day, I will rise from a cook

762
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,940
to a great general
who stabilizes the nation!

763
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,940
Give it back to me.

764
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,820
Hurry!

765
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,620
Hurry.

766
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,540
Look.

767
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,180
Zhao sold off more than half
of the textile businesses in Guandong,

768
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,940
as well as the rouge shops.

769
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,740
She also bought dozens of silk factories
and tea plantations in Futing.

770
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,700
(Miao Ansu)
The prices may be cheap.

771
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,780
But these are all businesses
with slim profits and difficult sales.

772
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,860
The Dongyu pirates
have been rampaging through Futing.

773
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,180
Nine out of ten trading ships
are robbed by pirates.

774
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,980
Wouldn't this be too risky?

775
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,980
We have recaptured all the islands
along the coast.

776
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,820
Let's cherish this moment.

777
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,580
We don't have
many battles left to fight.

(Records of the Enlightened Age)

780
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,940
The court has sent Duke of Ding

781
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,540
to pacify the chaos at sea for years.

782
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,060
The pirate troubles will be resolved,
and the sea trade will thrive.

783
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,420
Things like silk and tea
may seem insignificant now.

784
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,180
They will be more valuable
than gold in the future.

785
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,540
So we need to quickly secure

786
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,660
these shops.

787
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,460
They will double in value later.

788
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:16,620

(Wrongfully Killed Man)
(going to happen?)

795
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,740
Little child,

796
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,380
why are you upset?

797
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,460
(Records of the Enlightened Age)
I can't believe someone believed

798
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,580
the random story I made up.

799
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,340
What do you think
about the story I wrote?

800
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,180
You wrote this?

801
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,380
I clearly worked hard.

802
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,380
Why can't I change the outcome?

803
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,380
Throw a rock into the river.

804
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,500
Throw a bigger one.

805
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,980
A big one that it's difficult
for you to carry.

806
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,540
(Did you see that?)

807
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,340
No matter how large the rock is,

808
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,540
it only creates a temporary ripple.

809
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:14,860
You can't change
the direction of the river.

810
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:19,420
Then how can one change
the direction of this river?

811
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,460
If you have enough strength

812
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,140
to make the majestic mountain

813
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,180
in front of you collapse

814
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,660
one day,

815
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:31,860
then you can change the river.

816
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:46,980
(So fate is not something)

817
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,780
(that cannot be defied)

818
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,340
(or changed.)

819
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,540
(This time,)

(Song Mo, Star of Doom)

This family banquet

833
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,420
is likely an opportunity
for the eldest grandson of Mr. Wu

834
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,900
to meet the daughters of the Dou Family.

835
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,940
Song Yichun neglected military affairs

836
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,420
and shall be punished
with thirty lashes.

837

838
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,980
to let me take the punishment
in place of my father.

839
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,300
