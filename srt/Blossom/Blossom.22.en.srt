1
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,160
Dou Ming's nanny
was there to care for her.

2
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,459
She should've known

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,299
whether she was pregnant.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,729
They didn't say anything at all.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,080
What were they trying to do?

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,640
All this while,

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,499
Ming has been busy managing
the residence's expenditure

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,230
while seeking a decent position for me.

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,750
Besides, she just got married.

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,520
She hasn't learned much yet.

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,499
Why would she risk her own child's life?

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,449
She even stole her own sister's husband!

13
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:32,950
What else is she not capable of?

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,089
If only you married Dou Zhao instead.

15
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,329
She'd make sure our residence

16
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,480
would prosper for three generations!

17
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,550
Enough! Stop that.

18
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,080
In the end, all you care about is money.

19
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,550
Anyway, I hope
that you'll stop interfering

20
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,870
in the residence's matters.

21
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,689
That wretched lass

22
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,310
must have bewitched you

23
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,289
that you don't even listen to me.

24
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,430
You...

25
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,040
Mind yourself, Your Ladyship.

26
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,200
What did you call me?

27
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,350
They say an elder sister
is like a mother.

28
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,600
All these years,

29
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,680
I've been managing
the household for you.

30
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,400
Now that you have a wife,

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,899
you've totally forgotten

32
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,939
everything I've done for you!

33
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,700
Stop claiming
that you're doing this for me!

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,689
I can see

35
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,510
that you've been unhappy over the years

36
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:30,600
in the Duke of Jing's Residence.

37
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,040
I feel for you.

38
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,990
If you could,

39
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,600
please put yourself in Ming's shoes.

40
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,510
From now on,

41
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,760
stop worrying about the affairs here.

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,060
(Duke of Jining's Residence)

43
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,880
If I were as capable as my sister,

44
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,960
I wouldn't have been in this state.

45
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,550
Ming, it's not like that.

46
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,800
You know

47
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,480
what kind of person I am, don't you?

48
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,480
I thought I knew you.

49
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,089
But, your sister said...

50
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,280
I know.

51
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,649
In the end, all my sister
and your mother wanted

52
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,670
was just money and material comforts.

53
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,160
Since that's the case,
I'll just work hard and earn them

54
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,390
so that we can enjoy
some peace and quiet.

55
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,670
You have an idea?

56
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,280
Many people are eager to buy my artwork,

57
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,070
but they were all lowly
and crude commoners,

58
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,040
so I refused to have
anything to do with them.

59
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,630
You are an excellent artist.

60
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,880
If you're willing to sell to the public,

61
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,910
people would flock over
to buy your artwork.

62
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,480
If you make a name in the art industry,

63
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,480
your artwork will be immortalized.

64
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,230
That's your dream too, right?

65
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,510
Things will get better for us.

66
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,000
For you, Ming.

67
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,119
=Blossom=
(Adapted from the novel "Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

68
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,380
=Episode 22=

69
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,250
Madam, you've gone through
so much trouble

70
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,920
to secure a job for the Duke,

71
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,880
yet he refused to accept it.

72
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,800
He'd rather sell his artwork
to the lowly commoners.

73
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,089
How could our young mistress

74
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,819
marry such a useless man?

75
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,070
Mind your tongue.

76
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,710
Even so,

77
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,630
he's my son-in-law.

78
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,920
No matter what,

79
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,560
I'll eke out a path for Ming

80
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,440
and make sure
she doesn't repeat my past.

81
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,710
What's going on?

82
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,209
Madam.

83
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,470
Long time no see.

84
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,780
(Jieyi Hall)

85
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,590
Your father has been
waging war against us bandits.

86
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,760
Why didn't you send us a letter?

87
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,139
We've been earning money
for you over the years.

88
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,920
Are you trying to get rid of us?

89
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,510
Of course not.

90
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,760
We've just had two marriages
in the residence lately,

91
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,590
so I was too busy to talk
to my father about this.

92
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,620
Madam.

93
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,500
Are you trying to fool us?

94
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,780
If you keep this foolery up,

95
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,940
you'd have a taste of my blade!

96
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,940
Come on.

97
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,100
Slaughter me!

98
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,740
I hope that makes you and I happy.

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,959
Madam.

100
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,700
- What are you saying?
- Shut up!

101
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,020
You can

102
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,300
end my life now.

103
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,260
Let's see if my father,

104
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,580
the Minister of War,

105
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,020
will let you guys off.

106
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,180
Otherwise,

107
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,660
you'd better untie me,

108
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,580
so we can sit and talk.

109
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,239
Guys!

110
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,380
Yes, sir!

111
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,780
Untie her.

112
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,059
(Jieyi Hall)

113
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,200
Madam.

114
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,490
Pardon me.

115
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,959
As you know, all of us

116
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,580
are just trying to make a living.

117
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,119
If you have the money
to support your daughter,

118
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,220
then what about the debt you owe us?

119
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,639
At this rate,

120
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,359
my brothers might get hungry

121
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,700
and rob the Duke of Jining's residence

122
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,420
for a change.

123
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,580
All the Duke of Jining has now

124
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,660
are just debt and pawn tickets.

125
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,700
If you don't believe me,
go ahead and rob them.

126
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,660
If you ask me,

127
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,340
if you really want to go all out,

128
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,940
there's another residence you can rob.

129
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,140
(Jieyi Hall)

130
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,860
Come here.

131
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,640
What is it?

132
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,180
Stand here.

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,140
Close your eyes.

134
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,820
Close your eyes.

135
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,060
What's going on?

136
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,180
Don't peek.

137
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,540
What are you doing?

138
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,460
Don't move.

139
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,540
Almost there.

140
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,079
Isn't it more appropriate
to do this at night instead?

141
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,500
Why can't we do it in the day?

142
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,350
In fact, it's better
since you can see clearer

143
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,580
when there's ample lighting.

144
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,060
Are you feeling hot?

145
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,580
Why are you sweating?

146
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,260
No.

147
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,540
I don't feel hot.

148
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,830
And it's done.

149
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,020
It's done?

150
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,940
Surprised?

151
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,060
Surprised.

152
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,260
You made this for me?

153
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,260
I just wanted to measure this on you.

154
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,740
It fits you.

155
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,460
I thought...

156
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,780
I was thinking too much.

157
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,079
When I bathed you that day,

158
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,359
I noticed a lot of wounds on your body

159
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,580
created by the friction
caused by ill-fitted armor.

160
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,980
Now that you're guarding
the imperial palace,

161
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,500
you could use a golden armored vest.

162
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,519
This will defend you from attacks

163
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,260
without scraping your skin.

164
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,500
It can keep you safe.

165
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,420
What's wrong? You don't like it?

166
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,020
I love it.

167
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,060
You've been sighing at the vest

168
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,060
for an hour, Your Lordship.

169
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,540
Is there anything wrong with it?

170
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,049
I saw how my uncle,
the Duke of Ding, and his wife

171
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,980
remained affectionate even though
they were at the battlefield.

172
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,300
They have always been a loving couple.

173
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,380
What do you think of me and Dou Zhao?

174
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,780
Do we seem different?

175
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,780
Her Ladyship is brave and witty.

176
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,759
She's been managing
the household efficiently.

177
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,740
Ever since she married
into the residence,

178
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,759
even the Duke is cautious around her,

179
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,380
and he's stopped picking
any fights with you.

180
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,980
She is the perfect wife for you.

181
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,300
I have a feeling that she

182
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,420
doesn't love me.

183
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,279
Your Lordship.

184
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,379
She's done so much for you

185
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,580
and even made this vest herself.

186
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,039
How could you say that
she doesn't love you?

187
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,180
Exactly.

188
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,740
No.

189
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,740
That's not the kind of love I meant.

190
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,820
As I told Dou Zhao,

191
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,519
we'd face every challenge together.

192
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,260
The way she treats me

193
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,460
is like a strategist advising a general,

194
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,359
just like how you're treating me.

195
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,620
That's not love.

196
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,959
Your Lordship.

197
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,500
I love you.

198
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,919
I love you too.

199
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,039
No, no!

200
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,780
That's not what I meant.

201
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,700
The love Dou Zhao has for me

202
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,399
is not romantic love.

203
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,580
Do you understand?

204
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,580
I am unmarried,

205
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,820
so I don't really understand.

206
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,900
Don't you like the way
Her Ladyship treats you?

207
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,180
Not exactly.

208
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,060
I'd say she's oblivious.

209
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,100
You're getting close. Continue.

210
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,239
Your Lordship.

211
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,519
I'm just 17 years old,

212
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,090
and I'm not in a romantic relationship,

213
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,740
so I don't know what else to say.

214
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,100
What do you kids know about love?

215
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,159
I don't know about love?

216
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,799
You're already this old
and still unmarried.

217
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,679
How dare you tease me?

218
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,529
So what?

219
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,780
That's because my life
is dedicated to His Lordship.

220
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,180
Yantang.

221
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,100
Are you sure you don't want
to visit Drunken Bordello?

222
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,580
I heard

223
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,460
that they've hired
a bunch of pretty musicians.

224
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,220
You can dine and wine
while listening to music.

225
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,740
My treat.

226
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,159
Come on.

227
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,559
I also heard that they've also hired

228
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,350
some handsome singers.

229
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,200
Are you trying to emulate
the Eldest Princess?

230
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,460
You're so petty.

231
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,340
I got it.

232
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,340
You're jealous.

233
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,380
You're drunk.

234
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,620
I'm not.

235
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,799
Why choose such a song?

236
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,259
Don't you know?

237
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,999
This is what we call romance.

238
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,160
What do you expect them to do,
recite classical texts?

239
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,540
It seems to be working, though.

240
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,820
What a beautiful night.

241
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,860
Nice singing!

242
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,220
That doesn't look very gentlemanly.

243
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,879
You deserve to remain single forever.

244
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,300
What's wrong with being single?

245
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,559
I like it.

246
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,020
You two seem to be plotting something.

247
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,279
Spill the beans.

248
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,380
What kind of trick
did you pull on Her Ladyship?

249
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,830
It's not just your room.

250
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,250
This place is filled with stars too.

251
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,100
See?

252
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,500
I used to loathe your eyes,

253
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,999
but now...

254
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,260
What now?

255
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,420
There's a cluster of stars

256
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,060
inside your eyes,

257
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,900
twinkling and shining.

258
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,300
How beautiful.

259
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,140
Look.

260
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,599
The reflection on the water

261
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,060
looks so ethereal and pretty.

262
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,420
You can see it, but you can't touch it.

263
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,140
It's prettier this way.

264
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,900
Do you like it?

265
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,580
I love it.

266
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,300
I love it.

267
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,900
I love you too.

268
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,500
Look.

269
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,460
The lights are so beautiful,

270
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,780
just like your eyes.

271
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,550
Your Lordship!

272
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,430
Your Lordship.

273
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,610
Shh.

274
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,900
Go back first

275
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,180
and prepare some warm soup
and ginger tea for her.

276
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,990
- I'll be back soon.
- Your Lordship.

277
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,630
There are so many people out here.

278
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,959
If you carry Her Ladyship back...

279
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,510
If you don't prepare everything I asked,

280
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,400
I'll make you run ten li
with weights tomorrow.

281
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,020
Yes, Your Lordship.

282
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,300
Come on.

283
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,590
That lamp

284
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,060
is so pretty.

285
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,300
I'll get it for you.

286
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,980
I'll get you whatever you want.

287
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,479
My dad said you have no shame.

288
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,900
I'm so sorry.

289
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,430
- Don't blabber.
- As long as my wife is happy,

290
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,840

Don't worry.

312
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,160
I changed your clothes.

313
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,249
As for your hangover soup,

314
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,660
it was His Lordship who made it for you.

315
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,900
You were absolutely
intoxicated last night.

316
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,540
I do seem to have a memory lapse.

317
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,480
I only remember that last night,

318
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,340
we went to enjoy some performances,

319
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,900
and...

320
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,280
And what happened?

321
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,340
You'll have to ask His Lordship.

322
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,770
You were hugging him the whole night.

323
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,400
When he left the room this morning,

324
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,400
his neck was purplish
from the constant gripping.

325
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,380
That's why you'll have to ask him.

326
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,340
You're awake.

327
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,930
I thought you'd sleep in.

328
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,480
Last night...

329
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,920
Yantang.

330
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,880
Last night,

331
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,340
I got greedy and drank too much.

332
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,100
Other than that,

333
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,580
I didn't do anything
inappropriate, did I?

334
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,750
Other than what?

335
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,170
What are they saying?

336
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,140
I guess it's nothing.

337
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,820
I mean,

338
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,740
I didn't get rowdy
after drinking, did I?

339
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,359
You've always been calm and composed.

340
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,500
Of course, you didn't.

341
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,620
All you did was tugging me

342
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,879
to watch the lights and stars together.

343
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,719
Then, you pointed at random things
and asked me to buy them.

344
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,910
You also hugged me the entire night
and babbled a bunch of stuff.

345
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,879
Don't take my words seriously

346
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,100
when I'm drunk.

347
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:55,709
So, you didn't mean it
when you said my eyes

348
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,850
were gentle and pretty?

349
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,940
You said you love...

350
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,439
Yantang.

351
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,900
You should go to work now.

352
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,580
- It's getting late, go.
- Sure.

353
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,739
By the way,

354
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,300
I put the lamp at the front yard.

355
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,219
This lamp...

356
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,329
His Lordship

357
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:19,279
got Mr. Yan to bring it back last night.

358
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,060
You even wanted to bring it back
to your room and hug it to sleep.

359
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,060
That lamp is so pretty.

360
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,180
Sure.

361
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,420
I'll get you whatever you want.

362
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,300
Your Ladyship!

363
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,799
- No, Your Ladyship!
- Push it in!

364
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,140
- Come on!
- Stop it, please!

365
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,119
It was the Duke of Jing
from the South Warden

366
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,679
who commissioned this lamp

367
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,310
for the old duchess's birthday.

368
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:44,479
It's 100 cun tall,

369
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,309
which symbolizes a long life.

370
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,620
Do you like it?

371
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,340
I do like it,

372
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,079
but I'm literally
taking her long life...

373
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,959
No,

374
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,660
I mean, I'm taking her birthday gift.

375
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,220
That doesn't seem appropriate.

376
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,519
It's fine.

377
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:01,399
His Lordship has already
commissioned a new lamp for her.

378
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,940
As long as you like it.

379
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,620
So, Your Ladyship.

380
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,380
Shall we hang the lamp?

381
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,020
This lamp looks too gaudy.

382
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,439
Hang it at the back gate.

383
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,279
Yes, Your Ladyship.

384
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,540
(Fleeting Time)

385
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,220
Maybe we should put it back in.

386
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,060
Nice.

387
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,540
Not many people in the capital

388
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,019
is capable of drawing cranes

389
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,680
in such a vivid manner.

390
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,380
It's spectacular.

391
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,860
I can offer 1,000 taels.

392
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:46,839
My husband has created

393
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,119
thousands of paintings,

394
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,740
and this is his best one.

395
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,640
Still, you need to make
a few adjustments.

396
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,959
First, the background.

397
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,180
Instead of the mountains,

398
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,830
you should draw the fields instead.

399
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,300
The fields?

400
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,709
Cranes are noble creatures

401
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,940
that dwell in the mountains.

402
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,110
How could it exist in the fields?

403
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,670
I'm planning to gift this to Lord Chen.

404
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,400
He's crippled,

405
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,349
and seeing these mountains

406
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,820
would only upset him.

407
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,180
Cranes in the fields
sound like a fun idea too.

408
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:25,700
The feathers look too simplistic.

409
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,039
They should look fuller

410
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,670
so that the painting looks valuable.

411
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:32,900
Also, the crane's head looks too faded.

412
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,050
It's not...

413
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,429
Since you don't understand art,
I shall not sell it to you.

414
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,870
I'll only sell to those
who can understand.

415
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,439
This…This is my first time seeing

416
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,229
someone who refuses to negotiate a deal!

417
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,039
I'm so sorry, Mr. Zhou.

418
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,060
Perhaps this deal is over,
but there's still next time.

419
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,959
At least the duchess is sensible.

420
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,340
You're beautiful and courteous.

421
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:55,579
You lecher!

422
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,459
- Men!
- Yes, Your Lordship!

423
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,529
Shoo this man away, now!

424
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:58,419
- Yes, Your Lordship!
- Tingyu!

425
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,359
- Your Lordship!
- Don't!

426
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,479
What did I do wrong?

427
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,900
- Tingyu!
- Move it!

428
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,279
What's wrong with you?

429
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,409
- Move it!
- Your Lordship!

430
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,550
Get out!

431
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,639
(Duke of Jining's Residence)

432
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,940
Unhand me!

433
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,420
- Run along!
- Run along!

434
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,020
You all...

435
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,740
1,000 taels

436
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,980
is one year's worth
of our food expenses.

437
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,239
He may be just an art dealer,

438
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,129
but many artists became famous
because of him.

439
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,270
He might be able

440
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,340
to sell your artwork to collectors

441
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,219
and even the palace.

442
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,289
Ming.

443
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,639
Art is a spiritual pursuit

444
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,679
that expresses one's mind.

445
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,090
If I paint things
that go against my principles

446
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,879
just to earn money,

447
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,480
it'd be an insult to my brushes.

448
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,480
If you don't want
to insult your brushes,

449
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,570
then you might as well work
in the Military Command.

450
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,269
Given your status as a duke,

451
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:48,119
you'll make a name for yourself
and enjoy an illustrious career.

452
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,700
My identity as a duke

453
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:52,020
has made me a subject of ridicule
among my peers.

454
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,900
Now, I even have to rely
on my wife's family.

455
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,420
I don't care

456
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,940
about this position.

457
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,079
That's because you've just started.

458
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,780
It's normal to make mistakes.

459
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,679
Next time, we can treat your peers

460
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,919
to a meal at Drunken Bordello

461
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,620
to win their support.

462
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,660
They've been ridiculing me,

463
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,409
and you want me to treat
those crude, uncivilized barbarians?

464
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,860
What an insult!

465
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,780
Fine.

466
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,860
Since you care about your dignity,

467
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,579
I'll do it for you.

468
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:24,699
I'll make some embroidery items
and sell them,

469
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,759
then rent a stall and sell some snacks.

470
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,140
It doesn't matter

471
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,349
who the breadwinner is.

472
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,620
No way.

473
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,590
You are a duchess.

474
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,279
If you associate yourself
with the public,

475
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,900
everyone in the Capital
will laugh at me!

476
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,340
Don't you learn from your mother.

477
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,500
What's wrong with my mother?

478
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,980
She may have done many wrong things,

479
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,319
but she sold congee in the past

480
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,999
to support her entire family.

481
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,340
What's wrong with that?

482
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,660
Ming.

483
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,339
Ming.

484
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,480
I...

485
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,420
That's not what I meant.

486
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,860
Fine.

487
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,080
I'll do it.

488
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,860
I'll go back to work.

489
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,540
(Natural Grace and Talent)

490
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,900
Your Lordship.

491
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,300
An old servant from the main residence
is requesting an audience.

492
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,360
Bring him in.

493
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,460
Your Lordship.

494
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,650
I'm Ma Qiang, a former stableman
at the Duke of Ying's Residence.

495
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,820
I didn't see you
when I was investigating

496
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,590
the mass resignation
of servants back then.

497
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,740
Why have you come now?

498
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,900
I didn't dare to show myself

499
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,980
because I was scared.

500
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:43,879
Now, I'm here

501
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,539
for my wife, Qi Xia.

502
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,680
She...

503
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,540
She used to be
the late Duchess's servant.

504
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,420
Where's my wife?

505
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,580
At the bookstore.

506
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,500
Call her back, now.

507
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,700
Yes, Your Lordship.

508
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,559
Most of the Duchess's servants
are already gone.

509
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,180
Qi Xia used to be one
of her personal maids.

510
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,900
After she went mad,

511
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,100
they assigned her to work
in the kitchen instead.

512
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,020
That's how she escaped death.

513
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,019
I reckon you can't get

514
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,719
much information from her.

515
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,180
Eagle. Cockerel.

516
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,839
Miss, do you still remember
the Duke of Ying's Residence?

517
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,740
Eagle. Cockerel.

518
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,100
Of course I do.

519
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,519
Eagle.

520
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,160
- Time to take your medicine.
- Cockerel.

521
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:37,119
Eagle.

522
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,399
- Qi Xia.
- Cockerel.

523
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,479
Qi Xia, come on.

524
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,620
Drink your medicine.

525
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,260
Eagle.

526
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,999
I know that place.

527
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,879
Yes, you do.

528
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,879
- Eagle.
- Come on.

529
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,140
Cockerel.

530
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,580
Here you go.

531
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,820
Don't drink it!

532
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,380
Don't drink it!

533
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,980
Don't drink it!

534
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,199
- Why is she reacting strongly?
- Don't drink it!

535
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,580
That's how it's been

536
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,300
ever since she went crazy.

537
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,100
Is it because
the medicine is too bitter?

538
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,439
- It's poisonous!
- Qi Xia!

539
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,680
- It's poisonous!
- It's not!

540
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,889
- It's poisonous!
- Qi Xia!

541
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:14,839
- It's poisonous!
- It's not!

542
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,359
- Qi Xia!
- It's poisonous!

543
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,679
- There, there.
- It's poisonous!

544
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,919
- How is licorice poisonous?
- Qi Xia!

545
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,759
It's poisonous!

546
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,510
- Has she always been averse to it?
- It's poisonous!

547
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,369
No.

548
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,239
- This licorice is sweet.
- It's poisonous!

549
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,469
- It's also good for health.
- It's poisonous!

550
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,119
- She loved infusing licorice in water.
- It's poisonous!

551
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,260
Can you recall

552
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,000
- when she started resisting licorice?
- It's poisonous!

553
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,529
I think

554
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,890
since the late Duchess fell ill.

555
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,060
There, there, Qi Xia.

556
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,119
There, there.

557
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,700
- Only my mother's maids could access
- It's poisonous!

558
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,140
my mother's food and medicine.

559
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,420
Could it be...

560
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,940
Meirui?

561
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,740
I've checked all the storerooms,

562
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,540
kitchens, and apothecaries
in the residence.

563
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,530
There's no licorice left in stock.

564
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,260
I'm not an expert in medicine.

565
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,180
Do you have any physician friends?

566
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,420
It's only been a year since I returned.

567
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,740
I don't trust anyone.

568
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,700
There's one.

569
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,780
It's a good prescription.

570
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,940
Euphorbia is a key component

571
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,540
in curing urinary retention.

572
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,979
However, euphorbia
and licorice are contradictory.

573
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,260
If taken together,

574
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,660
it may lead to death.

575
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,059
After my mother died,

576
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,940
I've checked the
remnants of her medicine.

577
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:36,560
They follow the prescription perfectly,
and no licorice is added.

578
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,419
However, these symptoms
would only appear

579
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,940
when both herbs are taken together.

580
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,140
Perhaps licorice wasn't
added to the medicine.

581
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,640
Does your mother have
any special food likings?

582
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,500
My mother doesn't like bitter food,

583
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,990
so she'd always eat some
candied fruit after taking medicine.

584
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,020
She gave me this
before I left for Futing.

585
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,799
That's it.

586
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,740
This wasn't preserved in honey,

587
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,679
but boiled in a licorice solution

588
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,879
to infuse sweetness into it.

589
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,300
If eaten daily,

590
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,580
she'd die in a month.

591
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,740
Who gave her this?

592
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,480
Your Ladyship.

593
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,760
Over here.

594
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,660
She used to be the late Duchess's maid.

595
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,340
She's gone mad now, so we can't
get any information from her.

596
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,660
Do you think you can cure her?

597
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,940
No.

598
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,940
No, no.

599
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,700
Bring her to me
every seven days before afternoon.

600
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,599
I'll try acupuncture treatment on her.

601
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,940
The rest is up to the heavens.

602
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,660
What we see might not be the truth.

603
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,660
The licorice alone
cannot prove everything.

604
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,660
Still, it's not a baseless observation.

605
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,700
As long as we find
the source of the licorice,

606
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,460
the truth will be revealed.

607
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,880
If we act impulsively,
we might alert our enemies.

608
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,399
The daily necessities
have always been purchased

609
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,740
from regular shops.

610
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,879
For now, if we can obtain

611
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,179
the matching tokens,

612
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,940
we might find something
from the account books.

613
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:33,959
Why don't we bring Qi Xia

614
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,780
back to Yizhi Hall?

615
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,420
That way, she can get treated,

616
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,980
and after all, she used to work
for the late Duchess,

617
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,540
so she shouldn't be suffering out here.

618
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,860
Perhaps we might discover more.

619
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,060
Didn't you tell me

620
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,060
all those wretched maids
are already dead?

621
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,780
We kept searching,
but we couldn't find her.

622
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,660
Besides, she'd gone mad,

623
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,060
so I thought

624
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,460
her illness had already killed her.

625
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,759
Then, why has she appeared

626
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,780
in Yizhi Hall, alive?

627
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,380
You idiot!

628
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,940
Your Grace!

629
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,940
Get out!

630
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:34,460
(Lu's Dental Clinic)

631
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,119
If we allow them to investigate further,

632
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,540
they're bound to discover

633
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,420
our involvement as well.

634
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,460
Our spies have reported

635
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,839
that Wang Yingxue is colluding
with the Cangbei Gang,

636
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,519
and they're planning to let
the bandits enter the Capital

637
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,620
to rob Dou Zhao's dowry.

638
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,159
Why don't we distract Song Mo?

639
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,999
So we can...

640
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,820
Dou Zhao is a pawn
to lure Song Mo into our trap.

641
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,500
Are you trying to ruin our plans,
Your Grace?

642
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,100
If this is not a mere robbery,

643
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,390
but a catastrophic event
that could terrorize the capital,

644
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:17,600
perhaps this is our chance
to regain our military power

645
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,260
and reshuffle the Capital's guards.

646
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,260
His Majesty fell ill today,

647
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:27,570
and he's about to head to the Western
Mountain Palace for recuperation.

648
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,340
As the commander of the Imperial Guards,

649
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,660
Song Mo will follow him.

650
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,110
The Imperial Guards' duty

651
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,400
is to protect the Emperor.

652
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:41,900
If he returns to rescue his wife,
he would be betraying His Majesty.

653
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,300
But if he doesn't return,

654
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,970
his wife would be dead.

655
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,190
That's a splendid idea!

656
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,399
No matter what that defiant son decides,

657
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,140
it's a dead end for him.

658
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,300
You're about to destroy
two important pawns in the game.

659
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,580
Don't you feel bad at all,
Grand Secretary Dou?

660
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,740
Dou Zhao is already
part of the Song family.

661
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,620
That's the Duke of Ying's business.

662
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,740
As for Wang Yingxue,

663
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,180
she's always been a pawn,

664
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,540
so it's time for her
to make herself useful.

665
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,980
(Universal Compassion)

666
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,540
This is your reward.

667
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,980
Where's the thing?

668
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,100
(Military Command)

669
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,540
Madam.

670
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,060
(Wei Tingyu)

671
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,220
There's something I don't understand.

672
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:56,479
Since Cangbei Gang is already helping us

673
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,900
to get rid of Dou Zhao,

674
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,300
why do we need to involve
the Duke of Jining in this?

675
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,540
The Cangbei Gang threatened us

676
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,100
because we couldn't pay our debts.

677
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,900
Everything is caused

678
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,100
by that greedy woman, Wei Tingzhen.

679
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,940
Moreover,

680
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,500
she's also involved
in the money-lending business.

681
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,460
The Duke of Jing is related
to the Empress's family.

682
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,380
Even if their dealings are exposed,

683
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,020
they wouldn't sit by and watch.

684
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,260
Madam, you've planned
everything so well.

685
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,980
Dou Zhao.

686
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,460
No one can save you this time.

687
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,039
Madam, it's a lucky sign!

688
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,300
(No. 24, very lucky)

689
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,540
Thank you for your blessing,
Bodhisattva.

690
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,039
(No. 45, very unlucky)

691
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,820
(Duke of Ying's Residence)

692
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,380
Just stay here
to practice calligraphy tonight.

693
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,700
Don't leave this room.

694
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,860
Father.

695
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,180
What are you up to?

696
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,540
You...

697
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,660
Are you trying to do something
to my brother?

698
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,060
He's my brother!

699
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,380
You fool!

700
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,519
He's a curse

701
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,340
that's been suppressing you!

702
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,079
Now that he's left the capital,

703
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,860
you don't have to worry about him.

704
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,239
Anyway,

705
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,509
no matter what happens tonight,

706
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,540
it's for your future.

707
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,380
Remember.

708
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,460
Keep calm and composed.

709
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,860
Practice well.

710
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,279
Keep an eye on him,

711
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,620
or else you'd be dead too!

712
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,250
Yes, Your Grace.

713
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,529
I've asked around the Capital,

714
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:41,300
but all of them said
they couldn't fix this.

715
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,060
Mr. Chen.

716
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,820
You said you could fix anything, right?

717
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:50,620
It's not that I don't want to fix it.

718
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,399
Look how broken it is.

719
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,100
The cracks are too irregular,

720
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,580
and it's made from a rare material.

721
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,820
I really can't

722
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,540
make it done.

723
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,839
Mr. Chen, you know

724
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,399
that I can pay for this.

725
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,820
Help me.

726
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,300
I am a craftsman, not a businessman.

727
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,900
I can't do anything

728
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,620
that might tarnish my reputation.

729
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,500
Mr. Chen.

730
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,840
Take a look around!

731
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,839
Mr. Chen, please try.

732
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,799
Try fixing it, Mr. Chen!

733
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,940
You...

734
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,519
Mr. Chen!

735
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,660
Sit down.

736
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,140
You...

737
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,380
Fu,

738
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,820
where's my office token?

739
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,129
I thought

740
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,899
you carry it with you all the time.

741
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,040
Try searching again.

742
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,180
It's not here. Where is it?

743
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,300
Go back home and search.

744
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,340
Wait.

745
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,940
Forget it, I'll go back
and search myself.

746
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,660
It's the Duke!

747
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,540
Youming.

748
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,940
Are you going to sell your paintings?

749
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,119
Oh, no.

750
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,279
I'm heading to the Military Command.

751
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,180
I'm on duty today.

752
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,300
Why don't you join us for a drink?

753
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,159
A drink? But I...

754
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,319
No more buts.

755
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,639
Everyone knows that your mother-in-law

756
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,020
got you a boring, useless job.

757
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,399
I invited a few senior officials
from the Military Command to join us.

758
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,460
They can help your
career progression, see?

759
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,660
- This way.
- Come on.

760
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,359
Let's go.

761
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,500
This way.

762
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,100
Come on.

763
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,740
(Yizhi Hall Account Book)

764
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,380
There's a fire over there!

765
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,800
Fire!

766
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,180
Near the gates!

767
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,140
Su Xin.

768
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,219
What's with the commotion outside?

769
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,770
There's a fire
outside the residence.

770
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,260
I've already checked it out.

771
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,380
A fire?

772
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,519
(Natural Grace and Talent)

773
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,660
Your Ladyship,

774
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,499
there's a fire at the North Gate.

775
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,020
The fire is getting serious,

776
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,780
so we've already sent a request

777
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,180
to the Military Command.

778
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,980
Someone should be here soon
to extinguish the flames.

779
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,660
That looks serious.

780
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,639
I don't think we can wait

781
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,860
till they arrive.

782
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,239
General Yan, take some men with you
to put the fire out.

783
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,340
His Lordship has ordered me

784
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,380
to stay here and protect you.

785
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,879
Don't worry.

786
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,970
If His Lordship were here,

787
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,540
he would've asked you to do the same.

788
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,860
Besides, I still have Mr. Chen,

789
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,180
Su Xin, and Su Lan with me.

790
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,119
Go and help them.

791
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,300
If that's what you wish.

792
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,399
You guys stay here and
protect Her Ladyship.

793
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,359
As for the others, follow me!

794
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,500
- Yes, General!
- Yes, General!

795
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,239
What's your business here?

796
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,159
Sir.

797
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,690
I have been ordered to clear the road
for the imperial carriage.

798
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,780
(Military Command)

799
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,220
Open the gates!

800
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,179
- You may enter.
- Thank you, sir.

801
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,320
Let's go.

802
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,359
Hold it!

803
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,740
What's on the wagon?

804
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,300
That's very treacherous of you.

805
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,719
That woman named Dou Zhao

806
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,679
has tens of thousands of gold taels.

807
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,020
Are you trying to keep

808
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,460
all the bounty to yourself?

809
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,790
Even the imperial treasury
doesn't have that much money.

810
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,010
Who told you that?

811
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,119
That's none of your concern.

812
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,290
You can take Yizhi Hall,

813
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,239
but I'm taking all the shops
and food warehouses

814
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,119
at the North Gates!

815
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,260
Move it!

816
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,879
Boss, this is...

817
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,879
Make this a quick battle.

818
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,020
Go!

819
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,860
Your Majesty.

820
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,300
Lord Song, what is it?

821
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:50,020
I have something urgent
to report.

822
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,500
Please pass my message.

823
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,420
His Majesty has just taken his medicine,

824
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,020
and he's finally getting some rest.

825
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,420
Anything can wait till morning.

826
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:59,509
I noticed that the Capital
seemed to be lit up in flames.

827
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,599
Something terrible must have happened.

828
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,220
- I don't think we can wait.
- Lord Song.

829
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,300
As the Emperor's servant, you should
be sharing His Majesty's burden.

830
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,980
Right now, our priority
is to help His Majesty recuperate.

831
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,039
Moreover,

832
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,300
the Military Command
will protect the capital.

833
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,220
Your sole responsibility
is to protect His Majesty.

834
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,879
(Jieyi Hall)

835
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,119
Someone opened the West Gate!

836
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,479
The bandits are rushing in!

837
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,039
If those bandits dare to come here,

838
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,420
I'll make sure
they'll never leave here again.

839
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,860
Hey, lady.

840
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,420
