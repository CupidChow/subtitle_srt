1
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:07,790
Madam.

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,310
There's nowhere to hide it.

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,430
Yes. We can't hide it.

4
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:17,969
Go.

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,640
Paste it on for me.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,640
The more obvious it is, the better.

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,640
Let's go.

8
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,710
I remember now.

9
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,400
Madam asked me to hide this

10
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:19,910
for you.

11
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,229
(His Majesty won't treat me
badly.)

12
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,349
(The disaster is due to the seawall.)

13
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,900
(Many are involved in this corruption.)

14
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,240
What happened back then?

15
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,070
This letter

16
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,070
was written on a painting originally.

17
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,240
Madam.

18
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:42,830
Madam.

19
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,390
Madam.

20
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,310
You've received a letter
from the Duke of Ding.

21
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,140
(To: Huisun, My Beloved Sister)

22
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,830
My brother is playing this
hidden message game with me again.

23
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,160
Get me a brush

24
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,760
with some tea for me to dip in.

25
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,950
Don't worry.

26
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,670
His Majesty won't treat me
badly in the Capital City.

27
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,160
The disaster caused by the hurricane
in Futing is due to the seawall.

28
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,440
Many are involved in this corruption.

29
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,040
I'll take this up to His Majesty.

30
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,860
(Mu Chuan, Dou Shishu,
Song Yichun, Dou Shiying)

31
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,699
Madam.

32
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,070
Why did you cough up blood?

33
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,600
Qi Xia.

34
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,529
Dry this painting for me.

35
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,809
Don't give it to anyone.

36
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,390
Don't tell anybody about this.

37
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,230
Except for Lord Song.

38
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,019
Yes, Madam.

39
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,160
Go now.

40
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,790
Where should I hide it?

41
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,369
Madam.

42
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,720
Where should I hide it?

43
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,560
There's nowhere to hide it.

44
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,200
Qi Xia.

45
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,560
Paste it on for me.

46
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,830
The more obvious it is, the better.

47
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,560
Don't worry, Madam.

48
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,329
I'll hand it over to Lord Song.

49
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,470
Go now.

50
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,720
Okay.

51
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,040
Father.

52
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,440
How can you do this?

53
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,459
She is my mother.

54
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,240
She is not your mother.

55
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,499
Me, you and Shuyao

56
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,000
are the true family.

57
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,729
Now,

58
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,379
your mother has suffered
so many years because of me.

59
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,150
I don't want to let her suffer anymore.

60
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,540
(Song Yichun, Dou Shiying)

61
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,950
We know the truth now.

62
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,120
With this list in our hands,

63
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,590
Lord Qing's life is in our hands too.

64
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,529
He touched the foundation
of the country.

65
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,920
We have solid evidence against him.

66
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,440
His Majesty is a wise emperor.

67
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,590
His Majesty is in failing health.

68
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,440
Will he end up like the Duke of Ding?

69
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,059
Besides, too many people
are involved in this.

70
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,680
We don't know how it'll turn out.

71
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,680
Why is my father's name on this list?

72
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,760
My Fifth Uncle
is Lord Qing's accomplice.

73
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,470
Is he trying to drag
my father down with him?

74
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,119
=Blossom=
(Adapted from the novel "Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

75
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,199
=Episode 31=

76
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,039
(Dou's Residence)

77
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,320
Why are you back?

78
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,880
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

79
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,059
Wait.

80
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,939
Gao Sheng.

81
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,100
Make a pot of tea
with my newly acquired Longjing tea.

82
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,169
Yes, Master.

83
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,289
Leave us.

84
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,430
No need to serve us.

85
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,560
I have things to tell you too.

86
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,900
Gao Sheng.

87
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,680
Seventh Master.

88
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,980
(Buyer: Dou Shiying)

89
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,670
Father.

90
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,219
The mansions that you are looking at

91
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,520
are quite costly.

92
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,849
I bought these mansions

93
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,590
as safety nets for you.

94
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,040
Not long ago, I got some extra money.

95
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,520
I invested in the Capital's
new Yunfei Silverhouse.

96
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,230
Their profit margin is amazing.

97
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:53,309
Using the profit from Yunfei Silverhouse
to pay for the house installment

98
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,450
is just nice.

99
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,529
I know all the jewelers

100
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,670
in the capital.

101
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,800
Why have I never heard
about Yunfei Silverhouse?

102
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:03,859
Father.

103
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,230
You are a naive and easily swayed man.

104
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,830
Don't simply invest in something.

105
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,200
I don't want you
to lose all your savings

106
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,030
for some meager profits.

107
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,389
I'm at the Ministry
of Revenue after all.

108
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,899
I've looked at their accounts.

109
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,440
The Silverhouse has great craftsmanship.

110
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,080
It has many customers.

111
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,649
Official Mu introduced us to that shop.

112
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,480
Shishu and I have invested
some money into it.

113
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,560
It's a profitable business.

114
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,240
Lord Song.

115
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,529
I've found out about everything.

116
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:36,990
The one who's running the Silverhouse

117
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,990
is the Duke of Jing's family,
the Zhang family.

118
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,070
Who else

119
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,230
in the capital has invested in it?

120
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,710
The staff there refuses
to reveal anything.

121
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,979
I've asked the people around.

122
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,200
Those who visit the place

123
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,800
are mostly high-ranking
ministers and officials.

124
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,870
The Zhang family is wealthy.

125
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,480
They spent tens of thousands of taels
just to renovate their yard.

126
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,679
With him running the place,

127
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,449
I'm sure it's safe since many of us

128
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,800
are the investors too.

129
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,040
You are at the Ministry of Revenue.

130
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,680
I'm sure you know the condition
of the court right now.

131
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,099
The annual tax revenue
is three million taels of silver.

132
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,110
But the expenditure
is six million taels of silver.

133
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,529
The court is losing money

134
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,160
and the people are having a hard time.

135
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:18,080
So, how could the Zhang family spend
tens of thousands of taels so easily?

136
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,929
What's the salary of the Duke of Jing?

137
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,470
What makes them so wealthy?

138
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,280
Maybe

139
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,590
he has some side businesses going on.

140
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,870
He's making money with money.

141
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,230
Public and private money

142
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,619
are different.

143
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,760
Father.

144
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,800
The Zhang family
is Her Majesty's birth family.

145
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,170
Their family comes from
the horse market in Liaodong.

146
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,469
Lord Qing and His Highness
are against each other now.

147
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,170
They are using those profits
to bring those ministers to their side.

148
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,800
How can you put them together?

149
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,230
Business is business.

150
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,040
The court is the court.

151
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,590
The Duke of Jing has never
cared about political matters.

152
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,040
Do you really think
that they are not related?

153
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,120
Let me ask you.

154
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,870
Did you sign your name when you invested

155
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,160
in the Silverhouse?

156
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,280
It's very clear that Lord Qing
is going to fight for the crown.

157
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,899
By signing a contract with him,

158
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,680
you are bound to him now.

159
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,950
No matter what he does in the future,

160
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,350
you can only support him

161
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,800
or act ignorance.

162
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,110
I'm not trying to gang up with anyone.

163
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,049
Fifth Uncle is already
a member of their gang.

164
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,450
That's why he dragged you into this.

165
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,280
He wants to use
your relationship with Yantang

166
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,190
to drag him down too

167
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,760
by forcing him to follow their orders.

168
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,670
Fighting for the crown
and forming gangs.

169
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,350
Our entire family will be in danger
if we are tied to these matters.

170
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,520
No.

171
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,350
I need to get out of this business.

172
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,809
Father.

173
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,070
Let me do it for you.

174
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,750
I'll go to the Silverhouse now.

175
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,590
Ms. Longevity.

176
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,419
Yantang.

177
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,830
What should we do now?

178
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,160
How about I take a leave

179
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,950
or resign?

180
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:16,950
Father-in-law.

181
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,520
Even if you resign,

182
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,590
you'll still be Ms. Longevity's father

183
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,350
and my father-in-law.

184
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,750
I promised Ms. Longevity
that I'll protect her family.

185
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,710
Their target is me.

186
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,280
I'll take care of this.

187
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,190
Summon the secret guards.

188
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,710
Your Lordship.

189
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,280
Lord Qing and the others
are investigating our men now.

190
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:41,070
What if they trap us all?

191
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,760
If he really wants to set up traps
in the Capital City,

192
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,750
he can never control who's the hunter

193
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,520
and who's the prey.

194
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,200
Secret guards?

195
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,780
(Yunfei Silverhouse)

196
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,739
Mr. Wang.

197
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,099
- Welcome.
- Okay.

198
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,280
- Welcome.
- Come.

199
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,719
Come.

200
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,860
Take care.

201
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,280
Duchess of Ying.

202
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,649
Our Ladyship is here
to propose a business to your owner.

203
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,280
Please notify Madam Wei about it.

204
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,169
I'm an impatient woman
with a bad temper.

205
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,590
She better come here quickly.

206
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,000
Otherwise, if I make a scene here,

207
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,830
it'll affect your business.

208
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,590
I'll inform our owner
about it right away.

209
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,040
Feel free to shop around.

210
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,870
Take a look.

211
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,760
Your Ladyship.

212
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,640
Please follow me.

213
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,569
I'll pay ten times
the price of the capital

214
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,280
that my father invested
plus the interest.

215
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,780
We can negotiate on the customer base
of the Miao family's shop

216
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,870
as well as the craftsmen
of the Zhaowen Bookstore.

217
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,870
In exchange for the contract
my father signed.

218
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,200
I would like to terminate it.

219
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,160
This is

220
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,110
like a windfall deal for you, right?

221
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:40,990
Your Ladyship.

222
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,830
According to the rules
of the Silverhouse,

223
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,160
once the contract is signed,

224
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,809
you can't terminate it

225
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,640
regardless of the profit and loss.

226
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,350
So, the rules of the Silverhouse

227
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,400
is stricter than the law of the country.

228
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,590
You call it an investment.

229
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,590
But it sounds like selling yourself.

230
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,070
Madam Wei has always put profit first.

231
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,750
But you've changed out of the blue.

232
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,529
Looks like the illegal benefits
that the Silverhouse is making

233
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,590
is more than what I can offer.

234
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,440
How dare you say that?

235
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,569
What benefits have the ladies

236
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,590
of the Dou family ever given us?

237
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,750
You just continue to feed
on the Wei family

238
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,070
and destroy us.

239
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,859
Your father and your uncle are lucky

240
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,070
that we've allowed them to invest in us.

241
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,750
How dare you feel so emboldened to think

242
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,640
that you can terminate the contract
on behalf of your father and uncle?

243
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,320
Go ahead and cause a scene here.

244
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,950
I don't believe

245
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,520
that the Shengtian Prison
will get you off the hook.

246
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,200
Wei Tingzhen.

247
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,680
I've tried to be courteous first.

248
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,870
I've shown you some respect today.

249
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,400
In the future,

250
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,690
you won't be receiving
the same treatment.

251
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,800
In the future?

252
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,170
In the future,
when someone else takes over the crown,

253
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,470
you and your husband

254
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,979
will perish.

255
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,350
How can you disrespect me then?

256
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,509
(Official Letter,
Commander of the Shadow Guard)

257
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,020
(To be opened at
the Northern Pacification Bureau Hall)

258
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,499
They say that it's hard to break
the addiction to gambling.

259
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,950
Why do you think it's like that?

260
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,160
Once someone

261
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,169
has experienced the feeling
of earning money tenfold

262
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,739
and becoming a wealthy person overnight,

263
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,950
that thrill

264
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,800
is something they can't forget
even at the cost of their fingers.

265
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,470
That's what happening
at Lord Qing's gambling table.

266
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,280
You can loan money and
pay them back with interest.

267
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,640
The more you gamble,

268
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,680
the more money you can make.

269
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,920
I've quit gambling
since a long time ago.

270
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,640
I'm afraid

271
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,680
that I can't accept your gift.

272
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,660
Sure.

273
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,810
Something has been stolen
from His Highness's residence today.

274
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,310
And the culprit is caught red-handed.

275
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,750
What should we do now?

276
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,169
Lord Qing has written a letter

277
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,750
to recommend you
as the Pacification envoy.

278
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,160
Will Song Mo save you?

279
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,080
Even if you are not willing to join us,

280
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,470
there will be more

281
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,510
who are willing.

282
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,480
Another thing,

283
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,440
don't forget about Miss Zhao.

284
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,409
Dou Shishu asked Zou Er to deliver
an invitation card

285
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,580
to meet you at the Silverhouse

286
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,099
at midnight tomorrow to discuss

287
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,649
about the business contract.

288
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,790
Our men are ready.

289
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,550
Dou Shishu is a ruthless

290
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,030
and selfish man.

291
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,649
He won't hand over the signed contract

292
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,950
unless you pledge your loyalty to him.

293
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,379
You should stay away

294
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,880
from this treacherous banquet.

295
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,619
Wait until we find
what's behind the Silverhouse.

296
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,760
No.

297
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,400
Lord Qing has already made his stand
during the martial arts competition.

298
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,440
He won't give me time to drag this out.

299
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,440
Haven't you realised?

300
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,400
Official Lu's visit has gotten
far and few lately.

301
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,160
Other than taking care of you,

302
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,360
Official Lu is only in charge
of His Majesty.

303
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,750
Has His Majesty's illness worsened?

304
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,200
The arrow has been nocked.

305
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,640
If I can't become Lord Qing's blade,

306
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,440
I'll become a thorn
that he has to get rid of.

307
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,169
- Your Ladyship.
- Your Ladyship.

308
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,790
Did you manage to retrieve the contract?

309
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,440
I've gotten something
that may be even better than that.

310
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,880
Our weakness is their flaw.

311
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,550
The stars have gone to sleep
behind the clouds.

312
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,840
Time to rest.

313
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,689
Midnight has arrived.

314
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,929
Time to close your shops.

315
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,070
Hurry up.

316
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,950
I never thought that I would be

317
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,640
welcomed personally
by Official Dou one day.

318
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,740
I thought you wouldn't be here.

319
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,450
Looks like you really care
about my brother.

320
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,440
Unfortunately, the way
we care about him is different.

321
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:16,200
Please, a moment.

322
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,030
We do business here.

323
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,710
I need to protect our jewelry here.

324
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,160
Please leave your weapons at the door.

325
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,400
He has received special permission

326
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,510
from His Majesty to carry
his sword at all times.

327
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,160
If you think of me as an enemy,

328
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,720
there's no need for us
to meet each other here.

329
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,929
This is an important family matter.

330
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,030
I just want to meet you alone

331
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,920
and drink some tea.

332
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,139
Wait for me outside.

333
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,280
Yes.

334
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,840
You've been avoiding me.

335
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,550
So, I have no choice
but to trick you here.

336
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,030
Don't blame Official Dou.

337
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,890
This is the path that Official Dou
has chosen for himself.

338
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,270
Why should I blame him?

339
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,790
I really have the snow lingzhi.

340
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,600
After your poison has been neutralized,

341
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,160
you can live a long life
with your wife and your children.

342
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,530
In the future, we can have
the brain from the Dou family

343
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,950
and the brawn from the Duke of Ying.

344
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,640
And the country can be at peace.

345
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,310
Isn't that great?

346
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,320
If I neutralize my poison,

347
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,440
I can't neutralize my grudge.

348
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,969
Across history,

349
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,710
many sacrifices had to be made

350
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,440
before a wise emperor could be crowned.

351
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,170
It's just a path that has to be taken.

352
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,120
It's not a destination.

353
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,160
If it's because of your mother,

354
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:56,099
I can give you Song Han's head

355
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,160
tomorrow to show

356
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,950
my sincerity.

357
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,680
Your uncle halted my plan.

358
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,030
It's true that Mother and I
intend to eliminate him.

359
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,120
However, the Duke of Ding
was a meritorious general.

360
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,619
If nothing had occurred

361
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,360
between him and Father,

362
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,790
he wouldn't have ended up this way.

363
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,920
He died because of his blind loyalty.

364
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,139
Shouldn't his departed soul

365
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,750
resent Wang Ge,

366
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,920
me, or Mother?

367
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,710
The twelve imperial gold decrees
that summoned Yue Fei back

368
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,710
were issued by Zhao Gou,

369
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,270
not Qin Hui.

370
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,520
Yes.

371
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,440
In front of Yue Fei's statue,

372
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,160
Zhao Gou should kneel
and accept criticism.

373
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,790
Even so, Qin Hui would never
be able to stand up again.

374
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,790
Song Mo,

375
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,400
His Highness has given you
enough respect.

376
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,270
If you still continue to defy him,

377
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,619
you'll die here tonight

378
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,880
for assassinating Lord Qing.

379
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,880
And Ms. Longevity will become a widow.

380
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,160
Can you still take your revenge?

381
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,400
Your Highness, you're good
at manipulating people.

382
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,000
However,

383
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,120
wise men

384
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,950
tend to fall into their own traps.

385
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,139
I told you before,

386
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,750
your army is weak.

387
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,440
Song Mo, how dare you

388
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,540
attempt to murder a prince!

389
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,619
Do you know
what punishment you will face?

390
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,500
If my revenge
were only about taking his life,

391
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,080
I could succeed tonight.

392
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,240
Don't forget

393
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,619
you came here for the agreement.

394
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,840
You forgot that,

395
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,880
not me.

396
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,480
Don't worry.

397
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,550
The agreement
in the secret chamber downstairs

398
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,270
will remain intact.

399
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,600
I measured it.

400
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,230
The main hall is sixteen steps long
and twelve steps wide.

401
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:20,750
There are three rooms inside

402
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,600
with six pillars.

403
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,360
I confirmed

404
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,310
the difference between the interior
and exterior is one zhang.

405
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,600
There must be a secret chamber.

406
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,779
When you confront Lord Qing,

407
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,400
I'll blow open the outer wall

408
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,640
and retrieve the agreement.

409
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,639
Your Highness!

410
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,620
(Silver Ornament Store)

411
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,000
Your Lordship,

412
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,470
all the agreements are here.

413
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:52,680
Well done.

414
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,269
Song Mo is insane.

415
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:03,899
He set off gunpowder in the street

416
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,230
and endangered the people's lives.

417
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,750
He must be executed immediately.

418
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,990
I will hand over all of this

419
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,819
and the Duke of Ding's letter

420
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,790
to His Majesty.

421
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,440
What do you think His Majesty

422
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,950
will decide about your crime
of fraternizing?

423
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,360
Jiang Meisun owned a troop
in the southeast,

424
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,600
and you intended to blow up the capital.

425
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,400
Everyone bears witness tonight.

426
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,920
The Jiang family

427
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,680
is no longer loyalists.

428
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,360
You don't deserve
to mention the Jiang family.

429
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:38,870
Your Lordship.

430
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,710
Song Mo attempted to assassinate me.

431
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,120
Whoever kills him

432
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,750
will earn the greatest reward.

433
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,690
Hold up!

434
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,480
Make way.

435
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,460
Stay still.

436
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,540
Yantang.

437
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,040
Why are you here?

438
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,199
Lord Qing, Duke of Ying,
and Official Dou,

439
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,470
please come with me to the palace.

440
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,990
Are you blind?

441
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,969
Song Mo set fire
and attempted to assassinate me.

442
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,120
He should be executed.

443
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,970
This evil woman plotted against me.

444
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,550
She deserves no better.

445
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,680
Yantang.

446
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,209
Finally, I've found

447
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,120
your weakness.

448
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,299
I only follow the imperial decree.

449
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,550
Please don't blame me, Your Highness.

450
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,550
People said it's inauspicious
for pregnant women to see blood.

451
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,200
You shouldn't have come.

452
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,120
Didn't we agree

453
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,400
to face everything together,

454
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,950
no matter what happened?

455
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,080
I'll enter the palace with you.

456
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:30,380
(Qianqing Palace)

457
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,169
(Intermediary: Wei Tingzhen, Proposer)

458
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,570
Father, please investigate wisely.

459
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,680
Song Mo deliberately set a trap
and started the fire.

460
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,510
If I hadn't defended myself,

461
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,790
I might not have survived
to meet you now.

462
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,750
Is that something a prince should say?

463
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,680
Your Majesty,

464
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,710
(Revere Heaven and Ancestral Wisdom)
Lord Qing formed a faction,

465
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,400
embezzled massive funds,

466
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,139
and fraternized with important officials

467
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,640
under the name of Silverhouse
in the capital.

468
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:05,310
They committed bureaucratic corruption
and exploited the people.

469
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,310
The list of his fraction
and the agreement are here.

470
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,270
Please make your judgment, Your Majesty.

471
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,470
Are the important officials
you mentioned

472
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,249
those who impeached the Crown Prince

473
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,440
a couple of days ago?

474
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,990
You instigated me to fight
against my brother

475
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,120
for your own vengeance, didn't you?

476
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,880
Words may be fabricated,

477
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:27,270
but signatures and thumbprints can't.

478
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,339
Over a million silver taels
in this ledger

479
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,270
can be tracked as clear as day.

480
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,840
I request a thorough investigation
into every residence involved.

481
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,240
Your Majesty.

482
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:41,680
Duke of Ying,

483
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,139
this incident involves many parties.

484
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,920
His Majesty is exhausted now.

485
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,590
Your Majesty.

486
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,000
Your Majesty.

487
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,780
Lord Yu'an, Lord Jihuai,
and Duke of Qing

488
00:27:53,781 --> 00:27:54,880
request an audience.

489
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,660
All the lords are inside.

490
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,440
Even the key ministers

491
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,360
intend to impeach Song Mo.

492
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,510
He sent himself to his demise.

493
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,640
Do you want to follow him as well?

494
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,880
You blew up

495
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,790
the secret chamber, didn't you?

496
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,480
Do you know the punishment
for illegal explosive manufacturing?

497
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,390
Capital crime.

498
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,470
However, Fifth Uncle,
you're in charge of the military,

499
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,470
and your niece secretly made explosives.

500
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,030
You made this happen.

501
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,900
- You!
- By then,

502
00:28:38,901 --> 00:28:40,230
will the Empress and Lord Qing

503
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,750
sacrifice you

504
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,510
to die with me and Song Mo?

505
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,120
You... You're so despicable.

506
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,570
Are you trying to drag
the Dou family down with you?

507
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,790
I'm protecting the Dou family.

508
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,619
Lord Qing embezzled national funds,

509
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,880
and the evidence is conclusive.

510
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,470
His Majesty is a wise ruler.

511
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,920
Besides, this incident
has startled many parties.

512
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:04,510
His Majesty must make a decision.

513
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,750
Madam Dou, you may be good
at managing household affairs,

514
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,550
but you underestimate
the court politics.

515
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:17,550
You must be tired, Official Dou.

516
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:18,819
Go take a rest.

517
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,030
Yes, Your Highness.

518
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,360
You'll become a mother soon.

519
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,920
You should understand how parents think.

520
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,990
Even though Song Mo
has a rightful reason,

521
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,470
he's still an official.

522
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:34,779
Youting may have committed
a grave mistake,

523
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,200
but he's His Majesty's son.

524
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,200
His Majesty isn't just
Lord Qing's father,

525
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:43,030
he's the father of this nation.

526
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,009
All the more reason

527
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:46,160
he should consider the bigger picture.

528
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,009
If every official who commits corruption

529
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,249
were executed,

530
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:52,080
how would the imperial court operate?

531
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,440
Would the people still have faith in it?

532
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,810
The law doesn't punish
when too many people are guilty,

533
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,120
let alone their own families.

534
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,990
Lord Yu'an is His Majesty's uncle,

535
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,790
and Lord Jihuai is his blood brother.

536
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,640
The agreement might not serve as proof,

537
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,539
but it's definitely a giant stone

538
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,400
to crush you.

539
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,449
Song Mo was just promoted to the Command
of Military Command,

540
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,750
yet he exploded the Silverhouse
and committed theft.

541
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,729
You command the Imperial Guard,

542
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,640
yet you assault a prince in public.

543
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,030
(Lord Yu'an, Lord Jihuai)
How arrogant of you.

544
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,550
You've disgraced the imperial favor.

545
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:31,640
You must be punished severely
to quell public wrath.

546
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,230
According to the law,

547
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,590
royal family members must not interfere
in court affairs.

548
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,729
I failed my duty and committed arson.

549
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,400
I admit it.

550
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,440
But if your name appears
on the agreement,

551
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:47,200
will you admit it or not?

552
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,810
Your Majesty, the founding emperor left us
ancestral teachings.

553
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,800
If the family is at peace,
the nation will be stable.

554
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,720
The royal family is a role model
for the people.

555
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,360
Filial piety is the main principle
in governance.

556
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:02,120
Familial suspicions and brotherly discord
are the greatest taboos.

557
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,080
As an official,

558
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,339
he instigated disharmony
within the royal family.

559
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,080
He deserves a million deaths.

560
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:11,370
It was I who held your hand

561
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,209
as you transcribed every single sentence
of the ancestral teachings.

562
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,350
Your Majesty,

563
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:16,830
have you forgotten?

564
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,579
Song Mo's accusation

565
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,249
is merely an attempt
to absolve his family's crimes.

566
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,710
Your Majesty, you're wise.

567
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,400
You must be able to discern
his base intention.

568
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,660
- Your Majesty, please decide wisely.
- Your Majesty, please decide wisely.

569
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,920
This agreement

570
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,470
is stained with blood.

571
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,200
I can't read it clearly.

572
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,819
You've been kneeling until now.

573
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,979
You've done more than enough as a wife.

574
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,710
You should consider yourself.

575
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,920
Divorce Song Mo
and return to the Dou family.

576
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,400
Your fifth uncle can
keep your family safe,

577
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,969
and I'll keep a position

578
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,400
for you.

579
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,160
Becoming the wife of a guilty official

580
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,310
or a noble lady

581
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,440
is an easy choice.

582
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,550
Who I choose to be

583
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,030
isn't about whose wife I am

584
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,120
or daughter I am.

585
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,120
It depends on who I am.

586
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,360
A person with integrity
walks their own path.

587
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:50,880
I'll be waiting here
until Song Mo comes out.

588
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,600
The path of a ruler
and the path of an official

589
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,510
are different.

590
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,379
If Song Mo were to leave here

591
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,249
with a clear name,

592
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,440
there would only be one path.

593
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,680
That's to admit
that his actions tonight

594
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,689
were ordered by his father-in-law

595
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,600
and placed all the blame on Dou Shiying.

596
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,710
On this agreement,

597
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,359
I can only recognize

598
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,510
Dou Shiying's name.

599
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,360
You went to Yunfei Silverhouse
for him, didn't you?

600
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,319
He must've become dotard

601
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,940
and driven you and Youting apart.

602
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:34,400
I barged into Yunfei Silverhouse
and started the fire.

603
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,400
Father-in-law has no idea about it.

604
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,470
If you want to punish someone,

605
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,950
please punish me alone.

606
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,579
It has nothing to do with others.

607
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,720
Song Mo!

608
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,960
Your Majesty.

609
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,920
His Majesty cherish your talent.

610
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,680
Please don't be stubborn
and take the blame.

611
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,899
Your future will be wasted.

612
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,969
Your Majesty,

613
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,360
given Song Mo's action tonight,

614
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:00,539
it's unforgivable.

615
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,239
Each offense deserves death.

616
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,819
Your Majesty, you mustn't
show leniency on him.

617
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,169
If you don't execute him,

618
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,819
are you waiting for him
to kill the entire royal family?

619
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,040
How dare you!

620
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,790
Should I send it to the Directorate
of the Credentials for cleansing

621
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,310
or burn it?

622
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,830
Keep it.

623
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,949
Don't release it yet.

624
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:35,090
Yes, Your Majesty.

625
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,970
You have done well.

626
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:45,080
Your mother has raised you well.

627
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,750
If it weren't for tonight,

628
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,779
I wouldn't have realized

629
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:53,270
how much my uncle and brother

630
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,640
cherish you.

631
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,270
Father.

632
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,680
To achieve big,

633
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:06,520
one has to weigh the pros and cons.

634
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,030
Impulse

635
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,920
will only ruin everything.

636
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,870
Dou Shiying incited court officials

637
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,870
to frame princes

638
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,910
and cause chaos in the capital.

639
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,059
Guards.

640
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,290
Your Majesty,

641
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:24,779
I will not weigh the pros and cons

642
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,640
or abandon innocent people
for personal gain.

643
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,120
If you must arrest someone,

644
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,870
I'll admit the crime.

645
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,280
If Uncle were alive,

646
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,390
he would never allow me

647
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,750
to sacrifice someone important

648
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,120
for my personal gain.

649
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:41,400
This is ludicrous.

650
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,780
How dare you pressure His Majesty
with a disgraced official?

651
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,830
Do you have no regard for the monarch?

652
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:50,040
Are you trying to continue

653
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:53,750
Jiang Meisun's rebellion?

654
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,070
What did you just say?

655
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,779
You drew your sword
in His Majesty's presence.

656
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,779
Are you trying
to assassinate the emperor?

657
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,659
I'll kill you.

658
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,390
Are you insane, Song Mo?

659
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:08,750
Staying sober

660
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:12,200
is a hundred times more painful
than madness.

661
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,080
Abandoning justice for the family.

662
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,040
You've done this more than once.

663
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,040
Why should I still endure this?

664
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:29,040
Why should I still have hope in you?

665
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,190
Your Majesty.

666
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,000
Your Majesty.

667
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:45,080
You

668
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,710
have always

669
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,390
hated me.

670
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,380

(Qianqing Palace)

676
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,070
By the imperial decree of His Majesty,

677
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,529
Song Mo neglected his duties,

678
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:36,310
causing an incident at Changle Street.

679
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,719
In consideration of his past merits,

680
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,719
his death sentence is pardoned.

681
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,180
He's stripped of all official positions

682
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,959
and will be detained in prison

683
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,380
for further judgment.

684
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,220
What a shame, Duchess of Ying.

00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:25,719

Godfather, just focus
on looking after His Majesty.

725
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,820
His Majesty is ill.

726
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,820
How could he issue an edict?

727
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,839

00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,359

00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,620
If he isn't executed publicly,

736
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,060
the public wrath can't be quelled.

737
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,900
Ji Jianming,

738
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,820
what are you doing here?

739
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,340
How dare you!

740
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,260
His Highness regards me as his mentor.

741
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,500
Who are you to call me by my name?

742
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,100
Dou Zhao is my sister-in-law

743
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:47,380
as well as the Duchess of Ying.

744
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,260
It's natural for me

745
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,700
to take her back.

746
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,639
However, as an outsider,

747
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,780
you took her away

748
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,140
when she was unconscious.

749
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,420
Don't think
I don't know your intentions.

750
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,500
You abduct Dou Zhao
to control Song Mo's power.

751
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,020
You're the one

752
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,620
with ulterior intentions.

753
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:12,379
Don't think you can escape
after disrupting Lord Qing's plan.

754
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,620
If His Highness finds out
you saved someone he hates,

755
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,020
he will kill you.

756
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,820
When did His Highness ever order you
to target the Duchess?

757
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,220
You've rushed here even before Song Mo's
sentence was issued.

758
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,260
Do you think His Highness
won't notice your intentions?

759
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,660
Intentions or not,

760
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,460
we'll find out.

761
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,620
Search the place!

762
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,119
This Resentment

763
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,719
will bring you excruciating pain.

764
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,420
Take your time and savor the pain.

765
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,700
Yantang.

766
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,220
Yantang.

767
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,620
Yantang.

768
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,559
Madam!

769
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,130
