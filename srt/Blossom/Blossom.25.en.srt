1
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,219
(Accumulate Merit and Virtue)

2
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,390
The abbot said

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,910
that you're welcome to pray

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,910
and offer incense to Buddha,

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,200
but if you're here
to ask about the past,

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,680
the abbot refuses to speak,

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,480
so you should stop
wasting your energy here.

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,310
What a fool you were!

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,609
What a fool you were!

10
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,750
Mo.

11
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,350
I just discovered that Father
was keeping a mistress here.

12
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,080
This is none of your business!

13
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,990
Father!

14
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,200
I know you're upset.

15
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,640
You can vent it out on me.

16
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,739
There's too much misunderstanding
between you and Brother.

17
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,459
I don't want your hatred to grow deeper.

18
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,849
I can be the bad guy.

19
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:10,990
For this family's sake.

20
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:14,190
You!

21
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,390
Your Lordship!

22
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,400
Your Lordship, we found this
inside the woman's house.

23
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,249
I wanted to wear
a decorative knot on my belt,

24
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,680
so I got my maid to make one,

25
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:33,969
but it turned out ugly,

26
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,120
so I burned it.

27
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,400
The decorative knot you burned

28
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,550
was from this woman.

29
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,680
It was Father.

30
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,880
He brought me here
to learn to play the flute,

31
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,600
and she gave me this knot.

32
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,249
I was burning it
when you saw me that day.

33
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,960
I didn't mean to lie...

34
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:55,579
Mo.

35
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,910
You're good at reading faces.

36
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,400
You must know
that I wasn't lying just now.

37
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,080
I have always

38
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,040
respected you since young.

39
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,350
Every family has its
own dirty laundry, right?

40
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,489
I don't understand

41
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,139
why all of you have to

42
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,609
hang our dirty laundry outside?

43
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,200
The Duke of Ying's Residence

44
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,280
has more than just dirty laundry.

45
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,390
You think I can't investigate further

46
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,350
just because this woman is dead?

47
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,880
You think I can assume
nothing has happened,

48
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,040
and that I can reconcile with him?

49
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,350
He's our father, after all.

50
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,979
Men.

51
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,760
Take Second Young Master
back to Yizhi Hall.

52
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,320
- Take him away.
- Brother.

53
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,440
Mo.

54
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,230
I...

55
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,299
Move!

56
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,440
- Mo!
- Come on!

57
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,670
Mo.

58
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,070
You and Mother
were married for 20 years,

59
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,480
and you didn't shed
a tear when she died.

60
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,000
So, it's because
your heart was elsewhere.

61
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,299
That makes sense.

62
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,950
You're selfish and timid.

63
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,280
You wouldn't hide
the daughter of a criminal here

64
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,950
if you didn't really love her.

65
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,280
So what if she's the daughter
of a criminal?

66
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,269
I met someone I loved,

67
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,699
and all I did was keep her here.

68
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,419
I don't need my son

69
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,110
to lecture me!

70
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,390
I feel so bad for my mother.

71
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,559
=Blossom=
(Adapted from the novel "Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

72
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,820
=Episode 25=

73
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,150
Fate and destiny are predestined,

74
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,950
yet you refused to accept it.

75
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,390
Please tell the abbot

76
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,070
that I, Ji Yong, requests an audience.

77
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,409
(Accumulate Merit and Virtue)

78
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,560
The abbot asks you this.

79
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,699
Years ago, Emperor Taizong

80
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,070
launched a bloodbath in the capital
to obtain the throne.

81
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,710
After that, he built this temple

82
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,880
to appease the victims' souls.

83
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,560
In the eyes of the public,

84
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,470
this was for the benefit
for future generations.

85
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,670
What do you think?

86
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:57,510
Emperor Taizong
did so to relieve his guilt.

87
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,220
No matter his intentions back then,

88
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,560
the emperor did something good
for the people.

89
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,880
A century has passed since then.

90
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,320
Why should the people today

91
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:14,270
continue debating about his intentions?

92
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,680
So, you mean that

93
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,880
just because Li Yaoniang
had been praying here

94
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,089
over the past decade or so,

95
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,590
the past deserves to be buried?

96
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,070
Ms. Li decided to hide
her secrets in this temple

97
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,030
because she didn't want
to cause any more killing.

98
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,270
Just like Ms. Dou here,
she had kind intentions.

99
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,890
Now that you know the truth
can harm yourself and other people,

100
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,590
it's best not to ask about the past.

101
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,200
As is said, "Reward will not befall
those who are intentionally kind,

102
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,320
and punishment will not befall
those who are unintentionally evil."

103
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,270
As you said earlier,
intentions do matter.

104
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:53,120
Emperor Taizong was brave enough
to admit his mistakes

105
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,240
and build this temple
to apologize to the dead.

106
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,440
His intention was to redeem himself,

107
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,630
and he worked hard
to restore peace and prosperity.

108
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,360
However, if someone decides

109
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,510
to bury the truth
under the pretense of regret,

110
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,070
subsequently hurting those
who are innocent,

111
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,760
how is that fair?

112
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,259
Your Lordship.

113
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,170
We have seized control
of the entire residence.

114
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,019
You should let Shengtian Court

115
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,630
or the Ministry of Justice
investigate the death of Ms. Li.

116
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,000
It's inappropriate to imprison
both of them in Yizhi Hall.

117
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:29,409
Your eldest uncle and third uncle

118
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,920
has already left for the palace.

119
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,680
That's fast.

120
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,680
It shows that I do have to take

121
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,209
extreme measures to discover the truth.

122
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,760
If the palace officials are here,

123
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,120
they can be my witness.

124
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,830
Eighteen years ago,

125
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,760
both Li Yaoniang and my mother
were pregnant.

126
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,070
Li Yaoniang often visited Wanfo Temple.

127
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,619
Coincidentally,

128
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,360
my mother got startled there
and had a premature birth.

129
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,800
Li Yaoniang is Song Han's mother,

130
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,400
am I right?

131
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:07,880
You're crazy.

132
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,760
You're spouting nonsense.

133
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,240
It's clearly written in the records

134
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,760
that Li Yaoniang was born
to an official in Futing.

135
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,510
Back then, you were leading
a troop of soldiers in Futing.

136
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,800
Her entire family
was thrown into prison,

137
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,510
and the records showed
that you visited her twice.

138
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,329
If she weren't Song Han's birth mother,

139
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,800
why would she have
the same kind of decorative knot?

140
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,320
You've had an affair with her.

141
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,710
Song Mo.

142
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,710
You're just scared that Han

143
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,990
would steal your position.

144
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,750
How could you incriminate him?

145
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,560
Don't forget

146
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,160
that he's your brother!

147
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,350
How could you say that
in front of your mother?

148
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,019
(Virtuous Wife,
Madam Jiang's Memorial Tablet)

149
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,870
Don't you feel any shame

150
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,280
lying in front of my mother?

151
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,070
Ms. Dou, you are right.

152
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,560
However, today's events

153
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,470
weren't the results
of Li Yaoniang's intentions.

154
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,950
One's opinions

155
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,920
might not reflect those of others.

156
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,449
Your standard of interpreting intentions

157
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,870
may be different from mine,

158
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,950
but this doesn't deny the fact
that we all have good intentions.

159
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,350
Please tell us the truth, Abbot,

160
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,160
so as to bring justice to both families.

161
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,750
If you insist, Ms. Dou.

162
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,040
Perhaps you're fated
to resolve this turbulent past.

163
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,070
Eighteen years ago,
on the day of Jingzhe,

164
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:03,320
both Ms. Li and Madam Jiang
were at this temple.

165
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,379
Back then, Ms. Li carried
a one-month-old baby

166
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,470
in her arms,

167
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,040
and she wanted to pray for the baby.

168
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,950
As for Madam Jiang, the Duchess of Ying,
she had a premature birth here.

169
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:21,160
The Duke of Ying said
she gave birth to a baby boy,

170
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,640
but I saw clearly

171
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:30,040
that she gave birth to a baby girl.

172
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,289
(Virtuous Wife,
Madam Jiang's Memorial Tablet)

173
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,430
Father.

174
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,929
Am I really not my mother's real son?

175
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,070
Ridiculous!

176
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,569
Our family records clearly state
that Han is Huisun's son!

177
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,800
A mere decorative knot

178
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,040
cannot upend the truth!

179
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:52,230
Then, have you heard of

180
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,750
a maternity test?

181
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,520
You drip the blood of a child
onto a parent's bone

182
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,520
and see whether the blood seeps in

183
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,160
to determine
if they're related by blood.

184
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,680
Huisun has already been buried.

185
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,739
You dare to dig her grave?

186
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,070
You're not qualified enough
to dig my mother's grave!

187
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,790
Bring her in!

188
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,830
Don't touch her!

189
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,470
Where should we cut?

190
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,769
The skull?

191
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,169
Don't touch her!

192
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,529
Or the leg bone?

193
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,350
Don't touch her!

194
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,160
She has the beautiful hands

195
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,320
of a musician.

196
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,830
You dare?

197
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,110
Why not?

198
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,239
Hold it!

199
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,259
(Loyalty)

200
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,160
I did not let your mother down.

201
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,440
The only person
I have ever let down is her!

202
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,920
Li Yaoniang was her stage name
given by the music office.

203
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,640
She is Li Shuyao, the daughter
of Futing's Magistrate.

204
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,280
Back then, I was just a lowborn
deployed to Futing.

205
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:32,040
I met her at the seaside in Futing.

206
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,800
I was playing the sheng,
and she played the flute.

207
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,800
We played in harmony

208
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,040
and promised to stay together.

209
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,400
But Jiang Meisun

210
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,800
ruined everything!

211
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,040
He raided the Lis' residence

212
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,350
and ruined Shuyao's life!

213
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,640
Then, as fate would have it,

214
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,560
His Majesty

215
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,750
ordered me to marry
the sister of my enemy.

216
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,990
Everything I had wanted for years,

217
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,899
status, career, and wealth

218
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,809
were got overnight.

219
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,920
But later, I met her again
in the Music Office.

220
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:28,230
We had a child.

221
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,590
I checked the magistrate records.

222
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,470
The Li family was incarcerated
because of corruption.

223
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,440
The proceedings
were legal and reasonable.

224
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,520
You think you let her down.

225
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,520
What about my mother?

226
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,640
Even when she died,

227
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,320
she had never held
her real child in her arms.

228
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,590
Where is the child now?

229
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,640
Speak!

230
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,280
That child is already dead.

231
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,929
The Jiangs owe me this!

232
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:17,619
If Jiang Meisun didn't
raid the Lis' residence,

233
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,230
I wouldn't be in this state now!

234
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,280
Han should have been my heir apparent!

235
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,219
My uncle enforced the law justly.

236
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,690
My mother treated you wholeheartedly.

237
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,280
You owe them two lives!

238
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,830
No,

239
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,360
three lives!

240
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,619
Mo!

241
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,929
Father said that out of anger.

242
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,750
You're still his son.

243
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,339
Moreover, His Majesty said

244
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,070
that both of you are...

245
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,520
If you have a shred of conscience left,

246
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,710
tell me the truth.

247
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:46,769
Who helped you

248
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,230
rescue Li Yaoniang
from the Music Office?

249
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,830
There's no such person!

250
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,230
You're still lying!

251
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,320
You snuck a court performer out
and hid her in the capital for years.

252
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,820
It's impossible if you got no help
from high-ranking officials.

253
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,640
Eventually, my mother
discovered her presence.

254
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,870
That's why you killed her.

255
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,750
Your mother was my wife.

256
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,830
Why would I kill her?

257
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,689
She died of illness!

258
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,280
If you didn't intend this,

259
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,619
then you must have
been ordered to do so.

260
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,280
Those people killed my uncle

261
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,499
and wanted to eliminate the Jiangs,

262
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,499
right?

263
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,280
You're spouting nonsense.

264
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,350
Revenge has driven you crazy!

265
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,280
You're right.

266
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,240
Bring the evidence.

267
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,830
Licorice candied fruits.

268
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,520
These are not meant to be taken
with my mother's prescription.

269
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,529
You bought these fruits.

270
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,110
You were the one
who made her die from illness!

271
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,859
I'm not a physician.

272
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,950
How would I know
these foods are contradictory?

273
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,859
These are just candies.

274
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,409
As the master of the household,

275
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,520
why would I care about mere candies?

276
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:06,769
You won't confess?

277
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,070
I have nothing to confess!

278
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,400
You see that?

279
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,040
He forced me to do so.

280
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,750
Take him to the main hall!

281
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,809
- Yes, Your Lordship!
- Mo.

282
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,649
You...

283
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,929
- Mo!
- You!

284
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,070
Move it!

285
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,010
This is an old case that involves

286
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,809
the private affairs
of a prestigious family.

287
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,899
Your interference would only
create more resentment.

288
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,640
Why don't you stay
in your residence first?

289
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,160
I'll brew a pot of tea,

290
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,110
and we can discuss our next step.

291
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:38,560
(Yantang is blinded by hatred now.)

292
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,560
(Song Yichun is in danger.)

293
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,499
(I have to stop him now.)

294
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,569
(Song Mo, Star of Death)

295
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,640
(In a fit of hatred, he began killing)

296
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,859
(to take his revenge.)

297
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,200
(Song Mo's hair turned white
after killing his father and brother.)

298
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,230
(Perhaps it was Li Yaoniang's death
that started it all?)

299
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,750
What's done is done.

300
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,409
Even if you try to stop it now,

301
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:05,080
you can only change things temporarily,
but not forever.

302
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,209
My strength may be minuscule,

303
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,880
and I may not alter my destiny,

304
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,030
but I'll walk alongside him.

305
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,160
Mantis Song is a lucky guy, indeed.

306
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,550
Mo!

307
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:32,929
All I know

308
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,880
is that my mother is Jiang Huisun,

309
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,819
and Song Yichun is our father.

310
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,440
You're my most respected brother.

311
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,440
This family is what I identify with.

312
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,579
You're still pleading for him.

313
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,270
I'm doing this for you.

314
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,610
If you do hate me,

315
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,339
I can kill myself now.

316
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,480
I won't blame you for it.

317
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,640
If you truly see me as your brother,

318
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,550
then tell me,

319
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,270
when did you realize the truth?

320
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,720
Today.

321
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,340
I did feel that things were strange,

322
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,200
but now that Mother is gone,

323
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,470
I was scared that you'd abandon me,

324
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,170
so I pretended that nothing happened.

325
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,790
Mo, please stop!

326
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,110
I beg you.

327
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,440
Remember this?

328
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,600
You gave me this blade
and said you'd let me join you someday.

329
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,990
We confiscated this blade from pirates.

330
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,310
It's yours now.

331
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,379
Thank you.

332
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,620
I know you love grilled venison,

333
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,790
so I'm planning to hunt a deer tomorrow.

334
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,379
Sure.

335
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,990
If you manage to hunt one,

336
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,680
I will ask Father

337
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,200
to assign a position for you in Futing.

338
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,120
It's a deal. Don't break your promise.

339
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,249
Back then, Mother was still alive.

340
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,550
Don't you mention her!

341
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,790
Our uncle died before he could return.

342
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,990
Mother was betrayed and insulted.

343
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,440
If I can't even protect my family,

344
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,440
how could I call myself a son?

345
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,230
Now, even if everyone disagrees with me,

346
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,449
I will restore justice.

347
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,590
Mo.

348
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,470
Please let go of Father

349
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,120
for my sake.

350
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,680
If you still see me as your brother,

351
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,360
return to Xixiang Place now.

352
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,379
- Take him away.
- Yes, Your Lordship!

353
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,520
Mo.

354
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,760
Mo!

355
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,280
Mo!

356
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,680
Mo!

357
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,110
Let go of me!

358
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,579
I am the Duke of Ying!

359
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,339
The emperor will decide who's wrong!

360
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,899
You cannot punish me!

361
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,899
Fine.

362
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,209
As long as you tell me

363
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,080
who's behind all this.

364
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,080
So, that's what you want to know?

365
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,150
Sure.

366
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,470
Burn me, then.

367
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,990
Even the heavens are on my side!

368
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,649
If your mother were still alive,

369
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,539
she'd stop you from doing so!

370
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,009
How dare you still mention her?

371
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,990
I have always loved only Shuyao.

372
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,880
I married Jiang Huisun
only for status and wealth!

373
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,270
Having you with her

374
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:35,310
is the biggest regret of my life!

375
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,489
Your Lordship!

376
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,630
Your Lordship!

377
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,710
You can't even hold your blade firmly.

378
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:44,539
Don't you feel more painful

379
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,270
the more you feel angry?

380
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,750
I'm poisoned.

381
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,470
When did you poison me?

382
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,439
When did you grow

383
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,160
your first strand of white hair?

384
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,969
That day, I punished you
only to warn you,

385
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,339
but Lyu Zheng poisoned you
without my knowledge.

386
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,859
You will never have to know

387
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,649
who's behind this.

388
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:09,510
There's poison on the beating sticks?

389
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,929
When the poison seeps into your bones,

390
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,510
your hair will turn completely white,

391
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,460
and your life will come to an end.

392
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,200
Yantang!

393
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,600
Stop that!

394
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,489
Yantang.

395
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,750
Don't be rash.

396
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:33,920
I once promised you
that I will protect you.

397
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,990
Now, I realize that I've been
living in a lie,

398
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,200
and I can't even protect my family.

399
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,270
That's not it.

400
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,550
You can't turn to the dark side

401
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,760
just because fate is cruel.

402
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,360
If the heavens refuses to be fair,

403
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,779
I will restore justice myself!

404
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,950
Come on!

405
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,550
No matter how difficult and tough
the road ahead is,

406
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,160
I will walk alongside you.

407
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:06,870
Yantang!

408
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,270
Yantang!

409
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,310
Yantang!

410
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,990
Imperial Decree!

411
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,920
His Majesty has decreed

412
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,689
that the Duke of Ying
and his son enter the palace now!

413
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,270
Kill me!

414
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:26,929
If you kill me,

415
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,990
you'll be defying His Majesty's orders!

416
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,550
His Majesty has also decreed

417
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,120
that you will receive treatment
in the palace if you are ill or injured.

418
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,960
Your Lordship!

419
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,480
Yantang!

420
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,249
Yantang!

421
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,139
- Yantang!
- Madam

422
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,920
is not called upon.

423
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,200
You shall stay here.

424
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,350
Your Ladyship!

425
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,600
Yantang!

426
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,720
Your Majesty.

427
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,900
Lord Song is afflicted
with the poison of hatred.

428
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:11,400
This is a very rare poison

429
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:15,619
that doesn't show any initial symptoms,

430
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,680
but when the victim's hair turns white,

431
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,099
that's when the poison takes effect.

432
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,600
It can cause immense pain.

433
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,840
When the victim's hair
turns completely white,

434
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,160
he will die soon.

435
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,680
He's still so young.

436
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,400
How do you cure it?

437
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,510
As its name suggests,

438
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,339
if he can let go of his hatred,

439
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,950
his pain will be relieved.

440
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,750
However, given Lord Song's
current condition,

441
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,750
even with our best medicine,
he can only live

442
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,840
up to a year.

443
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,409
(Yuxi Palace)
Your Majesty!

444
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,619
When the poison takes effect,

445
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,579
the victim may turn violent.

446
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,859
Please consider your safety.

447
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,899
Don't go, Your Majesty!

448
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,040
Your Majesty!

449
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,840
I want him to live.

450
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,310
If you can't find an antidote in a year

451
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:25,830
and he dies,

452
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,880
you'll be joining him.

453
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

454
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:34,030
If word of Lord Song's illness spreads,

455
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,059
you know what will happen.

456
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,750
Yes, I understand.

457
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:46,880
Uncle.

458
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:49,600
I will not let that woman
enter our house.

459
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,230
It was him who switched Mother's child.

460
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,030
There must be someone behind him.

461
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,600
I have to find out.

462
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,929
I have to...

463
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:58,969
Yantang.

464
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,600
Uncle, Uncle.

465
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,640
I have failed

466
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,440
to protect my mother.

467
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,360
Please punish me.

468
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,339
Blame me, Uncle.

469
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,209
- Wake up, Lord Song.
- Punish me.

470
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,790
- Uncle.
- It's His Majesty.

471
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,400
He's the emperor.

472
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,280
Yantang.

473
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,270
You'll be fine.

474
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:21,230
Your mother and uncle
will not die in vain.

475
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,870
Your Majesty.

476
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,120
About what transpired
at the Duke of Ying's residence,

477
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,440
you have to deliver the verdict.

478
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,680
Eunuch Wang!

479
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,299
Eunuch Wang, spare him!

480
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,539
Even Ms. Li has killed herself
out of guilt.

481
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,209
We can't get the truth
out of her anymore.

482
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,859
It's impossible to determine his sins.

483
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,510
Eunuch Wang.

484
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,009
My ancestors had worked
alongside the former emperor

485
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:04,790
to establish this kingdom

486
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,990
and earn our title of duke.

487
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,979
We have retained this title
for three generations.

488
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,729
You can't kill my brother

489
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,209
just because he had an affair

490
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,169
and a love child!

491
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,600
Imperial Decree!

492
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:25,729
The Duke of Ying has had an affair
and switched his children

493
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,379
to make his love child his official son.

494
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,230
This is an unethical act.

495
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,779
He will be stripped off his position
in the Military Command.

496
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:37,310
His title as duke will be retained,
but he will have to repent.

497
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:42,790
I have committed a heinous sin.

498
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,470
I am willing to accept punishment.

499
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:50,299
However, my son Song Han
was not involved.

500
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,840
He did not know any of this.

501
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:55,030
I hope His Majesty can pardon him

502
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:59,550
and let him retain
his title in the family.

503
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,689
Decorum and honor

504
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,360
are the pillars of the society,

505
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:10,030
and social rankings
are the base of decorum.

506
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,059
The eldest daughter of your residence

507
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,400
is still nowhere to be found.

508
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:16,470
Do you think His Majesty would bother

509
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,470
pitying a love child?

510
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,950
This is to relieve pain caused by anger.

511
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:41,619
This is to cure colds.

512
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,200
Don't mix them up.

513
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,400
You must be terribly anxious

514
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,150
to brew every
single concoction there is.

515
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,450
Don't you think the palace physicians
can prepare them too?

516
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,689
You got Su Lan to bring me here

517
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:51,880
just to give you these herbs?

518
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,000
Su Xin.

519
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,080
Get more spring water.

520
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,240
Yes, Your Ladyship.

521
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,080
Whatever happens,

522
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,689
the residence will only

523
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,120
get busier.

524
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,859
I'm counting on you

525
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,099
and Ansu to look after

526
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,240
Zhaowen Bookstore.

527
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,440
All I care about is you, Dou Zhao.

528
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,750
Stop bothering me over
Mantis Song's problems.

529
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,950
This balm is good for healing scars.

530
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,920
Apply this every day.

531
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,470
Ever since you got married,

532
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,779
your life has become

533
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,080
utterly boring.

534
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,510
If you want to leave,

535
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,400
I have plenty of ideas.

536
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,790
Since I know what's going to happen,

537
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,230
all the more I should try to stop them.

538
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,200
I want to follow my heart.

539
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,000
As for the results,

540
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,550
these are not within my considerations.

541
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,350
Your Lordship.

542
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,750
Don't tell my wife

543
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,230
about my condition.

544
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,030
If your health continues to deteriorate,

545
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,200
do you think you can hide it from her?

546
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,200
I wanted to protect her,

547
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,960
but now,

548
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,200
I'm letting her down.

549
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,640
This case is getting more complicated.

550
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,920
I have to resolve it soon,

551
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,750
or else she'd have to face

552
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,200
those monsters alone after I die.

553
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,200
Even when I'm in the underworld,

554
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,790
I'd still be worried.

555
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,070
Then...

556
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:11,440
What are your plans now?

557
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,080
Give me some time alone.

558
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,839
Pick something fresh for me.

559
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,980
Sure.

560
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,779
(If I can spend the last part)

561
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,880
(of my journey with Ms. Longevity,)

562
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,750
(my life would still be worth it.)

563
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,550
Your Lordship.

564
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,360
We have news from Chen Jia.

565
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,779
Your Lordship!

566
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,099
Spare me!

567
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,160
I didn't know anything back then.

568
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,750
I really didn't know!

569
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,950
Spill the beans, now!

570
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,520
Back then,

571
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,400
the Duke ordered me
to take care of a baby girl.

572
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:44,030
However, that baby was weak
since she was born prematurely.

573
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,360
She died in a few days.

574
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,440
Spare me, Your Lordship!

575
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,920
What happened back then?

576
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,280
Tell me, now!

577
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:59,440
I only remember that the baby girl

578
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:03,680
was brought from Madam Jiang's room.

579
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:04,969
As for the rest,

580
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:07,360
I really don't know anything!

581
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:13,030
Remove him from the residence.

582
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,520
Throw him to a military camp.

583
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,580
Just make sure he's alive.

584
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,409
Yes, Your Lordship.

585
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,409
Move!

586
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:20,160
Your Lordship, I was wrong!

587
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,680
Your Lordship!

588
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,640
I tried putting myself in your shoes.

589
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,990
You were born to a commoner mother,
and you were restricted by your status,

590
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:45,120
so you married a noblewoman
whom you didn't love.

591
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,520
Regret

592
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,950
became your excuse
to do whatever is necessary.

593
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,750
The mastermind behind you...

594
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:55,200
What did they promise you?

595
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,270
Did they promise you

596
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,550
to make Song Han a duke?

597
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:06,230
You Jiangs have always been snobbish,

598
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,200
thinking that you're

599
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,230
saviors of the world.

600
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,790
Now, I'm going to make myself clear.

601
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,400
I don't need anyone
to offer me any deals.

602
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,080
To take Ms. Li away
from the Music Office,

603
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,550
you'd have to go through
the Ministry of Justice.

604
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,510
There's someone behind you.

605
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,310
I am a duke.

606
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:31,710
How is it impossible for me to take away

607
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,160
an incriminated musician?

608
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,400
You've always been
secretly serving Liaodong.

609
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,680
Looks like Song Han is involved too.

610
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,079
Han has nothing to do with it!

611
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,819
That means you're involved.

612
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,960
Enough!

613
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,840
When the bandits besieged the capital,

614
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,880
you switched all the guards
in the Military Command

615
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,020
and even the capital reserves

616
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,339
to Lord Qing's men.

617
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,969
There must be some palace officials

618
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,539
and civil servants

619
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,200
who are working for him, right?

620
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:56,290
He's created such an elaborate plan

621
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,200
not just for status,

622
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,880
but for treason.

623
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:08,160
I don't understand

624
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:10,870
what you're talking about.

625
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,120
Have you thought about Song Han?

626
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,969
Do you think he'd be free

627
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,910
after you die?

628
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,560
He'd be all alone in this world.

629
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,680
Doesn't that worry you?

630
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,400
Han is innocent.

631
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:29,890
If you dare to lay a finger on him...

632
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,710
Even if I don't, someone else will.

633
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,680
What?

634
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:37,520
Right now, you're just a discarded pawn.

635
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:41,270
Even if you carry
all your secrets to your grave,

636
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,840
those people

637
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,960
won't let Song Han live.

638
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,200
Take care.

639
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,900
(Beloved Sister, Jiang)

640
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,820
(Beloved Sister, Jiang)

641
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,200
How do you know I'm here?

642
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,910
General Yan has told me everything.

643
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,710
What did he say?

644
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:29,600
About your late sister.

645
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,089
That's why I thought

646
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,870
you'd be here to mourn for her.

647
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,529
The imperial physician said you fainted

648
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:45,000
because you were overwhelmed by anger.

649
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:48,480
This medicine should
alleviate your symptoms.

650
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,310
Why do you look so pale?

651
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,840
Let me take a look.

652
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,270
Your hand...

653
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,110
Does it still hurt?

654
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,480
Not anymore.

655
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,840
I'm sorry.

656
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,000
It's my fault.

657
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:25,230
You lost someone twice.

658
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,480
That must be really upsetting.

659
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,080
I've made you worried.

660
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,400
You were right.

661
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,350
If the same thing happens again,

662
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,270
please stop me.

663
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:47,830
I cannot lose control anymore.

664
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:51,750
You took the words out of my mouth.

665
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,520
Come on, drink it while it's hot.

666
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,350
Back then,

667
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:10,000
when I managed to return
to the residence alive,

668
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:12,680
I thought that was the worst
I'd ever experience.

669
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,600
Ever since I could remember,

670
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,270
Song Yichun has always
listened to my mother.

671
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,160
He treated her with respect.

672
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,710
Whenever he was deployed out of town,

673
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,790
he would return
with gifts for my mother.

674
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,560
I thought it was out of love,

675
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,270
but it was actually tolerance.

676
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,320
It was hatred.

677
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,800
I don't know

678
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,640
what's real in my life anymore.

679
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,910
Your mother's love for you,

680
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,640
your uncle's guidance,

681
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:53,520
and your army's undying loyalty

682
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,390
are all real.

683
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:58,710
I'm real, too.

684
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,080
With how things are now,

685
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,310
I shouldn't let you
get involved in my pain.

686
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,350
As a couple, we should stay
together through thick and thin

687
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,870
and share our joys and woes.

688
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,230
From now on,

689
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,899
you can dump all your unhappiness

690
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,430
and troubles on me.

691
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:28,350
We are different from your parents.

692
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,110
Yantang.

693
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,750
Let me offer some
incense to your sister.

694
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,960
Then, let's go home.

695
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,840
Sure.

696
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,680
Look, fireworks!

697
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:58,150

00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,350
Do you remember

702
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:18,350
we saw fireworks together
for the first time outside the prison?

703
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,520
Back then, Dou Shishu and his followers

704
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,000
kept trying to impeach me,

705
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,750
and you called upon Gu Yu to protect me.

706
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:29,120
Why did you do so?

707
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,000
Even fireworks come in
a multitude of colors.

708
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,520
He and I are different.

709
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:40,870
Back then, I thought

710
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,000
that if this woman
could be my strategist,

711
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,350
I'd have nothing to fear.

712
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,520
So,

713
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,000
is that why you locked
Mr. Chen up for so long?

714
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,910
You're just as ruthless, my wife.

715
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:57,910
You locked General Yan up
in the coal room.

716
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:58,819
When I found him,

717
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,659
he was covered in soot.

718

722
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,680
You can't hold them.

723
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,160
Beautiful things may not last long,

724
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,200
but you can hold them.

725
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,040
You may be my strategist,

726
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,350
but I only want you

727
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,200
to relax and be my wife.

728
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,739
I'm willing to stay by your side.

I'll have no regrets.

I used to think

00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,710
that I could protect you,

00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,230
but now,

00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,009
