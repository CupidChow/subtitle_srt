1
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,680
Recently, Youting sent some gifts

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,489
to the noblemen and officials

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,550
during the Mid-Autumn Festival.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,680
Even Minister Dou
has accepted his gifts,

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,270
and they seem close.

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,960
What do you think?

7
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,520
I shall not talk bad
about our key ministers.

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,550
Moreover, we need the rice
from Lizhen in the north.

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,219
Minister Dou

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,779
is the only one in the palace
who can speak their language.

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,550
He has immense power in politics.

12
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,760
If we denounce him
simply because of that,

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,080
the people in Liaodong would be rattled.

14
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,350
Aren't you worried that Lord Qing
and Dou Shishu may work together

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,630
to weaken your influence
as the Crown Prince?

16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,800
Father, you are unwell now.

17
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,760
It would be disloyal of me
to fight with my brother now.

18
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:57,040
This may also lead to speculation
among the officials

19
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,990
that we are trying to remove dissidents,

20
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,200
which will in turn cause
a public uproar.

21
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,480
You've grown sensible.

22
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,150
However, remember this.

23
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,710
You cannot clap with just one hand.

24
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,040
You should learn from your brother

25
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,539
about being a ruler

26
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,270
and gaining your subordinates' support.

27
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,200
I apologize for my foolishness.

28
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,379
All I know is to improve myself

29
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,960
and love my country and people.

30
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,040
I've spent so many years working hard

31
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,990
to become a good Crown Prince,

32
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,160
hoping to bring honor

33
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,710
to our ancestors and kingdom.

34
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,470
You may leave now.

35
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,630
What do you think of the Crown Prince?

36
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,489
I wouldn't dare comment anything

37
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,040
about the Crown Prince.

38
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,950
You watched him grow up.

39
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,910
He may seem proud and quiet,

40
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,070
but he has a benevolent heart.

41
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,320
Every year, on my birthday,

42
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,929
everyone else tries to impress me

43
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,019
by offering precious treasures,

44
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,280
but he would instead

45
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,049
gather locusts, seedlings,

46
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,809
and cloths from all over the kingdom.

47
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,699
He doesn't even know
how to maintain a facade.

48
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,760
How will he gain
the support of the officials?

49
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,350
I don't know if I should
blame Liang Jifang

50
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,600
for teaching him too well, or teaching him
until he's grown foolish.

51
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,510
I understand your worries, Your Majesty.

52
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,390
The Crown Prince is morally upright.

53
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,670
There will be good officials
who will stay loyal to him.

54
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,390
Yousheng is the Crown Prince

55
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,880
and my son.

56
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,790
It's time for him to learn

57
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,320
how to use his best weapon, Yantang.

58
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,599

(Adapted from the novel "Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

59
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,860
=Episode 27=

60
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,700
(Yizhi Hall)

61
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,150
So, the Crown Prince wasn't trying

62
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,529
to win your favor, but he's been

63
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,760
spying and warning you.

64
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,409
All the Crown Prince wants

65
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,830
is to protect his kingdom.

66
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,560
He's taking his role
as the next emperor seriously.

67
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,390
He's not the mastermind.

68
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,030
If the Crown Prince loses support,

69
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,950
and Lord Qing wants to seize the throne,

70
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,120
what would he do?

71
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,320
First, he needs military support.

72
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,409
The ministers in charge of the troops

73
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,730
have always sided with Lord Qing.

74
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,579
Moreover, there's a new
horse market in Liaodong,

75
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,819
making it a major trading hub
at the borders.

76
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,590
They'll be able to grow
their troops easily.

77
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,270
Now that Dou Shishu has control
over the Ministry of War,

78
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,240
he has the power to deploy the
kingdom's troops in any way he wants.

79
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,630
If he supports Lord Qing,

80
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,590
he could launch a coup easily

81
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,769
and attack the capital.

82
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,260
(Capital, Shengtian Court)

83
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,579
Also,

84
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,070
before he launches a coup,

85
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,320
he needs to make sure the ministers
can keep this a secret.

86
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,880
To do that, he will need support
from the civilian ministers

87
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,950
to stabilize the political situation.

88
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,760
You're right.

89
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,390
Other than my fifth uncle

90
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,880
and the other key ministers,

91
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,200
there must be many people
who are secretly supporting Lord Qing.

92
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,560
I've heard from Mr. Chen

93
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,849
that Mu Chuan became
the Minister of Works

94
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,590
because he had
the support of Empress Wan.

95
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,830
Apart from military power
and the royal court,

96
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,800
he also needs to seize control
of the palace and capital's reserves,

97
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,510
such as the Imperial Guards
stationed at the palace itself.

98
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,259
If we look at history, both Wei Lue

99
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,120
and Tang Shu's coups were successful

100
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,150
because they got the Imperial Guards

101
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,830
to deliver the fatal blow.

102
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,320
So, no matter where they
start launching their coup,

103
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,550
they will have to go past you.

104
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,000
That's why they planned
the bandit invasion,

105
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,200
so they could replace the capital's military
reserves with their own people.

106
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,030
By then, they could easily

107
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,560
open the city gates

108
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,710
or imprison His Majesty.

109
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,760
Among the eunuchs,
other than the two Eunuch Wangs,

110
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,510
there are another six to seven eunuchs
who hold power.

111
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,499
But if we investigate them one by one,

112
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,240
we might alert them.

113
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,729
The Crown Prince has always

114
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,270
behaved like an ascetic,

115
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,320
and I don't really know
what he's thinking.

116
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,590
However, if he knows
about Lord Qing's ambitions,

117
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,000
I wonder if he'd panically confront him,

118
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,510
or secretly plot against him.

119
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,120
Why don't we test him?

120
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,630
Lord Qing has a bigger chance
of winning.

121
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,920
Still, if we support Lord Qing,

122
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,880
even if he does become the Emperor,

123
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,360
that doesn't make him
any less of a thief and a traitor.

124
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,030
The results are bound to be ugly

125
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,320
whether he succeeds or not.

126
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:28,990
What's wrong?

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,273
(Qiguang Wanfo Pagoda)
Your Highness,

128
00:07:30,274 --> 00:07:32,499
(Qiguang Wanfo Pagoda)
the throne isn't yours yet,

129
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,240
and you're already eager to kill
those who supported you?

130
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,470
Don't worry.

131
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,920
I know what to do.

132
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,150
I will not make you suffer
because of my loyalties.

133
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,830
My uncle is helping Lord Qing
to collude with other ministers

134
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,019
to steal the throne.

135
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,000
If proven guilty,
he will be a horrendous sinner.

136
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,059
My grandmother, my father, and even me

137
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,390
will be prosecuted.

138
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,360
Empress Wan was so eager
to arrange our marriage

139
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,120
probably to set the stage up

140
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,270
and use you as a bait.

141
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,880
The Art of War states

142
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,200
that there are five dangerous faults
can lead to the downfall of a general.

143
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,510
The most dangerous one

144
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,880
is being overly compassionate,

145
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,950
which leads to
constant worry and trouble.

146
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,830
In some cases, the enemy
captures the loved ones

147
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,640
of the opposing party as hostage,

148
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,320
forcing them to surrender
without a fight.

149
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,160
I am nowhere

150
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,520
as ruthless as Dou Shishu.

151
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,920
I won't be held hostage by anyone.

152
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,710
I have a mind of my own.

153
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,830
I don't take threats from anyone.

154
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,110
I won't repeat the mistakes
of my mother and the Duke of Ding.

155
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,350
What they couldn't achieve,

156
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,710
we will.

157
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,640
Very well.

158
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:03,979
I'll dye your hair

159
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,830
every month so that

160
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,049
you won't become

161
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,350
a white-haired imp.

162
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,230
Deal.

163
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,259
Madam, you've always
been good with crafts.

164
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,160
That new pattern looks pretty.

165
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,180
Madam!

166
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,600
Madam!

167
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,040
Madam , bad news!

168
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,169
Grand Princess Shude
sent an urgent letter

169
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,470
saying that she has
a dreadful emergency!

170
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,800
What happened?

171
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,760
She needs another player.

172
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,740
(Ningshou Palace)

173
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,619
Dou Zhao.

174
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,520
If Her Majesty didn't remind me,

175
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,899
I almost forgot

176
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,590
that we could invite you for mahjong.

177
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,350
This is the Empress.

178
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,320
And the Crown Princess.

179
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

180
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,440
Greetings, Your Highness.

181
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,870
I've heard that the Duchess of Ying
is a successful businesswoman.

182
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,400
You are a model to the kingdom's women.

183
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,809
You flatter me, Your Majesty.

184
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,160
You're just in time.

185
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,200
We need another player for mahjong.

186
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,470
Let's begin now.

187
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,520
Come in.

188
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,019
I hope that Your Majesty

189
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,619
and Your Highnesses

190
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,110
won't mind me if I fumble.

191
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,070
Nine.

192
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,520
I wonder how lucky I will be today.

193
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,590
Luck doesn't matter.

194
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,200
Winning is all about tactics.

195
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,520
A good game depends

196
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,680
on the person playing.

197
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:02,899
If you want to win,

198
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,280
you need to see
who's playing against whom.

199
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,870
You have a point, Mother.

200
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,870
That's how games are.

201
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,400
Someone wins, and someone loses.

202
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,200
Sometimes, wins and losses
are not determined in a split second.

203
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,760
Thirty thousand.

204
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,430
I win.

205
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,950
Seventy thousand.

206
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,650
I can't believe this.

207
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,290
Come on, let's play
another eight rounds.

208
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,950
We'll see if you're really that lucky.

209
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,280
I just lucked out.

210
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,200
Mother, you're still

211
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,950
the star player here.

212
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,590
(Eight rounds?)

213
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,470
(Against the Grand Princess,)

214
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,710
(the Empress)

215
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,750
(and the Crown Princess?)

216
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,040
(This isn't a game.)

217
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,800
(This is a landmine!)

218
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,870
I win!

219
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,070
This is so fun.

220
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:07,739
Still, Dou Zhao.

221
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,830
It seems like you're unlucky today.

222
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,070
You've never won even once.

223
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,800
My dear Duchess,

224
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,590
did you go easy on us?

225
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,590
I just learned how to play mahjong,

226
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,640
so I'm not very good at it.

227
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,859
Back when the Duke of Ying
went to Liaodong

228
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,280
to help the Jiang clan settle down,

229
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,830
I heard that he
hit it off with Lord Qing

230
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,680
right after they met.

231
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,979
Yantang did request His Highness

232
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,259
so that the elder folks in the clan

233
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,219
could get treated,

234
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,990
and that the leaking roofs
could be fixed.

235
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,899
That's typical of him.

236
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,899
He's a loyal citizen.

237
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,750
To do that, you need to be loyal
to your family first.

238
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,449
I raised Youting

239
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,929
until he was 12 years old,

240
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,750
and he was deployed to the barren lands.

241
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,929
He never received any education
from famous scholars,

242
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,350
but he was still respected
by the court officials.

243
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,169
Nevertheless, it's only because

244
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,870
they admired his loyalty to the kingdom.

245
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,259
Five dots.

246
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,400
I win.

247
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,929
You're a clever lady, Duchess.

248
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,320
You're good at mahjong.

249
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,169
Madam, I thought
you were playing mahjong?

250
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,649
Why do you look so lethargic?

251
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,470
I've been playing since noon till now.

252
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,049
I didn't know

253
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,110
they're so enthusiastic when they play.

254
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,350
It's not a simple game.

255
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,320
Who won the most?

256
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,899
Judging from the number of wins,

257
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,320
it's the Empress, of course.

258
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,110
Your Ladyship.

259
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,859
Her Majesty wants to see you.

260
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,280
Please head to Kunning Palace now.

261
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,649
My pleasure.

262
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,870
Lead the way.

263
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,240
This way.

264
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,859
Your Majesty,
the Duchess of Ying is here.

265
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,929
- Your Majesty.
- Finally, help is here.

266
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,280
Here, take a look at these papers.

267
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,760
Lately, the Emperor wants
to reduce the palace's expenditure,

268
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:32,280
which covers everything from clothes
and rewards to even papers.

269
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,950
Here, look at this.

270
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,430
The palace uses more than nine million
pieces of papers every year.

271
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,750
Half of them are used
for books and records.

272
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,339
While bamboo and jute are cheaper,

273
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,560
they tend to rot easily,
which makes them hard to store.

274
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,280
You could opt for papyrus instead.

275
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,280
If there's a papyrus factory
near the capital,

276
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,470
you could simplify the process

277
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,470
and save up to 40% in costs.

278
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,400
If you use recycled paper,

279
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:08,920
you could save even more.

280
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,750
You do know a lot.

281
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,870
You're a great help to me.

282
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,120
You flatter me, Your Majesty.

283
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,160
You're such a demure lady

284
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,499
and a clever merchant,

285
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,689
while the Duke is both
strong and courageous,

286
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,819
defending the kingdom.

287
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,040
He will be able to protect
our kingdom if stationed at Liaodong.

288
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,280
Unfortunately, he's ill now.

289
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,680
Thank you for your concern,
Your Majesty.

290
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,070
In Liaodong, there's a snow lingzhi
that grows every 300 years.

291
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,800
They say it can even resurrect the dead.

292
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,499
This is a Xueyuan pill

293
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,830
that contains snow lingzhi.

294
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,230
I'm sure you're good at medicine,

295
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,160
so why don't you try whether this pill
is as miraculous as they claim?

296
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,929
Lord Shi

297
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,280
wanted to give this to the Duke too,

298
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,219
but he didn't even look at it,

299
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,830
and shooed Lord Shi out right away.

300
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,339
I know as his wife, you should
respect the Duke's wishes,

301
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,339
but, Your Ladyship,

302
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,040
can you really see him die?

303
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,920
Your niece is a clever lady.

304
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,040
I'd love to help her too.

305
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,640
She is indeed capable.

306
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,990
Even those who never
involve themselves in politics

307
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,320
are in this mess thanks to her.

308
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,470
You're the one who
dragged me into this mess.

309
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,350
The entire palace knows
I recommended you to become minister.

310
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,990
Now that you're helping Lord Qing,

311
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,440
the officials and
the Emperor would think

312
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:40,350
that I also support Lord Qing
in seizing the throne.

313
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,680
I am part of the royal family.

314
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,280
You should know where my bottom line is.

315
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,560
Whatever you're doing,

316
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,240
stop.

317
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:54,649
I can't.

318
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,560
You're not listening to me anymore?

319
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,169
Calm down, Your Highness.

320
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,099
Don't kneel if I didn't ask you to.

321
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,219
As your servant, I am obliged to kneel.

322
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,059
Life is like swimming
against the currents.

323
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,550
You have to abandon
everything unimportant

324
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,400
to be able to swim upwards.

325
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,200
That's what you taught me.

326
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,470
When did I teach you that?

327
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,840
Back when I was an assistant magistrate
in Dengzhou,

328
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,270
I was still a lowly official

329
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,080
with no prestigious background.

330
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,280
All those years,

331
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,120
I wasn't treated like a human.

332
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,840
Those crooks treated me

333
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,360
like a doormat.

334
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,030
I worked hard every day and night,

335
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,729
and they took my credit

336
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,470
to rise through the official ranks,

337
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,470
yet I was still the doormat.

338
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,830
So,

339
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,440
I wanted to resign and retake
the imperial examination,

340
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,640
but they wouldn't let me do that.

341
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,840
Back then, my old husband just died.

342
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,600
On the day I went to pray for him,

343
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,080
you wrote me a hymn,

344
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,360
and I promoted you in return.

345
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,950
Now, you're already a key minister.

346
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,710
Isn't that enough?

347
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,950
I loved the hymn you wrote for me.

348
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,480
What can I do for you?

349
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,430
I only hope to resign my post

350
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,680
and retake the imperial examination
to earn a better rank

351
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:31,200
and be assigned to a place
where I can unleash my talents.

352
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,440
Such a place doesn't exist.

353
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,310
I wrote a letter of recommendation
for you to the Ministry of Personnel.

354
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,960
Next month, you will
be the Magistrate of Haiyan.

355
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,409
I only wish to rely on myself...

356
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,200
Taking shortcuts is not something
to be shameful of.

357
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,550
Your dignity and principles

358
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,510
shouldn't be within
your consideration now.

359
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,280
I've abandoned so many things.

360
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,639
They said I was a brown-noser

361
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,059
with no shame,

362
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,440
but I didn't care.

363
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,620
I just wanted to see

364
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,159
how far I could go

365
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,409
along the shortcut I took

366
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,350
in exchange for my principles.

367
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,409
And I will go as far as it takes me.

368
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,950
My family

369
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,360
used to be mere peddlers.

370
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,300
It was me

371
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,400
who made us a prestigious clan.

372
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,200
Shishu.

373
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,379
I sacrificed my marriage

374
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,270
for wealth and freedom.

375
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,440
However, I didn't harm anyone.

376
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,790
The path you're taking is too risky.

377
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,249
You will harm yourself

378
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,990
and me.

379
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,440
Your Highness.

380
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,230
You have my support.

381
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,440
Someday,

382
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,950
I will give you

383
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,680
everything you've wanted.

384
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,500
You're back.

385
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,030
Where did you get this Xueyuan pill?

386
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,360
From the Empress.

387
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:20,009
She's offering me this so-called antidote
to make me one of her cronies.

388
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:20,919
You know very well

389
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,990
that I'd never disregard
my principles to survive.

390
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,680
I know.

391
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,640
You want to avenge your family.

392
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,819
But, this pill is so rare

393
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,819
that Mr. Chen couldn't find it anywhere.

394
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,920
Now that the pill
is right in front of you,

395
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,510
why don't you try it?

396
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,950
The Empress and Lord Qing
is taking advantage of my illness.

397
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,829
If the pill works

398
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,379
and prolongs my life,

399
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,170
it'd be harder for both of us to say goodbye
when my condition worsens.

400
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,680
By then, we'd want to get another pill,
and another afterwards.

401
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,649
We'd be at the Empress bidding.

402
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,440
We can solve these problems as they come.

403
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,360
As long as there's a glimmer of hope,

404
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,009
I want you to live.

405
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,920
That's exactly what
the Empress is planning.

406
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,449
She wants us to side

407
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,790
with Lord Qing.

408
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,120
I know the Empress
is plotting something.

409
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,750
Don't worry, though.

410
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,440
I got this pill

411
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:06,920
by stealing it.

412
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,760
You stole it?

413
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,579
I managed to find out
that Lord Qing was planning

414
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,630
to deliver some precious gifts
to the Empress today,

415
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,360
which includes the Xueyuan pill.

416
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,310
Beat him up!

417
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,489
Take everything away!

418
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,990
It might be valuable!

419
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,840
Come on!

420
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,840
I don't want to side with Lord Qing,

421
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,470
but I also want my husband to live.

422
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,240
I'm sorry, Ms. Longevity.

423
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,160
I was wrong to accuse you.

424
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:41,310
In the past, I ignored everything
to discover the truth

425
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:42,910
and avenge my family.

426
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,040
But now, you gave me a family.

427
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,920
I am no longer alone.

428
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,409
I promise you this.

429
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,550
In the future,

430
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,230
even if I had to sacrifice something,

431
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,920
I'd protect this family.

432
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,840
I'll take the pill now.

433
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,310
Back then, he was already
on Lord Qing's side,

434
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,160
so he must have taken the Xueyuan pill.

435
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,750
However, his hair was white,
and he was still poisoned.

436
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,590
Wait.

437
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,310
Su Lan.

438
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,019
Madam.

439
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,229
Get me some warm water

440
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,510
and my medicine box.

441
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,760
Yes.

442
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,680
Are you suspecting

443
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,950
that something's wrong with this pill?

444
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,270
Poisoned blood should be
purplish black in color.

445
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,920
If this antidote works,

446
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,790
the blood should react to it.

447
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,350
Look.

448
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,680
The color's changing!

449
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,750
That means the antidote works.

450
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,550
Ms. Longevity!

451
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,720
Zhangru?

452
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,160
Ms. Longevity!

453
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,680
What brings you back?

454
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,390
I thought you're visiting
Uncle in Diannan?

455
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,550
Why are you back?

456
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,059
The Mid-Autumn Festival is here.

457
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,449
I'm back to celebrate.

458
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,710
Have you forgotten?

459
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:27,009
You've never been so enthusiastic

460
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,990
about a festival.

461
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:32,990
Don't tell me

462
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,600
someone's celebrating with you today.

463
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,170
No.

464
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,579
The lantern parade is starting soon.

465
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,160
Why are you still cooped up here?

466
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,840
I'm going to the parade now.

467
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,200
Come on.

468
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,760
Let's take a look.

469
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,470
To think we were robbed

470
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,710
right inside the palace.

471
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,080
What a joke.

472
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,680
The bandits seemed to be
remnants of Cangbei Gang.

473
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,790
We have already
eliminated the entire gang.

474
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:10,649
Besides, this is too much
of a coincidence.

475
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,920
The Xueyuan pill was also stolen.

476
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,310
Could it be Dou Zhao?

477
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:19,870
No.

478
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,539
She looked so firm

479
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,230
when she rejected me.

480
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,710
Since she had already refused you,

481
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:30,050
why do they have to go through
the trouble to steal it?

482
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,600
Looks like they're just plain robbers.

483
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,790
They must be more than mere robbers.

484
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,440
Dou Zhao is a sly woman.

485
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,470
It must be her.

486
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,209
How dare she oppose us?

487
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,400
Why don't I send someone

488
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,779
to bring Dou Zhao here right away?

489
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,920
No.

490
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,209
We have no proof now.

491
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,550
We can't do anything to her.

492
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,310
Since we can't be allies,

493
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,440
we'll have to be foes.

494
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,219
Hot buns fresh from the oven!
Take a look!

495
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,440
Lantern quizzes available here!

496
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:03,969
Want to take a quiz?

497
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,009
It's two wen for a guess.

498
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,700
If you get it right,
you'll get a lantern.

499
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,230
"At the end of the year,
there's fish and rice."

500
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,120
I can read it out,

501
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,360
but I don't understand.

502
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:30,819
It's the character "lin".

503
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,960
"Lin"?

504
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,200
Let's see.

505
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,539
("Lin")

506
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,969
It really is.

507
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,489
Officer Chen, I didn't know

508
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,630
you're also good at quizzes.

509
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,680
Here's your lantern.

510
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,409
How cute.

511
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,700
It's a rabbit.

512
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,350
It's so cute.

513
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,070
Look.

514
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,600
Do you like this lantern?

515
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,360
Yes.

516
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,040
Ms. Longevity.

517
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,050
What is it?

518
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,249
I feel like we're being followed.

519
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,390
Who?

520
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,750
Perhaps I was worrying for nothing.

521
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,240
Let's go.

522
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,619
Why did you pull me?

523
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,880
Don't try to cheat.

524
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,409
We had a deal.

525
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,200
If you disturb them,

526
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,640
that'd be counted as cheating.

527
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,750
I wasn't trying to disturb them.

528
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,600
I just don't want to lose their tracks.

529
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,360
Come on.

530
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,600
Take a look.

531
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,760
Are you fine?

532
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,630
I'm fine.

533
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,040
Let me carry you.

534
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,600
This is so embarrassing.

535
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,590
Watch out.

536
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,640
I'm about to slip off.

537
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,470
Let me light up the path.

538
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,899
Want to see who can run faster,

539
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,080
my bunny or you?

540
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,710
They're gone

541
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,560
- in a blink of an eye.
- Let's look around.

542
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,169
Oh no, she must have seen me.

543
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,009
No, it's so dark,
she couldn't have seen you.

544
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,969
- Don't worry.
- She must have seen me.

545
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,920
Her eyes met mine.

546
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,489
It was just a while.

547
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,249
I guess they didn't see us.

548
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,390
Right?

549
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,110
What's wrong?

550
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,230
Officer Chen?

551
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,139
No,

552
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,689
we're not supposed to go there.

553
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,990
We need to go back, not this way.

554
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,350
This is the right way.

555
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,160
Your Lordship, Your Ladyship.

556
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,440
Ms. Zhao sprained her ankle.

557
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,920
I will take her home safely.

558
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,810
Don't worry.

559
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,000
Zhangru.

560
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,750
Be careful.

561
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:57,120
Ms. Longevity.

562
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,270
No matter what,

563
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,880
it's responsible of Chen Jia
to show himself

564
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,790
and explain to us.

565
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,100
Shall we continue following them?

566
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,180
No.

567
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,740
Then, can we finally

568
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,220
enjoy the rest of the lantern parade?

569
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,060
Second Young Master.

570
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,100
Miss Miao.

571
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:12,919
I got this lantern for you

572
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,470
from the lantern parade.

573
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,320
Tonight is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

574
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,030
Why aren't you celebrating?

575
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,380
Mid-Autumn Festival?

576
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,980
There's no one else left

577
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,620
whom I can reunite with now.

578
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,689
These are freshly made Dingsheng cakes.

579
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,260
There's peanuts inside.

580
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,510
I left some for you.

581
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,659
It's tradition to eat cakes
duing the Mid-Autumn Festival

582
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,500
to usher joy and happiness.

583
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,300
Thank you, Miss Miao.

584
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,900
However,

585
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,900
joy and happiness

586
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,140
is beyond my reach now.

587
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,500
Young Master.

588
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,780
You need to forge your path
one step at a time.

589
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,559
When my family experienced its downfall,

590
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,879
all of us

591
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,519
held on together

592
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,740
and survived through
the hardest moments.

593
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,980
Things will get better.

594
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,580
Try one.

595
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,500
That's right.

596
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,140
The hardest moments are over.

597
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,980
Thank you, Miss Miao.

598
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,619
You always comfort me when I feel down.

599
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,460
I don't know how to repay you.

600
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:58,959
When you handed me the cakes,
I noticed your hands were cold.

601
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,100
Here you go.

602
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,959
If chatting with me

603
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,780
makes you feel better,

604
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,380
that makes me glad.

605
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,580
Perhaps it's just small talk to you,

606
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,780
but to me,

607
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,900
you're a lifesaver.

608
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,660
I can't keep hiding anymore.

609
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,300
I need to leave this courtyard

610
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,420
and live like a man,

611
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,580
forging my own path.

612
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,700
Look.

613
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,220
The moon is beautiful

614
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,940
when it's quiet.

615
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,220
Yes.

616
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,820
I remember a poem

617
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,540
about moons and bamboos.

618
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,589
What was it again?

619
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,980
"Is there ever a night

620
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,820
with no moon and bamboo groves?

621
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,020
But there is definitely
a dearth of idlers like us two."

622
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,180
Correct?

623
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,610
Yes.

624
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,220
(Harmonious Nature)

625
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,350
Ms. Longevity.

626
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,180
Ms. Longevity, why are you crying?

627
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,980
The antidote

628
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,780
can only suppress
the poison temporarily.

629
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,060
It does not cure it.

630
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,460
It can only prolong
your life for a while.

631
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,180
It's fine.

632
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,359
See?

633
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,980
I'm still alive and well.

634
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,079
Besides,

635
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,370
it's possible that the poison
might just stay dormant.

636
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,200
There must be a way.

637
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,730
Don't cry.

638
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,100
(Liaodong)

639
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,519
Your Highness,
you haven't missed a shot.

640
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,779
You're definitely

641
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,500
one of the best archers in the kingdom.

642
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,319
You Song brothers are interesting.

643
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,860
One of you kept rejecting my offers,

644
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,540
while the other came all the way here

645
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,580
just to flatter me.

646
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,340
My brother and father
didn't appreciate your offer,

647
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,060
but I do.

648
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,340
I do not like incapable men,

649
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,620
and I absolutely detest

650
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,460
those who are disloyal.

651
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,880
In the past, I had no choice.

652
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,540
But now,

653
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,780
I want to make my own choice.

654
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,450
I don't want to spend my life
feeling inferior to someone.

655
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,799
All I need is an opportunity,

656
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,780
and I shall repay you in ways

657
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,420
that exceed what Song Mo can offer.

658
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,980
Pray tell.

659
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,550
While you were practicing earlier,

660
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,990
you released your arrow even before
you pulled it all the way back.

661
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:52,340
That's because you're used to practicing
with the same equipment,

662
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,349
and you know where the arrow will land.

663
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,759
However, in the battlefield,

664
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,820
nothing is certain.

665
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:03,320
I suggest that you
need a practice partner

666
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,100
to train your adaptability skills.

667
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,220
That will improve your archery, too.

668
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,900
But if I accidentally shoot you,

669
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,820
it'd be bad for my reputation.

670
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,380
If your real target is Song Mo,

671
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:22,620
I'd be the perfect training partner.

672
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,789
Compared to a mere servant,

673
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,109
I have the status

674
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,659
to help you befriend

675
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,460
the younger noblemen and officials.

676
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,479
I also know how to plan strategies
to secure your position in politics

677
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,449
and navigate through uncertainties.

678
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,539
I also know how to fight, and I can make sure
that the capital troops

679
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,780
won't completely fall under
Song Mo's hands.

680
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,660
You sound like

681
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,660
I need you more

682
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,180
than you need me.

683
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,519
If you were to separately evaluate

684
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,420
my background, warriorship,
and scholarship,

685
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,420
I may not be your best choice.

686
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,910
However, I do fulfill
those three criteria,

687
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,100
and more importantly, I have
the determination to fight till I die.

688
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,860
War is all about strategy.

689
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,900
Ever since I was born, I was destined
to thwart Song Mo's plans.

690
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,260
I'm the only person

691
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,740
who can help you secretly

692
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,420
align everyone to your side.

693
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,639
The ministers are planning to organize

694
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,740
a supplementary imperial examination
to search for new talents.

695
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,940
If you can pass
the initial examinations,

696
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,140
I will take you in.

697
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,860
Thank you, Your Highness.

698
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,820
Master Ji.

699
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,639
Song Han came to me with an offer,

700
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,260
just as you predicted.

701
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,260
You are truly an oracle.

702
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,860
It's just a strategical deduction.

703
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,940
Song Han is now desperate,

704
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,020
and if he doesn't get
to grow into a mighty wolf,

705
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,759
given his paranoid nature,

706
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,660
he'd have to live in fear and guilt.

707
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,540
By then, life would
torture him to the core.

708
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,860
Song Han's situation
is actually similar to mine.

709
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,970
In the Song family,
no matter how capable he is,

710
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,420
Song Mo will always outdo him.

711
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:36,770
After all, nothing can change the fact
that he was an illicit love child.

712
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,820
His only choice is to help me
claim the throne

713
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,780
so that he can stand tall in the future.

714
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,740
Master Ji, you're truly
a far-sighted strategist.

715
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,580
Here's a token of my appreciation.

716
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,700
Just seeing them carrying these chests
makes me feel exhausted.

717
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,300
Why do I need so much money?

718
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,599
Forget it.

719
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,940
Where are you going, Master Ji?

720
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,460
Back to the capital.

721
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,789
At first, I wanted to help you

722
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,499
since the Empress supports you,

723
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,449
and you were so eager to learn.

724
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,590
But now,

725
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,539
you're repaying me
with flattery and gold,

726
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,119
without a hint of truth.

727
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,980
Why should I waste my time?

728
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,260
If you want to end my life,

729
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,700
get someone to come with me.

730
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,460
Wait, Master Ji.

731
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,860
I treat you with utmost sincerity.

732
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,180
Utmost sincerity?

733
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,559
How did the Duke of Ding die?

734
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,060
You refused to mention a word of it.

735
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,980
Working for a sly and paranoid man

736
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,420
will only ruin my elaborate plans.

737
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,260
I understand, Master Ji.

738
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,380
I will tell you everything
about the Duke of Ding,

739
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,620
from the beginning till the end.

740
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,700
When I eventually succeed,

741
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,100
you will be my top adviser.

742
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,300
Is that what

743
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,060
you promised Dou Shishu, too?

744
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,279
Both you and Dou Shishu

745
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,020
are my right-hand men.

746
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,639
However,

747
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,100
Dou Shishu offered his horse market
to show his sincerity,

748
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,700
and he's willing to sacrifice his niece.

749
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,180
As for you,

750
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,580
you still haven't helped me
gain Song Mo's support.

751
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,460
Song Mo?

752
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,940
He's loyal to the Emperor.

753
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,780
If I recruit him,

754
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,060
I'd be opposing the Emperor directly.

755
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,540
You think the Emperor
would let me do that?

756
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,940
What would you do by then?

757
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,060
Start a coup in Liaodong,
which is thousands of lis away?

758
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,180
Are you certain about that?

759
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,380
But if we don't eliminate him,

760
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,109
he'd be a threat.

761
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,320
The Imperial Guards are elite soldiers
that defend the palace.

762
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,199
We have to seize control of them.

763
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,540
That's why

764
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,420
I'm asking you to recruit
Song Han instead.

765
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,679
Since we can't recruit
the Songs publicly,

766
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,490
we can take advantage
of their family issues.

767
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,759
Song Han wants his dukeship.

768
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,390
He's at loggerheads
with his brother now.

769
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,279
That's between him and his brother.

770
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,719
No matter how things develop,

771
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,799
it will only benefit you,

772
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,100
and this is a guaranteed result.

773
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,740
I understand.

774
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,460
The ice cream tastes good.

775
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,620
(Lu's Dental Clinic)

776
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,359
Song Han is just an illicit love child.

777
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,719
You're recruiting him?

778
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,380
I think he has
a special position to play.

779
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,900
If we use him well,

780
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,900
we can turn the tide.

781
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,300
He's a lowly man with high ambitions.

782
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,260
A man like him

783
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,740
is more likely to heed our bidding.

784
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,180
I lose.

785
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,380
Minister Lu, did you lose to me,

786
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,580
so you can ask me for a favor?

787
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,660
To be honest,

788
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,940
I don't think my son will pass
the normal imperial examinations.

789
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,980
As for the upcoming
supplementary imperial examinations,

790
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,620
we still need some help.

791
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,820
The palace is in need
of military talents.

792
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,500
His Majesty is taking the
military examinations seriously.

793
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,679
I have been ordered
to appoint another examiner,

794
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,380
and I guess they already
have a candidate in mind,

795
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,140
so I'm afraid I have to disappoint you.

796
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,099
I can't interfere in something
that's beyond my authority.

797
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,130
But you're in charge
of imperial examinations,

798
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,180
so I'm sure you can

799
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,380
do something about it.

800
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,180
For the written examinations,
there's still some room for wriggling.

801
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,740
However, the military examinations

802
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,900
will test their true abilities.

803
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,380
Don't worry, Minister Dou.

804
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,540
As long as he can pass
the written examinations,

805
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,799
I'm sure my son

806
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,460
is good enough

807
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,740
to fight his way through.

808
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,910
I just want to make a name for myself
through my own capabilities,

809
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,159
and you're stopping me?

810
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,239
You might as well kill me

811
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,380
in front of His Majesty.

812
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,559
Mantis Song is now a public enemy.

813
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,279
For your sake and your family's,

814
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,100
you can't take this risk with him.

815
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,500
Leave him.
