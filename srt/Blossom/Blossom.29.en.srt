1
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,590
What's this?

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,180
These are kuanxin noodles,

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,239
traditionally prepared
by a mother-in-law

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,940
for her daughter-in-law

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,540
to establish a harmonious relationship.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,420
My mother is no longer alive,

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,700
so I'm cooking for you.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,140
Why are there four bowls?

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,359
(Memorial Tablet of Song Yichun)

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,500
As per tradition,

11
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,020
I should bring my bride
to pray in the ancestral hall,

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,220
but my father was a sinner,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,750
(Memorial Tablet of Song Yichun)
so he wasn't admitted into the hall.

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,900
These two bowls

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,940
are for my parents.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,940
(Memorial Tablet of Song Yichun)

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,580
Father.

18
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,620
Mother.

19
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,460
I'm married now.

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,460
This is my wife.

21
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,580
We're doing great.

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,700
You can rest in peace in heaven.

23
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,380
Why don't you put the tablet
in the ancestral hall?

24
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,860
We'll just pray quietly
without startling anyone.

25
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,599
I'll come with you.

26
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,460

=Blossom=
(Adapted from the novel "Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

28
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,540
=Episode 29=

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,070
Ever since the horse market
in Liaodong was founded,

30
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,340
our kingdom signed a treaty
with the Lizhen tribe

31
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,900
and promised not to attack each other.

32
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,639
However, the Lizhen tribesmen have
been invading our borders lately,

33
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,140
stealing our livestock and feed.

34
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,319
Meanwhile, Lord Qing

35
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,180
is using this opportunity
to expand his troops

36
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,860
to raise his own elite soldiers.

37
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,220
His intentions are well known to all.

38
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,060
Today, Lord Qing is known to be good
at recruiting talents,

39
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,980
but in fact, he does so

40
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,420
through promises of status and wealth,
and sometimes threats.

41
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,439
Do you think they'd really

42
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,100
worship him as their master?

43
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,460
They won't.

44
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,870
"Lecture not during chaotic times."

45
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,320
"Abandon not during peaceful times."

46
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,860
"Do help during miserable times."

47
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,940
That's the only way
to gain one's loyalty.

48
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,579
Your Lordship, Your Ladyship.

49
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,959
Official Chen is here.

50
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,819
Show him in.

51
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,960
Yes.

52
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,540
Your Lordship, Your Ladyship.

53
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,880
Our scouts in Liaodong
has sent us some news.

54
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,700
The royal court has determined

55
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,460
that ten shi of horse feed
should be sold for seven taels,

56
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,359
but Lord Qing has been
secretly raising prices

57
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,420
all the way to 20 taels, and has only submitted
30% of the revenue to the palace.

58
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,140
He claimed that it
was the palace's orders.

59
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,199
That's why the Lizhen tribesmen
became furious

60
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,620
and turned rogue,

61
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,300
creating chaos in Liaodong.

62
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,919
Lord Qing is abusing power

63
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,180
for his own wealth.

64
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,399
This is a serious matter.

65
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,680
We need to formulate a solution.

66
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,840
If we act impulsively
without a backup plan,

67
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,279
Lord Qing may learn to cover his tracks

68
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,620
and accuse us instead.

69
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,199
(Meritorious Service)

70
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,479
How dare you secretly worship a sinner?

71
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,340
(Memorial Tablet of Song Yichun)
Give me the tablet!

72
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,340
It's only human
to mourn for one's parents.

73
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,100
I hope you can pardon us this time.

74
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,540
It was the Emperor himself
who declared Song Yichun a sinner.

75
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,359
He's already kind enough
to let this family

76
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,260
retain their dukeship status.

77
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,679
If word of this spreads,

78
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,660
you'd be seen as opposing
the Emperor's orders!

79
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,119
Director Song, Princess.

80
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,980
I'm sure

81
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,740
you'd understand that.

82
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,279
Who are you

83
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,820
to shove my master?

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,140
Your master?

85
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,409
That illicit love child

86
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,959
and that dead man

87
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,879
tried to kill the Duchess several times.

88
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,839
How is he a master?

89
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,980
Su Lan, that's enough!

90
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,620
Yes.

91
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,760
You're a princess now.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,490
Of course, you'd protect him.

93
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,420
I can't say no to that.

94
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,500
Su Lan.

95
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,780
Whatever the reason may be,

96
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,600
anyone who offends someone
of a higher rank has to be punished.

97
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,460
Men.

98
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,500
Punish her.

99
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,679
You haughty maid.

100
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,380
You dare to defy the Princess?

101
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,620
Do you have any respect
for the royal family?

102
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,039
If you won't heed the Princess orders,

103
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,940
I'll have to ask
the Empress to interfere

104
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,140
and make sure everyone
in the Duke's residence

105
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,540
know their place.

106
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,959
Men.

107
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,260
Slap her face 20 times.

108
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,940
It was the Prince Consort
who prayed to a sinner.

109
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,340
Please understand this, Princess.

110
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,500
(He just wanted)

111
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,460
(to pray to his parents.)

112
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,420
Why are you still standing there?

113
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,380
Didn't you hear what I said?

114
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,420
Slap her face 20 times!

115
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,700
Stop that!

116
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,980
- Get up.
- Out of the way!

117
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,079
Your Ladyship.

118
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,980
- Your maid has been very brazen.
- Are you fine?

119
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,980
First, she insulted Second Young Master,

120
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,740
then rebutted the Princess.

121
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,319
Are all your servants

122
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,559
so disrespectful?

123
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,800
What do you know about respect?

124
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,660
Is this how you talk to me?

125
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,839
Zhao, I punished her because...

126
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,959
Sister-in-law.

127
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,140
It's not the Princess's fault.

128
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,500
Su Lan...

129
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,620
She kept calling me an illicit...

130
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,860
Forget it.

131
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,300
This row started because of me.

132
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,500
Don't blame her.

133
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,340
I know you've been gossiping
behind our backs.

134
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,799
But they are still newly married.

135
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,420
What will the Princess think?

136
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,279
I just warned you,

137
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,560
and you still dare to talk back?

138
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,620
Sister-in-law, if you think I'm wrong,

139
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,580
then I'm wrong.

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,990
Please don't put the Princess
in a difficult position

141
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,380
and hurt your friendship.

142
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,180
It was my idea
to pray to his father here.

143
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,140
If the Emperor has to punish someone,

144
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,780
I'll take the full blame.

145
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,060
However, Su Lan

146
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,980
has insulted the Prince Consort

147
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,940
several times in public.

148
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,780
I hope you can give me an explanation.

149
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,420
Miao Ansu!

150
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,380
Have you forgotten our friendship
just because you got married?

151
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,479
Exactly!

152
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,999
Even a dog is better than you!

153
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,140
Su Lan!

154
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,620
Well said.

155
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,180
At least Su Lan has exposed

156
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,740
the truth behind
our so-called friendship.

157
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,260
Zhao.

158
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,660
What do you take me for?

159
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,620
How could you ask me that?

160
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,620
Now, I don't know

161
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,300
whether you're good to me

162
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,780
because you saw me as a friend,

163
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,780
or because you pitied me.

164
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,300
If we're truly friends,

165
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,060
now that my husband and I are insulted,

166
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,740
can't I even defend ourselves?

167
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,980
Had I not come,

168
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,100
you would've killed Dou Zhao here,
wouldn't you?

169
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,780
What happened to her?

170
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,940
Summon Official Lu now.

171
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,340
Zhao must have been too angry.

172
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,690
It's impossible to reinstate your
father's tablet in the hall now.

173
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,200
I heard that Sister-in-law

174
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,380
has been working too hard,

175
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,420
so she probably passed out
from exhaustion.

176
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,090
Don't overthink it.

177
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,900
It's just that it's obvious

178
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,060
that a maid is closer to her
than you are.

179
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,260
It was Su Lan who insulted us first,

180
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,300
yet she only blamed you
for punishing her.

181
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,620
She misunderstood you before.

182
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,060
Has my relationship with her turned sour

183
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,740
since we got married?

184
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,700
But why?

185
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,900
Some things change for the worse,

186
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,919
but some change for the better.

187
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,719
(Melody of Bamboo and Pines)

188
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,940
Perhaps it's normal for one
to give up on certain things

189
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,740
when they find the love of their life.

190
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,780
It's my fault.

191
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,260
I'm sorry.

192
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,220
Well?

193
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,100
Her kidneys are acting up

194
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,959
because of exhaustion,

195
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,900
and her uterus is rather cold,

196
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,500
which makes pregnancy hard.

197
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,340
What should we do?

198
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,980
So,

199
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,860
you are very lucky that Her Ladyship

200
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,580
could get pregnant this time.

201
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,460
She's pregnant?

202
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,900
Yes.

203
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,439
Ms. Longevity.

204
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,580
We have a child now.

205
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,580
Is the child healthy?

206
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,140
Your child is fine,

207
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,060
but your body is weak,

208
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,540
and the first three months
are the riskiest.

209
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,220
You have to be much more careful.

210
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,519
Thank you, Official Lu.

211
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,740
Thank you, Official Lu.

212
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,900
I take my leave.

213
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,540
Su Lan, walk him out.

214
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,100
But...

215
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,780
Ms. Longevity.

216
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,380
Giving birth is risky,

217
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,260
and I'm meant to die soon.

218
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,119
Just tell me if you
don't want this child.

219
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,260
I want it.

220
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,780
I want my child to be born

221
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,140
healthily and safely.

222
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,060
I've even thought of names.

223
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,300
If it's a boy, we'll name him Zhiyi.

224
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,060
If it's a girl, then she'll be Lianjun.

225
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,980
"You know my mind

226
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,700
and feel my compassion.

227
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,460
It is a love that needs no questions.

228
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,980
As paddy turns to rice

229
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,420
and candle becomes tears,

230
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,540
our love will bloom."

231
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,660
Those are nice names.

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,100
(Memorial Tablet of Song Yichun)

234
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,580
Second Young Master.

235
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,460
I thought you wanted to pray
to the late Duke this morning?

236
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,599
Why are you...

237
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,740
Did you really think

238
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,740
I wanted to pray to my useless father?

239
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,300
He has no right to enter
the ancestral hall.

(Passing Days)

242
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,119
Today will be the last time Ji Yong

243
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,460
performs acupuncture on Qi Xia.

244
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,060
It's been quite a while.

245
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,860
I wonder how Qi Xia is doing now.

246
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,719
Madam, you should be resting

247
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,340
instead of coming out.

248
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,180
Lord Buddha.

249
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,460
I, Miao Ansu, will worship you
for the rest of my life.

250
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,319
May I receive your blessings.

251
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,940
First, I hope my family can enjoy
peace and longevity.

252
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,119
Second, I hope
that my dear friend Dou Zhao

253
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,420
will be free from calamity
and lead a good life.

254
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,719
Third, I hope that Dou Zhao and I

255
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,060
can resolve our differences
and reconcile.

256
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,500
Zhao.

257
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,559
You can leave first.

258
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,359
I'd like to talk to Zhao alone.

259
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,700
Yes, Princess.

260
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,220
I heard that praying to the Buddha
in Wanfo Temple does work.

261
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,100
I guess my third wish has been granted.

262
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,860
Zhao, you're not angry at me anymore?

263
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,980
No matter how much misunderstanding
we may have,

264
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,020
you're still my best friend.

265
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,700
I wouldn't hold a grudge against you.

266
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,140
Ansu.

267
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,580
Whether it's our friends or husbands,

268
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,700
we chose them to become
part of our family.

269
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,580
I hope you won't regret.

270
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,060
I know you care for me,

271
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,140
but Song Han is not a bad person.

272
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,559
As the youngest son of a duke,

273
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,419
he had never experienced suffering.

274
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,300
Now that his parents have passed away,

275
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,439
he got too overwhelmed.

276
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,020
That's why he's changed drastically.

277
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,940
I guess there are some things
that you should know.

278
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,220
Ansu!

279
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,090
Your body is weak.

280
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,100
It's windy and smoky here.

281
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,300
You might collapse.

282
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,500
Since Sister-in-law stays nearby,

283
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,180
you can save your conversation
for next time.

284
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,540
Zhao.

285
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,780
I'm going home now.
Let's catch up sometime.

286
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,220
- Sure.
- Men.

287
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,700
Escort the Princess back home.

288
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,050
This way, Princess.

289
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,940
I know your tricks.

290
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,820
I've been tolerating you

291
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,860
because Ansu had a turbulent past,

292
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,140
and she truly loves you,

293
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,500
so I didn't want to ruin the man
she's relying on.

294
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,060
However, I now see

295
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,340
that you're taking advantage
of Ansu's love

296
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,799
and the last shred of brotherhood
you share with your brother

297
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,460
to commit unlawful things.

298
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,460
If you don't stop soon,

299
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,500
you will face the consequences,

300
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,500
and I won't let you off.

301
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,260
Sister-in-law, you're still acting

302
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,700
like you're holier than all of us.

303
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,300
Who do you think you are?

304
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,820
A judge?

305
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,620
A king?

306
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,380
Or a god?

307
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,220
I'm just fighting
for what should be mine.

308
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,500
How is that wrong?

309
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,350
In fact, Sister-in-law,

310
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,940
you've been meddling too much.

311
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,860
One day, you'll bear
the brunt of your actions,

312
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,540
and you might hurt yourself.

313
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,850
I take my leave.

314
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,570
How stubborn.

315
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,799
I thought Miss Miao had changed
after she became a princess,

316
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,330
but she still had the heart
to pray for Madam.

317
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,949
I guess childhood friendships

318
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,300
don't change easily.

319
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,460
Your Ladyship!

320
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,220
Your Ladyship.

321
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,929
My wife has recovered.

322
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,280
Qi Xia has recovered!

323
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,050
Bring me to her now.

324
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,180
She's recovered from epilepsy,

325
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,659
but her nerves have been damaged,

326
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,869
so her cognition
is not fully restored yet.

327
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,380
She needs more rest,

328
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,300
so don't exhaust her.

329
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,980
Qi Xia.

330
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,500
Do you recognize me?

331
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,220
Of course I do.

332
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,740
You're my husband.

333
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,020
This is wonderful.

334
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,039
Thank you, Your Ladyship!

335
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,199
Thank you, Master Ji!

336
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,140
Since Qi Xia has recovered,

337
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,679
why don't you work in Yizhi Hall

338
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,100
to take care of her?

339
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,679
Come on, Qi Xia.

340
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,740
Come on, let's kowtow to Her Ladyship!

341
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,860
Please get up.

342
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,059
Su Xin, Su Lan.

343
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,039
Take them back.

344
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,380
- Yes, Your Ladyship.
- Yes, Your Ladyship.

345
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,740
Come on.

346
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,420
Thank you for your help again.

347
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,620
She was destined to recover.

348
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,879
If you're not in a rush,

349
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,340
stay with me a while more.

350
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,140
What is it?

351
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,480
I'd like to teach you
the 13 Acupuncture Spots of the Demons.

352
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,780
The 13 Acupuncture Spots of the Demons?

353
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,820
There's a meridian spot
under the tongue.

354
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,710
When you perform acupuncture there,
we call it "sealing the demon".

355
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,060
It's a very unusual method
that is hard to master.

356
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,959
However, it works miracles on patients
who are in a coma

357
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,860
or in critical condition.

358
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,540
They say physicians shine
during troubled times.

359
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,990
I wish the world is free of illness,
and that physicians are not needed.

360
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,500
Other than acupuncture,

361
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,220
is there anything else
you want to tell me?

362
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,700
You've been my medical student,

363
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,020
and this is probably your last lesson.

364
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,020
Injuries are common
among Lord Qing's troops.

365
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,460
Even ten physicians
cannot compare to you.

366
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,020
For that,

367
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,580
if I were Lord Qing,

368
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,500
I'd do all I can to make you
stay in Liaodong.

369
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,940
Moreover, you're also
a brilliant strategist.

370
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,340
You flatter me.

371
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,260
You didn't come back
to the capital to rest.

372
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:52,319
It was Lord Qing
who ordered you to return

373
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,580
to do something else.

374
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,660
And you approached me right away

375
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,740
because it's part
of Lord Qing's plan, right?

376
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,140
I don't want to hide anything from you,

377
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,300
and I know I can't.

378
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,740
Forget it.

379
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,860
Before we proceed to the boring talk,

380
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,340
come with me.

381
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,380
Little Zhuang Zhou.

382
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,140
Do you remember this place?

383
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,460
Of course.

384
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,020
The cracks on the mirror
are still there.

385
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,730
You're finally awake.

386
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,399
Have you gone crazy from reading?

387
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,220
You knocked your head on the mirror.

388
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,820
I still remember the alignment
of the stars that day.

389
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,860
There is hope hidden in the darkness,

390
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,900
and they're bound by karma.

391
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,380
I thought I was your karma,

392
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,660
but I was wrong.

393
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,060
The final result was a turbulent world.

394
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,340
I didn't expect

395
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,340
that my most trusted friend

396
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,100
would become the cause of it.

397
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,580
Is this what your ambition is?

398
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,300
What I want is to lead the cabinet
and restore the kingdom's glory.

399
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,540
I want the person who trusts me
the most to become the Emperor.

400
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,360
Even if war breaks out in Liaodong,
causing pain and suffering?

401
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,639
As long as Lord Qing
follows my instructions,

402
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,959
he won't have to resort to violence.

403
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,959
Is this why you chose
to serve a traitor?

404
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,719
Since ancient times, the only way

405
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,719
to determine a traitor or pioneer

406
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,100
depends on whether they win.

407
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,940
So, when you were helping
the Miao family back in Futing,

408
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,980
you've already planned this?

409
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,460
Getting close to Lord Qing
through Mu Chuan

410
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,140
was just the first step.

411
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,780
When the bandits invaded the capital,

412
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,420
the Crown Prince lost
almost all of his troops.

413
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,660
Were you part of it too?

414
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,780
Years ago, when Song Yichun released
Li Yaoniang from the Music Office,

415
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,840
he had to go through
the Ministry of Justice.

416
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,980
Since then,

417
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,479
he was already secretly

418
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,719
affiliated to Lord Qing.

419
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,980
I'm asking about you.

420
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,260
Yes.

421
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,890
It was my idea to suppress Song Mo
by manipulating Song Yichun

422
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,140
and the Dou family.

423
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,630
He was the root cause of the issue,
and that was the only solution.

424
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,999
Like playing a game of chess,
I have to play by my strategies.

425
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,180
If the bandits killed me that night,

426
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,570
would you still act so nonchalant?

427
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,020
So, everyone else are just your pawns,

428
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,879
and they must belong to either side?

429
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,829
But, I won't let you die.

430
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:27,260
I won't let you risk your life
for those pawns.

431
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,860
Yes.

432
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,500
I planned everything all along.

433
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,999
But, I've also given you

434
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,879
countless chances to escape.

435
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,039
Had you chosen to leave with me,

436
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,039
I would've given everything up
and start again!

437
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,180
But you?

438
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,740
How could you be so stupid

439
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,420
to fall in love with Song Mo?

440
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,420
Dou Zhao.

441
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,420
My scheme is nowhere near completion.

442
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,260
If you want to keep yourself
and Song Mo safe,

443
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,460
tell him to resign his position
in the Imperial Guards.

444
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,220
I'll make sure
that the both of you stay safe.

445
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,340
The snow ganoderma lucidum does exist.

446
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,460
I didn't lie to you.

447
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,900
Ji Jianming.

448
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,740
Disappointment
is the worst feeling of all.

449
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,580
You were my most trusted friend.

450
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,620
But I know very well

451
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,959
that you'd never turn back.

452
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,900
Why should I turn back?

453
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,499
This is the quickest way.

454
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,359
In just two years,

455
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,700
the kingdom will rise from the ashes.

456
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,060
Then, tell me.

457
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,580
Other than Dou Shishu,
Song Yichun, and Mu Chuan,

458
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,380
who else besides me
is working for Lord Qing?

459
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,500
You shouldn't ask things

460
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,940
that I'm not supposed to say.

461
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,300
Our friendship ends today.

462
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,900
The next time we meet,

463
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,140
we will be enemies.

464
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,319
Must you side with the Crown Prince?

465
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,860
This has nothing to do with you.

466
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,420
I knew you'd come.

467
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,140
Of course.

468
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,620
You've laid out an ambush here.

469
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,300
You wanted to kill us, right?

470
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,540
Halt!

471
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,340
Let them go.

472
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,860
Song Mo.

473
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,079
One day, you will

474
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,740
understand my intentions today.

475
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,460
But, no matter what,

476
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,420
before you die,

477
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,340
please leave Dou Zhao

478
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,540
and don't get her involved.

479
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,660
Cuizhu.

480
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,399
Are there any maids serving
the Prince Consort now?

481
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,639
The Prince Consort said

482
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,879
he doesn't wish to be bothered

483
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,540
when he's resting.

484
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,780
Get me a thick blanket.

485
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,940
Yes, Your Highness.

486
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,500
Didn't I tell you not to get near me
when I'm sleeping?

487
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,340
I didn't want you to catch a cold,

488
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,900
so I got you a blanket.

489
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,820
Sorry, I...

490
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,260
I'm sorry.

491
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,940
Someone!

492
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,159
Summon a physician.

493
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,700
- Right away.
- Wait.

494
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,100
I'm fine, Muyu.

495
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,199
No need to summon a physician.

496
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,340
You may leave now.

497
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,980
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

498
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,180
I...

499
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,980
I didn't mean to do that.

500
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,860
Let me go outside to calm down.

501
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,100
Muyu.

502
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,700
Don't be nervous.

503
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,220
I'm really fine.

504
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,020
Come with me.

505
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,620
Come on.

506
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,660
Here.

507
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,780
Ansu, I...

508
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,660
Sit down.

509
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,220
Lie down.

510
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,460
No, Ansu.

511
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,940
I might hurt you again.

512
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,780
You won't hurt me again.

513
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,620
Lie down.

514
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,780
You have to lie down to sleep.

515
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,220
Listen to me.

516
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,540
Put your legs up and sleep.

517
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,660
Everything will get better.

518
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,540
It'll be fine.

519
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,540
Mother.

520
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,380

549
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:45,420
♪For you, I rise again in this life♪

550
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,520
♪Without regret♪

551
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,199
Sister.

552
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,639
I just want 3,000 taels.

553
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,919
It's urgent.

554
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,180
That's a lot of money.

555
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,220
Why do you need it?

556
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,119
What else?

557
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,500
I lost my money in business.

558
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,919
I told you that business seemed fishy.

559
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,999
And your friends

560
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,319
doesn't look like decent people.

561
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,239
"I told you."

562
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,460
What is there to tell me now?

563
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,559
Just give me the money.

564
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,559
Anping.

565
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,999
You've been spending

566
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,419
more than you can afford.

567
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,279
What do you mean?

568
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,639
I haven't been spending much.

569
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,260
That's enough. Stop fighting.

570
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,380
Ansu.

571
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,060
Listen.

572
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,620
Even though you're the elder sister,

573
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,740
but you're still a woman.

574
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,679
You've been managing

575
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,140
the family's business well,

576
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,559
but you have to know

577
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,239
that everything belongs to your brother.

578
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,279
Exactly.

579
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,220
Don't interfere in this.

580
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,300
All your money is mine.

581
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,260
I'm just letting you keep it for me.

582
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,320
You won't even give me
a few thousand taels now.

583
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,940
Just this month alone,

584
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,319
Anping has spent 1,000 taels

585
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,519
on drinking

586
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,820
and clothing.

587
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,559
Money doesn't fall from the sky.

588
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,660
We can't afford to spend it
like it's unlimited.

589
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,180
As for your business venture,

590
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,340
we need to look into it and plan.

591
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,479
What now?

592
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,639
Now that you're a princess,

593
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,940
your brother can't use
your money anymore?

594
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,399
Why did I give birth
to such a bad daughter?

595
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,540
I...

596
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,319
- Mother!
- My wife!

597
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,759
- Mother!
- Go away!

598
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,580
I'm so mad now.

599
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,439
Look how you've angered Mother.

600
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,700
Are you still my sister?

601
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,239
You must be a traitor.

602
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,639
You must be using our family's money

603
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,580
to repay your husband's debts!

604
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,980
- I'm fine.
- Mother, everything's fine.

605
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,209
Don't be mad.

606
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:34,479
- Why do I have a daughter like her?
- I'm here, don't be mad.

607
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,599
- I'm so...
- Hush now.

608
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,620
Entertain our guests, girls.

609
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,220
You're here, sir.

610
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,439
Here, this way.

611
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,639
Come on.

612
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,340
Fill my cup.

613
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,900
Anping.

614
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,819
You are the Princess's only brother

615
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,620
and the only son of your family.

616
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,620
It's only natural

617
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,830
that you should manage

618
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,900
all of your family's assets.

619
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,540
Of course.

620
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,940
You sure know how to talk.

621
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,700
Thanks to my sister,

622
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,660
you're now rich and promoted.

623
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,780
When you succeed in the future,

624
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,780
don't forget our family.

625
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,679
I will always remember

626
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,460
what the Princess has done for me.

627
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,599
Since you're here, Anping,

628
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,020
you should just

629
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,620
enjoy yourself.

630
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,940
Greetings, Lord Song. My name is Zishu.

631
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,380
Zishu.

632
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,780
Come here and greet Mr. Miao.

633
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,140
Greetings, Mr. Miao.

634
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:05,380
I didn't expect such a beauty
to work here.

635
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,560
Allow me to fill your cup.

636
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,120
Fill my cup!

637
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,740
I'm Princess Anyu's only brother.

638
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:29,919
Are you all happy, good sirs?

639
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,620
Come on, dance!

640
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,340
Greetings, Lord Song.

641
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,639
Greetings, Mr. Miao.

642
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,620
This morning,

643
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,799
someone has already

644
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,820
requested Zishu to serve them today.

645
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,340
According to the rules,

646
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,559
I have to bring Zishu to...

647
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,700
Who?

648
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,279
Who's so bold

649
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,559
to steal my woman?

650
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,879
- Dear sir.
- Zishu!

651
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,959
No, Mr. Miao!

652
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,300
Where's Zishu?

653
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,580
Mr. Miao!

654
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,060
- Mr. Miao!
- Mr. Miao!

655
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,119
Calm down, Mr. Miao!

656
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,940
- Mr. Miao!
- Mr. Miao!

657
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,959
Mr. Miao!

658
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,940
Mr. Miao, listen to me!

659
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,359
- Zishu!
- Excuse me, sir.

660
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,859
- Zishu!
- Calm down!

661
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,350
- Where's Zishu?
- Mr. Miao!

662
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,780
Who's trying to steal Zishu from me?

663
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,300
- I think it's them.
- Zishu.

664
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,279
Buzz off.

665
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,959
- Out of my way.
- You're not needed here.

666
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,380
So, you're the one who's trying
to steal Zishu from me?

667
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,780
Yeah.

668
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,700
Who are you?

669
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,380
Listen,

670
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,740
I'm the...

671
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,140
Who cares?

672
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,159
Mr. Miao!

673
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,820
Don't fight, please!

674
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,580
We can talk it out!

675
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,439
He missed!

676
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,820
Punch me here.

677
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,180
Damn you!

678
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,380
Mr. Miao!

679
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,060
Your Highness!

680
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,380
Your Highness!

681
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,199
Something...

682
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,340
What happened?

683
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,780
Anping.

684
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,900
Anping.

685
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,820
What happened to Anping?

686
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,980
Someone in Drunken Bordello

687
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,740
beat him to death.

688
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,140
Anping, don't scare me.

689
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,420
Wake up.

690
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,380
How could this happen?

691
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,260
Anping.

692
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:29,260
(Prudence and Caution)

693
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,500
Ansu.

694
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,900
You're awake.

695
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,380
I'm sorry, Ansu.

696
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,560
I couldn't reach there in time.

697
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,100
The killer

698
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,940
has been arrested.

699
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,580
Who's there?

700
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,159
- Song Han?
- Take him away.

701
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:12,999
You...

702
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,519
What are you doing?

703
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,359
- Move it!
- Who are you to arrest me?

704
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,839
Do you know who my father is?

705
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,940
Song Han, how dare you arrest me?

706
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,620
Anping...

707
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,260
How did he

708
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,980
get beaten to death?

709
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,660
The incident happened
at Drunken Bordello.

710
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,399
That Miao kid is a weakling.

711
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,580
Yeah, and he's the Princess's brother?

712
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,810
- Back then, Anping and Dongqi...
- Run along now.

713
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,239
They were fighting

714
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,460
over a courtesan.

715
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,380
Stay there if you dare!

716
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,740
Just you wait!

717
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,660
I'll be waiting for you.

718
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,319
Move it!

719
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,460
Shoo!

720
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,020
Soon after Anping walked out,

721
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,300
he began to vomit blood

722
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,060
and fainted.

723
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,940
When my men and I found him
in an alleyway,

724
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,180
he was already...

725
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,260
How could this happen?

726
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,340
He's my only brother.

727
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,300
What about my parents?

728
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,740
I've already talked

729
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,340
to the elders in your family.

730
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,500
Your father had a stroke,

731
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,980
and the imperial physician
is with him now.

732
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,500
Your mother

733
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,820
fainted a few times from sadness.

734
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,100
She's fine, though.

735
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,020
Don't be afraid.

736
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,220
Everything's fine.

From now on,

738
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,580
even if I'm the only one by your side,

739
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,140
I will take good care of you.

740
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:38,439
I think

741
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,279
the Crown Prince admires you.

742
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,039
You haven't met him many times,
have you?

743
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,679
If you can become a good ruler,

744
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,920
I will help you establish your power
and fight the evil forces.

745
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,780
If you won't accept that,

746
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:51,220
I don't mind having another enemy.
