I think

9
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,430
it's the end of the road for you

10
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,400
after being a loyal official
for so long.

11
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,590
What do you think,

12
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,150
Your Highness?

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,860
(Crown Prince, Zhu Yousheng)

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,480
In the past, my uncle, Duke of Ding,

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,920
and all 237 people of the Jiang clan

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,200
were framed.

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,790
All 53,000 soldiers of the Ding Army

18
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,590
were wronged and humiliated.

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,157
Today, I wonder how many will it be
for the East Palace

20
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,000
and the capital.

21
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,400
You disregarded
your father, the emperor,

22
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,760
and helped Zhu Youting seize the throne

23
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,840
just to clear

24
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,840
Ding Army's name.

25
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,560
You are even putting the blame

26
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,400
on Father and me.

27
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,560
I will kill any suspect.

28
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,200
(General of Cavalry, Song Mo)
You think you're wronged?

29
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,680
Song Mo,

30
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,590
I pity you.

31
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,010
You took revenge on the wrong person.

32
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,710
I lost.

33
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,030
But you will also lose everything.

34
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,870
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

35
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,710
I'd rather die

36
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,910
than obey a traitor.

37
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,470
Sir,

38
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,400
I found it.

39
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,640
Congratulations, Sir.

40
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,960
You're halfway to your revenge.

41
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,120
He said

42
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,710
I took revenge on the wrong person.

43
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,370
(During the winter of the 27th year
of the Chengping era,)

44
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,430
(while the emperor was gravely ill,)

45
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,310
(General of Cavalry, Song Mo,
supported Lord Qing)

46
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,030
(to launched a night attack
on the capital)

47
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,880
(by using the excuse
of accompanying the emperor)

48
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,970
(to avenge Duke of Ding
who suffered an injustice.)

49
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,030
Having more than 100 weapons
is a felony.

50
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,610
Did you know that Lord Qing
and Song Mo would start a rebellion?

51
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,560
The capital is getting dangerous.

52
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,790
The streets are filled
with rebels and refugees.

53
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,940
(Marquis of Jining's Wife, Dou Zhao)
Who cares about a crime

54
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,150
when in such a chaos?

55
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,290
Take them.

56
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,150
Yes!

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,120
Song Mo is a cold-blooded killer.

58
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,630
He murdered his father
and younger brother back then.

59
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,750
Now, he has started a rebellion
and attacked the capital.

60
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,560
Everyone is saying that Song Mo

61
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,470
is going to wipe out the city.

62
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,390
That was why I tried to escape.

63
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,780
(Marquis of Jining, Wei Tingyu)
Ridiculous!

64
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,870
How dare a servant like you

65
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,240
gossip about
affairs of the imperial court?

66
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,720
Beat him up!

67
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,430
This traitor, Song Mo,

68
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,800
is here to get revenge.

69
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,300
(Shadow Guard, Chen Jia)

70
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,320
(Court Eunuch of Ministry
of Imperial Ceremony, Wang Ge)

71
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,390
After tonight,

72
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,600
Lord Qing will become the emperor.

73
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,310
General Song, you contributed the most.

74
00:05:18,388 --> 00:05:19,230
We are here

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,190
to congratulate you.

76
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,870
Do you know

77
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,510
that what I did tonight

78
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,830
was to avenge Duke of Ding?

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,160
Once I meet His Majesty,

80
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,920
I will hand this over to Lord Qing.

81
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,310
His Majesty is having a conversation

82
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,480
with His Highness.

83
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,510
You shouldn't disturb him.

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,310
When the throne changes hands,

85
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,160
you will meet His Majesty.

86
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,960
Fine.

87
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,920
Ask him to come to me

88
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,240
when he becomes the emperor.

89
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,720
Everyone, heed my order!

90
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,080
Yes!

91
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,190
Move to the outskirts

92
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,160
and await His Majesty's orders!

93
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,560
Yes!

94
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,980
(A new emperor
who couldn't ascend the throne)

95
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,190
(and the rebels
who surround the capital's outskirts.)

96
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,790
(An impasse.)

97
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,160
(A chaos.)

98
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,310
(Marquis of Jining's Residence)

99
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,040
(At that time,
I would never have imagined)

100
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:25,430
(that the seemingly stable residence)

101
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,680
(already had
so many cracks within.)

102
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,760
From tonight onwards,

103
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,720
entertainment and repairs
in the residence are halted.

104
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,980
The servants in charge,

105
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,260
go purchase a month's worth

106
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,310
of meat, vegetables,
and fruit tomorrow morning.

107
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,480
Patrol the residence along this route.

108
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,750
Rotate in four shifts.

109
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,870
Assign blades and arrows
to the ten men at the entrances

110
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,190
and have them guard there all day.

111
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,910
Put two more men

112
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,720
guard the duke, Ming,
and the three Madam's chambers.

113
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,030
Yes.

114
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,000
Madam.

115
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,130
The duke and Lord Qing are relatives.

116
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,000
(Ms. Tuo)
All the nobles

117
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,850
and ministers

118
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,040
are seeking an audience.

119
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,720
At such a crucial time,

120
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,070
Lord Qing's men
are calling for enthronement.

121
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,350
(Dou Family's Second Daughter, Dou Ming)
The officials would risk themselves

122
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,140
for the emperor.
There are fence sitters too.

123
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,870
Everyone wants to drag Tingyu down.

124
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,880
I'm not meeting them.

125
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,510
But if I don't meet them,

126
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,620
I might offend them.

127
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,720
Carry it inside.

128
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,820
(Libation)

129
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,640
I am ill.

130
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,120
I'm seriously ill.

131
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,560
The duke is not meeting guests

132
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,070
to take care of me.

133
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,070
This is inappropriate.

134
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,000
Can propriety help you overcome this?

135
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,360
Nothing is greater than life and death.

136
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,190
With the coffin here,

137
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,430
you will have peace.

138
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,340
(Libation)

139
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,540
=Blossom=

140
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:48,060
(Adapted from the novel
"Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

141
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,100
=Episode 1=

142
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,520
Buy 100 kilograms of charcoal.

143
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,480
The duke and Ming like
to write and draw.

144
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,510
Buy another 100 feet of paper.

145
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,000
Ask all the managers
of estates and shops

146
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,340
to come to see me after lunch.

147
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,590
Yes.

148
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,440
Madam.

149
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,840
Here you go.

150
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,290
Madam, the miscarriage

151
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,240
almost killed you last year.

152
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,150
The priority now

153
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,870
is to take care of your health.

154
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,720
Don't overwork.

155
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,280
The wife of a big family
has to take care of everything.

156
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,600
Serving my husband's family,

157
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,700
taking care of his concubines,
illegitimate children,

158
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,720
more than 100 people in the residence,

159
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,270
and managing dozens

160
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,720
of estates and shops.

161
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,120
That's not counting
the usual social activities.

162
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,080
The duke doesn't even ask you

163
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,270
about your illness.

164
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,460
Fifth Young Lady came from far away

165
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,550
and said she'd take care of you

166
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,840
but she was always not around.

167
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,260
You're not from the same mother
after all.

168
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,540
- She's so heartless.
- Ms. Tuo.

169
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,630
Madam, look.

170
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,320
It's not even spring yet

171
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,360
but the Yulan magnolias are in bloom.

172
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,720
It's my first time
seeing Yulan magnolias in the snow.

173
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,650
My mother would be very happy

174
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,630
if she could see it.

175
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,670
If Seventh Madam were still around,

176
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,480
you wouldn't have to work so hard.

177
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,390
What's that smell?

178
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,480
The smell of herbs.

179
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,320
Someone's making herbal soup.

180
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,720
It seems like Ming isn't slacking.

181
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,320
She is making medicine for me.

182
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,680
Yes.

183
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,030
Don't talk about our mothers
in the future.

184
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,880
Ming will feel sad if she hears it.

185
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:05,990
Yes.

186
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,960
I'm afraid the medicine is burnt.

187
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,800
Don't worry.

188
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,960
The physician said

189
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,550
she would die soon.

190
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,960
Once she dies and
the mourning period is over,

191
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,600
I will marry you.

192
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,240
He is right.

193
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,360
Our marriage was decided by our parents.

194
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,590
There were
never any feelings between us.

195
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,000
If they have feelings for each other,

196
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,750
he can marry Dou Ming

197
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,510
after I die from illness,

198
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,990
so the relationship
between the Wei and Dou family

199
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,600
can be long-lasting.

200
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,960
Madam.

201
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,080
Let's go.

202
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,200
I'm afraid Father won't allow it.

203
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,630
Her mother and my mother

204
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,770
were close friends back then.

205
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,440
The relationship
between my mother and Father

206
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,870
caused her mother's death.

207
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,510
(Mother...)

208
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,120
(Mother died because of her?)

209
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,240
I've been doing my best
to manage the residence

210
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,790
but ended up
helping my enemy instead.

211
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,630
The kitchen is on fire.

212
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,510
Get someone here.

213
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,470
Yes.

214
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,120
Don't worry.

215
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,910
Don't you know me well?

216
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,840
I will do everything I can

217
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,270
to marry you.

218
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,200
No one can separate us.

219
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,020
There's a fire!

220
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,440
- There's a fire!
- Hurry!

221
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,960
- Hurry, there's a fire!
- Someone!

222
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,800
What's that noise?

223
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,490
- There's a fire!
- Hurry!

224
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,560
Someone!

225
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,550
Quick! There's a fire!

226
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,630
- There's a fire!
- There's a fire!

227
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,320
Hurry!

228
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:15,990
Dear,

229
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,200
it's my fault.

230
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,240
Don't hurt Ming.

231
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,440
I'm not going to harm her.

232
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,750
But I want to thank both of you

233
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,720
for not letting me remain clueless.

234
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,150
- Sister.
- Don't call me that.

235
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,960
I've never wanted love from you,

236
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,390
or you.

237
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,080
But both of you

238
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,870
even trample on my last bit of feelings.

239
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,320
How did my mother die?

240
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,670
It was before I was born.

241
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,630
But I heard the elders talk about it.

242
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,720
I don't know so much.

243
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,910
I will investigate this.

244
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,740
However, there should be an explanation

245
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,000
for what happens today.

246
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,350
You...

247
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,320
I, Dou Zhao, married into this family
for ten years

248
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,390
and did my best every day

249
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,960
to manage the residence.

250
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,790
I've never let you, Wei Tingyu,

251
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,750
or Dou Ming down.

252
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,510
During the chaos of the capital,

253
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,510
I've been looking after the residence
with my fragile body,

254
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,720
but they

255
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,030
were fornicating in the kitchen

256
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,150
and cursing me to die.

257
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,200
A heartless man cannot be relied on.

258
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,150
The daughter of an enemy
cannot be a family of mine.

259
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,990
When this scandal and grudge
is tried in court in the future,

260
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,510
all of you are witnesses.

261
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,630
From today onward,

262
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,080
I'm no longer the wife
of the Marquis of Jining.

263
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,840
Master!

264
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,110
Master.

265
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,320
Madam left in a carriage.

266
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,160
Stupid.

267
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,390
Don't you think I know that?

268
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,190
I asked you to guard here.
What did you do?

269
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,400
Why are you still spacing out?

270
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,390
Get our clothes here.

271
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,450
Yes!

272
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,220
If I knew this would happen,

273
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,700
I would've listened to my mother

274
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,060
to put poison in her medicine

275
00:16:22,587 --> 00:16:23,907
to kill her.

276
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,900
Why are you still here?

277
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,460
If she goes to court,

278
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,260
we won't live a peaceful life
from now on.

279
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,230
Don't worry.

280
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:34,227
She will never ruin the reputation

281
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,500
of my family.

282
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,460
Having talent and ambition

283
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,900
without any place to show.

284
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:03,730
Miss.

285
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,220
It's snowing heavily.

286
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,380
This isn't snow.

287
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:35,170
Ms. Tuo,

288
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,500
give them some food.

289
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,310
Thank you.

290
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,700
Thank you.

291
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,620
(The land is ruined
and the empire will soon fall.)

292
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,340
(Everything is unexpected.)

293
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,420
(This ill-fated departure)

294
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,180
(is my farewell.)

295
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,100
The willow is born.

296
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,620
Spin the top.

297
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,220
The willow is green.

298
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,740
Play the diabolo.

299
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,700
The willow sprouts.

300
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,660
Hit...

301
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:14,940
Ms. Tuo.

302
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,780
I was young when Mother passed away.

303
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,540
Help me recall if there
was anything weird.

304
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,200
The Old Master
just became a palace scholar.

305
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,670
It was also your cousin's birthday.

306
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,550
The late Madam asked me to bring you

307
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,240
to tell your uncle this good news.

308
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,290
When I came back,
the late Madam passed away.

309
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,040
Later, Wang Yingxue
married into the family.

310
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:42,980
Look out!

311
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,820
Ms. Tuo!

312
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,260
(A groundbreaking long spear)

313
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,140
(and grey hair at a young age.)

314
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,740
(Song Mo?)

315
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,620
Miss, are you all right?

316
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,620
Miss.

317
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,580
Miss.

318
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,820
Do you hear me?

319
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,540
If you cry,

320
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,060
I'll send you to the devil, Song Mo.

321
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,260
He eats children.

322
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,880
I'm not crying.

323
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,380
Give me the rations.

324
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,100
Go home.

325
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,700
(He isn't
as cruel as the rumours suggest.)

326
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,420
General, since you know the kids

327
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,260
don't even dare to cry
when you're mentioned,

328
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,700
(Ji Yong, Monk Name: Yuantong)
you should

329
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,340
kill less in the future.

330
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,340
It's a carriage
from Marquis of Jining's Residence.

331
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,820
(Lu Ming)

332
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,980
The capital is in chaos.

333
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,500
Why do you come here?

334
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,310
I'm going back to my hometown.

335
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,060
You are so ill and you've gone
through an arduous journey.

336
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,620
You can go to heaven

337
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,300
instead of your hometown.

338
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,780
Follow me to get warm at the temple.

339
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,860
Have a bowl of herbal soup.

340
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,300
Hold it.

341
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,780
How can we accept

342
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,260
(Lu Zheng)
an unknown person now?

343
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,460
Lu Zheng.

344
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,700
Everyone, hear my orders!

345
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,700
Yes!

346
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,200
Move to the back hill of Wanfo Temple!

347
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,060
Yes!

348
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,140
I thought it was an enemy scout.

349
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,300
Sorry for what I did.

350
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,380
Lu Ming.

351
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,660
Fix the carriage
and escort her to the temple.

352
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,020
Yes.

353
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,140
Miss.

354
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,740
I investigated it.

355
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,490
There're only money and clothing
in the carriage.

356
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,910
It's difficult to travel in the snow

357
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,240
and you are very ill.

358
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,400
Anything urgent?

359
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,800
We shouldn't bother you

360
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,100
with the family trifles, General.

361
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,560
The general treated you with courtesy

362
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,360
and allowed you to rest here.

363
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,410
How dare you still hide things from us?

364
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,900
Is this a trap?

365
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,740
Lu Ming.

366
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,820
Miss.

367
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,440
You should know

368
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,760
that everything will be decided
in a few days.

369
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,560
Being cautious is the only way
to survive in a dangerous place.

370
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,320
We must know everything.

371
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,640
- General, I...
- Ms. Tuo.

372
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,000
It's nothing important.

373
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,320
It's just

374
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,600
a family scandal, General.

375
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,840
The Marquis of Jining
has been having an affair

376
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,800
with my half-sibling

377
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,320
while I am seriously ill.

378
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,560
I witnessed it today

379
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,640
and wanted to divorce immediately.

380
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,280
However, the imperial court
had no one on duty

381
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,800
due to the capital's chaos,

382
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,000
so I had to

383
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,490
return to my hometown
to report it to the officials.

384
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,800
I see.

385
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,620
I had

386
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,760
offended you.

387
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,720
You are too serious.

388
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
I am no longer
the wife of the Marquis of Jining.

389
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,800
My surname is Dou.

390
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,720
I'm the fourth child of the family.

391
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,520
A man's indulgence can be spoken of

392
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,280
but a woman's indulgence cannot.

393
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,000
Getting to know a person early

394
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,720
and settle things quickly.

395
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,240
Miss Dou,

396
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,360
that's a blessing in disguise.

397
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,280
General, you will rule the new empire.

398
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,280
You have authority and power.

399
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,240
Why do you have
a head full of grey hair?

400
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,200
I can see dejection
in between your eyes.

401
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,840
Sir.

402
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,300
Sir.

403
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,120
I'm sorry.

404
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,800
A person who is dying

405
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,240
gave his life to the wrong person.

406
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,540
You are right.

407
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,920
A person who is dying

408
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,290
gave his life to the wrong person.

409
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,760
The sun is coming up.

410
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,080
Later, I'll have someone to escort you back
to your hometown.

411
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,840
The sky looks weird today.

412
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,100
The Fire Star enters
the Purple Forbidden Enclosure.

413
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,160
It's a sign of chaos.

414
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,600
However, the meteor is bright.

415
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,300
The chaos of the capital

416
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,160
is indeed the reflection,

417
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,560
but the meteor...

418
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,920
There should be a blessing
among the disasters.

419
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,240
Both of you are fated.

420
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,200
Master Yuantong, you overestimated me.

421
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,120
A weak woman like me

422
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,720
is just a passerby
who avoids the blizzard

423
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,800
and gets a bowl of hot medicine.

424
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:19,240
How will I be fated with General Song?

425
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,060
What?

426
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,840
Is Lord Qing not going
to give us an explanation?

427
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,440
General Song!

428
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,620
Even if you are almighty,

429
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,040
if you do this,

430
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,720
Lord Qing

431
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,160
will still kill you.

432
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,360
Whoever sits on the throne

433
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,600
is cold-blooded.

434
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,280
Duke of Ding sacrificed himself
to guard the border for 15 years

435
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,780
but was accused of treason

436
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,960
and was punished
with the annihilation of his clan.

437
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,840
His Highness hasn't
ascended the throne yet

438
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,840
and is already trying
to kill the one who helped him.

439
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,890
Are you not worried
that the officials will be in fear?

440
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,640
General Song, you're overthinking.

441
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,860
If news goes out,

442
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,660
it's just a scandal

443
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,080
of Marquis of Jining's family.

444
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,400
It has nothing to do with Lord Qing.

445
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,900
Am I right?

446
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,200
(Granted by the Emperor)
By Lord Qing's edict,

447
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,580
Song Mo became arrogant.

448
00:27:36,581 --> 00:27:37,800
He abused favour
and acted against reason

449
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,240
to kidnap

450
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,060
and eloped with
Marquis of Jining's wife, Dou Zhao.

451
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,770
Wei Tingyu, you...

452
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,140
With both of them captured together,
they will be executed

453
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,000
as the family's law.

454
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,920
Putting the blame on a woman.

455
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,200
Lord Qing is more shameless
than his father, the previous emperor.

456
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,640
General Song,

457
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,060
if you hand over the jade seal

458
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,320
and commit suicide,

459
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:04,960
Lord Qing will leave your body whole.

460
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,160
Unfortunately,

461
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,880
I'm very petty.

462
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,280
I won't leave both your bodies whole.

463
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:24,560
Kill!

464
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,060
Madam,

465
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,840
please come with me
to hide at the back hill.

466
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,960
Let's go.

467
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,920
When Lord Qing stopped me
from meeting His Majesty,

468
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,360
I knew he was going to betray me.

469
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,240
- Sir.
- I gave him a chance.

470
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,240
If he kept his promise to meet me,

471
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,640
I would spare him.

472
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,800
However, he went
to Xishanxing Palace instead.

473
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,140
(Xishanxing Palace)

474
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,440
The elites of the Ding Army I deployed

475
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,720
did not go to waste.

476
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,880
How does killing me benefit Song Mo?

477
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,860
Even if he wants to rule the kingdom,

478
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,220
I can grant him the opportunity.

479
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,580
(Lord Qing, Zhu Youting)
Kill!

480
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,840
Kill!

481
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,920
Lord Qing

482
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,440
is supposed to be dead by now.

483
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,880
You're just bluffing.

484
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,740
Take him down.

485
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,160
Sir.

486
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,500
(Qiguang Wanfo Pagoda)

487
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,820
Get ready for battle!

488
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,440
Kill!

489
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,020
Miss.

490
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,940
Be careful.

491
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:22,690
Ding Army is brave and excels in battle.

492
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,100
We have been surrounded now.

493
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,620
What should we do?

494
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,760
Don't worry. If your wife is dead,

495
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,020
Song Mo is just a criminal general

496
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,440
no matter how powerful he is.

497
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,740
Sir!

498
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,160
Miss, go quickly!

499
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,080
I'll kill you!

500
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,060
How can

501
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,000
a weak woman like you

502
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,800
kill anyone?

503
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,260
Ms. Tuo!

504
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,060
General.

505
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,220
General.

506
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,120
I didn't know about Wei Tingyu's plans.

507
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,400
I'm seriously poisoned

508
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,400
and going to die soon.

509
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,480
I'm just sorry

510
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,040
I can't avenge the Duke of Ding.

511
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,040
But I caused you

512
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,920
to get your name tarnished
and your life in danger.

513
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,960
You saved me

514
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,720
last night at the outskirts.

515
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,640
I got you into this.

516
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,000
Let's go. I'll take you away.

517
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,660
Yuantong.

518
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,880
Master Yuantong.

519
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,260
Yuantong.

520
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,980
(Records of the Enlightened Age)

521
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,820
Go.

522
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,060
Go.

523
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,980
- Over there.
- Let's leave together.

524
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,880
I'm not important.

525
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,520
A blessing in disguise.
Both of you are fated.

526
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,640
Both of you can change destiny.

527
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,400
Go.

528
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,700
They are over there!

529
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,540
Catch them!

530
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,620
Hurry!

531
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,380
Look out!

532
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,360
(Don't be a woman.)

533
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,040
(Your happiness will
be in others' hands.)

534
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,320
(Not only married couples
in the mortal realm will change.)

535
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,920
(It's also the same for
an emperor and his officials.)

536
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,920
(Being grateful in dawn)

537
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,280
(and killing them at dusk.)

538
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,380
(Records of the Enlightened Age)

539
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,680
(I've never had)

540
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,800
(a moment in my life)

541
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,260
(Records of the Enlightened Age)

542
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,960
(where I have a choice.)

543
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,020
You're finally awake.

544
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,740
You were entranced while reading

545
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,160
and hit yourself in the mirror.

546
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,380
This...

547
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:58,980
What?

548
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,760
Ms. Longevity.

549
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,060
Miss!

550
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,300
Ms. Longevity.

551
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,140
Miss.

552
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,260
(Dou Family's Mistress, Zhao Guqiu)
You're awake.

553
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,760
Mother.

554
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,200
Ms. Tuo.

555
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,760
You are here.

556
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,640
Why are you being coquettish?

557
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,600
It's all my fault.

558
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,140
Madam begged Buddha to bless Master

559
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,560
into becoming a scholar.

560
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,960
I also went to make a wish.

561
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,960
I didn't look after you.

562
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,480
Become a scholar?

563
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,780
Is this

564
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,000
the eighth year of the Chengping era?

565
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,180
Yes.

566
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,120
But I've lived my life.

567
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:18,960
Just now,

568
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,840
the temple was full of Shadow Guards.

569
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,400
I died in front of the mirror.

570
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,440
Miss.

571
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,000
Zhuang Zhou dreams of the butterfly.
The butterfly dreams of Zhuang Zhou.

572
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,400
It's just a dream.

573
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,080
You read a storybook
until you were too immersed.

574
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,080
You hit your head
and had a crazy dream.

575
00:39:38,382 --> 00:39:40,280
The dream and you are two things.

576
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,740
(Records of the Enlightened Age)

577
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,760
Records of the Enlightened Age?

578
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,980
It was a storybook left by a hermit

579
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,520
for a fated person.

580
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,100
I think

581
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,000
you are the Little Zhuang Zhou
who is fated to it.

582
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,880
Thank you, Master Yuantong.

583
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,320
Are you Yuantong?

584
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,100
Mo!

585
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,840
You are finally awake.

586
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,180
Mo!

587
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,800
I was so scared because you had
a nightmare and couldn't wake up.

588
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,360
Thankfully, the abbot treated you.

589
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,600
(Duke of Ying's Wife, Jiang Huisun)
How are you? Feeling better?

590
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,160
Mother.

591
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,000
I had a very long dream.

592
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,220
However, I forgot everything

593
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,880
about the dream.

594
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,160
That's good.

595
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,120
Everything in life

596
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,680
has the wisdom
and virtuous appearance of Buddha.

597
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,080
But due to delusion and attachment,

598
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,280
they cannot attain realization.

599
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,960
Thank you, Abbott.

600
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,840
However, I think

601
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,520
I shouldn't forget the dream.

602
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,240
(On the day of becoming a scholar,)

603
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,240
(a man complains)
(The Yulan magnolia wilts.)

604
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,760
(Records of the Enlightened Age)
(ambition goes away with the wind.)

605
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,200
(Focusing on the bad times and
regret not cherishing the good times.)

606
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,520
(Why does it feel like a defeat)

607
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,760
(after becoming a scholar?)

608
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,100
Ms. Longevity?

609
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,620
What are you looking at?

610
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,520
Is this storybook so nice?

611
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:52,820
He succeeded.

612
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,020
He succeeded?

613
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,470
Madam!

614
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,200
Madam!

615
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,200
He succeeded!

616
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,140
Master did it.

617
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,000
Seventh rank on the second tier.

618
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,400
That's great.

619
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,540
Shiying finally gets his wish

620
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,960
after studying day and night.

621
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,440
Who did you hear from

622
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,200
about your father's success?

623
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,020
I...

624
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,160
This temple is a good place.

625
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:21,380
Madam

626
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,180
also came to pray for Wang Yingxue's

627
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,020
family matters.

628
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,240
- Wang Yingxue?
- Everything has come true.

629
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,880
(Father studied hard for many years)

630
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,160
(and finally
became a scholar that year.)

631
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,760
(While the whole family
was celebrating,)

632
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,820
(Mother fell ill suddenly.)

633
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,660
Mother!

634
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,880
What's wrong, Mother?

635
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,520
(After Mother passed away,)

636
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,440
(Wang Yingxue married into the family)

637
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,340
(and became my stepmother.)

638
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,620
Her mother and my mother

639
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,000
were close friends back then.

640
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,600
The relationship
between my mother and Father

641
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,280
caused her mother's death.

642
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,420
Gao Sheng.

643
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,280
Prepare the carriage.

644
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,600
Yes, Madam.

645
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,260
Ms. Tuo, take her to Zhao Residence

646
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,260
to tell my brother the good news.

647
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,490
It's Zhangru's birthday as well.

648
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:02,330
- No.
- Yes.

649
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,280
I haven't seen Father for a long time.

650
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:09,100
Why not invite Uncle and my cousin

651
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,040
to celebrate together?

652
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,420
Uncle is a vice censor-in-chief.

653
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,040
He has the power
to impeach other officials.

654
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,860
His reports
can be presented to His Majesty.

655
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,140
It will be good for Father

656
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:17,160
when he becomes an official.

657
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:22,840
How do you know all these?

658
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:25,680
That's a good thing.

659
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:28,580
I haven't reunited
with Brother for a long time.

660
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,120
Go and invite my brother.

661
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,300
We can finally taste

662
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,880
the jar of wine I buried for Shiying

663
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,360
when I married into the family.

664
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,240
I must thank Buddha for the blessing.

665
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,000
Give it to me.

666
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:42,150
Slow down.

667
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:44,950
Ms. Tuo,

668
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:46,320
Father went to the capital
for the imperial exam.

669
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,080
Does Wang Yingxue live
in the capital too?

670
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,420
Yes.

671
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,800
Miss Wang's father was demoted

672
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:52,880
and her family was in decline.

673
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,560
They sold cotton and rice
for a living in Chanxi.

674
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,900
When Master studied in Chanxi,

675
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,080
Madam asked Master

676
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,080
to bring some money to Miss Wang.

677
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,000
Ask Uncle to come immediately.

678
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,100
The sooner, the better.

679
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:08,660
Yes.

680
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,360
(What has happened cannot be rectified,)

681
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,760
(but I can still change the future.)

682
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,040
(Since the Records
of the Enlightened Age)

683
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,520
(has fate recorded in it,)

684
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:27,960
(I can change its ending)

685
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,360
(since I've known it)

686
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,560
(while it is in my hands.)

687
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:35,860
(Mother,)

688
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:37,520
(no matter how hard
and dangerous it is,)

689
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,280
(I will protect you)

690
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,160
(from anyone.)

691
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,020
Dou Shiying went away to study,

692
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,280
but he was cheating.

693
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,020
If you dare force my sister,

694
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:07,020
I, Zhao Si, will kill you

695
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,500
even if I have to sacrifice my life!

696
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,280
If you can't forgive me,

697
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,480
just grant me a white cloth
to commit suicide.

698
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,880
If you want to die so badly,

699
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,180
take it.
