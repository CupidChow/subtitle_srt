1
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,009
It's cold and windy.

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,699
Madam, take care of your health.

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,729
I'll be fine.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,280
I'm not that weak.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,230
But I'm really worried

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,360
about Ansu.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,800
She must be heartbroken

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,870
But it's not convenient for me
to visit her.

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,200
Go and buy her some tonic.

10
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,520
Yes, Madam.

11
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,070
Who is it?

12
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:32,590
Directress Su?

13
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,440
What are you trying to do?

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,880
Zhao?

15
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:43,649
You can leave us.

16
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,910
Yes, Princess.

17
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,040
I'd like to ask Madam something.

18
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,230
Where did you get this silver hairpin?

19
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,609
Madam, my mother asked me
to give this to you.

20
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,649
Thank you for your help.

21
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:04,910
I cannot accept this.

22
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,200
A mother and her son gave it to me.

23
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,680
When Yantang saved them,

24
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,040
their village
had already been attacked by bandits.

25
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,120
The boy's arm was burned.

26
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,760
But luckily he was saved in time.

27
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,320
Otherwise,

28
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,480
he would have died on the streets.

29
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,150
The people you saved

30
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,710
were my mother and younger brother.

31
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,510
Madam, could you take me to them?

32
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,100
(Zhaowen Bookstore)

33
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,419
Your mother and brother

34
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,280
(To Su Yan)
are doing well in Liaodong.

35
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,299
As long as you stay loyal,

36
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,510
I will take good care of your family.

37
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,160
(I will never forget the kindness)

38
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,830
(you showed the Su Family.)

39
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,699
I'm willing to serve you faithfully

40
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,000
until my dying day.

41
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,910
Madam, please don't tell them I was here

42
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,230
to avoid any complications.

43
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,070
Don't worry.

44
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,910
I'll get going now, Madam.

45
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,470
Yan.

46
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,510
Yan!

47
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,280
- Yan...
- Mother.

48
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,950
Mother.

49
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,280
I was deceived by a treacherous person.

50
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,320
I didn't know you and Brother suffered

51
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,560
so much.

52
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,830
Yan,

53
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,259
I've finally found you.

54
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,400
Mother,

55
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,320
please live well with my brother.

56
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,229
Madam.

57
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,370
Get up quickly.

58
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,440
Madam, you saved

59
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,440
my mother and brother

60
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,440
and helped them settle down.

61
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,390
I will never forget

62
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,270
such kindness.

63
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,120
If I ever get the chance,

64
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,960
I will repay this kindness

65
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,830
a thousand times over.

66
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,399
=Blossom=
(Adapted from the novel "Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

67
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,479
=Episode 30=

68
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,500
(Natural Grace and Talent)

69
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,470
Madam, what are you doing?

70
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,470
I'm making glutinous rice balls.

71
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,280
I nearly forgot
the palace banquet is around the corner.

72
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,230
That's right.

73
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,430
By the way,

74
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,139
we must not be careless

75
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,990
now that Lord Qing is returning
to the capital.

76
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,939
The more evidence we gather,

77
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,390
the closer we get to safety.

78
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,169
We need to find out
what cards Lord Qing is holding.

79
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,289
Being far away,

80
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,320
he can't quickly grasp the situation
in the palace.

81
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,329
So he must have important allies here,

82
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,510
and not just one.

83
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,710
It's too difficult for us to interfere
with palace matters

84
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,710
unless we leverage
the Eastern Palace's influence.

85
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,760
But the Crown Prince is very stubborn,
and I can't get through to him.

86
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,000
It doesn't matter.

87
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,950
Lord Qing can use our family
to target you.

88
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,150
We can use that method
to our advantage too.

89
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,950
The Crown Princess invited me
to discuss the banquet at the palace.

90
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,390
This is a good opportunity.

91
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,440
Lord Qing and the Crown Prince
also invited me to hunt.

92
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,240
I'll pick you up after the hunt ends.

93
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,240
Eating glutinous rice balls together
is quite interesting too.

94
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,070
What a clever idea.

95
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,139
No wonder Mother specifically instructed

96
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,120
to let you make the arrangements
for the palace banquet.

97
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,459
But as her daughter-in-law,

98
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,030
I'm not as thoughtful
and understanding as you.

99
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,830
Since it's a state banquet,

100
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,950
it naturally honors the Empress
and the Crown Princess.

101
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,120
I'm only lending a hand.

102
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,710
These glutinous rice balls
may look novel.

103
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,960
But kneading the dough
and preparing the fillings

104
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,760
rely on the Imperial Kitchen.

105
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,470
It's the Eastern Palace hosting
the banquet after all.

106
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,360
The Empress doesn't like rigid banquets.

107
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,640
These...

108
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,470
How about focusing on elegance?

109
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,700
The Music Office can change
the first piece of performance

110
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,470
to "Song of the Clear River"
or "Hymn to the Emperor."

111
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:50,200
The Imperial Food Service can also prepare
dishes using the best produce

112
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,750
from this year's harvest.

113
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,680
So when His Majesty asks,

114
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,470
it will also please him.

115
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,440
Proceed as the Duchess suggested.

116
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,890
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

117
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,830
My archery skills aren't great.

118
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,680
So I'd appreciate
your guidance, Brother.

119
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,040
If you want to show off,

120
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,290
you should do it in front of Father.

121
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,770
On this hunting ground,

122
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,230
you're picking the wrong person.

123
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,400
That's right.

124
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,800
I can never forget

125
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,320
Yantang's blindfolded archery.

126
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,520
Yantang,

127
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,160
my brother excels in literature

128
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,640
while I, in martial arts.

129
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,520
Do you prefer literature
or martial arts nowadays?

130
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,320
My only preference now

131
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,470
is peace at home.

132
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,590
To be able to spend time with my wife,

133
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,470
watching plays, admiring lanterns,

134
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,230
and living a peaceful life

135
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,040
are enough for me.

136
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,070
Ah, Yantang, you've learned the art
of deflecting questions.

137
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,350
Balancing family peace

138
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,320
and court politics

139
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,350
is possible.

140
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,639
Look at the Crown Prince.

141
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,280
Your alliance for power

142
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,470
isn't my concern.

143
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,990
But it greatly affects you, Brother!

144
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,400
How many supporters
do you still have at court?

145
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,920
And how many are questioning
or impeaching you?

146
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,440
Since you're discussing
royal family matters,

147
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,230
I shouldn't be listening.

148
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,099
I'll take my leave.

149
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,240
Song Mo!

150
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,280
As the Commander of the Imperial Guard,

151
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,950
it's your duty
to protect the royal family.

152
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,560
If anything happens to the Crown Prince

153
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,710
or me today,

154
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,449
you won't escape responsibility.

155
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,590
Youting!

156
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:51,750
You don't even try to hide
your treasonous intentions, do you?

157
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,270
I could kill you

158
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,950
for what you just said.

159
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,409
You always like

160
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,800
to accuse people

161
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,350
without evidence.

162
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,440
But accusations of treason

163
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,270
require proof.

164
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,280
Even if someone did plan a rebellion,

165
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,870
given the current situation,

166
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,830
giving up the position of heir

167
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,750
to a capable person

168
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,350
could save the people and the state

169
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,280
from suffering.

170
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,289
How dare you!

171
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,339
Imperial Guards, listen up!

172
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,289
- Yes!
- Yes!

173
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,800
All soldiers turn your backs!

174
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,350
Anyone who listens or watches

175
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,619
will face military punishment!

176
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,760
- Yes!
- Yes!

177
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,160
His Highness is truly magnanimous.

178
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,950
Lord Song admires him for that.

179
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,619
Only a scholar

180
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,590
could speak so eloquently

181
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,590
about such a stubborn person.

182
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,110
Every wife in the world

183
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:03,230
would obey and agree.

184
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,800
But they all scold their husbands
in their hearts.

185
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,430
Your Highness,

186
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,750
are you pregnant?

187
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,920
How did you know?

188
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,920
This season's shad fish is the freshest.

189
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,710
But you find it too fishy.

190
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:41,230
When pregnant,

191
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,689
a person's sense of smell is heightened

192
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,350
and their food preferences change.

193
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,950
I am like that too.

194
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,950
The imperial physician
diagnosed me earlier.

195
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,750
He said I have a weak body,

196
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,520
making it hard to conceive.

197
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,710
That's why I didn't announce
my pregnancy.

198
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,230
I still feel very nauseated.

199
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,070
Eunuch Wang,

200
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,320
please bring me a magnolia branch.

201
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,520
Yes, Your Highness.

202
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,859
Pick that one for me.

203
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,000
Yes, sir. Watch out!

204
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,590
Watch out!

205
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,430
(It's him.)

206
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,330
(If the Crown Princess gives birth
to a prince next year,)

207
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,990
(the Crown Prince's position
will be secure.)

208
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,160
(Lord Qing will surely rebel.)

209
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,020
Your Highness.

210
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,580
The Crown Princess is very weak.

211
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,479
Take her to the palace hall.

212
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,980
Quickly, fetch the imperial physician.

213
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,260
Your Grace, be cautious.

214
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,889
The Crown Princess
is pregnant after all.

215
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,280
Shouldn't we wait for the physician

216
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,879
- before making a diagnosis?
- It'll be too late.

217
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,250
I must administer acupuncture now.

218
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,560
Please reconsider, Your Grace.

219
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,620
Are you defying orders?

220
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,340
I dare not.

221
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,399
You've got plenty of soldiers.

222
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,839
But I came alone.

223
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,239
If something really happens today,

224
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,340
what will the court officials think
when they find out?

225
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,740
Your Highnesses,

226
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,079
these are different times.

227
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,639
You can't fight like you did
when you were kids.

228
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,759
Every punch now

229
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,540
affects the state.

230
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,780
Please reconsider your actions.

231
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,959
Song Mo!

232
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,060
You always helped me in fights before.

233
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,580
Who will you help now?

234
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,740
Crown Prince.

235
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,980
See that, Crown Prince?

236
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,239
Yantang is always on my side.

237
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,380
Lord Qing.

238
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,399
- Song Mo!
- Song Mo!

239
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,990
- Are you out of your mind?
- Are you out of your mind?

240
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,399
Haven't I treated you
and your son well enough?

241
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,580
I allowed you to participate
in political discussions.

242
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,759
Youting has vast lands

243
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,460
and high income,
much more than Yousheng.

244
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,020
Can't you be content?

245
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,220
What more do you want?

246
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,300
If Father truly despises us,

247
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,460
you could order our deaths.

248
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,660
But don't wrong my heart.

249
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,860
After three years apart,

250
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,780
I never thought
what I longed for day and night

251
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,900
would turn out like this.

252
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,700
Your Majesty,

253
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,940
I am ashamed of myself.

254
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,100
I will resign from my position
in the central palace.

255
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,820
Please strip Youting of his title
and make him a commoner.

256
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,940
My son and I only wish for peace.

257
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:29,660
Your Majesty, please calm down
for your health's sake.

258
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,090
Official Lu has arrived!

259
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,919
How's the Crown Prince?

260
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,059
Your Majesty,

261
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,540
I've been to the Eastern Palace.

262
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,750
The Crown Prince isn't badly injured

263
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,060
and is not in danger.

264
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,510
For goodness sake, Song Mo.

265
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,820
I can't believe you helped
that jerk to hit me!

266
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,610
I will remember this.

267
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,140
If Yantang hadn't interfered,

268
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,219
you would have lost

269
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,080
a limb or two.

270
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,250
You're welcome.

271
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,749
See that?

272
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,180
He's even proud of himself.

273
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,980
Do you have no respect left
for your monarch?

274
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,090
How insolent!

275
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,220
If Dou Zhao hadn't been here

276
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,300
to perform acupuncture
and medication in time,

277
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,880
your son

278
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,700
would not have survived.

279
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,820
Your Highness,
you give me too much credit.

280
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,940
It's just my duty.

281
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,940
Thank you, Duchess.

282
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,820
I know Your Highness

283
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,020
despises underhanded schemes.

284
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,500
But if a nobleman dies
because of such schemes,

285
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,340
what's the point of being noble?

286
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,500
Lord Qing is back in the capital,

287
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,460
aiming to eliminate

288
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,900
Your Highness and Yantang.

289
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,679
Since you know

290
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,460
the truth about Duke of Ding's death,

291
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,020
revealing it

292
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,620
and exposing Lord Qing's allies

293
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,300
could be your safeguard.

294
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,970
I swore before Father

295
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,580
never

296
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,520
to speak of it.

297
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,720
Well,

298
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,020
you swore, but I didn't.

299
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,660
If you don't tell,

300
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,300
I will.

301
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,519
Don't you dare!

302
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,060
- If you tell, I'll...
- Divorce me?

303
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,860
Sure, go ahead.

304
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,820
I'll take my child and remarry.

305
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,660
I won't let us die with you.

306
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,700
He won't speak

307
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,780
because it involves royal secrets.

308
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,700
Even a word would cause chaos
in the state.

309
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,460
The Emperor never intended
to kill the Duke of Ding.

310
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,740
He ordered the Shadow Guard to escort
the Duke of Ding to the capital

311
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,700
because the emperor

312
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,180
was gravely ill

313
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,540
and feared his death was near.

314
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,820
At that time,

315
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,260
Father was very sick.

316
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,470
The Duke of Ding pacified the pirates
and opened up sea trade,

317
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,140
which benefited the state.

318
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,680
Although he provided disaster relief
and defied imperial orders,

319
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,300
they were a timely help to the people.

320
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,820
Why did you suspect him

321
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,180
and have him escorted back here?

322
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,759
Jiang Meisun is the only person
in this world

323
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,239
whom I can completely trust.

324
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,100
Why would I suspect him?

325
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,420
Then why...

326
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,660
He obeys and trusts me.

327
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,620
But will he obey and trust you
in the future?

328
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,460
You

329
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,780
don't know how to manage ministers.

330
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,079
Pleading for him in private

331
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,620
does no good.

332
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,380
Wait until I reprimand him,

333
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,540
imprison him, and strip his title.

334
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,940
Then you can plead
for his innocence in court.

335
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,820
That way, he will be indebted to you

336
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,340
and be loyal to you.

337
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,140
Duke of Ding is loyal and just.

338
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,820
I don't want to humiliate and subdue him
with power tactics.

339
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,180
I can visit him sincerely

340
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,780
and win his trust.

341
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,700
A father knows his son best.

342
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,140
You have a kind heart

343
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,980
and will be a benevolent ruler.

344
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,140
But kindness alone

345
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,740
won't secure the state.

346
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,740
Come closer.

347
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,460
My illness fluctuates.

348
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,820
If something happens,

349
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,660
Lizhen in the North

350
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,380
and the pirates in the South
will invade again.

351
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,940
The feudal princes will be restless.

352
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,540
I would rather Meisun hate me,

353
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,540
but you must hold onto
this valuable ally.

354
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,479
After my demise...

355
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,519
Father.

356
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,900
After you ascend the throne,

357
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,679
release him from prison

358
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,460
and restore his power.

359
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,300
Only then

360
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,940
will the country remain stable.

361
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,700
Do you understand,

362
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,060
my son?

363
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,820
If Duke of Ding had reached the capital,

364
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,020
everything would have been fine.

365
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,620
But someone took advantage
of the situation.

366
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,180
Your Highness.

367
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,340
Come in.

368
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,500
Eunuch Wang is here.

369
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,439
Eunuch Wang is closer to Father

370
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,299
and knows more about the circumstances

371
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,140
of Duke of Ding's death.

372
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,220
Eunuch Wang.

373
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,460
Since His Majesty already knew

374
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,980
why was he still convicted?

375
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,400
Because Her Majesty
persuaded His Majesty

376
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,919
that it was too late to change things.

377
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,500
If Duke of Ding was declared innocent,

378
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,380
the public would see it

379
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,100
as the emperor unjustly killing
a loyal subject,

380
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,780
damaging the royal family's reputation.

381
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,820
An emperor

382
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,900
can never be seen making a mistake.

383
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,740
My uncle sacrificed

384
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,959
his life for the emperor.

385
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,380
Yet his loyalty

386
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,220
was less important than saving face.

387
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,340
His Majesty couldn't bear it.

388
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,000
So he gave a lenient sentence,

389
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,319
allowing Duke of Ding's body
to be collected and buried,

390
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,900
and lightly punished the Jiang family.

391
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,540
Thank you, Eunuch Wang.

392
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,580
Given the current situation,

393
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,940
if you two don't work together

394
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,020
to save the state,

395
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,919
the peace and prosperity

396
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,900
that the emperor and Duke of Ding
worked hard to build

397
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,060
will be destroyed.

398
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,860
I've always suspected one thing.

399
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,380
If Lord Qing intends to rebel,

400
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,660
but he's far away in Liaodong.

401
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,239
Even with inside help,

402
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,159
communication would take too long.

403
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,239
How could he react
to changing situations

404
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,580
and give his order without delay?

405
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,660
If I'm not mistaken,

406
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,919
the true mastermind

407
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,020
behind this rebellion isn't Lord Qing

408
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,460
but Her Majesty Wan.

409
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,170
Am I right?

410
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,980
Her Majesty Wan?

411
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,319
The people of Futing

412
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,519
go to Duke of Ding's shrine

413
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,060
and hail him as a hero.

414
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,279
He used his own salary

415
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,900
to give bonuses to the army,

416
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,980
effectively making them
his private army.

417
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,950
When you sent the Crown Prince
to provide disaster relief,

418
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,260
he defied orders and did it himself.

419
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,239
Now, in the people's eyes,

420
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,900
the court is to blame,
and he is credited.

421
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,140
You might as well make him
a feudal prince

422
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,700
and give Futing to him as his fief.

423
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,420
It would've saved a lot of trouble.

424
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,279
(Xuanyue Palace)

425
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,110
You were supposed
to keep an eye on things

426
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,750
and not let the Crown Princess
and Duchess of Ying get too close.

427
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,159
How could you let this happen?

428
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,279
Calm down, Your Majesty.

429
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,620
I failed you.

430
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,759
Please punish me.

431
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,380
Useless thing.

432
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,479
Get out.

433
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

434
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,160
Father's illness relapsed
many times over the years.

435
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,260
Each time it relapses,

436
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,559
it's been you working tirelessly,
handling state affairs,

437
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,860
and reviewing memorials.

438
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,140
That's how you develop night blindness.

439
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,540
The imperial physician
repeatedly warned you not to cry.

440
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,060
I was impulsive in the incident

441
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:09,420
with the Crown Prince today.

442
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,910
I've let you down.

443
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,260
Youting,

444
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,620
I know you've endured humiliation
for years

445
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,700
just to return to my side.

446
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,940
How is this letting me down?

447
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,860
Come.

448
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,380
Get up.

449
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,180
My genuine tears

450
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,140
have long since dried up.

451
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,300
Your father has been a heavy burden

452
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,900
on us for decades.

453
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,679
It's not easy

454
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,740
to replace him.

455
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,300
In times of great importance,

456
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,079
one must remain calm.

457
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,129
But I can't stand

458
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,740
seeing you kneel before him.

459
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,580
With your wisdom and sacrifices

460
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,119
for the country and the royal family

461
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,460
over the years,

462
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,380
it's he who should be kneeling to you.

463
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,740
If this fragile pretense
is about to crumble,

464
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,580
there's no need to keep up this charade.

465
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,180
It's time to act.

466
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,860
The time for the reckoning
I've set for him

467
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,140
is approaching.

468
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,540
I truly want to see

469
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,900
the day the nation falls

470
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,020
and family turns against each other.

471
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,340
Will that selfish, hypocritical man

472
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,340
still have tears left

473
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,540
to shed?

474
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,300
She's meddling in state affairs
to the extent

475
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,439
and even poisoning Father.

476
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,279
Why are you only telling me now?

477
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,900
Because His Majesty
has always been frail.

478
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,300
For these past few decades,

479
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,020
he can no longer do
without the elixirs of the sorcerers.

480
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,500
Her Majesty Wan knows
such a method well.

481
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,140
The elixirs provided
had immediate effects

482
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,180
but drained his vitality.

483
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,420
The doses were so small

484
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,580
that even Official Lu noticed it late.

485
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,460
A mix of poison and medicine
taken over the years.

486
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,460
If we stop giving it without a solution,

487
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,020
I'm afraid...

488
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,300
No wonder His Majesty knew the truth

489
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,060
but had to cover it up.

490
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,220
Your father's life,

491
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,740
the nation, and the throne,

492
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,140
will you save them or not?

493
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,060
If you want to seize power

494
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,639
and trample
on the royal family's dignity,

495
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,980
I will never support you.

496
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,260
The ruler is above his subjects,
the father above the son.

497
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,140
Do you think

498
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,100
royal prestige

499
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,220
is more important
than the injustice suffered

500
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,460
by one person, one family, and an army?

501
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,479
Justice, law, honor,

502
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,519
and morality.

503
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,919
Are these just false idols used

504
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,060
by the royal family
to control the people?

505
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,900
If so,

506
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,039
Song Mo and I have no reason

507
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,479
to serve a foolish and selfish ruler.

508
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,319
Dou Zhao,

509
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,439
how dare you!

510
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,319
Well said!

511
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,080
- I scolded her well, didn't I?
- Dou Zhao,

512
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,420
I'm willing to pay you

513
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,420
to come here and scold him every day.

514
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,140
You...

515
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,340
There's one more thing.

516
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,020
It involves
the Duke of Ying's household.

517
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,999
I once overheard

518
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,340
Lord Qing and Her Majesty Wan talking

519
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,359
in her palace

520
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,639
about a letter from Duke of Ding hidden
at the Duke of Ying's Residence,

521
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,340
that has yet to be found.

522
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,940
I know about that.

523
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,580
His Highness came
to my house looking for that letter.

524
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,639
What is it about?

525
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,980
What's written in the letter?

526
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,140
I don't know the content of the letter.

527
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,300
But I do know the letter is important.

528
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,500
The messenger I captured confessed

529
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,180
that a servant had received the letter.

530
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,639
Despite searching it secretly
several times,

531
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,919
I haven't found it.

532
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,580
And Lord Qing is coveting
this letter too.

533
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,079
So no matter what,

534
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,380
we cannot let Lord Qing
have this letter.

535
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,580
I've already said

536
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,620
what I can.

537
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,919
Whatever both of you decide

538
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,100
will be fate.

539
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,980
I shall take my leave now.

540
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,820
Many thanks, Eunuch Wang.

541
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,270
You've studied the teachings
of Confucius and Mencius.

542
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,119
If idols fall,

543
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,260
rituals collapse,

544
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,079
and everyone rebels

545
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,340
like Chen Sheng and Wu Guang,

546
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,500
can the world still be at peace?

547
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,000
The teachings you speak of

548
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,279
is to have virtuous rulers
like Emperor Yao and Emperor Shun,

549
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,020
and then refine the customs
of the people.

550
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,279
But in reality,
the royal family condones

551
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,100
the nobles taking farmland,
enslaving people,

552
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,150
and leaving
the common folk struggling to survive.

553
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,620
Should we silence them

554
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,580
to make them cheer for us?

555
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,740
The tragedies of the Dou Family,
Song Family, and the royal family

556
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,460
stem from the same source.

557
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,559
The ruler and father are supreme,

558
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,839
while wives, concubines,
and children are lowly.

559
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,719
These lowly ones fight
amongst themselves for dominance.

560
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,239
If we judge everything

561
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,140
based on rank rather
than right and wrong,

562
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,220
schemes and plots will never end.

563
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,740
Rituals and laws are meant
to stabilize hearts.

564
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,100
But if they instead cause chaos,

565
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,180
the state will inevitably fall to ruin.

566
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,500
The people are the foundation
of the state.

567
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,340
If you become a good ruler,

568
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,140
I will help you pacify the country
and eradicate evil.

569
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,820
But under one condition.

570
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,620
It's not blood for blood,

571
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,439
or seizing power.

572
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,300
But for the emperor

573
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,060
to publicly reveal the truth,

574
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,340
restore the loyal's honor,

575
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,500
and console the aggrieved.

576
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,300
If you agree,

577
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,780
then we are allies.

578
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,540
If you don't,

579
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,260
I don't mind having one more enemy.

580
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,140
Song Mo,

581
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,940
are you negotiating terms with me?

582
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,569
It would be a pity

583
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,740
to be just allies.

584
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,860
The Crown Prince and I like
Dou Zhao's character.

585
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,540
What if we arrange a marriage
for our unborn children

586
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,740
and become in-laws too?

587
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,599
- Who wants to be in-laws with him?
- Who wants to be in-laws with him?

588
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,639
He might become

589
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,079
a traitor one day.

590
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,480
Then you must have turned
into a stubborn and foolish ruler.

591
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,940
You have a heroic spirit.

592
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,519
How did you end up

593
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,119
with such an arrogant fool?

594
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,500
Crown Princess,
please keep your husband in check.

595
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,319
He's sharp-tongued, rigid, and arrogant.

596
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,460
Everyone from all walks of life
finds him difficult

597
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,940
to get along with.

598
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,620
Dou Zhao,
keep your husband in check too.

599
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,039
If he continues to be reckless,

600
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,620
you'll end up dead on the streets!

601
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,359
You need

602
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,439
to reflect on yourself.

603
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,719
You've become too self-important

604
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,740
and now you've learned to insult others.

605
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,260
You're right.

606
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:38,080
I need to reflect on

607
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,140
how I ended up

608
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,660
with a shrew

609
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,100
who sides with others.

610
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,110
A shrew, huh?

611
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,519
- Come, I'll show you.
- Please...

612
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,990
- Tell me who's the shrew.
- I'm sorry.

613
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,500
Sorry, huh?

614
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,300
Why are you still frowning?

615
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,599
Our alliance with the Crown Prince

616
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,239
and distancing from Lord Qing
is ultimately a good thing.

617
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,460
We should be happy about it.

618
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,180
What's bothering you?

619
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,220
I think

620
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,180
the Crown Prince seems to admire you.

621
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,719
Haven't you two only met a few times?

622
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,740
Are you seeing things?

623
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,340
It's the Crown Princess who admires me.

624
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,759
Next time you see him,

625
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,039
don't dress up so nicely.

626
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,560
No need for hairpins or fancy clothes.

627
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,260
Just wear something black.

628
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,420
That won't work either.

629
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,060
You also look beautiful in black
without makeup.

630
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,700
When the Crown Prince
was selecting a consort,

631
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,239
he favored intelligence, resilience,
and extensive knowledge.

632
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,380
Isn't that describing you?

633
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,180
Though everything you say
is unreasonable,

634
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,140
I love hearing every word.

635
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,220
Stop the carriage.

636
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,540
We're not home yet.

637
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,700
Your shoe seems dirty.

638
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,180
No, it's not.

639
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,879
What are you doing?

640
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,140
I understand what I must do now.

641
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,679
This poison needs to be treated.

642
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,169
I want to live long

643
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:38,059
and take good care of my appearance.

644
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,519
So the Crown Prince feels inferior

645
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,839
when he sees me.

646
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,959
Put me down.

647
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,380
So many people are watching.

648
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,879
I want the whole capital to know

649
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,999
that you, Dou Zhao,
are the Duchess of Ying.

650
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,380
This is embarrassing.

651
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,990
It's not the first time
I've carried you like this.

652
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,780
(Natural Grace and Talent)

653
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,380
I didn't even look at him.

654
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,060
Would that hurt Yousheng?

655
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,380
You're considering the big picture,
Your Majesty.

656
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,599
The Crown Prince will surely understand
your intention.

657
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,540
The Crown Prince and Lord Qing
are of noble status.

658
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,300
They were injured in their fight.

659
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,090
(Palace of Heavenly Majesty)
If this issue is brought to light,

660
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,759
the first to be blamed will be Yantang

661
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,940
who was responsible for their safety.

662
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,900
If he was dismissed,

663
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,060
the court's balance
would be hard to maintain.

664
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,460
Your Majesty,

665
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,900
the medicine is getting cold.

666
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,020
Aren't you performing divination?

667
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,220
No.

668
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,100
I already have

669
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,700
my answer.

670
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:22,860
(Funeral)

671
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,310
Today is the seventh day
since Anping's passing.

672
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,500
The wives of the officials treat you
as they always have.

673
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,820
At the memorial feast,

674
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,300
they show you nothing but respect.

675
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,260
It's clear that everyone knows

676
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,820
Dong Qi truly deserved his death.

677
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,020
I'd rather have stayed in Futing

678
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,500
as a lowly merchant woman
for my entire life

679
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,580
than be wealthy

680
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,500
and lose my brother

681
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,079
like this.

682
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,519
(Tomb of Miao Anping)

683
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,900
Anping was arrogant.

684
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,900
But he wasn't reckless.

685
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,580
Without striving for a higher position,

686
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,580
we can only watch
our loved ones be bullied.

687
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,860
I was the same in the past.

688
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,500
Now,

689
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,780
as the Commander
of the Tengxiang Guards,

690
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,820
I hold real power

691
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,460
equal to Song Mo.

692
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,700
From now on,

693
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,900
we no longer need to bow to anyone.

694
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,220
The Tengxiang Guards

695
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,460
is lesser-known
among the twenty-six guards unit.

696
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,180
The most crucial aspect of it

697
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:38,599
is that it controls most

698
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,860
of the grain and warhorse supplies
for the capital.

699
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,100
It may seem like one unimportant unit

700
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,900
that no one is interested in.

701
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,460
But in times of war,

702
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,620
cavalry that can charge

703
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,279
and dominate on the plains

704
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,980
will be the key to victory,

705
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,740
whether on the frontier or elsewhere.

706
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,079
Even if the Imperial Guards
and Shenji Camp have firearms,

707
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,660
they're useless

708
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,900
without horses.

709
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,340
The capital is peaceful now.

710
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,980
But you made it seem it's at war.

711
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,340
But peace today

712
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,300
doesn't guarantee peace tomorrow.

713
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,820
Song Mo faced bandits

714
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,140
as his opportunity.

715
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,300
I'll have mine too.

716
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,820
I only want to protect you
and your parents

717
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,660
when the time comes.

718
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,050
Muyu,

719
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:37,900
thank you for taking care
of my parents recently.

720
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,150
Climbing the official ladder
often requires favors.

721
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,860
If you need anything, just let me know.

722
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,399
(Tomb of Miao Anping)

723
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,540
One day,

724
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,079
I will repay you a thousandfold.

725
00:38:55,080 --> 00:39:01,359
(Tomb of Miao Anping)

726
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,660
(Duke of Ying's Residence)

727
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,580
Watch your steps.

728
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,900
Does this place look familiar to you?

729
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,820
Your Grace, Madam.
Have some tea.

730
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,860
Have a seat first.

731
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,940
Try to recall.

732
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,660
What were you looking for?

733
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,740
Medicine.

734
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,740
Someone.

735
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,559
Medicine.

736
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,380
Duchess of Ying was ill.

737
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,860
She was gravely ill. Am I right?

738
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,980
She was ill. She took medicine.

739
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,580
A fan.

740
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,060
Fan the stove.

741
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,900
Nine types of herbal medicines.

742
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,740
For six hours.

743
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,500
Fan the stove.

744
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,079
Nine types of herbal medicines.

745
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,540
Was there also a letter?

746
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,940
Letter?

747
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,380
Letter...

748
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,719
Who gave it to whom?

749
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,210
What does it say? Where is the letter?

750
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,020
Letter...

751
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,700
Give the letter to me now.

752
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,340
Letter.

753
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,940
Give the letter to me.

754
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,500
Give it to me.

755
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,860
Here you go.

756
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,820
Madam! Madam!

757
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,540
Duke of Ding sent a letter!

758
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,860
Duke of Ding sent a letter!

759
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,220
Follow her.

760
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,580
Madam!

761
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,260
Madam, Duke of Ding has sent a letter.

762
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,099
My brother is playing his riddles again.

763
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:47,999
Go,

764
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,140
fetch a pen.

765
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,599
Bring some tea.

766
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,780
Yes, Madam.

767
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,300
Madam!

768
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,820
Why are you coughing blood?

769
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,919
Qi Xia,

770
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,759
quickly.

771
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,959
Dry the painting and hide it.

772
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,399
Tell no one about this.

773
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,050
Don't give it to anyone.

774
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,119
You can only tell Song Mo.

775
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,620
Only Song Mo can know.

776
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,799
- Yes, Madam.
- Go now.

777
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,940
Yes, Madam!

778
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,719
Hide it. I must hide it.

779
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,319
Madam, where should I hide it?

780
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,660
Where should I hide it?

781
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,620
Hide it. I must hide it.

782
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,200
Madam! Madam!

783
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,119
Where should I hide it?

784
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,210
Where could be the perfect spot?

785
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,260
Qi Xia!

786
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,660
Qi Xia!

787
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,980
Yes, Madam.

788
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,479
No place is safe to hide it.

789
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,100
Yes, it will be discovered.

790
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,780
Go.

791
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,460
Help me hang it up.

792
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,180
The more visible, the better.

793
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,180
Let's go.

794
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,479
When the throne changes hands,

795
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,759
you and your husband

796
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,839
won't have a way out.

797
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,279
If I can't be Lord Qing's sharp blade,

798
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,679
I'll be the thorn he must pull out.

799
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,379
Song Mo has gone mad.

800
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,919
He set off explosives in the street,

801
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:32,959
endangering the people.

802
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,260
