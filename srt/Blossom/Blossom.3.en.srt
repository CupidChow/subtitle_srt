00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,860
(Three years later,
Spring, Year 24 of Chengping)

2
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,190
Pirates! Pirates!

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,190
Sir, I beg you, sir.

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,830
If you rob us, we're done for.

5
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,510
Song Mo!

6
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:34,840
It's a trap.

7
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,630
Speak.

8
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,480
Where is your base camp?

9
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:37,990
Song Mo,

10
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,560
you think you'll find the base

11
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,000
since you've caught me?

12
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:43,430
We, people of Dongyu,
will never surrender!

13
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,150
Is it...

14
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,960
in Nanshan?

15
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,710
Tongzhou?

16
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,400
Jilang, Zhanshui, Coral Island?

17
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,310
Meizhou, Feiyudao,

18
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,350
or is it Boat Island?

19
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,200
It's Boat Island.

20
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,360
Song Mo.

21
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:12,590
You crook.

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,030
You won't get what you're after!

23
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,280
That was brilliant, sir.

24
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,520
We almost starved to death

25
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,910
because of that dirty
grains transport officer.

26
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,430
- Thankfully, you baited them.
- That's enough.

27
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,400
- Lu Ming.
- You lured the pirates here...

28
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
- Stop talking.
- And we finally get to eat.

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,240
That's enough. On your knees.

30
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,840
Sir, my brother is new.

31
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,150
He didn't know

32
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,710
that the officer is your father,
Duke of Ying.

33
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,550
We beg for your forgiveness.

34
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,960
I understand the anger
after starving for so long.

35
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,030
I would be too.

36
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,430
It's nothing.

37
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,920
Just go ahead.

38
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,400
Fortunately, it didn't ruin your plan.

39
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,470
We got rid of five pirate ships.

40
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,800
That's a job well done.

41
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,870
Just five boats is nothing.

42
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
Listen up, Ding Army!

43
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,310
Here!

44
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,470
Everyone, dig in.

45
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,800
In 10 minutes,

46
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,710
we will put on the pirates' clothing
and head for Boat Island.

47
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,910
To safeguard Futing's peace,

48
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,400
we will carve our names in history.

49
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,990
Safeguard the country!
Carve our names in history!

50
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,680
Safeguard the country!
Carve our names in history!

51
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,800

"Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

53

54
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,420
(Futing)

55
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,070
Come, quick!

56
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,190
The Ding Army will be victorious!

57
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,160
It's the Ding Army!

58
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,820
The Ding Army has returned!

59
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,510
- Come look!
- The Ding Army has returned!

60
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,270
The Ding Army is back.

61
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,750
The Ding Army is back!

62
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,240
Did you win the battle?

63
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,080
Yes, we did.

64
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,960
We conquered Boat Island.

65
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
With peace restored on the seas,

66
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,000
your goods will be worth much more now.

67
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,000
That's great news!

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,600
This is so grand.

69
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,310
Get used to it.

70
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,230
This is nothing.

71
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,920
There will be grander receptions
in the future.

72
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,160
The Ding Army is great!

73
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,630
- Ding Army!
- The Ding Army is great!

74
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,800
Thank goodness for the Ding Army.

75
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,400
Lu Zheng,

76
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,230
notify the army division

77
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,870
to escort the captive women
and children back to Dongyu.

78
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,720
If the army dares abuse the children

79
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,920
The Ding Army is great!

80
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,800
or violate the women,

81
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,000
they will be punished by military law.

82
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,960
Yes, sir.

83
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,270
Congratulations, Marshal.

84
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,830
The news of your conquest of Boat Island

85
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,920
has reached the military base.

86
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
Duke of Ying has come too.

87
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,440
Father is here?

88
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,400
Jiang Meisun!

89
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,430
The delay in delivering grains

90
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,950
(Song Yichun, Duke of Ying)
was due to attacks from pirates.

91
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,600
What is wrong about eliminating evils
for the people?

92
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,150
Let me go!

93
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,120
- Let me go!
- Sir.

94
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,950
He is after all Duke of Ying,

95
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,630
your brother-in-law.

96
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,950
Listen up.

97
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,510
Song Yichun failed
to carry out his duties.

98
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,040
On top of that,
he's making wild statements.

99
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,040
According to military law,

100
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,430
he is sentenced to 30 whips.

101
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,030
Execute the punishment.

102
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,960
Yes, sir.

103
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:26,830
You dare do it?

104
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,870
I am a high-ranking decorated duke.

105
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,070
Without the royal decree,
don't anyone dare touch me!

106
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,710
Marshal!

107
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,710
Son!

108
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,760
Sir,

109
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,190
fortunately,
I have fulfilled my mission.

110
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,230
On your feet.

111
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,200
We were running of our food.

112
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,720
Because you used yourself as bait,

113
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,040
we were able to subdue
Dongyu's military power.

114
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,630
Good work! You must be rewarded.

115
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,760
Sir,

116
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,190
the deputy marshal not only
destroyed ten pirate ships,

117
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,360
he also made use of them
to take down Boat Island.

118
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,600
The pirates' last island
has also been eliminated.

119
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,430
The decade-long efforts in border
control and pacifying the seas

120
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,600
have finally succeeded.

121
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,190
Awesome!

122
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,440
Young man.

123
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,390
Your supplies were limited,

124
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,950
and so was your manpower.

125
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,310
Were you trying to get yourself killed?

126
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,270
It's because of the delay
in food delivery,

127
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,630
that's why my son had to risk his life
to save everyone!

128
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,230
Son,

129
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,870
talk some sense into your uncle.

130
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,920
I refuse to waste time arguing with him.

131
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,760
Incredulous!

132
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,000
The army is governed by law.

133
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,120
There is no place for familial bonds.

134
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,070
Failure to prioritize, greedy for merit
for suppressing bandits,

135
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,560
you delayed the operation for ten days!

136
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,240
If Song Mo hadn't stepped up
at the critical moment,

137
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,270
this battle would've been lost.

138
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,600
How dare you say that!

139
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,510
Bring me the whip!

140
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,920
I will execute punishment myself!

141
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,870
- I dare you!
- Watch me!

142
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,710
Sir.

143
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,870
Duke of Ying is guilty
of dereliction of duty.

144
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,000
But to watch on

145
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,310
as my elderly father gets punished

146
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,070
is also a failure on my part.

147
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,000
Thirty whips

148
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,000
is like a death sentence to him.

149
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,630
I did no wrong!

150
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,160
Please, sir.

151
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,510
Considering our victory on Boat Island,

152
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,480
allow me to receive
the punishment in my father's place.

153
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,310
It is not against the law,

154
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,950
and is a show of my loyalty.

155
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,510
Please have mercy, Marshal!

156
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,480
Please have mercy, Marshal!

157
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,310
Please have mercy, Marshal!

158
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,750
A show of loyalty, huh?

159
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,840
Well then...

160
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,600
you get your wish.

161
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,870
I'll increase it by 10 whips.

162
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,800
Will you take it?

163
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,710
Yes.

164
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,350
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,350
Go!

166
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,270
How did a failure
produce such a distinguished son?

167
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,750
Unbelievable!

168
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,270
Hang in there.

169
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,600
Young man.

170
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,000
How did you ever think
to attack Boat Island

171
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,000
with only a handful of men?

172
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,080
You put yourself in danger,

173
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,600
how reckless.

174
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,390
The Art of War states,

175
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,600
throw them into a desperate
situation and they will survive.

176
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,270
Place them in a position of certain
death and they will then live.

177
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,270
An army that fights with grief
and despair is destined to win.

178
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,360
You taught me this.

179
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,790
Don't you talk about
military strategy with me, boy.

180
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,000
I wasn't there,

181
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,320
but I know very well
what you were thinking.

182
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
You attacked Boat Island

183
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,750
because you wanted to make up
for your father's sins.

184
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,200
Now you've seen for yourself.

185
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,510
Was it worth it?

186
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,120
You actually went ahead and beat him?

187
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,160
I told him to.

188
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,840
The military is not child's play.

189
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,480
It was only 40 whips.

190
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,030
I meant it when I said

191
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,720
I'd bear it for my father.

192
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,560
Leave us.

193
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,720
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

194
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,590
Uncle.

195
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,510
Worth it or not, he is still my father.

196
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,120
My mother and Han

197
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,080
are waiting for him at home.

198
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,440
It's all my fault.

199
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,910
Back then,

200
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,150
I should never have agreed
to let him marry Huisun.

201
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,630
That's not right.

202
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,720
I wouldn't be here if Father and Mother
hadn't gotten married.

203
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,560
Without me,

204
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,200
who would protect the seas
alongside you?

205
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,670
You would've been so bored.

206
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,390
Right now,

207
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,510
I feel like I just had
a cupping session,

208
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:16,600
I'm rejuvenated.

209
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,670
Is this rejuvenating?

210
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,710
Is it?

211
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,120
Duke of Ying has left.

212
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,500
(Abundance)

213
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,180
(Abundance)

214
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,150
Light a lantern and incense,

215
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,240
(Zhao Zhangru)
I pray for God's blessings.

216
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,150
May the warehouses
be filled with good harvest.

217
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,720
May Ms. Longevity and Ansu

218
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,440
make bucket loads of money.

219
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,750
A farmer's livelihood is dependent
on the weather.

220
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,870
Rain or shine, nobody knows for sure.

221
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:24,973
(Fair weather cometh)
That's why

222
00:12:24,974 --> 00:12:26,030
(Fair weather cometh)
we have to pray for good weather.

223
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,150
Doing business
is all about our own effort.

224
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,240
Rather than praying to the gods,

225
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,150
isn't it better to reward me instead?

226
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,440
Watch what you say.

227
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,670
Sailing the seas relies
on heavenly will.

228
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,150
Dear God,

229
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,270
please don't mind Ms. Longevity.

230
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,510
If you have the time,

231
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,630
please do watch over us.

232
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,030
Bless us with more wealth and fortune.

233
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,150
My guess is that the pirates
will be eliminated by the year end.

234
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,030
The maritime trade will experience
a great boon in spring and summer.

235
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,030
I will get you your wealth and fortune.

236
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,790
You are like the all-knowing
female Zhuge.

237
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,390
But did you see this coming?

238
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,240
Zhangru!

239
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,920
Okay.

240
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,840
I have another intuition.

241
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,270
You won't be getting
a matrilocal husband this year either.

242
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,120
How dare you say that?

243
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,110
Zhangru!

244
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,440
Good news!

245
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,200
I've got great news!

246
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,480
- Su.
- Su.

247
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,600
What are you two doing?

248
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,600
What are you doing?

249
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,910
- Stop it!
- Come here.

250
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,280
Stop it!

251
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,710
Oh no.

252
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,960
What's that?

253
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,230
Money.

254
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,670
I didn't guess they'd be silver notes,

255
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,510
worth 1000 taels each.

256
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,030
And there's a thick stack.

257
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,030
I doubt you'd find anyone

258
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,440
with this many notes
in the whole of Northern Zhili.

259
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,600
The tea leaves, silk and ceramics
that we stockpiled last year

260
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,750
all increased in prices.

261
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,480
It's all thanks to Zhao's tip.

262
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,320
My father said,

263
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,910
the orders from merchant ships
increased by tenfold this month.

264
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,720
The earnings will only get bigger.

265
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,200
Ansu,

266
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,360
go back and tell Mr. and Mrs. Miao

267
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,240
to sell the merchant ships

268
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,550
after the current goods are cleared.

269
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,120
We'll look for another
business opportunity.

270
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,840
Are you serious, Ms. Longevity?

271
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,510
Yeah,

272
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,000
we've managed to get a head start
in Futing.

273
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,270
We're the top sea merchant.

274
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,720
Very soon,

275
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,720
all the waterways will be connected.

276
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,600
Wouldn't we make even more money then?

277
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,630
We're in the 24th year of Chengping.

278
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,080
The Ding Army's mission to pacify
the seas is coming to fruition.

279
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,750
With the pirates eliminated,

280
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,600
maritime trade will
be extremely profitable

281
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,550
without any obstacles.

282
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,270
From the local Futing magistrate
to the Ministry of Revenue,

283
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,550
they will surely implement levies.

284
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,270
I reckon this business won't be as easy.

285
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,840
Even if the local officials want a cut,

286
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,000
it's not to the extent
of giving it up entirely, right?

287
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,080
Isn't it too soon to back out?

288
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,320
Or is it because you heard something

289
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,360
from Mr. Chen?

290
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,270
No.

291
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,910
Buy when prices are low,

292
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,150
even if they later rise,
you bought at a low price.

293
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,240
Sell when prices are high, even if they
later drop, you sold at a high price.

294
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,600
Everyone knows this business
is a windfall.

295
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,870
So there's no profit to be made.

296
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,470
Just trust me.

297
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,110
I don't get it,

298
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,080
but I know one thing.

299
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,440
If you become
the richest person in Zhending,

300
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,480
your stepmother

301
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,630
and that wannabe relative,
Marquis of Jining,

302
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,120
would surely be desirous.

303
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,560
Fourth Young Lady.

304
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,630
Nanny Zhou from the capital is here.

305
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,470
See?

306
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,510
Speak of the devil.

307
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,150
Here comes trouble.

308
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,510
I said no to your family's
new year party long ago.

309
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,630
Now, you've come asking again.

310
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,270
I have relatives
from afar visiting today.

311
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,480
So I've no time
to be the gracious elder.

312
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,270
Old Madam, you sure know how to jest.

313
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,510
It's rare for Fifth Master
and Seventh Master to be present.

314
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,510
It will be a grand family reunion.

315
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,270
Isn't it nice for everyone to gather?

316
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,510
I'll be frank.

317
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,720
Seventh Master fell ill a few days ago.

318
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,030
He misses his daughter.

319
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,750
You're using Father as an excuse?

320
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,270
So I'd be the bad daughter
if I didn't go.

321
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,240
Don't say that, Miss.

322
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,270
Madam prepared a full spread of dishes

323
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,670
in anticipating of your arrival.

324
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,600
She cooked?

325
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,120
Are you sure it's edible?

326
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,030
Right.

327
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,510
Who knows what she's up to?

328
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,750
She might have added poison to the dish.

329
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,630
There's no way I'm falling for it.

330
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,240
Come on, it's not like that.

331
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,230
Alright.

332
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,150
You're going, Ms. Longevity?

333
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,350
Grandmother,

334
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,270
at least Father remembered me.

335
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,200
I will go.

336
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,720
We'll go with Zhao then.

337
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,870
I reckon the residence

338
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,510
wouldn't mind feeding
a couple more mouths.

339
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,710
Alright.

340
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,480
It takes only half a day to get
to the capital from Zhending.

341
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,590
Nanny Zhou,

342
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,720
please take good care
of my granddaughters.

343
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,790
Certainly.

344
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,360
How are things today?

345
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,450
Good harvest.

346
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,500
That's great.

347
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,070
Candied hawthorns!

348
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:08,910
I'll have one.

349
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,100
(Duke of Ying's Residence)

350
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,620
(Song Han, Duke of Ying's Second Son)

351
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,960
Han's mastery of the spear

352
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,750
has improved a lot.

353
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,860
I suppose it took a toll on your mother.

354
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,100
There's no such thing.

355
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,820
I haven't wielded a spear
in a long time.

356
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,940
Nowadays,

357
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,540
it's good for me to keep active.

358
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:05,420
Mo!

359
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,380
You're back.

360
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,980
Son.

361
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,380
My son.

362
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,140
Mother.

363
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,300
This is a blade I got from the pirates.

364
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,660
I want you to have it.

365
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,060
Thank you, Mo.

366
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,220
I heard you were badly injured
from the battle on Boat Island.

367
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,540
Where are you hurt?

368
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,500
Let me see.

369
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,820
I'm alright.

370
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,220
It must have been a hard journey.

371
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,780
I'm sure you've suffered.

372
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,580
Are you going to boast
about your victory from the get-go?

373
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,220
His uncle took care of his wounds.

374
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,940
There's no need for us.

375
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,980
Could you stop sulking about my brother?

376
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,260
The boys are still here.

377
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,340
Leave him there.

378
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,260
It's been a while

379
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,700
since you've had my cooking, right?

380
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,740
Go and rest up.

381
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,460
I will personally cook today.

382
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,780
Let's have a good family meal later.

383
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,980
Sounds good. I'll help you, Mother.

384
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,820
Okay.

385
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,900
Leave us.

386
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,100
What a move from your uncle.

387
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,260
He sent a military notice urgently.

388
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,780
It stated how I was negligent

389
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,980
and was only spared from whipping
due to my son's meritorious service.

390
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,780
Now, the officials all knew it.

391
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,180
I

392
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,860
have to rely on my good son

393
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,020
to have Jiang Meisun let me go?

394
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,100
This is a military notice
on the victory,

395
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,340
not an impeachment letter.

396
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,860
It's mainly to share

397
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,460
the good news of the victory.

398
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,980
So His Majesty wouldn't focus
on you mistake.

399
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,340
Was I wrong in helping the people
get rid of the bandits?

400
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,820
If you hadn't asked to be punished,

401
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,100
I would've had something to back
myself up in front of His Majesty.

402
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,500
Now look what's happened.

403
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,820
His Majesty demoted me to take charge
of the military in South City.

404
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,100
The son is praised
while the father is scorned.

405
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,300
You're putting me down,

406
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,380
and you think Jiang Meisun
did it out of good will?

407
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,900
Father, that's...

408
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,660
Do you still take me as your father?

409
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,460
All this while,

410
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,940
you've stationed yourself in Futing

411
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,820
and hardly ever came home.

412
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,900
His Majesty praised you
in a royal edict,

413
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,540
saying how you take after Jiang Meisun.

414
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,660
What a joke I've become.

415
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,940
Whose son are you really?

416
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,000
Perfume sachets, ornaments...

417
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,190
Candied hawthorns...

418
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,360
Come take a look.

419
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,010
Perfume sachets, ornaments,
little trinkets.

420
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,960
Powder and rouge.

421
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,670
Come and take a look.

422
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,560
Is it there?

423
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,570
- I'll take you.
- Let's get you a little tiger.

424
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:54,410
Okay.

425
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,300
Do you like it?

426
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,820
Whose son are you really?

427
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,780
His lordship has always been strict

428
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,140
with you since young.

429
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,860
It's true that there are more rules

430
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,980
in the duke's household.

431
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,900
Today, I realized.

432
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,980
After being away for so long,

433
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,500
my parents and little brother

434
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,860
are what a real family is like.

435
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,740
My coming back suddenly

436
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,900
seemed to have disrupted their harmony.

437
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,620
I want to take a stroll alone.

438
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,380
You may leave.

439
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,580
Today,

440
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:54,740
this shadow puppet show

441
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,540
I'm putting on today

442
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,380
is called the Legend of Zhao Si.

443
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,980
- Nice.
- Awesome!

444
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:26,460
(Happiness)

445
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,660
- Take a look.
- Ornaments...

446
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,700
(If I weren't the son
of Duke of Ying,)

447
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,540
(would it have been better
for everyone?)

448
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,900
(Suona, sedan, happiness)
Nice!

449
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,820
(Happiness)

450
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,980
- Nice.
- Nice.

451
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,540
It's been so long
since we came to the capital.

452
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,900
The new year celebration here
is much livelier.

453
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,220
There are so many shows and masks.

454
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,980
We're going to be late
if we don't make a move.

455
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,860
Why did you ladies get off here?

456
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,460
Fifth Master and Seventh Master
are waiting.

457
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,300
Come, get in the carriage.

458
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,700
Go on, quickly.

459
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:46,780
Young ladies,

460
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,140
I will notify Fifth Master
and Seventh Master.

461
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,420
Fourth Young Lady.

462
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,820
Chen Shiyuan, Liu Xuezhen, Pang Kunbai.

463
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,620
The guests are all new nobles
in the court.

464
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,340
Know yourself and your opponent.

465
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,060
Being prepared means less worries.

466
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,140
There are so many male guests.

467
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,660
With so many young guys,

468
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,180
I should've dressed up nicer.

469
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,180
The guests are mainly
Fifth Uncle's students,

470
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,260
members of nobility.

471
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,740
This is after all a banquet of honor.

472
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,700
Our attire is indeed disrespectful.

473
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,340
Sister.

474
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,420
Sister.

475
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,580
How come you're here?

476
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,780
You look dashing, Ming.

477
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,420
I just followed Mother's instructions.

478
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,660
I didn't know you'd be here today.

479
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,620
There are many guests.

480
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,580
Why don't you come to my room

481
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,660
and I'll help you get dressed? Come.

482
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:48,540
- Zhao.
- No...

483
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,900
You're finally here.

484
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,460
Master and Fifth Brother
are all waiting for you.

485
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:54,980
Ming,

486
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,780
why didn't you tell us Zhao is here?

487
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:58,860
Follow me.

488
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,700
It's this way.

489
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,260
Master,

490
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,980
- Zhao and the girls are here.
- Yes.

491
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,140
Not bad, they're young and talented.

492
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,300
Ms. Longevity.

493
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,980
The residence is hosting a banquet

494
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,300
and our guests are notable members
of the society.

495
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,220
How could you show up late

496
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,420
and dressed up like that?

497
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,060
Standing next to Ming,

498
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,820
you look more like a servant.

499
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,620
Ms. Longevity lives
with her grandmother.

500
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,340
It's good to be simple and neat.

501
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,300
It's my fault.

502
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,030
I forgot to tell the ladies
the specifics.

503
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,407
(Pang Kunbai)
Let me take them

504
00:25:37,408 --> 00:25:38,540
(Pang Kunbai)
to get dressed.

505
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,220
Come.

506
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:43,220
Apologies, Fifth Uncle.

507
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,940
My sisters and I are dressed plainly

508
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,660
not because
we were deliberately neglectful.

509
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,180
It's because dressing too lavishly
is inappropriate.

510
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,280
What do you mean?

511
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,740
Since last year, natural disasters
have been frequently occurring.

512
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,100
On top of that, wars raged on.

513
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,740
In the start of the year,
the Emperor and Empress

514
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,660
took the initiative to cut down
on luxury items.

515
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,420
They called on the officials
to not waste resources.

516
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,380
I heard that Fifth Uncle

517
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,090
is about to be promoted to head of
the Ministry of Rites.

518
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,300
Despite not having received
the official notice,

519
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,540
being so high profile and extravagant

520
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,060
could give others a reason
to make trouble.

521
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,220
Well...

522
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,260
That is true.

523
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,340
It didn't cross my mind at all.

524
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,260
For special celebrations,

525
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,780
even commoners would dress up.

526
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,540
It's for the sake of auspiciousness.

527
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,620
How is this

528
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,260
related to a national affair, Zhou?

529
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,940
It is quite a relief to hear such

530
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,060
down-to-earth words from a lady

531
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,330
from an official family.

532
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,700
Who's that?

533
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,420
Of course it had to be
the Fourth Young Lady.

534
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,660
Mr. Wu.

535
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,820
Long time no see.

536
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,860
Is Mr. Wu Sr. doing well?

537
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,150
Grandfather is as fine as can be.

538
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,525
(Wu Shan, Wu Family's Eldest Grandchild)
I wish Fifth Master Dou congratulations

539
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:50,820
(Wu Shan, Wu Family's Eldest Grandchild)
on behalf of my grandfather.

540
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,780
- Mr. Dou.
- Thank you.

541
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,940
- Mr. Wu.
- Take down the lights.

542
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,860
Please head inside.

543
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:05,780
- Madam.
- Head inside.

544
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,420
Help Ming to change her clothes.

545
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,220
Is that Prime Minister Wu's
sole grandchild, Wu Shan?

546
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,540
I didn't know you had dealings
with the Wu family.

547
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,940
My stepmother is the people person.

548
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,260
Moreover, Wang Xingyi
was Wu Shan's examiner.

549
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,260
He's likely the arrow
at this private banquet.

550
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,540
And between Dou Ming and I,

551
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,820
one of us is the bullseye.

552
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,220
They're really changing the lanterns?

553
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,740
(Bright Moon Clear Spring)
You're incredible, Mr. Chen.

554
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,533
(Su Xin, Su Lan)
You even predicted

555
00:27:44,534 --> 00:27:45,540
(Su Xin, Su Lan)
that they would change the lanterns

556
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,420
halfway through the banquet.

557
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,980
Switching out the celebratory lanterns

558
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:51,500
means Fourth Young Lady
is doing alright.

559
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,700
Perhaps she's even gotten
the upper hand.

560
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,980
Let us go, Mother.

561
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,060
Ming, answer me.

562
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,700
Just now at the door,

563
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,980
what were you doing

564
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,820
with Dou Zhao?

565
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,180
I just had
a little catch-up with sister.

566
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,260
She doesn't see you as her sister.

567
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,500
Don't be a fool.

568
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,460
Stop being so eager
to call her your sister.

569
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,420
Everything I do is for your own good.

570
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,140
Otherwise, why did I
go through the trouble

571
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,740
to invite Mr. Wu here?

572
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,700
But I don't have any...

573
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,540
Shut your mouth.

574
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,770
When choosing a husband,

575
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,180
your own feelings
is the lowest priority.

576
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,630
Mr. Wu is from an established family.

577
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,460
Moreover, he's kind and diligent.

578
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,820
He makes the perfect husband material.

579
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,260
You're of the age to get married.

580
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,700
You're at your prime.

581
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:40,980
So tonight,

582
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,180
make sure you make me proud.

583
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,220
Got it?

584
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,340
- Yes.
- Let's go.

585
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,100
Ms. Longevity.

586
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,700
It was a slight of hand
mentioning official affairs.

587
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,580
I'm dressed plainly

588
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,020
because Mother's death anniversary
is coming up.

589
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,780
I don't know
if you still remember, Father.

590
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,060
Of course I do.

591
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,860
Look at this magnolia tree.

592
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,900
I'm the one taking care of it.

593
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,940
The blooms
are particularly beautiful this year.

594
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,140
Flowers can bloom again,

595
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,700
but humans cannot start over.

596
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,900
Whether it's the new year
or a promotion, they're just excuses.

597
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,380
Father and Fifth Uncle

598
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,740
are taking this opportunity
to get Prime Minister Wu's grandson

599
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,780
and other guests

600
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,380
to check out the Dous' daughters, right?

601
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,500
Your fifth uncle

602
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,660
is only looking out
for your potential suitor.

603
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,820
Made to look inferior
and scrutinized by others,

604
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,220
did you expect me and Fifth Sister

605
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,020
to spread our tails like peacocks
to please those men?

606
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,860
The seniors only have
your best interests at heart.

607
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,620
Don't take it wrongly.

608
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,020
Fifth Uncle

609
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,620
insisted you take Wang Yingxue
as a concubine

610
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,540
so that he could use
the Wang family as backup.

611
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,260
Now, he's moved from
the governor of internal affairs

612
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,740
to the head of the Ministry of Rites.

613
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,580
Does he really need to use my marriage

614
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,180
to help connect him to the Wu family?

615
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,300
Dou Zhao,

616
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,300
you are being too harsh
toward your senior.

617
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,220
Since before, it's the parent's job
to arrange their children's marriage.

618
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,340
But have I ever
forced anything upon you?

619
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,500
No, you didn't force me,

620
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,900
nor did you ever educate me.

621
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,460
Just stay at arm's length.

622
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,620
It's fine to stay out
of each other's business.

623
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,300
- You...
- It's better for you

624
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,780
to place your hopes and dreams
onto Fifth Sister.

625
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,900
When she finds a suitor,

626
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,420
I will be happy to prepare her dowry.

627
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,020
Fifth Young Lady looks weak
like a willow.

628
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,100
She seems a little pitiful.

629
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,100
I reckon she'd be hard to please.

630
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,060
Fifth Young Lady is meant for Mr. Wu.

631
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,300
You can forget about her.

632
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,220
If you want to get
a foot into the Dou family,

633
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,340
you'll have to pick someone
from the unwanted pile,

634
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,580
the last in line.

635
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,940
For instance, the Zhao.

636
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,700
I rather go for Fourth Young Lady then.

637
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,340
At least she's loaded.

638
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,140
Fourth Young Lady is my pick.

639
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,700
You can have Miss Miao.

640
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,900
Although her family background
is lacking,

641
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,180
at least she's moldable.

642
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,500
A gentleman should think twice
before doing anything.

643
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,620
How could you discuss such vile ideas

644
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,820
under the eaves of the Dou residence?

645
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,300
What happened
to the lessons you learned

646
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,860
about the ways of the saint?

647
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,340
Just listen to me.

648
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,100
Pick Miss Miao and you're set.

649
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,140
Listen to me.

650
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,900
What's this?

651
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,660
It smells nasty!

652
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,420
This is a special rain gauge
made by the Ministry of Works.

653
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,340
It's used by counties and cities to
measure rainfall and prevent disasters.

654
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,580
You can't simply touch it.

655
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,660
Ming is here.

656
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,300
The main protagonist is here.

657
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,180
So we just have to be
the supporting cast?

658
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,020
Yes.

659
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,980
Act dumb and guileless.

660
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,540
Focus on eating and drinking.

661
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,500
Okay, I can do that.

662
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,180
Everyone,

663
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,660
we are fortunate to be gathered here.

664
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,540
Please don't be shy.

665
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,700
- Here.
- Sister.

666
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,500
Since you are all well-educated,

667
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:19,900
I have a suggestion.

668
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,300
Please come up with a couplet

669
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,420
and invite one of the ladies
to match it.

670
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,060
If by chance, someone makes
a good follow-up,

671
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,780
- they'll get one drink.
- Good idea.

672
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:28,620
Good idea.

673
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,860
That's a good idea.

674
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,260
Since Lord Dou has spoken,

675
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,180
it is an honor to be able to see
the literary talent

676
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,340
of the ladies.

677
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,780
Alright, then.
Let's have Mr. Wu go first.

678
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,340
A lane by the walls shaded with willows,

679
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,780
floodwaters submerge
the long embankment.

680
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,980
There's no ground left to tread
where cattle and sheep plod.

681
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,820
Good one.

682
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:57,140
Dezhen's literary talent
is not inferior to Hanlin's.

683
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,660
Ming.

684
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:28,940
Write this.

685
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,580
(A different world opens up
under the heavens)

686
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,260
Dou Ming has a follow-up.

687
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,340
Beyond the heart lies Shangri-la,

688
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,940
clouds obscure the narrow path ahead.

689
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,920
Through the woods
where chickens and dogs are heard,

690
00:33:48,921 --> 00:33:50,140
a different world opens up
under the heavens.

691
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,580
Excellent.

692
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,820
It's the perfect pairing.

693
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,740
Thanks to Mr. Wu for the inspiration.

694
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,700
Shishu, take a look at this verse.

695
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,420
Here.

696
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,860
Fifth Young Lady
is totally in the spotlight.

697
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,900
Wang Yingxue must be delighted.

698
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,700
Hasn't this rhyming gone long enough?

699
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,780
Yeah, Ms. Longevity.

700
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,140
That's how she's always been.

701
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,100
Fourth Young Lady is intelligent.

702
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,900
How come you've not produced any verse?

703
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,180
I grew up in the countryside,

704
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,260
so I'm not good in writing.

705
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,460
You jest, miss.

706
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,980
The young ladies are the stars
of today's banquet.

707
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,740
How about the Fourth Young Lady
set a verse this time?

708
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,100
Ms. Longevity,

709
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,460
do you not want to write?

710
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,100
I can do it for you.

711
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,940
A young child from the north
tends the herds,

712
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,700
watching over sheep, cattle,
and the stars.

713
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,300
I can match it.

714
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:33,660
The old rogue in black
launches a midnight ambush,

715
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,580
seeking to hold, to embrace,
and to steal a kiss.

716
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,340
How shameless.

717
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,180
Ridiculous.

718
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,460
From the handwriting,

719
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,900
it looks like Miss Zhao wrote it.

720
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,220
Zhao Si is a two-time participant of
the Ministry of Rites exam nonetheless.

721
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,740
You are his only daughter.

722
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,300
How could you be so crass and absurd?

723
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,180
You did a good job
following up though, Mr. Pang.

724
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,420
What about I pull
the red thread for you?

725
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,460
You could be the Zhaos'
matrilocal son-in-law.

726
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,340
I never said I wanted him.

727
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,580
Apologies for my rudeness.

728
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,420
He thought Zhao had written it,

729
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,860
that's why he tried comic relief.

730
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,180
It was only a joke.

731
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,180
When the tree is rotten,

732
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,980
you can't expect the fruit
to be any good.

733
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,940
Miss Zhao's parents are away in Diannan.

734
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,820
She lacks proper upbringing.

735
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,220
After spending years in the countryside
with merchants,

736
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,300
it's inevitable
she'd be unknowledgeable.

737
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,980
Stop your crap!

738
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,380
There, there.

739
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,980
If you're right,

740
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,980
I too, grew up without my parents.

741
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,180
So I'm doing menial jobs
and wandering in the countryside.

742
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,380
Dou Zhao.

743
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,500
Perfect.

744
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,060
I just thought of a first verse.

745
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,780
Ms. Longevity.

746
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,220
What? What's she doing on this side?

747
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,660
Dou Zhao, that's the men's area.

748
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,940
How could you cross over?

749
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,940
Aren't you ashamed?

750
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,780
Dou Zhao...

751
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,100
The gentlemen were discussing
the ladies' marriages

752
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,300
without a care in the world.

753
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,700
If they aren't ashamed,

754
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:15,900
why should I?

755
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,940
The fan is only used by courtesans

756
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,100
or talented scholars.

757
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,460
Mr. Liu Xuezhen.

758
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,860
I heard you sat
for the imperial exam six times

759
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,900
and failed six times.

760
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,260
You're using the fan,

761
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,020
so what talent do you have to show?

762
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,620
You're a lady, miss.

763
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,060
Your words

764
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,460
are inappropriate.

765
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,660
Mr. Chen Shiyuan.

766
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,420
I heard your family business went bust

767
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,660
and you even had to sell
your ancestral home.

768
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,980
I bet you're hoping to use the dowry
to plug the holes.

769
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,940
Ms. Longevity has been away
from the capital.

770
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,180
How did she know...

771
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,620
(Price treasure)

772
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,140
A fickle lover is easy to find,

773
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,060
but a priceless treasure
is hard to seek.

774
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:03,820
Why entrust insincere feelings
to embellished letters?

775
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,940
I can't stand you talentless
and immoral people

776
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,060
who curry favor with the powerful.

777
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,700
Just because you know a few characters,
you think you're superior,

778
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,980
talking ill of the ladies.

779
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,580
You treat marriage
like an item on the shelf,

780
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,860
comparing and commenting on it.

781
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,340
You deem us the unwanted bunch,
last in the line.

782
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,340
Does that make you the despicable fly?

783
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,260
Don't be rude.

784
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,060
You're behaving inappropriately

785
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,140
and making wild remarks
in front of guests.

786
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,460
Where are your manners?

787
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,460
That's Zhao for you.

788
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,460
Mr. Wu,

789
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,580
sorry you had to see that.

790
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,780
Fourth Young Lady Dou's couplet

791
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,220
is sincere and straightforward.

792
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,340
There's a bit of sarcastic humor too.

793
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,220
I actually think

794
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,020
there's nothing wrong with it.

795
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,700
But, it does make it harder
to create the other couplet.

796
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,180
I am too crass and unrefined.

797
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,460
I am not qualified
to be among such company.

798
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,380
Allow me to leave and self-reflect.

799
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,180
- Me too.
- Me too.

800
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,180
Let them be.

801
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,260
Will Fourth Young Lady be okay?

802
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,260
A noble family
knows to assess the situation.

803
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,460
Being too aggressive
may not be a good thing.

804
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:21,860
It will depend on whether
Fourth Young Lady can hold it in.

805
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,020
If she can,

806
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,140
we'll have to wait
for another 15 minutes.

807
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,780
You're always so cryptic, Mr. Chen.

808
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,550
What happens if she can't hold it in?

809
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,420
Wait up, Zhao!

810
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,420
She's here.

811
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,980
Don't be angry, Zhao.

812
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,140
I'm not.

813
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,540
I can't be bothered with those people.

814
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,980
Are you sure you're not angry, miss?

815
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,380
I am a little upset.

816
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,540
So you asked me to attend the banquet

817
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,060
hoping I'd keep a low profile.

818
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,380
But it's not all bad.

819
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,700
When choosing a wife,

820
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,860
officials value virtue
and respect the most.

821
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,940
Now that I'm seen

822
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,420
as the wild, fierce girl,

823
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,500
it will be the perfect excuse to reject
Marquis of Jining's marriage proposal.

824
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,660
Now they can't force me to get married.

825
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,300
Do you really not care about
your reputation

826
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,220
and marriage at all?

827
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,860
Women can live a good life

828
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,180
even without men.

829
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,780
When you become the wife,
you have to look after both families.

830
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,900
Worrying about his career,
taking care of household chores,

831
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,740
not to mention the concubines
and illegitimate children.

832
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,660
If your feelings were true,

833
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,420
you'd likely end up like my mother.

834
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,420
Still, I want to meet my one true love,

835
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,820
get married and have children.

836
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:43,140
Maybe it's because
I grew up without my parents,

837
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,340
so I've always wanted a family.

838
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,860
If you think...

839
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,420
I'm going to teach
those uneducated slimes a lesson!

840
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,660
How dare they say I'm too old,
crass and unfavorable?

841
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,460
- I'll show them what's up.
- Zhangru...

842
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,540
I, Zhao Zhangru, will show you
what it means to be crass!

843
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,180
Zhangru, get back here.

844
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,020
Sit down.

845
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:01,940
Zhangru.

846
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,420
Those people are blind and heartless.

847
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,940
They couldn't see your greatness.

848
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,420
That's right.

849
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,540
If my father hadn't insisted
on finding a matrilocal son-in-law,

850
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,340
I would've gotten married long ago.

851
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,940
Okay, okay, she's drunk.

852
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,340
I'll take her back first.

853
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,740
Come on.

854
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,140
I'm bored.

855
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,380
I'll go for a walk outside.

856
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,180
Okay. Don't stay out too late.

857
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,820
Let's go, this way.

858
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,300
Su, drink with me some more.

859
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,140
Okay, we'll drink.

860
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,340
Miss,

861
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,620
there's someone following us.

862
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:54,940
Miss, have a look.

863
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,180
Go back to Dou's Residence

864
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,220
and bring me some silver notes.

865
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,100
Will do, miss.

866
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,180
See you around.

867
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,900
(Show, Story of Luo Shan)

868
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,740
Sir.

869
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,100
The newly released Story of Luo Shan.

870
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,580
The son who lost his mother early
takes his father to court

871
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,300
A life of wandering,
heartache and grievances.

872
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,660
You can't cut off your father for good.

873
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,860
There are still some seats available.

874
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:32,980
Why don't you head in?

875
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,140
Drinks and snacks are provided.

876
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,020
It's the whole package.

877
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:43,980
(Show, Story of Luo Shan)

878
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,740
Welcome.

879
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,180
I invited Ji Jianming
to countryside manor

880
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,620
hoping he and Ms. Longevity
would take a liking to each other.

881
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,660
That Ji and Ms. Longevity
keep meeting up in private.

882
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:19,580
He must have feelings for her.

883
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:20,980
Zhao,

884
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:22,620

00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,500
