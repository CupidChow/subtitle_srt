00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,940
(Opera. The Life of Luo Shan)

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,800
Sir,

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,160
it's a new play titled,
"The Life of Luo Shan."

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,640
It's about a motherless child
who brings his father to court.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,880
A life of drifting
with emotional entanglement.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,710
A father and son relationship
that is hard to sever.

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,550
Please, come inside.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,620
(Opera. The Life of Luo Shan)

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,920
Please head inside.

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,150
Keep a close watch

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,600
on the woman with the fox mask.

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,800
- Yes.
- Yes.

13
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,920
So, how does the story unfold?

14
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,790
The entire family

15
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,960
was killed by the bandit, Xu Neng.

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,920
Xu Neng

17
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,110
is my father's name.

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,840
Could my father really...?

19
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,560
Outrageous!

20
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,000
Good!

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,040
The play is excellent.

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,400
But sadly, the son discovers
that his father is not only a bandit

23
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,230
but might also be the one
who killed his mother.

24
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,510
It seems like this is a tragedy.

25
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,000
Sir, please enjoy
and see how it unfolds.

26
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,840
But not necessarily.

27
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,840
People love to watch plays

28
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,590
because they always end the play

29
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,680
with a reunion

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,070
no matter how deep the grudges.

31
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,640
Life, on the other hand,
is harder than that.

32
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,350
Happiness finds company,
sorrow finds none.

33
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,920
If you don't believe it,

34
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,870
why not watch and see

35
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,430
if the ending is tragic or joyful?

36
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,150
Sure.

37
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,790
With the screen removed

38
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,350
and accompanied
by the candlelight and gentle breeze,

39
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,400
it will be much more spacious.

40
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,550
Waiter!

41
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,680
Remove this screen.

42
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,520
I'll move it right away.

43
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,180
(Exquisite Melodies)

44
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,400
Wonderful!

45
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,240
How strange.

46
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,280
It's neither a tragedy
nor a happy ending.

47
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,960
Is the play unfinished?

48
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,560
The son is an official,
and the father is a bandit.

49
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,870
Family and justice

50
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,030
become two uncompromising sides.

51
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,800
The ending is naturally hard to write.

52
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,680
If the second half showed

53
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,400
a son trying his father in court,

54
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,710
wouldn't that be shocking?

55
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,430
Do you think
a son shouldn't try his father?

56
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,800
Should family always come
before justice?

57
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,280
I meant

58
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,870
there's nothing wrong
with shocking the world.

59
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,840
Filial piety may be the greatest virtue.

60
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,280
But loyalty to the country comes first
when you're an official.

61
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,590
The question

62
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,560
is whether he wants to be a good son

63
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,190
or a good official.

64
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,680
There's no way to be both.

65
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,030
Whichever way he chooses,
it's bound to end in tragedy.

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,750
The main character is a tragic figure.

67
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,870
(I think he is heartbroken)

68
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,400
(because he is also struggling
between family and justice.)

69
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,030
How would you write it?

70
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,910
In court, try the cases as you should.

71
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,430
At home, you're a son again.

72
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,630
Put aside all the talk of big principles

73
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,400
and just softly coax him.

74
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,590
If that doesn't work,

75
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,590
you can just kneel on a washboard.

76
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,680
That would turn it into a comedy, then.

77
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,400
Dear audience, you are in luck!

78
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,030
To celebrate the festive season,

79
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,000
I've prepared

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,750
a guessing game and a little gift

81
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,000
to entertain you all.

82
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,470
=Blossom=

83
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,300
(Adapted from the novel
"Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

84
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,300
=Episode 4=

85
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,070
All the items used in the game are
from the tavern.

86
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,600
The performers' acts
will serve as hints.

87
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
Everyone here can guess.

88
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,920
The one with the most correct answers
wins.

89
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,040
Let's begin with the first question.

90
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,310
In the city, the battle horses roam.

91
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,310
Each year, the land is filled
with corpses and crows' cries.

92
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,150
Battle horses?

93
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,870
That is too small for them.

94
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,510
It's "The Blossom."

95
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,920
Ni Heng beats the drum
and insults Cao Cao.

96
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,920
It's a drumstick.

97
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,790
Correct!

98
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,120
Great answer!

99
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,190
I'm surprised you know
about historical weapons.

100
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,430
Could you be a man dressing as a woman?

101
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,950
Well, women can be as capable as men.

102
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,190
Let's move to the second question.

103
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,510
These are hairpins and skirts,

104
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,920
standing tall to hold up the sky.

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,120
What's this talk of a man's role?

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,800
Hua Mulan joined the army
in place of her father.

107
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,360
She removed her makeup
and disguised herself as a man.

108
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,070
The object in the box is a rouge used

109
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,310
by female performers.

110
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,320
Correct!

111
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,200
Impressive!

112
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,720
You seem quite familiar
with women's products.

113
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,070
Could it be you often frequent
such places?

114
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,600
In books,
there are beauties like Yan Ruyu.

115
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,960
If I must say,

116
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,360
why don't you two go home and compete?

117
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,630
It's meaningless to argue here.

118
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,920
- Don't you all agree?
- Leave now.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,360
- That's right.
- Go home.

120
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,630
That would be boring.

121
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,720
Competing is the fun part.

122
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,030
That's right.

123
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,000
If I just admit defeat,

124
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,950
it's not worth being a man at all.

125
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,510
Is there a third question?

126
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,750
That's right.

127
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,480
Is there a third riddle?

128
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,560
Here comes the third riddle.

129
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,390
The song of Chu brings sorrow

130
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:44,430
with tears filling the eyes.

131
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,560
The Battle of Gaixia,
surrounded by Chu's soldiers.

132
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,870
- The Chu army missed home.
- The Chu army...

133
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,510
Those who miss home want
to return home.

134
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,750
The item is Angelica Root,

135
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,080
a dish in the tavern.

136
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,320
Correct!

137
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,600
Excellent!

138
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,000
Miss, you won this round.

139
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,360
We both answered together.

140
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,560
But I was quicker.

141
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,150
Thank you for yielding.

142
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,430
The words you spoke so easily

143
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,680
were a luxury I could not even dream of.

144
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,630
I admit my defeat.

145
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,600
What do you think
this person is thinking?

146
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,120
He's upset
and does not accept his defeat.

147
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,790
He's thinking about his family

148
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,510
and the hometown
he hasn't returned to for a long time.

149
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,680
Congratulations, miss.

150
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,280
Thank you.

152
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,470
It's a pity

153
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,150
I can no longer use this.

154
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,110
Mister!

155
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,470
Mister,

156
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,840

to guess what's on your mind.)

158
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,870
(I wonder if I am right.)

159
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,390
(You are well-versed in knowledge)

160
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,240
(with unmatched talents.)

161
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,720
(But you're defeated
by family problems.)

162
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,960
(If your family is still around,)

163
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,150
(why not compromise and give it a try?)

164
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,600

that brings joy to your parents.)

your return.

and we need to return and provide help.

176

I was at the theater to watch a play.

It might have gotten caught
when I was passing by other audiences.

182
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,670
You left the army quietly this time.

183
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,510
So it's best not to expose
your whereabouts.

184
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,870
You should discard it.

185
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,080
If a woman's personal belongings

186
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,320
fall into the wrong hands,
won't that cause trouble?

187
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,080
I will return it to her
if I see her again.

188
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,630
By the way,

189
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,480
deliver this lantern to my father.

190
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,600
Let's meet at the post station
in an hour.

191
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,630
Scented sachets, charms,
and little trinkets for sale!

192
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,440
Sugar-coated hawthorn for sale!

193
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,120
Once I finish my business at dawn,
I'll bring her back.

194
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,440
You all should leave
and lay low for now.

195
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,910
- Yes.
- Leave now.

196
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,040
Pang Kunbai?

197
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,030
What are you trying to do?

198
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,870
What do you think?

199
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,720
I'm obviously going
to show you some affection.

200
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,920
How did you...

201
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,790
All... All of you...

202
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,670
Let me enjoy

203
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,000
your affection, then.

204
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,160
Get him!

205
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,920
Stop it.

206
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,750
Stop hitting me.

207
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,390
Spare me!

208
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,550
Who knew stargazing would lead
to such a drama.

209
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,360
Interesting, indeed.

210
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,790
Miss, spare us.

211
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,750
We were only doing our part
for the money.

212
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,720
You use your skills to bully women
and ruin their reputations

213
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,480
instead of putting your skills
to good use.

214
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,150
Killing you wouldn't be unjust.

215
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,870
Fourth Young Lady Dou,
it's all a misunderstanding.

216
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,030
Those scoundrels knocked me out
and brought me here!

217
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,440
I don't know anything.

218
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,360
Stop! I'll take responsibility for you!

219
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,030
I'll marry you
with all the proper ceremonies

220
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,360
and make sure no one criticizes you.

221
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,200
Just keep your mouth shut.

222
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,240
At the family banquet,

223
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,790
I saw you exchanged looks
with Wang Yingxue.

224
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,120
I knew it wasn't a simple banquet.

225
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,750
So I sent someone
to investigate your background.

226
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,120
You're a nephew of the Wang Family.

227
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,000
You're scheming on using nonsense

228
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,720
about what gossip can do
to one's reputation.

229
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,870
Did you think
Young Lady would suffer in silence?

230
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,000
You're coveting her hard-earned savings
from over ten years

231
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,850
to become part of her dowry

232
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,080
so it can fill your family's pockets!

233
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,630
I want to see what happens
when this matter reaches the court.

234
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,870
Is it me afraid
of being schemed against,

235
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,840
or your Wang Family afraid
of having your reputation ruined?

236
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,790
Take him away.

237
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,750
Get lost.

238
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,440
Little Zhuang Zhou,

239
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,120
it seems
Grandmother has taken good care of you.

240
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,670
This was a storybook left behind
by a carefree hermit.

241
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,440
He said it's for someone with fate.

242
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,040
It seems

243
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,630
you're that Little Zhuang Zhou he meant.

244
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,840
Yuantong?

245
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,200
Is it really you?

246
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,390
Why are you here?

247
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,550
Since you're one of us,

248
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,600
why did you let Pang Kunbai go?

249
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,670
Are you putting an act for me?

250
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,470
Aunt!

251
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,840
Aunt!

252
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,750
Look at you.

253
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,630
Aunt, we're done for.

254
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,000
What happened to you?

255
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,440
You're a grown man helped
by a group of people.

256
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,390
How did a young girl put you

257
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,480
in such a sorry state?

258
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,750
Aunt,

259
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,550
she was already prepared for this.

260
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,790
We have been played.

261
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,240
You're so useless.

262
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,440
Madam! Madam, we have trouble.

263
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,080
Fourth Young Lady has arrived
with the guards.

264
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,630
Head to the side room quickly.

265
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,360
Go and hide there now.

266
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,560
Madam,

267
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,360
is everything all right here?

268
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,870
I was robbed while I was enjoying
the Lantern Festival.

269
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,670
I even followed Officer Wang
from the yamen

270
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,790
to chase him all the way here.

271
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,550
But I realized that this is our house.

272
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,790
This is the Dou's Residence, you know.

273
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,550
The outlaws wouldn't dare to enter.

274
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,000
What nonsense.

275
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,680
Let me go!

276
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,630
- Let me go!
- Officer Wang,

277
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,990
he is right here.

278
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,110
You...

279
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,390
How dare you.

280
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,550
These two are from the same household.

281
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,030
Who's this troublemaker barking here?

282
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,390
Greetings, Madam Wang.

283
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,080
My name is Ji Yong,

284
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,030
a distant relative of Old Madam Cui.

285
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,480
I lodged the report.

286
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,440
Mr. Ji is the top scholar
in the provincial exam.

287
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,670
Arrest him!

288
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,440
Let me go!

289
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,150
Aunt! Aunt!

290
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,720
Aunt, help me!

291
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,270
Aunt!

292
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,230
Madam,

293
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,390
betrayal from one's family truly hurts.

294
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,960
He even said this was your idea.

295
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,390
You...

296
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,550
This is a serious matter.

297
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,480
I'll go and get Fifth Master
and Seventh Master

298
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,440
to go to the government office together.

299
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,080
We can sort out
any misunderstandings there.

300
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,630
No! This is...

301
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,270
Fifth Master and Seventh Master
are already asleep.

302
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,790
Let's not trouble the both of them.

303
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,960
Your acting was very convincing.

304
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,790
If you went straight
to report this to the authorities,

305
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,870
they wouldn't dare act

306
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,960
against the Wang Family
or the Dou Family's influence.

307
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,540
But catching them red-handed
is a different matter.

308
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,750
Wang Yingxue will have

309
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,030
a hard time explaining this to Father

310
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,910
and the Wang Family.

311
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,390
Absurd!

312
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,720
Absolutely ridiculous!

313
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,120
He's only a distant nephew.

314
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,510
You'd rather believe him

315
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,790
than me?

316
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,630
Kidnapping is such a serious crime.

317
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,530
How dare he falsely accuse me of it?

318
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,870
Your own nephew turned around
and accused you.

319
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,000
How could that be fake?

320
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,120
I just don't understand.

321
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,030
You used to be kind and patient.

322
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,480
What happened to you?

323
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,520
My dear,

324
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,480
is it me who's changed, or is it you?

325
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,000
No matter how others mocked me before,

326
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,110
you would always love and protect me.

327
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,510
But somewhere along the way,

328
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:13,790
our relationship was no longer the same.

329
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,750
We become a married couple in the name.

330
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,920
Ever since we sleep in separate rooms,

331
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,400
you've decided that I'm the bad person.

332
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,720
You would blame me

333
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,790
whenever anything bad happens
to Dou Zhao.

334
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,030
I'm just stating facts.

335
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,030
Stop bringing up unrelated matters.

336
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,400
It's not unrelated.

337
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,200
I know you can't let go
of Guqiu's death.

338
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,030
So you let me take that fall!

339
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,640
Sixteen years have passed.

340
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,270
Has Dou Zhao ever fulfilled
her duties as a daughter?

341
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,750
But as for me,

342
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,400
I've given everything I have
to the Dou Family,

343
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,270
both at home and in the court.

344
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,790
What else do you want from me?

345
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,680
Why don't you just divorce me already?

346
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,270
Yingxue. Yingxue!

347
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,110
That's not what I meant.

348
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,030
But Ms. Longevity did suffer
from the incident.

349
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,110
Father.

350
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,240
Mother.

351
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,720
Zhao has prepared a carriage

352
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,880
and is ready to leave soon.

353
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,320
Ming,

354
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,680
your mother's eyes are irritated
by pollen.

355
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,270
Help her wipe them.

356
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,560
Yes, Father.

357
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,720
You devoted yourself to this family.

358
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,790
Father knows that.

359
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,040
I know.

360
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,030
But he still favors Dou Zhao.

361
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,270
If I didn't make a scene just now,

362
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,680
how else could I remove the thorn?

363
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,960
Father wants harmony in the family.

364
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,200
Why not show some generosity

365
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,790
and make peace
with Zhao and Grandmother?

366
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,310
I'm the matron of this house!

367
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,440
Why should I humble myself to them?

368
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,240
Are you out of your mind?

369
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,510
As long as she stays unmarried,

370
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,550
you can't discuss your marriage.

371
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,510
Her wealth

372
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,160
should be part of your dowry.

373
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,200
I don't care

374
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,000
about the amount of my dowry

375
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,790
or when my wedding happens.

376
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,960
You fool!

377
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,640
I've never given the Dou Family a son.

378
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,310
So I'm forced to play the bad person

379
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,680
and fight for everything.

380
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,680
But I never imagined

381
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,030
you grew up to be such
a spineless child.

382
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,200
I don't even know why

383
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,400
I've been fighting all this time.

384
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,830
If I'd known this,

385
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,920
I would never have

386
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,920
let someone else raise you.

387
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,350
Mother,

388
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,480
I know I've let you down.

389
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,070
But I don't want you

390
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,110
to risk so much for my sake.

391
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,030
Lending money at interest
is strictly forbidden by the court.

392
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,270
All these years,

393
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,350
you've been dealing
with the cutthroat Cangbei Gang...

394
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,190
Quiet!

395
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,760
How dare you speak

396
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,310
of such things?

397
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,000
Cry?

398
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,510
Is crying all you know?

399
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,590
Crying is useless.

400
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,960
I know.

401
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,680
But I can't control my tears.

402
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,830
I'm useless.

403
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,630
Ming,

404
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,510
you must listen to everything I say

405
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,510
since you admit crying is useless.

406
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,640
Remember this.

407
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,160
Your dowry, family background,
and reputation

408
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,240
all affect your future marriage.

409
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,960
If I don't fight for it,

410
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,320
you'll live

411
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,750
in constant fear and uncertainty
in the future.

412
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:35,240
You can't even control your emotions.

413
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,270
Let alone the hardships
of being a wife.

414
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,110
How can you endure all that?

415
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,040
Ms. Longevity.

416
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,910
Ms. Longevity,

417
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,790
I failed to protect you.

418
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,030
It is all my fault.

419
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,550
I will definitely make it up to you.

420
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,310
It's not your fault, Father.

421
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,790
I should never have expected anything
in the first place.

422
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,950
All done.

423
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,480
Peony fillet, a famous Sichuan dish.

424
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,920
This Peony fillet
is so complicated to make

425
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,160
It's hard to find something like this
in the restaurants of the capital.

426
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,440
Ms. Longevity,
who taught you how to make it?

427
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,480
Then I'll try a bite first.

428
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,720
Zhangru,

429
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,510
I made this for Ji Jianming.

430
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,550
It's not proper if you eat it first.

431
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,270
Fine.

432
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,200
I wonder if he eats spicy food.

433
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,510
I also made
deep-fried potato shrimp for him.

434
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,920
Zhangru, why are you...

435
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,440
Su, what have you been doing over there

436
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,280
all day?

437
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,110
I made a sweet dish

438
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,310
for good luck,

439
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,510
called Hidden Treasures.

440
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,480
It looks good.

441
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,790
I don't know what Ji is thinking.

442
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,750
The capital has many tasty food and fun.

443
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,550
Why would he choose to live
in this remote manor?

444
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,640
By the way,

445
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,920
how did you two know each other?

446
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,310
I first met him
when I was still a child.

447
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,760
We met at Wanfo Temple.

448
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,240
Your health is in such poor condition.

449
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,880
You might as well go to heaven

450
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,550
instead of coming back to the village.

451
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,300
(Records of the Enlightened Age)
Leave now.

452
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:08,110
Misfortune can lead to something good
and they are connected.

453
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,750
We're counting on both of you
to change the secret of heaven.

454
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,830
Ji looks like a celestial being

455
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,480
It's a waste for him to be a monk.

456
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,680
I wonder if he's open
about being a matrilocal husband.

457
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:20,870
Zhao,

458
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,590
how far have you two progressed?

459
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,640
I haven't seen him in ages.

460
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,400
Then why are you still making
Peony fillet for him?

461
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,310
I've never even tried it before.

462
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,030
- Me too.
- I'll make it for you next time.

463
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,350
Fourth Young Lady,

464
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,160
Old Madam's migraines
are acting up again.

465
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,280
Mister,

466
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,510
how's Grandmother now?

467
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,270
Her migraine has built up over time
because of emotional stress.

468
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,110
It can't be rushed.

469
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,440
Just follow the remedy I gave

470
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,510
and recuperate slowly.

471
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,880
- Thank you, mister.
- I shall make a move now.

472
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,670
You're a quack!

473
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,550
- Who are you calling a quack?
- The one who answers.

474
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,750
- You...
- You're a quack, quack, quack.

475
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,510
I won't argue
with a young brat like you.

476
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,520
I'm leaving!

477
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,590
If you follow

478
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,270
that quack advice to treat her,

479
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,110
even a god couldn't save her.

480
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:26,960
Don't talk about bad luck.

481
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,280
What?

482
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,590
Will kind words heal her?

483
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,440
Take off her clothes.

484
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,790
You can save her, right?

485
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,480
The root of the illness
is blocked energy.

486
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,270
It's stuck at certain pressure points.

487
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,680
One is above the navel,

488
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,520
and the other is on the foot.

489
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,400
You'll need to remove her clothes
and use acupuncture.

490
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,960
Since she's a woman,

491
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,920
maybe we should find a female physician?

492
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,240
But female physicians are rare.

493
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,160
Grandmother won't eat or drink.

494
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,720
We cannot afford to wait anymore.

495
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:04,870
Grandmother.

496
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,640
Everyone has their fate.

497
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,310
Perhaps my time is ending.

498
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,510
I just don't understand.

499
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,030
It's a treatable illness,
but she refuses to be treated.

500
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,480
If everything is
about rules and propriety,

501
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,830
what do we need physicians for?

502
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,040
Old Madam,

503
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,240
isn't your life

504
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,110
more important than those useless rules?

505
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:24,950
Grandmother,

506
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,270
a physician
doesn't discriminate genders.

507
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,670
Everyone is patient in their eyes.

508
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,880
I don't want to lose a loved one
because of these traditions.

509
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:34,830
Please,

510
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,350
just try it for me.

511
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,630
Please, Grandmother.

512
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,480
Ms. Longevity!

513
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,430
Ms. Longevity!

514
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,030
Grandmother finally took the medicine.

515
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,310
I'll go and get her some plain congee.

516
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,430
All right.

517
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,160
Avoid meat and inflammatory foods
for the next few days.

518
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,000
All right.

519
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,630
Thank you very much.

520
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,320
It's a small matter.

521
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:13,920
Thank you.

522
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,160
Grandmother finally fell asleep.

523
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,110
Just because she's stable now
doesn't mean it'll last.

524
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,960
Her health is affected

525
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,640
by all the worries
she's been holding inside.

526
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,960
If the root cause isn't addressed,
she won't live long.

527
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,550
Grandmother has a heavy burden
in her heart.

528
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,070
She doesn't want to talk about it.

529
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,160
So I don't know how to help.

530
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,000
If she doesn't want to resolve it,
that's her choice.

531
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,480
Everyone has to face death eventually.

532
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,030
Just stay by her side and support her.

533
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,000
Did you glare at me

534
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,720
because you think I'm heartless

535
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,590
and cruel?

536
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,870
I just don't understand

537
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,480
why you treat life and death so lightly.

538
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,200
My father said I was born
without the ability to feel,

539
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,590
that I have little emotion.

540
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:06,350
I've never shed a single tear
since I was a child.

541
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,000
When I was four, he fell seriously ill.

542
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,510
So he gave me this telescope.

543
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,440
He said he would become a star.

544
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,310
So I would gaze at the stars
every night,

545
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,590
memorizing astronomy
and the calendar system.

546
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:20,750
But deep down,

547
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,040
I knew I would never find him

548
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,270
because a person will turn to dust
when they die.

549
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,520
Everyone dies.

550
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,030
Life leads to death,

551
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,160
and death marks the beginning
of life's cycle.

552
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,480
That's right.

553
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,240
What matters is how we live.

554
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,080
Little Zhuang Zhou,

555
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,230
how do you want to live your life?

556
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,480
I didn't think too much of it.

557
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,920
To live a full life

558
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,110
is rare enough.

559
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,270
(It's a luxury)

560
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,030
(for a person to live it well.)

561
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,110
If you still have the strength,
help those around you.

562
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,800
That would be enough.

563
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,030
Are you content with such a small wish?

564
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
So, have you decided not
to become a Buddhist monk?

565
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,510
I was sent to the temple
because I was weak when I was young.

566
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,680
There, I learned medicine
from the head monk.

567
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,030
A small physician heals
the body from illness.

568
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,240
A great physician heals the nation.

569
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,160
It would be interesting
to hold the position

570
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,510
of the Grand Secretary.

571
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,830
I've looked into the history

572
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,200
of the Grand Secretary
over the past three hundred years.

573
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,200
It takes decades of promotion
and hard work.

574
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,350
It'll take at least fifty years

575
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,030
to reach the second rank.

576
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,150
That takes too long.

577
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,080
So it's not worth it.

578
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,160
I need to find another way.

579
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,000
There's no shortcut
to becoming the Grand Secretary.

580
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,680
Unless you become a dishonest
or a traitorous official.

581
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,110
That could work, too.

582
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,480
It's more interesting talking to you.

583
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,520
When I return to the capital
after taking the imperial exam,

584
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,950
we can discuss it further.

585
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,240
Before you go to the capital,
I have one request.

586
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,960
I want to learn medicine from you.

587
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:05,200
Even though people
will always have to part,

588
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,270
I want to make

589
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,160
our time together last
as long as possible.

590
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:18,020
(Official Record of Medicine)

591
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,190
Not bad.

592
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,640
Ji and Ms. Longevity meet secretly
every day.

593
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,550
So they must have feelings
for each other now.

594
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,390
Do you want to bet on it?

595
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,030
Bring it on.

596
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,750
A chicken and a duck.

597
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,030
Such a perfect match.

598
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:48,870
Let's begin.

599
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,640
You did well dissecting
the chicken today.

600
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,000
But we should try it on a human body.

601
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,030
Let's go to the mass grave tonight.

602
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,190
All right.

603
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,510
How do you date at a mass grave?

604
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,760
I lost.

605
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,440
Ji Yong! Ji Yong, get up.

606
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,270
Ji Yong. Ji Yong.

607
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,110
Originally, I brought Ji Jianming
to the manor

608
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,240
as a potential prospect
for Ms. Longevity.

609
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,440
You're really wise.

610
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,350
They look perfectly matched.

611
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,310
One lacks emotion
and the other one is indifferent.

612
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,720
It's indeed a good match.

613
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,200
But too bad,
they have no feelings for each other

614
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,610
and are not fated to be together.

615
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,750
Remember to review the medical classics.

616
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,680
If you fall behind in your progress
when I return,

617
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,760
you will be punished with acupuncture.

618
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,080
All right.

619
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,240
But if you fail the exam,
you'll also get the same punishment.

620
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,480
But it's too easy not to fail the exam.

621
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,920
If I don't top the exam,
you can prick me however you want.

622
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,110
As for the nation's illness,

623
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,440
I've already checked the pulse
and made the diagnosis.

624
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:10,310
I've heard the higher the position,
the harder it is to retire.

625
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,920
Becoming a famous official
isn't necessarily interesting.

626
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,720
Corrupt officials are just a symptom.

627
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,550
The real problem lies in the system.

628
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,070
If we clean it up from the top down,

629
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,550
we could save a fortune.

630
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,480
Then the country's landscape
could be transformed.

631
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,040
Time for me to go now.

632
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,790
(He's talented and ambitious.)

633
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,000
(But why did he become a monk)

634
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,510
(in the dream?)

635
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,590
Oh, merciful Buddha.

636
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,358
(Ji Yong, Prodigious Monk)
(The scholar respects)

637
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,080
(Ji Yong, Prodigious Monk)
(the younger generation.)

638
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,590
(Who dares to challenge Confucius
in counting the stars?)

639
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,830
(Deal loyalty, treachery, gratitude,
and resentment lightly with a smile.)

640
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:53,960
(A perfect harmony
between nature and spirit.)

641
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,320
(Futing)

642
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,530
Patience, everyone will have some.

643
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:07,690
Bring more congee.

644
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,900
We can't keep up already. Hurry up.

645
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:26,880
♪The Grand Tutor tells me
the cause and reason♪

646
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,960
Duke of Ding is in Futing helping
with the disaster relief.

647
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,160
The government has run out of grain.

648
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,310
We shouldn't go out drinking these days.

649
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,160
What's there to be scared of?

650
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:42,160
No, Song Mo is like
a living King of Hell.

651
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:45,270
I've heard once he targets
someone for questioning,

652
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,960
- Did you take the money?
- (he always finds the evidence.)

653
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,030
No... No, I did not.

654
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,680
Whether they're royals, rich merchants,
or high-ranking officials,

655
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,350
he investigates them all.

656
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,280
Song Mo,

657
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,550
how dare you raid the Tang Family.

658
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,920
Do you know who's my older brother?

659
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,160
Do... Do you know who I am?

660
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,350
The eight magnates
of the Tang Family dominate

661
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,790
the salt trade,

662
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,960
mining, and water transport in Futing.

663
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,390
The entire Tang Family

664
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,480
won't let you off!

665
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,830
Who else?

666
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,800
How dare you!

667
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,110
Focus on your performance.

668
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,220
How dare a mere performer
like you step on a guest's table?

669
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,740
(Ding)

670
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,350
Ding Army?

671
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,040
General Song.

672
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,880
- General Song.
- General Song.

673
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,830
General Song, spare us.

674
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,880
General Song, have mercy.

675
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,160
I'll share half of the money with you.

676
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,510
Please let me go.

677
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,350
Sure.

678
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:01,270
I'll let you keep half
of your limbs and organs.

679
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,280
General, please check.

680
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,440
All the funds we embezzled are here.

681
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,960
This is enough
to keep your corpse whole.

682
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,510
If you do not wish to die,

683
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,360
tell me where you store
the grain reserves.

684
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,150
Duke of Ding, please reconsider carefully.

685
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:30,670
The emperor decreed
the crown prince to manage the relief.

686
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,360
While your intentions are good,

687
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:34,070
I cannot say anything

688
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,960
against the emperor's decree.

689
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,120
Eunuch Ding,

690
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:43,070
tens of thousands
of people are in danger.

691
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,840
We can't wait

692
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,800
for the royal family to come
from miles away to put up a show.

693
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,670
Do they know how many people die
from hunger every day?

694
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,440
I've already opened the treasury
and started the relief myself.

695
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,110
- Duke!
- Reply according to my words!

696
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,880
I will take the responsibility
if anything happens.

697
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,510
Marshal!

698
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,070
Deputy Marshal Song bought grain
from a neighboring county

699
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,480
with the confiscated bribe money

700
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,670
and sent it to the congee stall.

701
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,030
Well done, lad.

702
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,840
(Twilight in Spring)

703
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
I need to go and take a look.

704
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:16,700
Old Madam.

705
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,630
- Let me check it out. I'll be fine.
- You can't, Old Madam.

706
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,070
- It's pouring heavily. You can't go.
- The rain is so heavy.

707
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:20,910
Grandmother.

708
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,070
- Ms. Longevity.
- You're just starting to recover.

709
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,070
You can't be out in the rain.

710
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,590
- Quickly.
- I'm too restless to stay put.

711
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,280
It's raining so hard.

712
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:29,000
We've prepared the grain.

713
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,550
- We've fixed the foundation and roof.
- Hurry! Keep up!

714
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,400
But how can the structure withstand
such heavy rain?

715
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,360
These simple thatched houses
will definitely collapse.

716
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,760
Those tenants will be left homeless
without food.

717
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,150
Grandmother, don't worry.

718
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,320
- I'm preparing to repair the canal
- Hurry.

719
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,550
with the tenants and craftsmen
and send out the grain.

720
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:46,880
We'll make sure
the villagers are all right.

721
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,110
So stay here and distribute
the grains without worries.

722
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,440
Ms. Tuo, keep Grandmother company
and give the instructions together

723
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,030
and I'll take care of the rest.

724
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,190
- But...
- Fourth Young Lady, don't worry.

725
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,800
Ms. Longevity, you must be careful.

726
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,150
I'll be careful so don't worry.

727
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,710
Remember to be careful.

728
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,190
Wait your turn, no pushing.

729
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,630
No pushing! Back up!

730
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,840
- Line up!
- There's enough for everyone!

731
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,190
(Corruption and Abuse of Power)

732
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,110
Take turns! One at a time!

733
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:12,950
Don't drop it.

734
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,960
Next one.

735
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,400
Don't push. Everyone will have some.

736
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,440
One at a time!

737
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,320
I was here first. Give it to me!

738
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,070
Mister,

739
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,670
why is this hairpin made of white stone?

740
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,070
Doesn't it feel heavy
with the stone on his head?

741
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,840
Look.

742
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:40,230
It's no longer heavy
once we take it off.

743
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,030
No matter what it is made,

744
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,320
you can exchange this
for 30 jin of rice.

745
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,840
Then you and your parents
won't go hungry anymore.

746
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,430
Take it.

747
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,760
Thank you, mister.

748
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,480
The grain cart is here!

749
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,320
- The grain cart is here!
- The grain cart is here!

750
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,280
Be careful!

751
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,670
- Hurry!
- Watch it!

752
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:13,990
Watch out!

753
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,880
- Young Lady.
- Are you all right, Young Lady?

754
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,960
- Sir!
- Mister!

755
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,670
- Deputy Marshal!
- Sir! Sir!

756
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,670
- Sir!
- Sir! Sir!

757
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,550
- Sir! Sir!
- Mister!

758
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,320
Who are you?

759
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:03,840
Why are you here?

760
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,670
How come it's you?

761
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,670
We haven't met.

762
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,800
So you cannot die.

763
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,320
He's awake.

764
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,670
- He's finally awake.
- He's up.

765
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,510
He's up.

766
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,670
Luckily, you've awaken.

767
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,360
I'll let Marshal know.

768
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,800
Sir.

769
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:55,400
Three days ago, you suffered
a head injury from a hard object.

770
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,360
We've tried medicine,
herbal concoction, and acupuncture.

771
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,550
But you wouldn't wake up.

772
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:03,030
Fortunately,
the Marshal saw this item and lit it.

773
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,150
It had miraculous effects.

774
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,360
Sir, what kind of fragrance is this?

775
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,440
Benzoin.

776
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:30,480
They say Emperor Xuanzong couldn't sleep
after Imperial Consort Yang's demise.

777
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,800
His mind was in a state of confusion

778
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,320
and he could only fall asleep
with this fragrance

779
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,880
so he could dream of her.

780
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,160
Oh, I get it now.

781
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,920
Deputy Marshal dreamt of his sweetheart.

782
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,920
Can you keep quiet?

783
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,360
She saved my life.

784
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,550
Where's Marshal?

785
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:52,070
Marshal stayed by your bed
the whole night.

786
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,280
Before dawn,

787
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,110
he left to inspect
the newly repaired dikes.

788
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,030
The weather this year is truly strange.

789
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,440
Many places have been hit
by heavy rains.

790
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:02,480
Even the Tianjin sentry
and Zhending suffered too.

791
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,190
(Zhending.)

792
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,650
Here, it's not that hot anymore.

793
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:13,760
There are more if you still want some.

794
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,280
Have a bite.

795
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:18,660
Mother.

796
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,760
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.

797
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,280
- Mother.
- Eat slowly.

798
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:24,960
Have a bun.

799
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,510
Thank you, Miss.

800
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,510
Thank you.

801
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,710
- Eat it.
- Thank you.

802
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,440
Eat this bun.

803
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:34,910
Take it.

804
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:35,950
Thank you.

805
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:38,390
How are you feeling now?

806
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,600
Here you go.

807
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,230
- Distribute these to them.
- All right.

808
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,070
Thank you.

809
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,550
Thank you.

810
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,110
You'll be all right so don't worry.

811
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,180
(Half a Month Later)

812
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,400
I apologize for disturbing you so late.

813
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,230
My surname is Mei
and a merchant from the south.

814
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,670
We're passing through this area
and need a place to stay for the night.

815
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,030
Young Lady, you're up.

816
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,230
What's the hour now?

817
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,280
Just past three-quarters
after the Yin hour.

818
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,430
Young Lady,

819
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:13,110
a group of merchants arrived
at the manor.

820
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:15,030
The leader calls himself, Mr. Mei.

821
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:18,030
But I noticed everyone
in the group walks quietly,

822
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,070
with calloused palms.

823
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,400
Mr. Chen has sent people here
multiple times,

824
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:22,510
asking if you've woken up.

825
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,280
Bring Mr. Chen here.

826
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,800
They have surrounded the manor

827
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,880
and planned to wipe us out.

828
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,480
A hostage is your way to make a deal
that satisfies both sides.

829
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,320
Whether it will be a massacre
or making a deal,

830
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,480
is up to you to decide.

831
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,280
Fourth Young Lady,
you've been living far from the court.

832
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,320
