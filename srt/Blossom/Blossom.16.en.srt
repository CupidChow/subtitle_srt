1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,190
Wang Yingxue thinks
that she's intelligent.

2
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,369
That's why I have to
be one step ahead of her.

3
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,700
What the turtle shell shows
doesn't matter.

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,090
Most importantly,

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,110
we just need to cast doubts
in Wei Tingzhen's mind.

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,490
Wei Tingzhen was always paranoid.

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,759
Fourth Young Lady treats her nicely
out of the ordinary.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,239
She'll surely get to the bottom of it.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,209
So, what is she trying

10
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:27,790
to get to the bottom of?

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,959
That'll depend on the act

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,470
you two have to stage for me.

13
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:33,910
What?

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,239
Infertility?

15
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,449
Indeed.

16
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,980
That day, I inquired
about Dou Zhao's

17
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,449
condition from her maid as per your instructions.

18
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,769
They told me everything

19
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,449
after they got drunk.

20
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,390
Miss Dou looked pale last time.

21
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,089
Madam told me
to prepare some tonics

22
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,620
for her.

23
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,790
She has consumed countless tonics.

24
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,580
But they never worked.

25
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,420
No wonder

26
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,599
you smell of medicine.

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,809
I brew medicine

28
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,340
in the kitchen every day.

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,310
You do reek of medicine.

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,750
So, what kind of condition

31
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,529
is Miss Dou facing?

32
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,700
It's just...

33
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,950
Nanny, don't blame her.

34
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,260
She's spouting nonsense
now that she's drunk.

35
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,759
Fourth Young Lady is perfectly fine.

36
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,340
She brewed the medicine for me.

37
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,369
It's obvious that she was lying.

38
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,540
No one will fall for that.

39
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,369
I spent a lot of effort

40
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,039
to tail them until the fifth watch.

41
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,569
Then, I saw those two lasses

42
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,479
bury a white sack

43
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,780
under the tree.

44
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,009
I brought it back
and inquired a herb expert.

45
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,199
They said the doses are high.

46
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,369
It must've been used

47
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,700
on a woman who's infertile.

48
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,959
Madam,

49
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,670
you didn't see it for yourself,

50
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,870
but the tree was scorched.

51
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,679
It's no wonder one of them
were acting sneakily

52
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,110
while the other changed her attitude.

53
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,089
So, they knew that Dou Zhao
was infertile.

54
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,830
They wish to marry her into our family
in case nobody wants her.

55
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,670
That Wang Yingxue,

56
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,140
how dare she disrespect
the forces of nature?

57
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,110
Send the Dou Family a letter.

58
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,660
Tell them to halt
the engagement for now.

59
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,780
Since Dou Zhao is sick,

60
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,750
the wedding date should be reconsidered.

61
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,900
Let us see

62
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,330
who it is that cannot afford the delay.

63
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,609
(The wedding date can be reconsidered.)

64
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,990
(Wei Tingzhen,
Duke of Jining's Residence)

65
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,599
Madam, please be appeased.

66
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,030
That Wei Tingzhen,

67
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,710
what exactly is she up to?

68
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,180
Extend your hand.

69
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,430
What did Dou Zhao tell you?

70
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,990
It's not her fault.

71
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,550
I was the one who did something
that I wasn't supposed to.

72
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,750
You useless fool!

73
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,199
Duke of Jining has already advanced

74
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,969
their stipend ten years into the future.

75
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,569
Out of ten businesses,
nine of them incur losses.

76
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,860
With Wei Tingyu's ability,

77
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,190
do you think he's able to
repay his debt in this lifetime?

78
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,199
I'm marrying Dou Zhao off

79
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,820
to make her suffer from Wei Tingzhen.

80
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,930
The Duke of Jing's Residence

81
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,009
send out abused maidservants
every month, you know?

82
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,620
Do you think it's a joke?

83
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,689
I'm sure that Wei Tingyu tempted her.

84
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,249
Ming has little knowledge of the world
as she was raised here.

85
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,820
That's why she was duped.

86
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,759
Fifth Young Lady,

87
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,030
apologize now.

88
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,190
Mother, I know my fault now.

89
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,270
Do you truly know your fault?

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,810
Or did you say so
because of the punishment?

91
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,019
Mother,

92
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,530
actually, His Lordship and I are...

93
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,759
I'll tell you this.

94
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,220
It's impossible between you two!

95
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,500
Mother!

96
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,249
Seventh Master was always
concerned about Young Lady.

97
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,919
Fifth Master is the key here.

98
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,500
It takes two to tango.

99
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,900
Now, the Wei Family is the one
refusing the marriage.

100
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,030
Fifth Uncle must
be acting drunk as usual.

101
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,710
But Dou Ming is quite pitiful.

102
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,430
Wang Yingxue has discovered
her relationship with Wei Tingyu.

103
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,870
I assume she would be severely punished.

104
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,350
Offer me some ice cream,

105
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,870
and I'll avert the disasters
on your behalf.

106
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,230
Ji Jianming,

107
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,500
stop fooling around.

108
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,580
What are you doing in the Capital?

109
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:34,839
After the horse market was opened,

110
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,510
all those foolish people
who want to fawn

111
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,489
on us flocked to us in large groups.

112
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,350
Naturally, I won't make friends
with them.

113
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,009
Therefore, Lord Qing
sent me back to the Capital

114
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,150
to report for duty.

115
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,249
Polygonum multiflorum
and Rehmannia glutinosa?

116
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,700
These are included in the prescription
for infertile women.

117
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,510
Are you pretending to be infertile?

118
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,700
When you stage an act,
you have to prepare the full show.

119
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,369
Wei Tingzhen will only steel her resolve

120
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,400
upon seeing the medicinal dregs.

121
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,960
No wonder Seventh Uncle said
that the marriage was delayed again

122
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,759
on our way back.

123
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,450
But why did you go through all the trouble?

124
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,929
You can tell me anytime
that you want to cancel the wedding.

125
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,870
I have plenty of fast-acting methods.

126
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,990
I'm good at getting rid
of bad luck in love.

127
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,750
Family affairs are different
from state affairs.

128
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,249
If we do it quick,

129
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,839
other people might be implicated.

130
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,089
And, the Wei Family is already

131
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,150
looking for an excuse
to cancel the wedding.

132
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,279
You better not do anything stupid.

133
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,700
I don't need your help.

134
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,030
I'll definitely help you.

in the Capital!

Your Highness,
what do you think about it?

143
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,550
He's able to entertain
Your Highness and Your Lordship today.

144
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,810
He's very blessed.

145
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,399
Excellent.

146
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,990
I never expected that the once
handsome young general

147
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,790
is now obsessed with the play here.

148
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,670
Your Highness, you may not know,

149
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,889
ever since His Lordship
purchased Guanghe Tower,

150
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,910
plays were held every day.

151
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,310
Your Highness, what kinds
of plays do you like?

152
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,870
Please don't stand on ceremony.

153
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,380
Such audacity!

154
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,830
Your Highness,

155
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,199
The actors here

156
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,399
are all spoiled by me.

157
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,820
Please don't scare them.

158
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,480
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

159
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,990
You're still in the mourning period.
The entire court disapproves of you.

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,060
What nonsense are you doing right now?

161
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,609
His Majesty already spared me
from the mourning period.

162
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,060
I have to obey his order.

163
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,580
Besides, loyalty to the ruler
is the biggest part of filial piety.

164
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,190
Excellent!

165
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,670
I know you're laying low on purpose.

166
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,439
You pretend to indulge
in worldly pleasures.

167
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,220
In reality, you want people
to forget about your grudge

168
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,470
and hatred.

169
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,100
If you wish to investigate

170
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,270
Duke of Ying's case,

171
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,510
I might be able to help you out.

(Exquisite Melodies)

Uncle was killed by the pirates.

174
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,970
His Majesty has already closed the case.

175
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:04,130
Your Highness, could it be
that you have doubts about the case?

176
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,389
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

177
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,770
What about your father's plot
against you?

178
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,570
Do you plan to let him off?

179
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,370
We're family. Why would he set me up?

180
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,269
To put it bluntly,

181
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,949
he's my father.

182
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,199
What can I do?

183
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,829
At most, I can only manage

184
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,930
the heirs and soldier ruffians
on the training ground.

185
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,410
And,

186
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:35,330
this paradise.

187
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,099
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

188
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,810
It's a waste of your talent.

189
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,050
Your Highness, I guess I should
serve you with my abilities.

190
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,650
It's inconvenient
to do this in the palace.

191
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,050
Your Highness,

192
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,229
I'll reserve some actors
for you in secret.

193
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,170
What do you take me for?

194
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,639
Earl of Yunyang and Princess Jingyu
value you highly, you know?

195
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,090
They must've been blind!

196
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,890
Your Highness, please come again.

197
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,930
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

198
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,000
Your Lordship, this is a brilliant idea.

199
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,920
The officials in the Capital
love watching plays

200
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,940
regardless of their ranks.

201
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,580
We disguise ourselves
as a theater troupe

202
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,930
to hide our tracks so that it's easier
to gather intel.

203
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,570
Your Lordship, it's easier for us
to discuss things here too.

204
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,090
However, all of you have to
let your martial arts go to waste

205
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,570
and hide your identities.

206
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,930
Sorry about this.

207
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,810
Your Lordship, it's nothing.

208
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,450
His Highness
visited us incognito to test us.

209
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,770
He brought up the past on purpose

210
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,930
not only to win you to his side.

211
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,600
Your Lordship, during today's performance,

212
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,709
the person in charge of hosting
the station officers

213
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,350
have procured new leads unexpectedly.

214
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,269
This person spoke with certainty
after drinking,

215
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,990
claiming that the general had written
a letter

216
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,850
to your mother
before he entered the Capital.

217
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,370
No one noticed it since it wasn't sent
through the military post.

218
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,363
I've checked the letters
in the residence

219
00:11:06,364 --> 00:11:07,730
after the fall of my family.

220
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,210
Uncle didn't write us any letters.

221
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,930
The letter vanished
upon arriving in the Capital.

222
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,530
Even the person who delivered the letter
is nowhere to be seen.

223
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,490
The Capital's station officer

224
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,160
is the crown princess's cousin.

225
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,490
Send someone to notify Chen Jia.

226
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,580
Tell him to investigate the case and keep
a close eye on the Eastern Palace.

227
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,429
Get acquainted
with His Highness's subjects,

228
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,670
including his inner household.

229
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,330
Yes, Your Lordship.

230
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:40,330
(Lu's Dental Shop)

231
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,959
(Su Yan, Rite Official)

232
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,490
This is a 30-year-old Jinyin Wine.

233
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,270
So,

234
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,170
are you sure that the letter
Duke of Ding wrote to his family

235
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,580
will pose no threat to us?

236
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,530
Both Duke of Ding and the Ding Army
are already gone.

237
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,269
It's just a letter to his family.

238
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,490
What can it do?

239
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,450
I wonder what
that rebellious son of mine

240
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,690
will do now.

241
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:05,770
Could it be that Mother's death

242
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,970
is related to Uncle?

243
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:11,290
Being convicted, assassinated,

244
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,210
dying from illness, fall of the family,

245
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,610
all of these events
occurred one after another.

246
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,749
Not only must it be carefully examined,

247
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,890
layer by layer,

248
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,660
but it also requires
patience and endurance.

249
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,010
Just like what
Fourth Young Lady Dou had said,

250
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,890
we have to plan this through.

251
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:31,989
Your Lordship!

252
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,130
There's a situation outside.

253
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,090
Where?

254
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,509
Wei, you created this painting
through exquisite brushwork

255
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,690
and clever use of ink.

256
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,450
You're truly talented.

257
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,239
Jianming,

258
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,900
we should've known each other earlier.

259
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,899
Your praise touches my heart deeply.

260
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,650
Come. Let's have a toast.

261
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,690
Come.

262
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,450
Jianming,

263
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,090
I'm deeply troubled.

264
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,069
One can drown their sorrows with liquor.

265
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:08,989
Tingyu,

266
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,930
everything will be better
after you wake up.

267
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,370
Come. Over here.

268
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,219
Come.

269
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,750
Jianming.

270
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,010
Since when were they this close?

271
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:25,949
Your Lordship,

272
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,109
I saw Fifth Young Lady Dou

273
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,390
entering Guanghe Tower just now.

274
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,690
Dou Ming?

275
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,469
That's the room.

276
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,610
Thank you.

277
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,250
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

278
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,650
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

279
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,870
Someone.

280
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,970
Get me some water.

281
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,010
Ming?

282
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,250
Am I dreaming?

283
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,930
Ming, you...

284
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,850
What are you doing here?

285
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,109
What exactly are you up to?

286
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,520
Ji Jianming said with certainty

287
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,460
that you wanted to see me
for an urgent matter.

288
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,850
I rushed here after changing
into my maid's clothes.

289
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,749
In the end, you were totally drunk.

290
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,490
I wanted to get you
a bowl of hangover soup,

291
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,310
but the door was locked!

292
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,290
You're despicable!

293
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,490
I...

294
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,949
Something's off.

295
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:11,890
Ji Yong was the one
who wanted to drink with me.

296
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,530
Although I mentioned you
in front of him,

297
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,210
I didn't tell him to invite you.

298
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,370
This won't do.

299
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,170
I have to clarify things with Ji Yong.

300
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,810
Ji Yong!

301
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,989
Open the door!

302
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,450
I've tried everything.

303
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,050
It's locked from the outside.

304
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,530
There's no way to unlock it.

305
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,530
This is...

306
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,530
Ming, I...

307
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,810
I have no such intentions.

308
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,170
Although I'm playful,

309
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,690
I would never resort
to such ploys and tricks.

310
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,890
Moreover,

311
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,450
you're my beloved.

312
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,300
I...

313
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,370
But there's no way
we can explain ourselves

314
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,650
after spending the night here together.

315
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,850
Who would open the door for us tomorrow?

316
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,170
What will this rumor turn into
the day after tomorrow?

317
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,050
The criticisms will drown me alive!

318
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,299
Sister, Father, Mother, and Grandfather,

319
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,900
all of them will be implicated.

320
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,890
Why don't I just die right now?

321
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,269
Ming!

322
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,410
Don't do that!

323
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:23,250
You risked everything to come here
because of me.

324
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,090
If you cherish your reputation,

325
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,690
I shall take my life together with you.

326
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,909
Don't do it!

327
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:34,760
Don't do this!

328
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:35,869
You have a noble identity.

329
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,180
You don't need to do this for me.

330
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,829
Ming,

331
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:38,969
I swore a vow before.

332
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,450
You're the only woman I'll marry.

333
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,970
Even if our parents are
separating us by force

334
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,620
and that we aren't predestined
to be together,

335
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,490
I wouldn't abandon you

336
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,010
even if that means
we have to die together.

337
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,530
Our parents gave birth to us.

338
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,570
This is the command
of our parents that we have to follow.

339
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,810
With our hair tied, we swear a vow.

340
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,330
We shall not let each other down.

341
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,370
Now, we don't even fear death.

342
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,530
Why should we fear our feelings?

343
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,690
It's a success.

344
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,709
It's you again?

345
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,789
Did I offend you?

346
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,639
Have you considered

347
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,850
Dou Zhao's feelings and circumstances
when you did so?

348
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,230
Ordinary people can only
perceive what has happened,

349
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,069
not what is to come.

350
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,370
I'm helping Dou Zhao out.

351
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,770
You...

352
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,450
It's all my fault.

353
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,469
Harm me if you wish.

354
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,610
Do not touch her.

355
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,279
(Duke of Jining's Residence)

356
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,450
- Your Lordship.
- I'm fine.

357
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,309
- Lu Ming, shut the door.
- Yes, sir.

358
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,130
- Do not let anyone enter or exit.
- Yes, sir.

359
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,189
Tingyu!

360
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:33,909
Why did they beat you up?

361
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,989
Song Mo, Tingyu has already relieved himself
of the Imperial Guard's duty.

362
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,639
What gives you the right to hit him?

363
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,069
Tingzhen, it's all my fault.

364
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,989
You better mind your words
and your servants'.

365
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,700
His Lordship got lost
in the middle of the night.

366
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,130
He fell by accident.

367
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,410
I sent him back out of kind intentions.

368
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:50,730
That's the only statement
you should reveal to the public.

369
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,930
If a single word of this gets out,

370
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,450
I'll come back and cut off your tongue.

371
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,370
Understood.

372
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,770
What exactly is going on?

373
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,269
You...

374
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,349
- Tingzhen.
- You...

375
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,770
I cannot marry Dou Zhao.

376
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,589
Tingzhen, please allow me
to marry Dou Ming.

377
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:22,730
You!

378
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,450
Wang Yingxue.

379
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,450
You vicious wretch!

380
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,770
Since your eldest daughter
couldn't marry into the family,

381
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,170
you set up my son to make him
marry your second daughter!

382
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,970
Now, you've become
a parasite of the Wei Family!

383
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,389
(Duke of Jining's Residence)
Your Lordship,

384
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,669
he's indeed a playboy

385
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,290
who's greedy and lustful.

386
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,389
Why don't we take advantage
of the situation?

387
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,530
Wei Tingyu is a scoundrel indeed.

388
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,050
However, his engagement
with Dou Zhao hasn't been canceled yet.

389
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,970
If news of this gets out,

390
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,690
she'll be mocked and ridiculed

391
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,290
for the rest of her life.

392
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,330
What happened to the Wu family
was the perfect example.

393
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,810
But if we send Wei Tingyu back,

394
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,389
doesn't that mean Fourth Young Lady Dou
has to be married to him?

395
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,530
He can try it if he dares.

396
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,850
I need to escort His Majesty
to the western mountains in a few days.

397
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,970
I need to come up with a solution.

398
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,210
(Universal Compassion)

399
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,410
Mother,

400
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,669
I don't wish to go.

401
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,570
- I'm not going to the temple!
- Just go!

402
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,069
(Wanfo Temple)
Go!

403
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,570
I'm not going!

404
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,370
- Just go!
- Enough. Stop messing around.

405
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,990
You can live in the temple
for a few days first.

406
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,050
If other people ask about you,
say that you're on a retreat.

407
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,860
As for the incident in Guanghe Tower,

408
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,290
treat it as if it never took place.

409
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,690
Mother,

410
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,039
although His Lordship
and I did nothing, I...

411
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,450
Shut up! Even if
you're not embarrassed, I am!

412
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,690
I've already sent our men
to Duke of Jining's Residence.

413
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,270
I'm urging the Wei Family
to decide on the wedding date.

414
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,050
For the sake of the three families,

415
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,350
Dou Zhao

416
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:55,250
must be married to him.

417
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,490
Mother,

418
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,020
I've always been

419
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,010
leading a cautious life since young.

420
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,170
I endured everything I could.

421
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,750
Not this time.

422
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,330
His Lordship and I have already
sworn a vow with our hair.

423
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,189
Mother, I wish to act
without hesitations,

424
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,530
just like how you got married
to Father bravely.

425
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,370
Child, how could you be so silly?

426
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,970
Men

427
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,859
only cherish the things

428
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,250
that are difficult to get.

429
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:26,850
Back then, I got married to him
out of impulse and passion.

430
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,069
Now, only desolateness awaits me.

431
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:32,109
All these years of estranged marriage
and the incidents in the residence,

432
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,869
weren't they clear enough
for you to see?

433
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,010
Why are you trying
to follow in my footsteps?

434
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,570
Mother,

435
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,050
since young,

436
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,890
you forced me to learn
how to write, draw, and obey the rules.

437
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,490
Was it because it'd help me
obtain happiness?

438
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,880
Or was it because it'd help me
to marry into a noble family

439
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,770
so that I could
bring glory to the family?

440
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,330
What did you say?

441
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,770
You made me embroider
all those landscape paintings

442
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,790
and gifted them to people
all across the Capital!

443
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,210
But you only criticize me
for the mistakes I made.

444
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,330
To you, I am never good enough!

445
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,530
Only this time, only Wei Tingyu,

446
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,970
he could see the wounds on my hand.

447
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,149
He would tell me that I did great!

448
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,170
I don't need to suffer anymore!

449
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:14,970
I've raised you for over a decade!

450
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:18,050
Now, you're infatuated with Wei Tingyu
all because of his fancy words?

451
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,450
I'll tell you one last thing.

452
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:26,530
One's fondness won't last forever.

453
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,250
It'll fade away eventually.

454
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:31,650
The only thing that can
ensure your future

455
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,690
is a man's future

456
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,970
and money!

457
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,589
(Wanfo Temple)
Mother!

458
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,090
Mother, I beg you!

459
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,290
Mother, I don't want to go!

460
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,850
Mother!

461
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,770
You'll wake up from your dream

462
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,850
once your sister gets married.

463
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,130
Take her inside!

464
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,349
- Let's go.
- Mother!

465
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,229
- Ming.
- Mother!

466
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,400
- Ming, let's go!
- Let's go!

467
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,789
Mother, don't send me there!

468
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,789
Ming, let's go.

469
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,669
- Mother!
- Let's go!

470
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:57,109
Mother, don't send me there!

471
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,330
Mother!

472
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,410
Mother, I don't want to go!

473
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,829
(Wanfo Temple)
Mother!

474
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,210
Mother!

475
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,970
Madam.

476
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,890
You're here. Have a seat.

477
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,850
Duchess of Ying,

478
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,069
I came here again

479
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:34,090
to re-discuss the marriage
of our children.

480
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,570
The tea

481
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,410
may smell nice,

482
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:45,010
but it's tasteless.

483
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:48,610
Could it be that someone
has pulled a switcheroo?

484
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,690
Madam, please practice wise judgment.

485
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,930
I'm sure it wasn't us.

486
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,530
I assume it was an outsider.

487
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,869
Madam,

488
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,949
I came here

489
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,469
to clarify
the misunderstanding with you.

490
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,610
Misunderstanding?

491
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:02,529
Don't think

492
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,890
that I don't know what you did.

493
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,720
The Dou Family seems to have latched
onto our family, huh?

494
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,829
Your eldest daughter failed.

495
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,950
And now, you're asking
your second daughter to do so.

496
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,759
Listen.

497
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,930
The Wei Family isn't that gullible.

498
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,170
Madam,

499
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,810
please be appeased.

500
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,490
I came here to tell you this.

501
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,850
Dou Zhao is not only virtuous.

502
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,730
She's also very wealthy.

503
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,909
By then, you'll enjoy a luxurious life.

504
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,210
Think about it.

505
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,909
Once she marries into your family,

506
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:32,170
you can take over

507
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,370
all of her assets and wealth.

508
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,490
As for Zhao's body,

509
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:45,330
with enough time and careful nurturing,

510
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,610
it'll definitely recover.

511
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,930
You should try it again.

512
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,610
I've already picked a date.

513
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,010
Ten days from on is an auspicious day.

514
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:09,810
Ruin one's reputation
so that you can reap the benefit, huh?

515
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,050
You think you're the smartest man
in the world, huh?

516
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,869
To think that you were educated.

517
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,370
How dare you act so arrogantly?

518
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,210
You act without thinking of the others.

519
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,900
Luckily, it didn't blow
out of proportion.

520
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,650
Do you think Dou Ming can stay alive
if everyone knows it?

521
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,050
If you keep worrying about everything,

522
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,990
then you deserve
to bear the grievances yourself.

523
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,669
Do you think I need to stoop that low

524
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,549
if you're willing to marry Wei Tingyu?

525
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,290
It's true that I'm not willing
to marry him.

526
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,690
But I have a thorough plan.

527
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,789
I was one step away
from achieving success.

528
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,050
But you insisted on interfering!

529
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,900
All your methods are either feigning
sickness or pretending to be dead.

530
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:40,250
You call that a thorough plan?

531
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,389
At least I didn't harm people

532
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,650
because of my selfish desires.

533
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:47,610
How is what you're doing any different
from Wang Yingxue back then?

534
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,750
How dare you compare me
with Wang Yingxue?

535
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,280
My method yields immediate results.

536
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,610
If you're willing to cancel,

537
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,620
it doesn't matter even if Dou Ming and
Wei Tingyu have to suffer criticisms.

538
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,549
It's Song Mo didn't meddle in,

539
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,709
they'll thank me

540
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:00,090
with wedding sweets.

541
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,970
I did it for your sake, you know?

542
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,490
Luckily, Song Mo was there.

543
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,190
If not, the entire Dou Family
would've been done for.

544
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,690
You said you did it for my sake.

545
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,009
But have you ever considered
what I desired?

546
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,690
It's pointless
no matter what you desire.

547
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,250
If you do get married to Wei Tingyu,

548
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,749
they'll still do the same thing

549
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,050
under your nose, you know?

550
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,050
Don't worry.

551
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,210
The physician said

552
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,930
she doesn't have much time left.

553
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,970
Once she's dead,
and the mourning period is over,

554
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,130
I'll marry you.

555
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,989
I'm just helping the fruits on the tree

556
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,330
to ripen faster.

557
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,870
If you don't get away from Wei Tingyu,

558
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,530
you'll definitely suffer in the future.

559
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,290
I just don't want you

560
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,770
to shed tears in the future.

561
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,930
That's right.

562
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,810
Everything you said was right.

563
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:49,970
But I don't want to hear them.

564
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,109
I'm too petty!

565
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,690
I can't tolerate your demeanor!

566
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,829
I don't wish to get involved

567
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:57,990
with a despicable person like you who
tries to ruin other people's reputations!

568
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,170
From now on,

569
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,629
you and I

570
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,930
will go our separate ways.

571
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,650
Fine, Dou Zhao.

572
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,490
You better don't come to me
when you get into trouble in the future!

573
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,370
We just brought
Fifth Young Lady back not long ago.

574
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,210
The moment
I took my eyes off her, she...

575
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,850
Ming!

576
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:36,730
Ming!

577
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,850
Keep your mouth shut.

578
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,090
Thank goodness!

579
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,570
Hurry, get her some tea.

580
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,770
Yes, Madam.

581
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,730
Ming, are you okay?

582
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,050
Mother,

583
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,010
I'm an unfilial girl.

584
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,309
Just let me die.

585
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,450
No!

586
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,530
No!

587
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,220
Silly girl,

588
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,890
in this world,

589
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,130
there's no man
worth sacrificing your life for,

590
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,370
not to mention a man like Wei Tingyu!

591
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,330
Maybe he's not good enough.

592
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,269
But...

593
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,850
But one man's meat

594
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,170
is another man's poison.

595
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,850
We had already sworn an oath

596
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,770
when we made our lifetime commitment.

597
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,690
If we cannot grow old together,

598
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,190
we shall accompany each other
in the afterlife.

599
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,450
No!

600
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,490
No!

601
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,549
(Western Mountain Palace)

602
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,250
Song Mo, there are about six routes
that can take us to this place.

603
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,900
(Wealth and Luxury)
You took a detour on purpose

604
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:50,749
so that I could see

605
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,730
the lands under
Duke of Jining's rule are barren,

606
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,090
and the common people
are chewing on tree bark to survive.

607
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,870
You were targeting
Duke of Jining's Residence all along.

608
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,090
Such audacity.

609
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,050
How dare you abuse your power?

610
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:07,210
Indeed. I was selfish
for changing the route.

611
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,949
But Your Majesty, as you can see,

612
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,610
Duchess of Jing forcibly requisitioned
the harvest from that area

613
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,450
to arrange Duke of Jining's marriage.

614
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,669
Now, the farmers

615
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,570
don't even have rice seeds
to sow during spring.

616
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:17,890
That's a fact.

617
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,570
It's not something I've fabricated.

618
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:23,370
The imperial family extorts the people
whenever there's a joyous occasion.

619
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,950
This trend, if encouraged,

620
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,090
will surely be copied by nobles
in other regions.

621
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,450
The people's resentment
will be harder to resolve.

622
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,580
Your Majesty,
please practice wise judgment.

623
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:33,589
Wei Tingyu, relying on
his hereditary annual stipend,

624
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,410
has achieved no notable accomplishments
over the years.

625
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,290
He did all kinds
of ridiculous things instead.

626
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,950
He's not worthy of the winner
of the Ladies' Etiquette Contest.

627
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,610
You know clearly

628
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:46,690
that I intend to grant you
and Jingyu a marriage.

629
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,210
Don't tell me you intend
to marry Dou Zhao?

630
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,949
The betrothal letters of the two
have been exchanged.

631
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,789
I won't allow you to do what you want.

632
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,930
If you intend to kneel,

633
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,730
you can kneel here.

634
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,930
Dou Zhao had no choice but to do so.

635
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,060
She tried to cancel the marriage
several times but to no avail.

636
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,869
I've almost lost all the people

637
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,750
I have wanted to protect
and save in my life.

638
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,970
This is the only wish I have.

639
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:12,050
It's harmless to the imperial family
and to others.

640
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,690
I only wish that the person I care about

641
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,890
can have her wish fulfilled
just this once.

642
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:38,620
By then, when the palanquin
crosses the bridge,

643
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,450
I'll use this to burn it down.

644
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,810
By then, you guys can push
the palanquin into the lake.

645
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,330
I shall escape by swimming.

646
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:49,530
It's covered with fragments of flint.

647
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,970
And you need to jump into the lake
and escape by swimming.

648
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:55,610
This is indeed a risky plan.

649
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,029
Fourth Young Lady,

650
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:59,850
why can't you just seek
Old Madam Cui's help?

651
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:02,250
Grandmother is old now.

652
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,690
And, she's often sick as well.

653
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,330
I don't want her
to worry about me anymore.

654
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,930
Miss.

655
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,000
Wang Yingxue instructed several nannies

656
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:17,990
to purchase the wedding gown
and accessories a few days ago.

657
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,170
Anyway, the marriage won't take place.

658
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,029
She can act as
the female head of the family

659
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:23,909
all she likes.

660
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,069
I heard

661
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,189
that Wang Yingxue hired the best tailor

662
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:28,650
to make another wedding gown.

663
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,170
It wasn't your size.

664
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,130
Ever since the founding of our nation,

665
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,010
women

666
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,130
could only wear this crown

667
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,170
during their wedding.

668
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:49,330
I've never worn it before.

669
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,970
I hope that you can wear it tomorrow

670
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,770
so that you can lead
a smooth and peaceful life.

671
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:05,770
Mother,

672
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,970
are you sure you want me
to replace Zhao?

673
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,450
Ming,

674
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,890
you're my flesh and blood.

675
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,530
You're a part of me.

676
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,370
How can I bear to see you die?

677
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,850
Mother.

678
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,410
Dou Ming's voice sounded strange.

679
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,990
I assume she inflicted injury
upon herself as resistance.

680
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,170
Wang Yingxue is helpless

681
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:55,170
because she's her biological child.

682
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,429
That's great.

683
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,530
Miss, you don't need
to take the risk too.

684
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,669
But Miss,

685
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,970
you don't seem happy about it.

686
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,210
I'm doing everything I can
to cancel the wedding.

687
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,330
But she's doing everything she can
to get married to her beloved.

688
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,450
Both of us are fighting
for our own futures.

689
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:16,130
It's just that Duke of Jining's family

690
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,930
is utterly rotten.

691
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:21,010
Wei Tingyu isn't someone
whom she can entrust herself to.

692
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,730
(Dou Ming hasn't harmed me
in this life.)

693
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,690
(I can't just stand idly by
as she falls to her demise.)

694
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,509
(Dou's Residence)

695
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:40,970
Congratulations.

696
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:43,570
His Lordship has arrived.

697
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,899
(Bless)
It's so grand.

698
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,040
- They're here.
- Congratulations, Your Lordship.

699
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:47,549
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations, Your Lordship.

700
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,210
Congratulations, Your Lordship.

701
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,410
Zhao.

702
00:35:11,621 --> 00:35:13,650
The ceremony
will take up the entire day.

703
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,850
I was afraid that you might starve.

704
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,730
I've brought you some food.

705
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,450
Su Lan,

706
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,810
you may leave first.

707
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,130
Yes.

708
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,450
This is the lotus seed
and lily bulb dessert.

709
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:42,770
It symbolizes a harmonious union
and a happy future.

710
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,389
I wish you happiness

711
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,690
and a smooth life ahead as well.

712
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,690
May you find the one you love.

713
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:00,159
Congratulations.

714
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,800
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

715
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,450
Ming hasn't recovered from her illness.

716
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,450
She's unable to attend
her sister's wedding.

717
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:08,970
What a shame.

718
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,450
Don't worry.

719
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,589
Later, I'll definitely
find a good husband

720
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,650
for Ming as well.

721
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,870
To think that I thought
she had something brilliant planned.

722
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,810
In the end, she still
got into the palanquin.

723
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,570
Wait!

724
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,730
From now on,

725
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,610
you must do well in life, okay?

726
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,450
Go now.

727
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,650
It's a facade, huh?

728
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,730
Mr. Ji, you're intelligent indeed.

729
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,909
I just wonder if that one

730
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,330
is intelligent enough to realize this.

731
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:09,770
(Duke of Jining's Residence)

732
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:16,530
(Duke of Jining's Residence)

733
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,170
Wait!

734
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,410
Your Lordship,

735
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,930
today's my wedding day.

736
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,690
What are you doing?

737
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,269
Dumb mantis, don't try anything stupid.

738
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,610
- Do you know that...
- I know.

739
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,770
That's not Dou Zhao.

740
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,050
Why are you stopping them, then?

741
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:52,850
I just found out not long ago.

742
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,890
I knew

743
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,810
she would never get married
to Wei Tingyu.

744
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,069
(Misty Beauty)
This is their wedding. What is he...

745
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,140
I heard that their families
had grudges against each other.

746
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,290
Is that so?

747
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,549
Why did they head inside?

748
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,970
I don't know what's going on.

749
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,930
All those couples who had
made a vow with their hair,

750
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,050
how many of them
truly had feelings for each other?

751
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:38,010
They just got married because
they had no choice.

752
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,650
Sad, sleepless, in the long night,

753
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:49,610
in separation, I think of you.

754
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,730
Alas, I cannot hold the moonlight
in my slender hand.

755
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:58,090
I go back into the room,
perhaps to dream again of reunion.

756
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,290
Ming?

757
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:18,050
It's you?

758
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,629
This is great.

759
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,170
How did the heavens send you to me?

760
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,450
This dessert is important
for this occasion.

761
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,370
There should be more of it.

762
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,610
Get me another bowl.

763
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:45,859
Zhao,

764
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,119
I'm too ashamed to face you.

765
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,840
I don't want it to be like this either.

766
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:52,970
Dou Ming,

767
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,770
one's marriage determines
a lifetime of happiness or sorrow.

768
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,130
You have to think twice.

769
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,650
Duke of Jining's Residence
is complicated and messy.

770
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,570
And, Wei Tingyu isn't a good man.

771
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:03,989
If you do get married to him,

772
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,490
you might have to manage
the residence for the rest of your life.

773
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,629
You might soon see through

774
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,450
Wei Tingyu's cowardice and weakness.

775
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,930
You might suffer a lot.

776
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,790
You two might even
fall out of love after this.

777
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,330
Have you thought of that?

778
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,690
If you change your mind now,

779
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,290
I can still do something about it.

780
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,730
Since young,

781
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,210
I always listened to Mother.

782
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:30,050
I wanted to be a daughter
who she can be proud of.

783
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,490
But no one was ever concerned about

784
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,250
what I was thinking

785
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,170
or what I liked.

786
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,650
Mr. Wei is the first person

787
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:45,010
to admire me wholeheartedly
and know me well.

788
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,770
I like him.

789
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,780
He's not a despicable person.

790
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,450
It's just that his elder sister
is suppressing him.

791
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,970
He went against his sister for my sake.

792
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,290
He's devoted to me

793
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,570
and trying his best.

794
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,850
I think people can change.

795
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,450
I'm changing.

796
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,890
His Lordship is changing too.

797
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,350
He has already dismissed the concubines
in the household for my sake.

798
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,450
Isn't it possible

799
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:14,789
that people will change for the better

800
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,450
after what they've experienced?

801
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,690
(Change, huh?)

802
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:22,730
This time,

803
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,770
I don't want to follow
other people's will.

804
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,690
I only wish to act according

805
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,330
to my heart.

806
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,250
If you've made up your mind
to get married,

807
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,410
I shall give you my blessings.

808
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,269
- This won't do.
- Hurry up.

809
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,890
We won't make it in time
when they're here.

810
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,509
- Hurry, take this.
- I'm scared.

811
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:42,770
- Hurry.
- No...

812
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:46,890
Zhao!

813
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:49,229
Are you okay? Was that too harsh?

814
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,610
You actually hit me for real?

815
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,810
Zhao, I'm sorry.

816
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,290
Be careful.

817
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,370
I've let Zhao down my entire life.

818
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:12,450
If a person only has
a limited number of blessings,

819
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:15,619

my remaining blessings.
