1
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:09,759
It's a good idea

2
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:12,519
but it's not your usual approach.

3
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,519
Which teacher taught you?

4
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:15,800
Tell me.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,679
It was

6
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:20,920
a female teacher.

7
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:22,399
A female teacher?

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:23,440
Who?

9
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:25,079
So, who?

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,359
Why aren't you answering?

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,399
So secretive.

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,359
Could it be your crush?

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:34,960
No more wild guesses.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,640
Tell me which family she is from.

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,240
I, Earl Yunyang, will go all out

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,075
to be the matchmaker.

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,840
Stop messing around.

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,719
My mother is still ill.

19
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,320
No nonsense in front of her.

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,640
But if you ask me,

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,759
don't you think

22
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,080
you're overthinking this case?

23
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,920
Your mother fell ill.

24
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,960
My aunt, the empress,
and my uncle, the emperor,

25
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,120
sent imperial physicians
to check on her.

26
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,600
They're just as concerned as always.

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,000
We have Official Wu
who is working to mediate things.

28
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,560
Honestly, I think His Majesty
might scold him a bit at most.

29
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,160
Duke of Ding won't be
in any serious trouble.

30
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:18,840
I hope so.

31
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,940
=Blossom=
(Adapted from the novel "Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

32
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,900
=Episode 6=

33
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,560
Official Wu, please wait.

34
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,200
I wasn't targeting you
in front of the emperor earlier.

35
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,760
It's just that the emperor asked,

36
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,719
I can only speak honestly.

37
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,400
Honestly, huh?

38
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,080
If it's for the court's stability,

39
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,199
then it's all good.

40
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,240
But this concerns major matters
in the southeast.

41
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,640
It seem not to be related
to the Ministry of Rites now, does it?

42
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,120
With the Dragon Boat Festival
approaching,

43
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:26,520
why don't you go home
and rest for a few days?

44
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,560
Since you've instructed me to do so,

45
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,080
I can only comply.

46
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:50,800
Mr. Wu,

47
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,240
is this Official Dou
from the Western Dou Family?

48
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,879
Yes.

49
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,200
His Majesty read officials'
memorials against the Duke,

50
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,439
then he asked
about Meisun's health instead.

51
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,080
That shows he's worried, doesn't it?

52
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,199
But Dou Shishu went on to say

53
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:08,120
that bringing the Duke of Ding back
under arrest

54
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:10,280
could destabilize the southeast.

55
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,479
Isn't that like accusing Meisun

56
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:15,240
of building up an army
to start a rebellion?

57
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,360
Does Dou Shishu have a grudge
against Uncle?

58
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,759
Dou Shishu has always been cautious
and low-profile,

59
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,000
especially before he was promoted
to the Ministry of Rites.

60
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,120
He has never crossed the line.

61
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:29,219
It turns out,
he's just been hiding his ambition

62
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:32,460
and coveting the vacant seats
of the Grand Secretariat.

63
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,960
If Uncle is painted
as a treacherous minister,

64
00:04:35,299 --> 00:04:37,120
then Dou Shishu
who calls for his removal

65
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:38,680
will naturally get the credit.

66
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,659
Take good care of your mother.

67
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:42,600
When Meisun arrives in the capital,

68
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,800
the Grand Secretariat will have ways
to deal with this.

69
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,760
Thank you, Mr. Wu.

70
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,539
Have you tried
the Dou Family's rice dumpling?

71
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,219
Rice dumplings?

72
00:04:57,099 --> 00:04:58,060
You must try it.

73
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,960
If that's the case,

74
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,360
then it must be Fourth Young Lady Dou

75
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,620
who tipped off her uncle.

76
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,219
That wicked woman.

77
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:12,060
Earlier, you praised her
for being sharp,

78
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,140
loyal, and kind.

79
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
I... I'm terrible at judging people.

80
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:20,240
If she's really targeting
the Duke of Ding,

81
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,500
the Shadow Guard
would have wiped out Tan's Manor.

82
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,299
But everything's fine over there,

83
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:25,700
and the child is well taken care of.

84
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:28,659
Also, General Yan is keeping
an eye on things.

85
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,380
That just makes it even stranger.

86
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:33,640
Fourth Young Lady Dou
has been living in seclusion.

87
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:35,580
How would she know
all these court affairs?

88
00:05:37,219 --> 00:05:38,560
There's also another possibility.

89
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:40,020
It's not just Dou Shishu.

90
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,779
The entire Dou Family may be her pawns.

91
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:45,520
She could be plotting
and manipulating people from afar.

92
00:05:46,299 --> 00:05:48,040
Then Young Lord has become her leverage

93
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,700
to control us.

94
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:51,580
If that's true,

95
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:52,859
it's hard to believe

96
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,760
someone as beautiful
as Fourth Young Lady Dou

97
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,179
could be so ruthless.

98
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,400
Uncle hasn't even arrived here yet,

99
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,720
and we've already crossed paths
with the Dou Family twice.

100
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:06,099
There's bound to be more conflict ahead.

101
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:08,900
We have to figure out

102
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,680
what they're really after.

103
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:17,539
Xingyi suffered a lot in the past

104
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:20,219
and ended up with rheumatism.

105
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,979
That's why I sent over
some mugwort medicinal oil.

106
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,659
It wasn't anything valuable.

107
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:28,700
But he returned it to me.

108
00:06:29,859 --> 00:06:30,779
We're in-laws

109
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,020
and serve the same court.

110
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,440
Yet, the way he avoids any association,

111
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,080
you'd think we were complete strangers.

112
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:41,779
Father only didn't want
to give anyone an excuse to find fault

113
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:43,539
and drag us into trouble.

114
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,480
The Ministry of Rites keeps you busy.

115
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,460
You rarely come home.

116
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,580
Yet you still worry
about Father's health.

117
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,320
I'm truly grateful, Fifth Brother.

118
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,299
No need to thank me.

119
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,020
We're family.

120
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,339
I came back during my leave

121
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,739
because there's something

122
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,560
I need to discuss with you and Shiying.

123
00:06:58,739 --> 00:06:59,140
Sit.

124
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,580
Ms. Longevity is 23 this year

125
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:05,900
and Ming has turned 16 this year, right?

126
00:07:06,299 --> 00:07:06,900
Yes.

127
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:08,779
If it were a boy,

128
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,160
he'd be preparing
for the imperial exams.

129
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:13,120
Not being able to leave an heir
for the Dou Family

130
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,539
and making you worry about its future,

131
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,520
it's my failure as a sister-in-law.

132
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:22,219
This entire household runs
because of you.

133
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,000
How could it be your fault?

134
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:25,940
If anyone's at fault, it's Shiying.

135
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,219
He may be an official.

136
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,240
But he's driven by a set of principles.

137
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,460
He's completely clueless
about the court's situation.

138
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,800
If the Dou Family wants
to set a strong foothold,

139
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:37,620
we can't do it alone.

140
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,500
If Ming and Mr. Wu Shan's marriage
works out,

141
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,260
the two families will be united

142
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,659
and support each other.

143
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,900
Honestly, they get along well.

144
00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:50,140
They're just a bit shy.

145
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,700
In that case,

146
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:54,240
invite Dezhen here
for the Dragon Boat Festival banquet.

147
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,700
As elders,
we should do our part to help.

148
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,739
All right, I'll send out
the invitation right away.

149
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,299
Also, the Marquis of Jining
was in a mourning period.

150
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,640
The three-year mourning period is over.

151
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,339
It's time
to address his and Ms. Longevity's

152
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:06,620
verbal engagement now.

153
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,739
You should send out the invitation
for that too.

154
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:10,820
I'll talk to Shiying about this.

155
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,179
All right.

156
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:16,179
The arrangement for Fifth Young Lady
and Mr. Wu Shan is a good thing.

157
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,500
But Dou Zhao's childhood engagement

158
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:20,219
had been long overdue.

159
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:21,520
Why does Fifth Master seem

160
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,179
to be interested in it again?

161
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,620
He is not on leave.

162
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,979
Father already sent word.

163
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,020
Fifth Brother made a mistake in court

164
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,820
and went against Official Wu.

165
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,100
He was forced to take leave.

166
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:36,179
Now,

167
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,260
he's depending
on his two nieces' marriages.

168
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,539
One is to aim for a powerful family.

169
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,260
The other one is for a noble official.

170
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,100
Isn't our Wang Family's connection

171
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,220
not enough?

172
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:49,059
My father is straightforward
and upright.

173
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,440
He always does what's right,
not just favoring family.

174
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:53,600
Now he wants a position
in the Grand Secretariat.

175
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,819
Father won't want
to get involved in this mess.

176
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,100
But if Dou Zhao
becomes Marchioness of Jining,

177
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:02,220
won't she overshadow you?

178
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:06,539
Wei Tingyu is famous for his extravagant
and careless lifestyle.

179
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,579
Even though his family
has held the title for generations,

180
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:11,059
they've spent all their wealth

181
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:13,380
on funeral expenses in recent years.

182
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,059
His sister, Wei Tingzhen,

183
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:18,340
married the Duke of Jing
as his second wife.

184
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:22,179
This whole family is driven by greed.

185
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,699
They might be useful allies.

186
00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:28,980
Be careful, Madam.

187
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:32,740
This butterfly loves
those silk tree flowers.

188
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,260
Once their scale powder touched
the skin,

189
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,900
the itch would be unbearable.

190
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,500
I'll have the servant take care

191
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,920
of all those butterflies right away.

192
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:44,140
But they're so beautiful.

193
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:46,040
Won't it be a pity to catch them all?

194
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:13,779
Have a drink, Your Lordship.

195
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,880
That's a wonderful painting.

196
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:26,120
It's nicely painted.

197
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,980
You're flattering me.

198
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,640
You paint very well, Your Lordship.

199
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,260
Your Ladyship,

200
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,699
it's truly an honor to have you here.

201
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,179
Where's the Marquis?

202
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:45,740
He...

203
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,579
Madam, wait.

204
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,059
Excuse me, ladies.

205
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,140
Madam, slowly.

206
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,100
Watch your steps.

207
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,980
Why don't you

208
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,459
let me inform the Marquis first?

209
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,860
Madam, please have mercy.

210
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,620
If you barged in like this,

211
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,260
the Marquis would beat me to death.

212
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:10,220
Then I'll beat you foolish woman
to death now!

213
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:12,100
Madam!

214
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,459
Wonderful.

215
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:16,299
Well painted.

216
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,340
Peijin.

217
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,699
Tingzhen?

218
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,860
Fourth Young Lady Dou?

219
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,260
Why her again?

220
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:33,100
I've heard something reliable.

221
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:35,080
(Wei Tingzhen, Duchess of Jing)
She's making

222
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,340
at least this much in Futing now.

223
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,419
But it's all just material stuff.

224
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:42,960
Didn't Seventh Master Dou send
a letter earlier

225
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,419
saying matters of marriage
should be left to fate?

226
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,860
Doesn't that mean it's all over?

227
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,860
Of course, not.

228
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,960
Now the Dou Family
is taking the initiative,

229
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,840
inviting us to join them
for the Festival outing.

230
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,600
These past few years,
there have been disasters everywhere,

231
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,140
and the harvest has been halved.

232
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:00,400
But the expenses
at the household haven't dropped at all.

233
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,419
Without anyone to help,

234
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,600
do you know how much it costs

235
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,600
to run the household?

236
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:06,500
I...

237
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,340
Just do as I say.

238
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:08,939
Once Father's mourning period is over,

239
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,960
we need to finalize
the marriage right away.

240
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,699
But Tingzhen...

241
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:13,640
The Dou Family's household
is in turmoil.

242
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:15,659
She also grew up in the countryside.

243
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,200
A young master who attended
their family's banquets said

244
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,920
she doesn't care about the differences
between men and women,

245
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,960
speaks disrespectfully,
and even argues with elders.

246
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,179
She's completely uncouth.

247
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,380
I was going to say

248
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,640
that Dou Zhao is famous for her beauty.

249
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,819
She's truly a stunning woman.

250
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,659
Perhaps she could catch your eye?

251
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,939
But since you seem
to dislike her so much,

252
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,939
I won't worry
about your marriage anymore.

253
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:46,260
Three.

254
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,659
Two...

255
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:48,860
Tingzhen,

256
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,620
I'm a Marquis after all.

257
00:12:55,059 --> 00:12:57,100
So I should be more open-minded.

258
00:12:58,179 --> 00:12:59,880
Since we've already accepted
the invitation,

259
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,140
it would be rude if we don't go.

260
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,419
How about this?

261
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,800
You can take charge of this.

262
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:11,860
What a pity, really.

263
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,260
One wrong stroke.

264
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:16,480
Such a shame
for this winter plum blossom painting.

265
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:17,539
Not at all.

266
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,440
It's a beautiful painting
of the winter plum blossom.

267
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,680
No, it's not a pity at all.

268
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,440
Everyone, please take a look.

269
00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:33,900
"Who could have known
the winter's snow would come late,

270
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,320
and a single winter plum blossom
would bloom out of the wall?"

271
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,699
That's brilliant!

272
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,419
Indeed.

273
00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:46,140
The tiger talisman
is something you can buy.

274
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:48,440
Wang Yingxue only wants you
and Dou Ming to embroider it

275
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,179
to torture your poor little fingers.

276
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:50,939
Exactly.

277
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,179
That's why

278
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,779
I made sure to stitch it
all crooked and uneven.

279
00:13:55,299 --> 00:13:56,100
In any case,

280
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,819
I should appear worse than Dou Ming.

281
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,520
Are you downplaying yourself?

282
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,500
Not entirely.

283
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:04,699
The real trouble is asking you
to handle the banquet.

284
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,040
Old Madam
and Seventh Master Dou finally managed

285
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
to ease things up a bit.

286
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,560
Now she's dragging a whole group
of people to join the festivities.

287
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,120
I'm worried
it'll cause some misunderstandings.

288
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,299
I don't think Wang Yingxue cares

289
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,059
about the festival at all.

290
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,299
She just wants to set up
a marriage for you and Dou Ming.

291
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,419
Young Lady,

292
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:23,579
we got news from Zhaowen Bookstore.

293
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,240
Wu Shan has been posted
as Assistant Director

294
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,500
of Court of Imperial Sacrifices.

295
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,819
I am fine with Wu Shan coming.

296
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,299
But after six years,

297
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:51,100
doesn't Wei Tingyu get the message?

298
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,480
Why is he still coming?

299
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,100
How shameless.

300
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:54,419
Precisely.

301
00:14:55,539 --> 00:14:56,500
The physician said

302
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,140
her days are numbered.

303
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,179
Once she's gone,

304
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,340
I will marry you.

305
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:05,640
Song Mo is arrogant
due to his achievements and favor.

306
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,059
He kidnapped and eloped
with Marchioness of Jining, Dou Zhao.

307
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,380
Execute them

308
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,900
to uphold the family law.

309
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:14,740
This needs to be settled.

310
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:16,880
I'll give him a proper welcome

311
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:19,380
if he dares to show up.

312
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:27,400
This way, please.

313
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,040
The scenery here is beautiful,

314
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,200
and the repairs are done well.

315
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,880
As expected from the Cui Clan of Ji'an.

316
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:36,779
Even a countryside manor
can have such elegance.

317
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:40,900
My mother-in-law doesn't like
the bustling city.

318
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:43,299
So she stays here to rest.

319
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:46,779
Over the years,
all thanks to Zhao's company

320
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,939
and her helping around the manor.

321
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:50,539
I bet she's busy attending

322
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:52,579
to my mother-in-law's afternoon nap now.

323
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,620
I hope you won't mind

324
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,480
she couldn't welcome you personally.

325
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,980
Zhao is gentle, and virtuous,

326
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,360
and manages our household perfectly.

327
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,260
Everyone who meets her

328
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,179
has nothing but praise.

329
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:05,020
Even her sisters

330
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,579
are all kind and graceful,

331
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,419
smart and composed.

332
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,819
Oh, hello Uncle.

333
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:19,939
Ru,

334
00:16:20,539 --> 00:16:21,260
what are you doing?

335
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,340
I'll catch some more

336
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:24,100
to add an extra dish
for tonight's banquet.

337
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:24,779
Come on.

338
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:27,900
I...

339
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,539
Sorry about that.

340
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:31,340
Ru takes

341
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,140
after her father.

342
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:34,380
She's a bit too lively.

343
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,419
Come this way, please.

344
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:37,659
Please come this way.

345
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:39,020
Mr. Wu, this way.

346
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,140
Aside from Ru,

347
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,419
who's a bit energetic,

348
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,579
the rest of the ladies
are all very quiet and graceful.

349
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:46,100
I win!

350
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:47,819
You lose again.

351
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,980
Hurry up and pay up!

352
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,340
Accept your defeat.

353
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,459
Which tenant's daughter that?

354
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:54,560
She's acting so rough.

355
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,360
Chase her out now.

356
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:56,220
Fifth Uncle!

357
00:16:56,539 --> 00:16:57,920
Let's play another round.

358
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,860
It's me, Ansu.

359
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:00,980
Ansu?

360
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:03,059
Zhao taught me this game.

361
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:04,060
It's so much fun!

362
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,820
Do you want to play together?

363
00:17:07,219 --> 00:17:10,060
Miss Su is really good
at mental calculation.

364
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,080
So it's no surprise she likes this game.

365
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,939
Let's check out the backyard.

366
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:14,540
Come with me.

367
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,979
Come on, it's your turn now.

368
00:17:18,979 --> 00:17:19,780
Quickly.

369
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,179
This courtyard

370
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:23,060
is my mother-in-law's

371
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,979
favorite courtyard.

372
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:27,080
Look at these flowers and plants.

373
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,060
They're carefully tended to every day.

374
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,600
The courtyard is always green,

375
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,160
with birds chirping
and flowers blooming.

376
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,219
It's really lovely.

377
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:39,300
There are more over there.

378
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,739
Let's go and take a look.

379
00:17:40,979 --> 00:17:41,560
All right.

380
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,300
Ming.

381
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,100
As for Zhao, she's very quiet.

382
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:13,900
Most of the time,
she writes and reads books.

383
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,739
She's refined and graceful,
truly a woman of culture and virtue.

384
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,380
Come.

385
00:18:21,499 --> 00:18:22,179
Ms. Longevity?

386
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,340
That is very rude of you.

387
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:27,320
I wanted to greet the guests
with this willow-shooting equipment.

388
00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:30,419
But my skills aren't great,

389
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:33,060
and I ended up startling
our honored guests.

390
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:46,360
It's perfect
that Fifth Master and Seventh Master

391
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,080
are discussing official matters
in the study.

392
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,580
With the two old scholars not around,

393
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,820
the children would feel more at ease.

394
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,820
I've heard the Dou Family's Madam Wang

395
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:57,140
and Fourth Young Lady Dou

396
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,659
are both quite skilled at making money.

397
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,419
Madam Wang,

398
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:02,219
you've helped many officials

399
00:19:02,219 --> 00:19:03,540
become rich.

400
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,000
Seventh Master Dou marrying so well

401
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,280
means his official career
will surely go smoothly.

402
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,840
I don't deserve such compliments.

403
00:19:09,939 --> 00:19:11,219
I only make a small profit

404
00:19:11,219 --> 00:19:12,419
to support the household.

405
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,179
It's Zhao who is truly extraordinary.

406
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,140
She comes from wealth

407
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,040
and is remarkably talented
at managing manors.

408
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:22,300
She's already one of the richest
in the region.

409
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:27,340
It's a pity that she doesn't trust me
as the matron of the household.

410
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:30,340
If she would invest with me,

411
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:34,100
I could guarantee her a 30% profit
in just half a year.

412
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:38,100
If you make this marriage happen,

413
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:42,860
I'd be happy to contribute 40%...

414
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,419
No, I mean 50% of her dowry

415
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,340
for you to manage.

416
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,100
You're too kind.

417
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,739
If we happen to become in-laws,

418
00:19:52,939 --> 00:19:54,900
there's no need
to mention helping or not.

419
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,340
We're not outsiders here.

420
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,340
Have some tea.

421
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,179
Sure.

422
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,580
What's the fun of shooting willow?

423
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,019
(I knew your archery skills
are terrible)

424
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,640
(and care so much about your face.)

425
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,160
(If I made you think
we don't have the same interests)

426
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:11,640
(and angry out of embarrassment,)

427
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,400
(maybe you'd call off the engagement.
Now, that's the fun part!)

428
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,179
What are those?

429
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,860
A small gift from my elder sister.

430
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,540
It's a kite soaring in the sky,

431
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:21,340
symbolizing good fortune.

432
00:20:21,699 --> 00:20:23,380
"Look far to see a thousand li ahead,

433
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,820
rising to new heights."

434
00:20:25,739 --> 00:20:26,960
Madam Wei is so thoughtful.

435
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,360
Are these for Fifth Master Dou
and Seventh Master Dou?

436
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,179
Madam Wang, take a look.

437
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,060
"A fresh start leads

438
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,019
to soaring heights."

439
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,300
What a fine verse.

440
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:43,160
Even the sentiment is wonderful.

441
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,100
I had Peijin inscribe it personally.

442
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,019
I wish him a bright future,

443
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,179
a harmonious and happy life,
and soaring high together

444
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:51,680
with Fourth Young Lady Dou.

445
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:56,780
How did this archery turn
into shooting in the sky?

446
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,680
Fourth Young Lady,
are you shooting willows

447
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,540
or kites?

448
00:21:00,939 --> 00:21:02,179
My archery isn't great,

449
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:04,000
and the wind is strong today.

450
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,620
That's why I missed my target.

451
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,300
(I don't want to soar high with you.)

452
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,840
(I prefer shooting you with this arrow.)

453
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,300
Madam,

454
00:21:19,499 --> 00:21:21,380
Zhao usually doesn't practice archery.

455
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,060
I'm not sure
what's gotten into her today.

456
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,179
Ming!

457
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,459
It's some men having some fun.

458
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,520
Why are you trying
to draw attention to yourself?

459
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,960
Women shouldn't even
be learning archery in the first place.

460
00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:34,179
Madam,

461
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,800
why don't we head back to the house

462
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,440
to enjoy some fruit and rest for a bit?

463
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,459
Good idea.

464
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:53,979
You...

465
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,120
The wind really is strong.

466
00:21:59,179 --> 00:21:59,900
Fourth Young Lady,

467
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,939
am I in trouble?

468
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:03,739
It's only a kite.

469
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:06,259
The Marquis won't mind it,

470
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:07,659
right?

471
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:13,300
Zhao,

472
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,620
can you teach me
how to release the arrow?

473
00:22:17,939 --> 00:22:19,739
I heard the Marquis of Jining

474
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:21,939
is famous in the capital
for his archery skills.

475
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:27,659
I...

476
00:22:28,659 --> 00:22:29,419
Your Lordship.

477
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,499
I wouldn't call myself an expert.

478
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,939
But this little willow-shooting trick

479
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,939
is no challenge for me.

480
00:22:41,939 --> 00:22:43,499
Fifth Young Lady, you see.

481
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,340
To shoot accurately and steadily,

482
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:48,499
the arrow needs to be exactly
three times the length of its head

483
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,240
and perfectly symmetrical
along all four sides of the shaft.

484
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,680
Only then do you have a steady aim,

485
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,480
achieving what is mentioned
in the Rites of Zhou,

486
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,520
"Even in strong winds,

487
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,140
it will not falter."

488
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,360
You're very knowledgeable,
Your Lordship.

489
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,300
Knowledgeable indeed.

490
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:04,380
But if you don't shoot soon,

491
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,259
the flowers in the gourd will wither.

492
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:10,600
Fifth Young Lady, watch this carefully.

493
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:15,840
Your arm must be steady,
and your mind must be calm.

494
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,780
Aim for the roundest part of the gourd.

495
00:23:23,979 --> 00:23:25,019
Then release the arrow.

496
00:23:39,499 --> 00:23:40,100
This...

497
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,939
It is indeed very windy.

498
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,979
Yes, it sure is.

499
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:48,179
Do you want to try one more time?

500
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,140
The wind

501
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,280
was indeed strong just now.

502
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:55,800
I'll try one more time.

503
00:23:59,659 --> 00:24:01,459
Aim for the roundest part of the gourd.

504
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,440
Then release the arrow.

505
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:11,080
The arrow's fletching is definitely
not made from eagle feathers.

506
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,160
It can't shoot accurately.

507
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,860
The arm must be steady,
and the mind must be calm.

508
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,419
Aim for the roundest part of the gourd.

509
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:23,179
She hit it!

510
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:25,259
You truly have remarkable skills.

511
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,780
I learned in one try
and hit the target on my first try

512
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,240
just by following your instructions.

513
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,419
You're a quick learner.

514
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,340
But who picks up archery this fast?

515
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,320
You're already skilled in archery,
right?

516
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,600
(This woman is decent in appearance.)

517
00:24:41,699 --> 00:24:43,080
(But she's brash and sharp-tongued.)

518
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,019
(Why is she so infatuated with me?)

519
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,019
(This won't do.)

520
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,720
(How do I call off this engagement?)

521
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,979
(How do I explain it to Sister?)

522
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,219
(What a headache.)

523
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,960
Madam Wang's words
are too narrow-minded.

524
00:24:55,699 --> 00:24:57,800
Women like Fu Hao
expanded territories in the past

525
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,480
and Mulan
took her father's place in the army.

526
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,080
Today, there's Madam Wa Shi
who suppressed a rebellion

527
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,440
and took over administrative duties.

528
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,219
There's no such thing

529
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,900
as something only men can do

530
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,340
and women cannot in this era.

531
00:25:08,219 --> 00:25:10,060
She says plenty of things
that aren't right.

532
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:12,100
I won't take any of it to heart.

533
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,280
Mother is going to blame me
for being useless again.

534
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:22,140
I often hear the ladies
in the capital praise

535
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,540
Fifth Young Lady for being skilled
in the four arts

536
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,580
and needlework.

537
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,580
Seeing you today,
you're even more gentle and dignified.

538
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,760
Women have always been admired
for their gentleness and obedience.

539
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,739
Fifth Young Lady, why belittle yourself?

540
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:37,100
To Mother,

541
00:25:38,699 --> 00:25:41,540
if my sister can do something
that I can't,

542
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,380
that means I'm useless.

543
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,100
That's too narrow-minded.

544
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,739
It's like this branch and this arrow.

545
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,120
Which is useful,

546
00:25:51,739 --> 00:25:52,620
and which is not?

547
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,100
The arrow can be used in battle.

548
00:25:57,219 --> 00:26:00,780
But what's the use of the branch?

549
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:03,860
If the branch is on a tree,

550
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,960
it can shield people
from the wind and rain.

551
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,860
The bark can be used to make paper.

552
00:26:09,699 --> 00:26:11,820
Both serve different purposes.

553
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,520
Neither is more or less important.

554
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,340
It's the same with people.

555
00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:31,939
There's a leaf.

556
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,920
Wearing tiger talismans
on Dragon Boat Festival

557
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:47,720
can ward off evil
and bring good fortune.

558
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,140
These two young ladies
personally embroidered tiger talismans

559
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,860
for you two gentlemen,

560
00:26:52,499 --> 00:26:54,419
hoping to bring a good omen.

561
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,140
The embroidery and inlay work

562
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,060
are both exquisite.

563
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,580
Ming embroidered this one.

564
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,739
Her stitches are delicate.

565
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,259
This one was embroidered by Zhao.

566
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:07,200
Zhao's embroidery...

567
00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:11,780
Well,

568
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,380
it's still a tiger talisman.

569
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,380
It's quite good as well.

570
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,340
Please accept it, gentlemen.

571
00:27:19,499 --> 00:27:20,259
Thank you, Madam.

572
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,900
Thank you.

573
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:31,440
(Fourth Young Lady Dou's embroidery
is rather rough.)

574
00:27:31,699 --> 00:27:33,200
(But she still put in a lot of effort)

575
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,640
(to make a tiger talisman for me.)

576
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,699
(It shows how deeply she cares for me.)

577
00:27:39,739 --> 00:27:41,360
(It's a pity
our personalities don't match.)

578
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,580
(I'll have to let her down.)

579
00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:44,780
(But Fifth Young Lady's work...)

580
00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:47,900
(Fourth Young Lady)

581
00:27:48,259 --> 00:27:49,179
(has a unique mind,)

582
00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:50,840
(She's genuine and sincere.)

583
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,640
(Truly rare qualities in this world.)

584
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:01,019
Our tea plantation in the back hills
has beautiful scenery.

585
00:28:01,419 --> 00:28:03,699
Since this is your first time visiting
our manor,

586
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,860
I've arranged for a servant

587
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,620
to take you both on a stroll there.

588
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:10,419
Thank you, Madam.

589
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,939
Since we both dislike heat
and prefer quiet,

590
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,100
we'll just head to the pavilion.

591
00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:20,979
Once Zhao and Ming
have prepared the banquet,

592
00:28:21,219 --> 00:28:24,060
we can go straight
to the feast and have drinks.

593
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,720
Please come with me.

594
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,179
All right.

595
00:28:27,699 --> 00:28:28,520
This way, please.

596
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,440
Everything is arranged.

597
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,699
But those things
don't understand human speech.

598
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:46,179
How can we make them
only go for the Marquis?

599
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:47,699
What if it goes for Mr. Wu Shan?

600
00:28:47,699 --> 00:28:49,140
They won't make a mistake.

601
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,540
They will definitely go for Wei Tingyu.

602
00:28:52,219 --> 00:28:53,259
I've cleared everyone out.

603
00:28:53,459 --> 00:28:55,459
We can't afford any slip-ups
with Dou Zhao.

604
00:28:56,499 --> 00:28:57,820
After an hour,

605
00:28:58,459 --> 00:29:00,860
I'll bring Madam Wei over.

606
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,739
Yes, Madam.

607
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,900
It's indeed a beautiful scenery.

608
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,739
It's all right, I guess.

609
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:27,620
Wait, Mr. Wei.

610
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:31,259
Thank you.

611
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,540
Truly exquisite.

612
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,040
Fifth Young Lady truly has a refined
and thoughtful nature.

613
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,780
Every bead in this design

614
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,300
is clearly crafted with great care.

615
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,480
Well, Fourth Young Lady also put
a lot of thought into it.

616
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,580
But her thinking

617
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,659
is unique.

618
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:56,459
"The crane calls in the marshes,
the fish lurks in the depths."

619
00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:58,060
If these were reversed,

620
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,060
the crane wouldn't be a crane,

621
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,060
and the fish wouldn't be a fish.

622
00:30:02,979 --> 00:30:04,219
If we could switch them,

623
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,019
wouldn't that be perfect?

624
00:30:11,939 --> 00:30:14,160
This... this is something made
by a young lady

625
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,120
and given by elders.

626
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,320
Exchanging it privately

627
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,160
would be too impolite.

628
00:30:19,699 --> 00:30:21,580
Mr. Wu, I must disagree.

629
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:23,979
Festive gifts are no big deal.

630
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:26,620
Besides, can something forced upon us

631
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,720
by elders truly bring joy?

632
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,540
How shallow.

633
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:33,340
Mr. Wei,

634
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,140
this... this might not be appropriate.

635
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:36,900
Mr. Wei!

636
00:30:47,459 --> 00:30:49,580
The variety of light and hearty dishes

637
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,880
is still fairly acceptable.

638
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,280
But the cold dishes
shouldn't be served in bowls.

639
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,520
Switch to platters instead.

640
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,560
Yes, Young Lady.

641
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,620
Before serving the duck and barley soup,

642
00:31:01,979 --> 00:31:03,400
make sure to shred the duck meat.

643
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:04,560
Yes, Young Lady.

644
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,659
Prepare more snowflake pastries.

645
00:31:06,939 --> 00:31:08,459
If anyone doesn't eat cold dishes,

646
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,720
serve them room-temperature
mung bean soup instead.

647
00:31:10,939 --> 00:31:12,800
Entertaining distinguished guests
at a banquet

648
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,160
requires the utmost care.

649
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:15,979
Zhao, you truly consider every detail.

650
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,019
What do you think
of the fruit-serving dishes I chose?

651
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,179
Are they appropriate?

652
00:31:23,699 --> 00:31:24,419
Fourth Young Lady,

653
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,459
I'm truly sorry.

654
00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:28,259
Why are you so careless?

655
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,939
Luckily, it wasn't anything hot.

656
00:31:29,939 --> 00:31:30,620
Come with me.

657
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,600
Let me attend to Fourth Young Lady
to the side room

658
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,160
to get changed.

659
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,920
It's all right.

660
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:35,840
Let me just get everything ready
for the banquet first.

661
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,100
We have a lot of guests today,

662
00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:38,900
and your dress is quite sheer.

663
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,140
If someone sees you like this,

664
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,620
it could damage your reputation.

665
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,219
It's better if you change first.

666
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,340
Zhao.

667
00:31:46,499 --> 00:31:47,140
Keep preparing.

668
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,520
I'll go and see what's going on.

669
00:31:49,419 --> 00:31:50,540
Your dress is sheer.

670
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,860
What if you catch a cold?

671
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,860
It'll be quick.

672
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,620
It's just ahead. Come on now.

673
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,560
(Dai Jian, Governor of Shengtian)

674
00:32:03,459 --> 00:32:04,499
It's just a small gift.

675
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,419
I hope you'll accept it.

676
00:32:14,739 --> 00:32:16,900
This is quite a generous gift.

677
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,120
Yuanji, you're too generous.

678
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,780
Then I shall accept them.

679
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,120
Send this to the Governor's carriage.

680
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,800
Yes, Master.

681
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,499
Please have a seat.

682
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:29,179
You, too.

683
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,659
We're almost there.

684
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:32,540
Why are you in a rush, Nanny Zhou?

685
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,060
The banquet is going to start soon.

686
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,739
We can't delay it.

687
00:32:35,739 --> 00:32:37,060
I'll accompany Zhao.

688
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,080
I can cover a little for her.

689
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,820
No need.

690
00:32:41,739 --> 00:32:42,860
I mean

691
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,860
I can help her get changed.

692
00:32:45,739 --> 00:32:48,200
You don't have to twist my arm
when I want to help her to get changed.

693
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:50,760
We can attend
to Fourth Young Lady's need.

694
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,400
What are you trying to pull here,
Nanny Zhou?

695
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,259
I'm not.

696
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,080
Just helping her to get changed.

697
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,380
You don't allow Dou Ming to follow me.

698
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,979
I want to see

699
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,640
what's waiting for me in this room.

700
00:33:08,939 --> 00:33:09,659
Mr. Wu?

701
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:11,140
Why is Mr. Wu here?

702
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:13,360
When Mr. Wu was taking a stroll
in the back hills,

703
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,680
a group of swallowtail butterflies
suddenly appeared

704
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,380
and chased after him.

705
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,820
After that, he fell unconscious.

706
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,880
Swallowtail butterfly?

707
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,800
Get the physician here quickly

708
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,320
and notify the elders at home.

709
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:39,060
He is covered in scale powder

710
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,820
and only breaks out in rashes.

711
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,459
No need to let both Masters know.

712
00:33:50,659 --> 00:33:52,419
(The Miluo River is full
of lingering resentment.)

713
00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:52,880
(Wrongfully Killed Man)
(The Miluo River is full
of lingering resentment.)

714
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,360
(Wrongfully Killed Man)

715
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,300
(The child was buried
in the southern mountains.)

716
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,160
(Qu Yuan's life ended
in the Miluo River,)

717
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,680
(Wu Shan)
(and today is the Dragon Boat Festival.)

718
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,540
(The poem speaks of early death.)

719
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,840
Still hiding the truth?

720
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,600
You were setting up a situation
where a couple isolated together

721
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,059
to meet while getting changed,
forcing me to marry.

722
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:15,979
But you didn't expect

723
00:34:15,979 --> 00:34:17,740
Wei Tingyu to swap
the tiger talismans with Wu Shan.

724
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,220
For others, the scale powder
only causes redness and itching.

725
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:22,939
But Wu Shan has a lung condition.

726
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:24,840
This could cost him his life!

727
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:27,099
Mr. Wu came to the manor as a guest.

728
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:28,860
If anything bad happened to him,

729
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,200
how do we explain it to the Wu Family?

730
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,059
Just do as Zhao says.

731
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:34,180
Yes, Young Lady.

732
00:34:38,539 --> 00:34:39,700
His breathing is getting worse.

733
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,560
There are too many curtains in the room.

734
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,600
The air isn't circulating properly.

735
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,300
Suxin,

736
00:34:43,939 --> 00:34:45,260
go and get someone
to carry him to the yard.

737
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,080
Make sure they are gentle
and move him carefully.

738
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,380
Then bring me my acupuncture box.

739
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:48,939
Yes, Young Lady.

740
00:34:57,619 --> 00:34:58,780
Master is hosting guests at the manor.

741
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,660
No one is allowed to disturb.

742
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:05,860
I, Song Mo, the heir of Duke of Ying,

743
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:10,099
have come to pay a visit
with gifts for the Dragon Boat Festival!

744
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:17,419
Now, Grand Secretary Wu
has the final say in the court.

745
00:35:17,419 --> 00:35:18,419
No one can argue with him.

746
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,780
I am of low status
and have little influence.

747
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:24,180
I truly have no power
to relieve His Majesty's concerns.

748
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,459
The southeast has been hit by a storm,
causing miles of devastation.

749
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,340
While others are avoiding it,

750
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:32,499
the Dou family wishes
to step into the eye of the storm,

751
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,180
using the wind to their advantage.

752
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,019
Such courage.

753
00:35:36,419 --> 00:35:36,939
Fifth Master,

754
00:35:36,939 --> 00:35:38,459
I couldn't stop His Lordship
from entering.

755
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,499
The Dou Family has no connections
with the Duke of Ying.

756
00:35:44,979 --> 00:35:46,780
Since you are here uninvited,

757
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,340
what brings you here?

758
00:35:51,979 --> 00:35:54,619
You sent rice dumplings
to high officials in the capital.

759
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:58,180
I am curious
about the peculiar filling inside.

760
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,139
So I asked Official Wu for a few to try.

761
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,340
It turns out they're filled with gold.

762
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,539
It seems like Official Wu
has quite a strong prejudice against me.

763
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,740
It's just a regular festival gift.

764
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,499
He can refuse it.

765
00:36:22,019 --> 00:36:24,220
But he actually let you return
it to me in person.

766
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,180
You should put down your weapon,
Lord Song.

767
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:28,740
From my position
as the Governor of Shengtian,

768
00:36:29,499 --> 00:36:30,780
it looks like
you're publicly threatening

769
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,260
an official of the court.

770
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,019
I dare not.

771
00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:40,499
Your Lordship, you…

772
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:43,740
I have come to inform you respectfully,
Official Dou.

773
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,780
If you still plan

774
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,099
to accuse the Duke of Ding
of any crimes,

775
00:36:48,019 --> 00:36:49,480
then I shall offer these rice dumplings

776
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,700
to His Majesty for a taste.

777
00:36:54,939 --> 00:36:58,139
By then, even the Shengtian Prefecture

778
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,419
may not be able to protect you.

779
00:37:01,499 --> 00:37:01,939
You...

780
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,340
Master,

781
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,660
Mr. Wu Shan is unconscious.

782
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,880
Fourth Young Lady has ordered someone
to carry him to the backyard.

783
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,180
Quiet!

784
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,480
Do not speak recklessly!

785
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:10,860
Great.

786
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,300
You dare to harm Official Wu's
only grandson!

787
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,220
Preposterous.

788
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,700
Absolutely preposterous!

789
00:37:18,979 --> 00:37:20,660
This is your territory.

790
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,260
If I let him walk around like this,

791
00:37:23,419 --> 00:37:24,780
what would be left of my dignity!

792
00:37:25,459 --> 00:37:26,019
Someone!

793
00:37:26,979 --> 00:37:27,619
You cannot.

794
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:29,220
Official Dai, don't do it.

795
00:37:30,139 --> 00:37:33,260
You're worried that this marriage
won't be settled anytime soon.

796
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:34,660
In my opinion,

797
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,499
once fate comes its way,

798
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,939
nothing can stop it.

799
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,320
You're right about that.

800
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,740
Tingzhen!

801
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,900
Why are you here?

802
00:37:49,499 --> 00:37:49,979
Tingzhen,

803
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,300
Mr. Wu is...

804
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,260
Song Mo?

805
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:14,380
Suxin. Sulan.

806
00:38:15,939 --> 00:38:16,550
Fourth Young Lady,

807
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:17,939
what are you doing?

808
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,939
What are you trying to do to Dezhen?

809
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,800
He has tuberculosis and lung abscesses.

810
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,160
His breathing is getting weaker.

811
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,900
His lungs must be filled with pus now.

812
00:38:37,499 --> 00:38:39,660
Now, he's on the verge of death,
fighting for his life.

813
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,960
I need to perform acupuncture
on his Dazhui and Xuanji acupoints

814
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,499
to save him.

815
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,459
Dou Zhao!

816
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,619
How dare you!

817
00:38:48,019 --> 00:38:49,139
In broad daylight,

818
00:38:49,459 --> 00:38:50,979
you and Mr. Wu are tugging at each other

819
00:38:50,979 --> 00:38:51,990
with your clothes in disarray.

820
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:53,499
What are you trying to do? Get up now!

821
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,099
Mr. Wu Shan's illness flared up
strangely.

822
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,499
Zhao is about
to perform acupuncture on him.

823
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,019
If acupuncture is needed,
it should be done by a physician.

824
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,680
There are rules between men and women.

825
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,619
You have acted in such disgraceful
and improper behavior.

826
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:08,220
If this gets out,

827
00:39:08,459 --> 00:39:09,920
what will happen
to the Dou Family's reputation?

828
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:10,780
Someone,

829
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,499
quickly help Mr. Wu Shan up.

830
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,579
You're right.

831
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,019
Mother,
saving him is more important now.

832
00:39:18,019 --> 00:39:18,740
Quiet.

833
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,820
Since it's a respiratory condition,

834
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,820
he should be quickly sent
to the physician.

835
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,380
Someone, take him away.

836
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,019
We've already sent someone
to bring the physician here.

837
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:27,660
But the nearest medical hall

838
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,539
is ten li away.

839
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:30,019
By the time the physician arrived,

840
00:39:30,019 --> 00:39:31,459
Mr. Wu Shan would be dead.

841
00:39:32,419 --> 00:39:33,539
You've grown up on the battlefield.

842
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,619
So you must know
some injuries and illnesses

843
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,660
cannot be delayed.

844
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,499
Please look into my eyes.

845
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,019
Since you're skilled
in reading facial expressions,

846
00:39:51,459 --> 00:39:52,700
you will know I'm not lying.

847
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,459
I can save him.

848
00:40:13,939 --> 00:40:14,499
You can let go of me.

849
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,340
Hold onto Dezhen.

850
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:19,860
Lu Zheng,

851
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,700
Bring out all the folding screens

852
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,059
and set them up around tightly.

853
00:40:23,419 --> 00:40:23,820
Yes, Your Lordship.

854
00:40:26,939 --> 00:40:28,300
Everyone, turn around!

855
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,260
If anyone dares to look,

856
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:33,700
you'll lose your eyes.

857
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:44,260
Fourth Young Lady,

858
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:46,260
proceed with the acupuncture now.

859
00:40:50,139 --> 00:40:50,780
Your Lordship,

860
00:40:51,979 --> 00:40:54,419
you openly pointed your blade
at an official of the court.

861
00:40:55,139 --> 00:40:56,340
Do you intend to rebel?

862
00:40:56,939 --> 00:40:58,619
Anyone who stands in my way today

863
00:40:59,939 --> 00:41:00,619
will die.

864
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,459
You've repeatedly tried
to stop me from saving him.

865
00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:05,700
What are your true intentions?

866
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,780
Why do you believe

867
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,180
that this girl can save him?

868
00:41:09,979 --> 00:41:11,139
I trust my judgment.

869
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:12,660
You...

870
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,539
Lord Song,

871
00:41:15,419 --> 00:41:17,700
you're causing trouble at my place.

872
00:41:18,139 --> 00:41:19,539
Are you forcing me

873
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,979
to bring this matter to the emperor?

874
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,579
I'm sure you know

875
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:26,459
exactly how Dezhen's illness acted up.

876
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,820
If you want to bring this
before the emperor,

877
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:32,019
are you prepared
to discard your family's reputation

878
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,139
and the women's honor?

879
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,340
Mother.

880
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,059
Mother.

881
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:48,700
Dou Zhao,

882
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,660
are you trying
to get the entire family killed?

883
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,419
What a clever plan, Lord Song.

884
00:41:53,939 --> 00:41:55,539
If something happened to Mr. Wu,

885
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,499
the emperor would think the Dou Family

886
00:41:58,019 --> 00:41:59,619
is ambitious and power-hungry,

887
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:00,780
and that we would harm others
because of political differences.

888
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,939
Don't worry, Yuanji.

889
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,820
As the Governor of Shengtian,

890
00:42:06,019 --> 00:42:08,220
I'll testify to this.

891
00:42:08,539 --> 00:42:10,019
Song Mo broke into private property,

892
00:42:10,539 --> 00:42:12,260
threatened a court official
with a blade,

893
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,059
and obstructed efforts to save a life.

894
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,539
Even if this matter reaches the emperor,

895
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:17,900
the truth will be the same!

896
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,939
This embroidery is quite exquisite.

897
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,660
Fortunately, Song Mo comes
from a military background

898
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:47,539
and doesn't know
the underhanded tricks of a household.

899
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,419
Otherwise, today would
be a great disaster for the family!

900
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:50,619
I suggest you to be careful
with your words.

901
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,459
She is genuinely trying to save you
despite the criticisms.

902
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,700
Are you saying

903
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,700
Fourth Young Lady
also has feelings for me?

♪I lean in and gaze at you
as calm as serene waves♪

905
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:05,580
