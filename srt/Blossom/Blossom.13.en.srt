00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,709
(Zhaowen Bookstore)

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,450
you'll need at least a month to recover.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,660
I can't afford to wait anymore.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,660
The guard's life is hanging by a thread,

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,330
and my mother's just passed away.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,380
What I need the most

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,330
is not to heal,

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,580
but to be able to hold my weapon.

9
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,100
I knew it.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,100
I have medicine prepared for you.

11
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,980
Take one when you are exhausted.

12
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,770
You are draining your energy.

13
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,130
Your strength
will be reduced by 30 percent.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,450
The bruises don't get to heal properly.

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,490
Even if it's healed,

16
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,890
you will experience pain for a lifetime.

17
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,250
- If you trusted me...
- I trust you.

18
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,220
The 70 percent of my strength

19
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,530
is enough to fight against them.

20
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,420
Just like the first half
of The Life of Luo Shan's story,

21
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,050
it's hard to cut off your family
and to balance between it and loyalty.

22
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,050
I'm not a watcher anymore.

23
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,020
I'm part of the story now.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,140
I still remember

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,940
the fox-faced woman once told me...

26
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,580
If the second half of the story

27
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,780
is about the son
interrogating his father,

28
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,020
it'll be shocking.

29
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,530
Do you think

30
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,140
a son shouldn't interrogate the father

31
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,970
and family is more important than
the truth?

32
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,029
I mean,

33
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,250
what's wrong with being shocking?

34
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,170
We are not living in the play.

35
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,220
It doesn't matter

36
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,050
if you believed what happened;

37
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:56,330
or if it's true.

38
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,690
How could it be?

39
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,020
Are you

40
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,250
really not her?

41
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,549
The most important thing now

42
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,850
is to win the fight.

43
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,060
Let's put the other things
aside for now.

44
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,250
I'll get you some clothes.

45
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,620
How did he escape?

46
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,220
He was half dead.

47
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,639
They have contact in the residence.

48
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,500
They collaborated to save him.

49
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,900
Send someone to get him!

50
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,879
Search thoroughly in the Capital

51
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,039
and get him back!

52
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,180
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

53
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,060
Hurry up.

54
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,479
Interrogate Song Mo's guards!

55
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,329
He was badly injured.

56
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,530
I don't believe
he could get away from this.

57
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,130
- Yes, sir.
- Also,

58
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,079
get everyone from
the first and third family,

59
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,919
and also the elders

60
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,250
over here.

61
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,709
I want to go into the ancestral hall.

62
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,850
Yes, sir!

63
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,690
Come back.

64
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,850
All the men of sacrifices,

65
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,220
have they all returned?

66
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,940
Yes.

67
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,460
Go.

68
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:32,200
(Knocking Ice into Jade Chips)

69
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,690
You've made your decision.

70
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,130
You are right.

71
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,220
No matter how shocking it is,

72
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,690
we have to end the feud.

73
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,780
Even if I die,

74
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,180
even if everyone accused me of treason,

75
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,730
as long as there is someone
who trusts and understands me,

76
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,380
then this is a life
that's worthwhile for me.

77
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,130
I promise.

78
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,690
No matter what you do,

79
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,410
or what the public says about you,

80
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,180
I'll always support you.

81
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,970
This is more than enough

82
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,460
for me.

83
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,420
(It's...)

84
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,530
Fourth Young Lady,
you are the fox-faced woman.

85
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,370
Why don't you tell His Lordship?

86
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,660
Things aren't settled yet.

87
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,220
I can't let other things affect him.

88
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,700
I'll come back for you

89
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,100
if I stay alive!

90

(Funeral)

93
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:58,649
Why is my heart beating so fast?

94
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,059
- Stop it.
- Is this...

95
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:06,640
(Duke of Ying's Residence)

96
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,780
Where are my people?

97
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,080
(Song Maochun,
Song family's Eldest Uncle)

98
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,220
Entering the ancestral hall
in the middle of the night,

99
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,229
(Song Fengchun)
we've been waiting

100
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:26,340
(Song family's Third Uncle)
for four hours.

101
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,290
I'm sure something is wrong.

102
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,700
What could go wrong?

103
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,519
He has been beaten over 100 times.

104
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,220
Anyone else would be dead by now.

105
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,140
Maochun.

106
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,840
(Song's Ancestral Hall)

107
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,250
My apologies.

108
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,999
How dare you kill someone

109
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,309
in the inner courtyard of
the Duke of Ying's Residence.

110
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,700
This is an order from His Lordship.

111
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,370
There are thieves in the house.

112
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,100
We must separate
the family from the thieves.

113
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,460
This will be the line.

114
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,330
Anyone inside the ancestral hall
stays alive.

115
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,300
Anyone outside the ancestral hall
will be killed.

116
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,069
- Don't!
- How dare you!

117
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,580
What do you think
the Duke of Ying's Residence is?

118
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,119
We've never seen these people.

119
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,820
Are they really thieves?

120
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,820
Do you respect the law at all?

121
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,010
This is outrageous!

122
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,610
Lu Zheng!

123
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,020
Lu Zheng.

124
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,420
It's me.

125
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,970
I'm back.

126
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,760
Your Lordship,

127
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,250
I didn't admit it.

128
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,299
I...

129
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,970
I didn't let you down.

130
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,309
Brother!

131
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,159
Go!

132
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,309
Lu Ming, run!

133
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,189
Brother!

134
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,460
Get him out of the way!

135
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,610
Take good care of His Lordship.

136
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,010
Quick!

137
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,420
Brother!

138
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,010
Hurry up! Leave!

139
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,010
Good job.

140
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,370
You saved my life.

141
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,180
They all saved my life.

142
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,940
They…

143
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,100
They wanted to force me
to put my thumbprint.

144
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,780
I...

145
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,730
I bit my fingers.

146
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,890
So did the rest of us.

147
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,770
None of us admit it.

148
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,970
Lu Zheng.

149
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,490
Stay with me.

150
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,100
The medic is almost here.

151
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:09,469
You can't die.

152
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,589
Lu Zheng!

153
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,850
Open your eyes!

154
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,060
Your Lordship.

155
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,490
Where is my brother?

156
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,420
Brother, I'm here.

157
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,380
Brother.

158
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,460
Take care...

159
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:34,610
Take care of His Lordship for me.

160
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,140
I will.

161
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,820
- Protect
- I will.

162
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,730
His Lordship.

163
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,060
Lu Zheng.

164
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,380
Brother.

165
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,460
Lu Zheng!

166
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,100
Brother!

167
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,130
Brother!

168
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,690
Official Song!

169
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,240
(Lofty Morality)

170
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,509
Duke.

171
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,429
They are here.

172
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,490
We should run now.

173
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,010
Well, well, well.

174
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,180
He is Jiang Meisun's nephew indeed.

175
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,100
His Lordship dares to push us
into such a situation.

176
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,890
- I'm afraid he would...
- He wouldn't dare!

177
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,540
And he couldn't.

178
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,850
Li Zhen from Liaodong is approaching
the city with his soldiers,

179
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,250
the disturbance is pressing,

180
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,700
and His Majesty will not tolerate
internal rebellion.

181
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,250
Take this sword.

182
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,770
Go get help.

183
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:10,799
I...

184
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,940
Go!

185
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,610
Yes, sir.

186
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,900
Evil.

187
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,460
I know what you're looking for.

188
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,380
Han.

189
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,949
Brother.

190
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,090
Glad that you're fine.

191
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,610
Brother.

192
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,420
Can you don't be mad at father?

193
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,020
I'm not mad.

194
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,250
I'm killing those who are not loyal
to the family.

195
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,130
Only when the family is at peace,

196
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,700
then we can mourn our mother in peace.

197
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,540
Where is the jade pendant
that Grandfather gave to you?

198
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,890
I always bring it with me.

199
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,010
I wasn't around when Mother was ill.

200
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,490
Tell me about it.

201
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,970
Where is Nanny Xie?

202
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,010
She's been with Mother for decades.

203
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,300
Where is she now?

204
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,650
They said she was not well,
so they sent her home.

205
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,940
But she ran into bandits
on the way back.

206
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,610
She got killed.

207
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,850
Which doctor did Mother go to?

208
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,940
Her Majesty visited a few times.

209
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,540
She was worried.

210
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,770
Her Majesty recommended
the first doctor.

211
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,540
Mother's condition worsened
during the fall season.

212
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,970
His Highness recommended another doctor.

213
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,279
Lu Ming.

214
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,420
Yes.

215
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,039
Guard the Xixiang Place.

216
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,180
Yes.

217
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,690
Brother.

218
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,060
Please.

219
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,370
Don't hurt father.

220
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,490
- Brother.
- Brother.

221
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,949
Come here.

222
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,460
It's safe here.

223
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,730
Father, is there anything
you would like to tell me?

224
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,420
The Jiang family is now guilty.

225
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,420
Uncle and I

226
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,820
are considered guilty in your eyes too.

227
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,460
Since you have the capability
to fight your way back,

228
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,220
what do you want?

229
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,770
I always see you as my father.

230
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,610
Did you ever see me as your son?

231
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:24,730
Silence is better than words.

232
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,340
Adultery is a misunderstanding.

233
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,650
Those who died are traitors.

234
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,610
You can take your mother's dowry
and private property.

235
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,940
We'll put everything

236
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,250
behind us.

237
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,060
Thank you for your words.

238
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,220
I can now put our father-son bond

239
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,850
behind too.

240
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,100
During my last trip home,
you scolded me badly.

241
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,580
I gave you this
as a token of reconciliation.

242
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,580
I found it
in the utility room yesterday.

243
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:08,060
The candle wick is white,
the outer layer is full of dust.

244
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,980
You've never looked at it.

245
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,730
All these years,

246
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,370
it's me that is having
an extravagant hope.

247
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:21,060
I took 40 strokes of the cane for you.

248
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,340
And you punished me with a hundred flog.

249
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,210
I've paid you back everything.

250
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,690
From now on, we are no longer related,

251
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,850
just like this lantern.

252
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,649
The reason why

253
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,580
I'm talking to you peacefully

254
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,020
is for Mother's funeral.

255
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,450
On my mother's First Seventh Ritual,

256
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,420
I'll perform the rites.

257
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,450
I'll hold the streamer

258
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,450
during the funeral procession.

259
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,740
You want to officiate the funeral

260
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,370
to show everyone in the Capital

261
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,439
that you are the Lordship.

262
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,130
You are doing it for your benefit!

263
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,199
Since I joined the army,

264
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,980
I've never relied on this family.

265
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,930
From now on, I'll rely on myself

266
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,300
to get what I want.

267
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,500
I'm moving to Grandfather's Yizhi Hall.

268
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,170
From now on, we are not related.

269
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,410
However, during the ceremony,

270
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,130
you must fulfill your duty
as my mother's husband,

271
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,580
so she can pass with honor.

272
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,100
Su Lan.

273
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,170
Burn the used gauze.

274
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,930
Don't leave anything behind.

275
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,540
Yes.

276
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,690
An urgent letter from Lord Qing.

277
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:31,210
(Harmony of Moral and Nourishing)
Li Zhen has been violating the border.

278
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,100
People are deeply disturbed.

279
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,170
In my humble opinion,

280
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,279
Wang Xingyi should lead the Supreme
Commander of Military Affairs in Jiliao.

281
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,690
Increase the troops by 30 thousand

282
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,410
and fight with Li Zhen.

283
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,540
Otherwise,
with the military strength in Liaodong,

284
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,340
it would take only ten days

285
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:50,450
for Li Zhen to invade Daitong.

286
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,869
How's the treasury spending?

287
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,930
Ministry of Construction is building
the Yuanyou Palace.

288
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,130
We're not even halfway there yet.

289
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,349
Your Majesty,

290
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,389
The Li Zhen tribe is poor.

291
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,349
We can tell from them urging us
to allow horse-trading

292
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,549
in order to get food.

293
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,689
They are starting a war

294
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,439
just to loot food supplies

295
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,540
and livestock for winter.

296
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,110
We don't necessarily
need to engage in this.

297
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,750
The Cabinet

298
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:24,130
is discussing the military affair
with His Majesty,

299
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,610
Lord Dou, don't use your knowledge
in the wrong place.

300
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,179
Official Wu,

301
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,850
this is a matter of national security.

302
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,690
I dare not refuse to speak.

303
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,959
If we can resolve the war in a month,

304
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,790
the Ministry of Revenue
will be able to support it.

305
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,370
However, if we can't resolve this
in three months,

306
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,780
we'll have to raise taxes
to pay for military use.

307
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,109
If that's so,
it'll affect the spring seeding of

308
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,999
people in Su, Song, Jia, and Hu.

309
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,869
Your Majesty,

310
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,519
we shouldn't allow horse-trading.

311
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,850
Previously, I was demoted
because of this.

312
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,869
Now, I'm not afraid to do it again.

313
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,519
Once we allow horse trading,
there will be corruption

314
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,149
and breed criminals.

315
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,629
Your Majesty,
please make a wise decision.

316
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,959
Guard the country
and die for the people,

317
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,119
this is the ancestral's motto.

318
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,119
We are a righteous country.

319
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,130
We will speak
even if it means death to us.

320
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,580
We will speak
even if it means death to us.

321
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,580
Your Majesty.

322
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,130
Bring Her Majesty's elixir.

323
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,530
- Yes, sir.
- Your Majesty.

324
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,740
Only if Meisun is here.

325
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,580
Did he send it in again today?

326
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,980
Yes, Master.

327
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,939
Ever since
the Fourth Young Lady was grounded,

328
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,529
Mr. Wu has been sending a copy of

329
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,399
Lessons for Women
through the back door every day.

330
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,910
Occasionally, he would sneak in
some food and newspaper.

331
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,170
His Oukai writing is angelic.

332
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,020
(﻿Lessons for Women)
That is good writing indeed.

333
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,669
Has the Seventh Master departed?

334
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,850
He departed after dinner.

335
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,439
It'll take at least two weeks

336
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,990
to audit the account
at the Taiyuan Residence.

337
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,690
Master,

338
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,850
last night,
regarding the Fourth Young Lady,

339
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,490
what do you think?

340
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,619
Dou Zhao is rebellious and arrogant.

341
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,160
It's time to fix it.

342
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,960
Send my word
to the Shengtian Prefecture.

343
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,880
(Funeral)

344
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,299
(Spirit Tablet of Jiang's Late Wife)

345
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,160
(Longevity)

346
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,880
(Funeral)

347
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,799
The funeral is always officiated

348
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,020
by the head of the family.

349
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,610
Why is the eldest son

350
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,149
taking over for the Duke?

351
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,959
Song Mo hasn't shed a tear.

352
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,170
Unfilial.

353
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,420
You're right.

354
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,999
What's wrong
with the eldest son taking over?

355
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,039
Filial or not;

356
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,999
Shed a tear or not,

357
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,790
has nothing to do with you.

358
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,719
They are from a family of officials
with meritorious records.

359
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,210
The standard of funeral

360
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,580
for Mrs Jiang is so shabby.

361
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,799
Right.

362
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,069
Lord Song is having
the time of his life.

363
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,420
He hasn't even seen his mother
one last time.

364
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,389
Watch your mouth.

365
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,820
Stop being so mean.

366
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,309
When he was fighting the pirates,

367
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,279
where were you?

368
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,410
I bet you didn't see your mother
one last time too.

369
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,610
Gu Yu is here to pay respect.

370
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,530
Don't worry.

371
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,820
I'm with you.

372
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,740
Next time, no one would dare
to speak ill of you

373
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,740
on East Fourth Street.

374
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,340
Thank you.

375
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,000
(Lu Zheng, the Ding Army)

376
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,180
Your Lordship.

377
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,580
I, Lu Ming,
will take over my brother's place.

378
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,450
From now on,

379
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,740
I'll protect Your Lordship

380
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,100
at all costs.

381
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,780
We all know who killed Lu Zheng.

382
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,940
But

383
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,370
we can't avenge his death now.

384
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,980
Will you still follow me?

385
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,210
No matter Your Lordship's decision,

386
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,850
I'm willing to be the vanguard.

387
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,930
Please let me be part of your army.

388
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,020
Bring me the wine.

389
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,170
I, Song Mo,

390
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,740
will always remember your sacrifice.

391
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,300
To my brothers.

392
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,450
Rest in peace!

393
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,850
Rest in peace!

394
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,040
(Lu Zheng, the Ding Army)

395
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:49,260
- Your Lordship!
- Your Lordship!

396
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,210
How is it? Did anyone find out?

397
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,420
Miss.

398
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,799
(Lord Song
officiated Mrs Jiang's funeral)

399
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,940
The situation is settled down.

400
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,829
Song Mo officiated Mrs Jiang's funeral.

401
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,060
He was in charge of the funeral.

402
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,260
The position is secured.

403
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,320
(Unfortunately, Lu Zheng was killed.)

404
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,370
Lu Zheng is dead.

405
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,410
(Lu Zheng should be alive.)

406
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,549
(But he's dead.)

407
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:43,100
Ready for battle!

408
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,420
Sister.

409
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,239
Who is it?

410
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,309
Fourth Young Lady,

411
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,260
the Fifth Master wants you in
the ancestral hall.

412
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,420
Fifth Uncle.

413
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,930
Why do you want to see me at this hour?

414
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,250
Ms. Longevity,

415
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,759
you've been unhappy
with your marriage arrangement

416
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,440
with the Duke of Jining.

417
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:27,130
Tell us the truth.

418
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,679
Perhaps, we can figure out some ways
to help you.

419
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,850
What do you mean?

420
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,389
Zou Er.

421
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,530
Yes.

422
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,069
The bloody garment, I...

423
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,210
Su Lan!

424
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,540
What is it?

425
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,610
Seems like something is wrong
with the bloody garment.

426
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,629
Fifth Brother.

427
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,850
This is the proof.

428
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,890
How is a bloody garment

429
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,450
related to me?

430
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,820
You are secretly meeting a man
outside of the family.

431
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,690
You are a dishonor to the Dou family.

432
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,210
Come in.

433
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,260
The Fourth Young Lady has an affair
with an outsider.

434
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,690
Bring out the family punishment.

435
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,450
Yes, sir.

436
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,199
Master.

437
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,679
It's ready.

438
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,500
Seventh Madam
asked you to make a decision.

439
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,650
The elder will marry a man of honor,
the second will marry a man of power.

440
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,410
It would have been perfect.

441
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,300
However, the pawns disobey.

442
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,860
We've come into a hopeless situation.

443
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,500
Try to pass what's happening with
Dou Zhao

444
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,170
to Wu Shan.

445
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,850
If we can exchange him for it

446
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,300
it'd still be worthwhile.

447
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,540
Master, you mean...

448
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,300
Didn't Wu Shan

449
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,909
want to be with Dou Zhao?

450
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,930
If he knew Dou Zhao was suffering,

451
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,610
would he be anxious?

452
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,890
Understood. I'll get it done.

453
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,549
All thanks to the Duke's blessing.

454
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,060
You've finally woken up.

455
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,890
Lord Song regains consciousness.

456
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,290
Lord Song!

457
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,210
Lord Song.

458
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,690
You're finally awake.

459
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,130
How long have I been asleep?

460
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,890
Seven days and seven nights.

461
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:49,100
The imperial physician
has been here a few times.

462
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,930
They say you've injured
your five viscera.

463
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,020
You took the pills
that overthrew your body.

464
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,740
You are exhausted

465
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,340
and you might not wake up.

466
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:02,450
Fortunately, you've survived this

467
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,940
Where is Dou Zhao?

468
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,540
How is she doing?

469
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,580
- Fourth Young Lady...
- Lu Ming.

470
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,050
What's wrong?

471
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,580
Tell me.

472
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,130
According to Mr. Chen,

473
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,100
the Fourth Young Lady was punished
by Dou Fifth Master

474
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,580
because she met with an outsider.

475
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,740
Outsider.

476
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,580
It's me.

477
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,759
Lord... Lord Song.

478
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,900
Lord Song.

479
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,370
The family just went through
a devastating state.

480
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,930
You merely escape from death.

481
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:45,999
You can't take this.

482
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,140
Yeah.

483
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,690
She saved my life.

484
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,300
If I can't make it,

485
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,199
then let's take it as
I'm returning my life to her.

486
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,629
In fact, the matter
with the Fourth Young Lady

487
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,260
has already been settled.

488
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,580
It's just the Wu family.

489
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,820
Wu family?

490
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,410
What's wrong with the Wu family?

491
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,039
Sir, you can't go in.

492
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,439
- Get out of my way.
- You can't go in.

493
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,199
- Get out.
- What are you doing?

494
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,410
Murder?

495
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,900
Get out of my way.

496
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,370
Fourth Young Lady.

497
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,370
The bloody garment is mine.

498
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,349
Mr. Wu,

499
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,869
don't make a false confession.

500
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:34,799
How could it belong to you?

501
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,589
I was coughing up blood.

502
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,410
As expected of the legal grandson
of the Wu's,

503
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,930
a man of honor.

504
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,130
But don't you think,

505
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,519
it's a ridiculous reason?

506
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,260
I was the one who acted boldly.

507
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,930
I was the frivolous one.

508
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,690
It has nothing to do
with the Fourth Young Lady.

509
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:54,170
Minister Dou, please punish me.

510
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,930
Official Wu bullies us
on the strength of his position,

511
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,589
allowing his grandson
to break into the inner courtyard

512
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,850
to seduce Dou's family's daughter
who is already engaged,

513
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,370
treating us as if we were nothing.

514
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,410
I'm not the one to make the call.

515
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:09,100
Shengtian Prefecture
should make the call.

516
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,580
Seducing a well-known family's daughter,

517
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:19,450
you're going to be beheaded.

518
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,260
Poor guy.

519
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,690
That night,

520
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,500
I was there to ask for medicine.

521
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,170
We are innocent.

522
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,279
You come from a family of scholars.

523
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,300
How could you be innocent

524
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,210
if you have been visiting
the Dou's Residence?

525
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,930
There could be one reason.

526
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,060
Official Wu wanted the ministers
to agree to start a war with Li Zhen.

527
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,439
Did you go to Dou's Residence
to find out their view

528
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,260
and to persuade them?

529
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,170
What does this have to do
with my grandfather?

530
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,300
In the time of danger and chaos,

531
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,610
that's when you see loyalty in person.

532
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,130
It's the duty of the servant

533
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,340
to protect the country with his blood.

534
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:05,300
Naturally,
we shouldn't tolerate traitors.

535
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,580
There's no need to persuade.

536
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,930
Wu Shan said

537
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:16,349
that Official Wu thinks that now is
the time of danger and chaos,

538
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,799
those who favor peace are not loyal.

539
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,610
His Majesty tolerates traitors.

540
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,239
Wu Shan went to Dou's residence
to seduce the daughter,

541
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,549
intending to find out
Dou's officials' view,

542
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:30,300
and planned to gang up.

543
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,490
That's not true.

544
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,130
You distort the truth.

545
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,650
Who are you?

546
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,940
Is anyone here?

547
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:41,130
I want to meet Dou Shishu!

548
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,069
Piles of water filled with blood

549
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,130
were poured out of the Shengtian Prison.

550
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:48,059
All the statement
is about Wu's family lobbying

551
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,820
and trying to gang up.

552
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,690
How about those civil servants
who are close to us?

553
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,740
They returned all the money.

554
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,540
I thought

555
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,890
I saved his life.

556
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,420
But now,

557
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,420
I owe him my life.

558
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,860
Dezhen has always been close
to the Dou family.

559
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,690
I bet Lord Dou

560
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,380
knows him very well.

561
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,860
Please spare his life.

562
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:34,420
Well, there's a line between public
and private interest.

563
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,190
Xingyi, don't worry.

564
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,510
Official Wu can also be assured.

565
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,010
It's nothing big.

566
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,559
Official Wu and I

567
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,380
will remember your favour.

568
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:47,420
On behalf of my student,

569
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,420
thank you.

570
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:51,650
Don't be.

571
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,020
Take care.

572
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:10,029
(Thorough Research and Deep Thinking)

573
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,170
Fifth Uncle.

574
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:15,330
I beg you to spare
Wu Shan and the Wu family.

575
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,869
Zhao, go back.

576
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,469
It's none of your business.

577
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,650
Ever since Wu Shan
was in the Shengtian Prefecture,

578
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,100
house servants of all civil servants

579
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,930
have been coming to Dou's family.

580
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,940
Lord Mu and Lord Zhao are here too.

581
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,770
We receive countless letters every day.

582
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,140
There is no way
they are letting it pass.

583
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:38,690
It's not good for a woman
to be too smart.

584
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,250
Having an affair

585
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:42,370
is merely a scandal for other families.

586
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,810
However,

587
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:47,290
the Wu family
has been in power for decades.

588
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:50,580
It's time to make way for other people.

589
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,330
The day when
the prosperous Wu family falls,

590
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,980
is the day you fulfill your ambition

591
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,940
and makes a name.

592
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,860
That's what you wanted
from the beginning, isn't it?

593
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,130
A gentleman planned his time

594
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,690
and acted when the time came.

595
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,860
Going against God's will

596
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,900
is not going to end well.

597
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,010
Fifth Uncle,

598
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,420
please!

599
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,100
Spare Wu Shan!

600
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,920
(Perpetual Bloom)

601
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,010
Fourth Young Lady.

602
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:40,159
We've got a reply from Mr. Chen.

603
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,540
Lord Song has regained consciousness.

604
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,170
It's good that he's awake.

605
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,100
I heard that when Lord Song woke up

606
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,610
and learned about the bloody garment,

607
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,919
he wanted to go
to the Shengtian Prefecture

608
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,119
to clear Mr. Wu's name.

609
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,260
No!

610
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,420
If he goes now,

611
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,290
he'll end up the same as Wu Shan.

612
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,650
Fifth Uncle, Song Yichun,

613
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:04,100
or the mastermind
behind Duke of Ding's case,

614
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,060
they all wanted both of them to be dead.

615
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,940
Even Yan Chaoqing can't persuade him.

616
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:09,460
And you were grounded.

617
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,300
Ms. Longevity.

618
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,780
Ms. Longevity.

619
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,060
I'm late.

620
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,969
I didn't expect so much would happen

621
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,480
during my trip to Chanxi.

622
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,330
I know you've suffered.

623
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,689
How's the injury?

624
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:54,930
Let me take a look.

625
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,260
It's all for the future
of the Dou family.

626
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,860
Just a little flesh wound. It's nothing.

627
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,530
Ms. Longevity.

628
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,460
I only just found out about this.

629
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,949
If I were here,

630
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,810
I would never let them hurt you.

631
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,940
Mr. Wu's condition is worse
in the prison.

632
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:14,730
Father always thinks highly of him.

633
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,810
Why don't you visit him?

634
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,220
It's been over ten years.

635
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,739
I've returned to you once again.

636
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,119
(Perpetual Bloom)

637
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,940
In return, what did I get?

638
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:34,290
Slaps and foot punishment.

639
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,090
Father.

640
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,380
Will I

641
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,020
be grounded forever?

642
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,170
That's not possible.

643
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,010
It'll be lifted.

644
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:53,380
It'll be lifted now.

645
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,159
Lord Song.

646
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,330
If you turn yourself in now,
we'll lose everything we've done.

647
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,060
Dezhen is weak.

648
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,530
He won't be able to withstand Shengtian
Prefecture's trap and punishment.

649
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,250
I can't let him suffer for me.

650
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,279
I'll turn myself in.

651
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,690
I have a way to end this.

652
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:42,909
(It's windy and snowy.)

653
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,050
(What are you doing here?)

654
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,639
(Your legs are severely injured.)

655
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,880
(Do you want to lose your legs?)

656
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,130
You promised me.

657
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,540
If I saved you,

658
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,650
you'll cherish this life

659
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,940
and fight to stay alive.

660
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,020
At this point in time,

661
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,940
there's no way you could save Wu Shan.

662
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,759
Instead, you'll give
those hiding in the dark

663
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,500
a chance to accuse you more.

664
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,020
Your closed ones will be hurt
and your enemies will be laughing.

665
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,279
Let me.

666
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,279
Don't move.

667
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,420
You'll scratch it again.

668
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:31,580
Didn't you say so?

669
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,599
In the eyes of a physician,

670
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,980
it's just a body.

671
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,130
There's no gender boundary.

672
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:38,210
Why are you shy?

673
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,029
I injured my legs,

674
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,580
not my hands.

675
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,690
They said it was a foot punishment,

676
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,420
but actually, they were aiming
for something else

677
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,210
so they didn't beat me hard.

678
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,610
My legs will be fine.

679
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,330
How about you?

680
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,260
Let me see.

681
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,220
Why is the Wu family

682
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:17,810
will be involved in something
between you and me?

683
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,460
When they were punishing me
at the ancestral hall,

684
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:23,509
Fifth Uncle purposely sent the news
to the Wu family

685
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:25,100
and made the fake blood garment.

686
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,100
Wu Shan was framed for imprisonment

687
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,730
because of me.

688
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,639
I've sent people to check
what's going on at the Shengtian Prison.

689
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,210
The confession is all about gang up.

690
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,580
I didn't realize so much had happened

691
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,650
in the few days I'd been in bed.

692
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,610
What Fifth Uncle has said enlighten me.

693
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,540
A gentleman planned his time

694
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,160
and acted when the time came.

695
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:48,980
Going against God's will

696
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,290
is not going to end well.

697
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,330
This case

698
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,879
is not about having an affair.

699
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,940
It's about Li Zhen's rebellion
in Liaodong.

700
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,980
Should we fight or make peace?

701
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,380
What is the situation in Liaodong?

702
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,250
Official Wu and the rest in the Cabinet
advise to start a war.

703
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,239
They even use the ancestral's motto.

704
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,159
We will speak
even if it means death to us.

705
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,420
His Majesty doesn't want to start a war
with Li Zhen.

706
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,690
After all, there's a financial deficit.

707
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,940
The country has no marshals.

708
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,730
His Majesty doesn't want to go to war?

709
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,420
Liaodong has no troops

710
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,689
and no experience in war.

711
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,330
The country is running out of money,
it's difficult to start a long war.

712
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,900
Wu has a loyal heart.
He wanted to fight.

713
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,290
The more he speaks,

714
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:34,170
the harder for His Majesty
to get out of this.

715
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,060
Fifth Uncle has been
a humble servant for years,

716
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:40,130
but now he dares to sue the Wu family.

717
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,330
I bet he figured out
His Majesty's intention.

718
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:45,060
According to you,

719
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,210
Mr. Wu's advice is untimely.

720
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:48,580
He's not going to make it.

721
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,780
I'm afraid

722
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:53,020
this will be a tough one.

723
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,290
If they can put aside right and wrong,
honor and disgrace,

724
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,250
we might be able to solve this.

725
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:09,540
The root cause is between
Old Master Wu and His Majesty.

726
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,639
The most unpredictable thing
in the world

727
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,100
is the human heart.

728
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,949
If I were to do it again,

729
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:34,500
I'm afraid
I couldn't stay out of it too.

730
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:36,279
I'd rather die

731
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,770
than admit this false accusation.

732
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,220
Beheaded!

♪I lean in and gaze at you
as calm as serene waves♪

734
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:49,570

and turbulent world♪

735
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:54,120
