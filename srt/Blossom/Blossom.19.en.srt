1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,440
(Cui's Residence)

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,390
Since you've decided,

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,790
I'll let you do what you want.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,110
Your mother said

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,120
there was no right or wrong
when it came to choices.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,200
If it was sincerely what you wanted

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,680
and a decision you wouldn't regret,

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,550
she would surely support you.

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,800
She also never regretted
marrying your father.

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,480
Guqiu's spirit

11
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,950
will be happier than I do

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,200
if she knows
you've found a suitable husband.

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,350
Thanks to her,

14
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,459
my career as an official

15
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,870
has been smooth sailing.

16
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,459
I prepared 12 boxes of jewellery

17
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,670
for your dowry.

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,160
I won't let you embarrass yourself.

19
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,539
Uncle,

20
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,310
I have enough dowry.

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,770
Diannan is a poor place
and it's tough being an official here.

22
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,969
You should leave it to Zhangru.

23
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,539
It's for you.

24
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,160
I have another batch prepared for Ru.

25
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,639
I'm fully prepared.

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,669
I bought a four-room house
that's facing South

27
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,860
in the Capital.

28
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,279
I'm just waiting to retire

29
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,660
and reunite with the family.

30
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,760
Father!

31
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,420
Ru!

32
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,140
- Ru!
- You are back!

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,839
Ms. Longevity is getting married.

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,980
Why haven't you found a husband?

35
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,780
If you keep dragging this,

36
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,610
you'll become an old single woman.

37
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,769
Come back to Diannan with me.

38
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:27,930
I'll find a husband for you.

39
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,999
If you keep looking,

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,260
I'll have buddies all over the place.

41
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,999
- Look...
- You are retiring soon.

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,639
Let's find one after you come back.

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,780
All right?

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,460
What's wrong?

45
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,180
What's wrong?

46
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,300
It's all thanks to
Zhao's husband's subordinates.

47
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,039
He was afraid that someone
might threaten the manor

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,039
and mistook me for the bad man.

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,020
Do I look like a bad person?

50
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,460
A little.

51
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,279
My heart...

52
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,519
Be careful.

53
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,399
My arm.

54
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,540
- Where did you hurt yourself?
- Everywhere.

55
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,820
Here and here.

56
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,420
(Uncle was supposed
to be a minor official)

57
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,260
(who was suppressed all the time.)

58
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,559
- (When I get married,)
-Here.

59
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,980
(he couldn't rest
and attend the wedding.)

60
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,670
- Father, you've worked hard.
- (His career is progressing well now)

61
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,140
(and he is reunited with his family.)

62
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,820
(That's great.)

63
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,529
Understand?

64
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,040
All right. Get married early.

65
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,820
Your Lordship.

66
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,110
How is it?

67
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,060
We've dug up
the Eastern and Western mountains,

68
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,500
but we still can't find anything.

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,079
There were a few floods here.

70
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,319
Even if it weren't destroyed,

71
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,119
it would've been moved.

72
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,890
Trying to find it in one night
is like finding a needle in a haystack.

73
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,740
Keep digging.

74
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,279
Yes.

75
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,279
Your Lordship,

76
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,439
why not forget about it?

77
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,849
It's going to rain soon.

78
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,220
There's a lot to prepare for the wedding.

79
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,260
Moreover, the Fourth Young Lady said

80
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,580
it wasn't important.

81
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,879
I might be blindfolded,

82
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,100
but I could hear

83
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,460
how crucial it was

84
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,060
when she said that.

85
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,420
I don't want her to have any regrets.

86
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,440
This is...

87
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,100
This is used underneath the wine jars.

88
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,300
Someone moved it.

89
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,400
Lu Ming.

90
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,580
Go and investigate
who was in charge of this garrison.

91
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,759
=Blossom=
(Adapted from the novel "Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

92
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,980
=Episode 19=

93
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,140
No. Further to the right.

94
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,239
Straighten the flower.

95
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,380
Yes.

96
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,340
That's more like it.

97
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,460
There's indeed a bad person
trying to cause trouble.

98
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,340
Both of you, come down.

99
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,919
Does he look like a bad person?

100
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,839
Yes.

101
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,959
Extremely.

102
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,500
Wait for me to count to three

103
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,900
and let's attack together.

104
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,180
Three!

105
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,220
Where is he?

106
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,180
Why did you attack me?

107
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,020
That's what I should ask you.

108
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,119
What are you trying to do

109
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,159
by sneaking around the estate

110
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,380
alone?

111
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,300
Who are you?

112
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,900
I am Zhao Zhangru.

113
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:11,879
Dou Zhao's cousin.

114
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,060
Who are you?

115
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,740
Forgive me.

116
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,700
You are from the Zhao family?

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,220
In that case,

118
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,119
please give this

119
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,239
to the newly-wed couple, Miss Zhao.

120
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,860
Tell them it's from Chen Jia.

121
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,689
I wish Lord Song and his wife
a happy ever after

122
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,300
and give birth to children soon.

123
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,500
What a weird person.

124
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,380
Miss Zhao.

125
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,660
What's wrong?

126
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,209
A bad person attacked me

127
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,100
and gave Ms. Longevity a gift.

128
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,079
He was weird and mysterious.

129
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,300
A man called Chen Jia.

130
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,820
Chen Jia?

131
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,420
Mr. Chen was here?

132
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,020
Shadow Guard?

133
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,640
No wonder he was acting sneakily
even though he was giving a gift.

134
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,839
That was weird.

135
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,799
Why did he give
a broken jade pomegranate?

136
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,260
Right? How weird.

137
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,420
I broke it.

138
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,100
(Cui's Residence)

139
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,879
- What's going on?
- It has been so long.

140
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,159
The auspicious hour is over.

141
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,900
Where is the escort team?

142
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,860
Let's wait for a while more.

143
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,060
How is it? Is he here?

144
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,979
We asked the men to run two li

145
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,540
but they didn't see the escort.

146
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,300
So unlucky?

147
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,100
She was replaced the last time.

148
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,260
This time,
they're breaking off the engagement.

149
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,799
Why are you still in the mood to eat?

150
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,140
Think of something.

151
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,420
As long as there isn't a catastrophe,

152
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,140
we still need to eat.

153
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,889
Moreover, I'm sure

154
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,900
he was held up by something.

155
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,900
- Lord Song.
- Lord Song.

156
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,879
- Lord Song.
- Lord Song.

157
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,650
- This is urgent. Move.
- It's not right.

158
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,060
Lord Song!

159
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,159
Sorry.

160
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,599
This is against the ritual.

161
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,959
This won't do, Lord Song!

162
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,839
Song Mo.

163
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,919
You just came in like this?

164
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,890
It's against the ritual.

165
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,839
Lord Zhao.

166
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,670
I have something urgent
to find Ms. Longevity.

167
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,879
The escort will arrive soon.

168
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,200
You missed the auspicious hour.

169
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,990
Are you trying
to force your way through now?

170
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,700
I'm sorry.

171
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,340
- Lord Song!
- How can he be so rude?

172
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,780
Stop him!

173
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,740
You can't go inside! Come back!

174
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,860
We'll wait for 15 more minutes.

175
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,100
If he isn't here,

176
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,780
I'll go and find him.

177
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,620
You'll go and find him?

178
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,660
Can I come in?

179
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,359
Dou Zhao.

180
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,500
No way.

181
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,419
No groom
enters a bridal chamber directly.

182
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,539
It's against the ritual.

183
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,999
You are late for an hour.

184
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,550
You said you'd marry Miss Dou.

185
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,239
- Song Mo, go away!
- Why are you so rude?

186
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,439
Dou Zhao, trust me.

187
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,879
- Just open a gap.

but the true meaning

320
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,399
is that Dou Zhao is a vulgar woman

321
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,980
who is kind of the surface
but a wolf at heart.

Duke of Ying, heed the decree.

345
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,980
By Heaven's mandate,
the emperor's edict is as follows.

346
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,919
Duke of Ying's eldest son
and Dou family's fourth daughter

347
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,540

I heard Duke of Ying
is good at playing the Sheng.

I'm sure you know

357
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,340
that no matter
how well the Sheng sounds,

358
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,300
it still won't be better than
when it is played with the bell.

359
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,551
A good father and a filial son
live in harmony

360
00:18:44,552 --> 00:18:45,679
is the only way

361
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,460

for five generations.

00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,940
Hurry!

369
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,380
This is rare.

370
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,940
Leading a donkey on Changle Street?

371
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,780
Yizhi Hall has no donkey shed for you.

372
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,279
Today is His Lordship's wedding.

373
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,900
No one can enter.

374
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,809
I am the bride's good friend.

375
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,020
I'm here to attend the banquet.

376
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,589
However, merchants

377
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,910
cannot wear silk
and ride a horse carriage.

378
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,620
Do you have an invitation?

379
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,800
I have too many goods.

380
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,969
When I find the invitation,
I might miss the banquet.

381
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,509
A merchant lady is a good friend
of His Lordship's wife?

382
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,100
I am the childhood friend
of the Jade Emperor.

383
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,420
You're looking down on others.

384
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,300
Second Young Master.

385
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,540
What's wrong with being a merchant?

386
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,500
She makes money with her own wisdom.

387
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,100
She's a lot better than
the flunkies of big families.

388
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,310
I am Song Han.

389
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,390
I've heard my sister-in-law was close
to the daughter of the great merchants

390
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,260
of the Miao family.

391
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,100
You must be

392
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,940
Young Lady Miao.

393
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,900
Thank you, Second Young Master.

394
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,119
These are all Zhao's personal assets.

395
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,780
I don't know how I should...

396
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,740
Here you go.

397
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,500
Your face.

398
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,639
Someone, move the boxes
to the inner courtyard.

399
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,780
Yes.

400
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,260
Hurry.

401
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,380
Thank you, Young Lady.

402
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,500
I'll ask someone to bring you
to the inner hall to wash up.

403
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,479
Don't worry.

404
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,460
I won't let you
miss the cross-cupped wine ritual.

405
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,820
Thank you, Young Master.

406
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:57,349
Lift the veil!

407
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,940
Lift the veil!

408
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,900
Great!

409
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,159
The groom must sit on the veil.

410
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,599
In the future, you will
always suppress the bride.

411
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,660
The wife follows the husband.

412
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,140
My residence has no such rule.

413
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,020
My wife and I are equal.

414
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,599
Please skip

415
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,060
every ritual of this kind.

416
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,620
That's...

417
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,839
Respecting and loving each other

418
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,620
is the way a relationship can last long.

419
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:31,479
Right!

420
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,260
Serve the cross-cupped wine.

421
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,620
Seems like someone
who cares not about rules.

422
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,079
Yantang is suppressed by her.

423
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,580
No one knows what the residence
will become in the future.

424
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,900
The newlyweds hold the cup
and drink with respect to each other.

425
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,340
From now on, husband and wife are one
and share weal and woe.

426
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,879
Tying each other's hair into a knot.

427
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,280
Informing each other
of the intention to grow old together.

428
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,399
Great!

429
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,719
From now on,

430
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,999
both of you will live in harmony

431
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,700
until you grow old.

432
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,639
The ritual is completed!

433
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,319
- Great!
- Great!

434
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,169
Let's go and drink!

435
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,239
- Lord Song, let's go and drink.
- Let's go.

436
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,079
- Let's go.
- Let's drink.

437
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,560
Yantang.

438
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:34,940
My wife has something to say.

439
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,759
- Quick!
- Come back early.

440
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,260
I have something to give you.

441
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,319
- All right. I'll come back soon.
- Talk after you come back.

442
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,439
Let's go and drink.

443
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,479
Let's go.

444
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,620
Let's drink.

445
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,119
We won't let you come back
unless you're drunk.

446
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,260
Quick!

447
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,540
Yantang has changed.

448
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,839
Madam Jiang used to say

449
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,769
this child was careless.

450
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,319
He would either wear the wrong clothes

451
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,140
or wear unmatched shoes or socks.

452
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,639
Today, he has finally met

453
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,820
the person he loves.

454
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,199
The ritual can progress smoothly

455
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,700
thanks to you, Grand Princess.

456
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,700
Take a seat.

457
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,639
Think of me as shamelessly asking you

458
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,340
to bless me by pressing the bed.

459
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,620
Come here.

460
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,260
Sit down.

461
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,879
This ritual requires a blessed person
who has a good marriage

462
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,540
with a son and a daughter.

463
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,119
I have no son and no daughter

464
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,660
and have lived alone
for more than a decade.

465
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,100
I think

466
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,300
someone who can live freely
and be at ease

467
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,020
is a blessed person.

468
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,599
I finally know

469
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,940
why Yantang loves you so much.

470
00:23:45,648 --> 00:23:46,828
What did you say?

471
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,319
The Duke welcomed Dou Zhao

472
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,060
into his family happily?

473
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,119
I said it clearly in my letter.

474
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,639
Dou Zhao is a rude brat

475
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,420
who cannot be educated.

476
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,399
Perhaps the Duke

477
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,900
was dull

478
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,959
and couldn't understand you.

479
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,220
Is it my fault
for not writing the letter clearly?

480
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,780
It seems like the Duke

481
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,140
is a foolish father who lacks sense.

482
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,060
No wonder he couldn't
win against his son.

483
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,140
(Yizhi Hall)

484
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,319
I couldn't trust Lord Song previously.

485
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,519
But it seems like

486
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,199
he is really nice to Zhao.

487
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,399
I feel happy for Zhao.

488
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,940
Me too.

489
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,479
However, I envy her as well.

490
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,180
It's not easy to find a good man.

491
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,919
When can I finally find one,

492
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,060
Su?

493
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,200
You are siblings,

494
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:44,180
but your accuracy
in Chinese Checkers is so bad.

495
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,140
You've lost three games consecutively.

496
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,239
It's embarrassing
to wear this jade belt.

497
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,620
Why not give it to me instead
as a prize?

498
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,879
It's just his bad luck.

499
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,760
I can help Second Young Master
win against you.

500
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,799
Second Young Master,
you are bad at Chinese Checkers

501
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,279
but your luck with women is good.

502
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,980
Even a merchant is trying to help you.

503
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,160
His Majesty gave me this belt.

504
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,959
Young Master Mu,
if you want it as a prize,

505
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,290
are you disrespecting His Majesty?

506
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,860
So what?

507
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,039
Second Young Master
is good at swordplay.

508
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,260
Why don't we do swordplay
while reciting poems?

509
00:25:18,312 --> 00:25:19,892
The last time I see you do that,

510
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,740
"Wearing the stone orchid
and the Duheng herb,

511
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,960
plucking a fresh flower
to express my longing for you."

512
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:26,020
The swordplay for that poem was good.

513
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,679
I despise people
who talk about your background.

514
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,680
You act arrogant
and think you're high and mighty.

515
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,940
That's right!

516
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,500
What does the poem mean?

517
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,919
- Stop talking.
- She doesn't know "Mountain Spirit"?

518
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,700
The Lord's wife has a friend like that?

519
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,039
I know the Mountain Spirit!

520
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,959
I know Qu Yuan as well!

521
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,470
I don't know it when they are combined!

522
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,610
I don't know it, so what?

523
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,890
Isn't it good enough
that the rice dumplings are delicious

524
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,639
and the wine is good?

525
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,279
You want to play
Chinese Checkers, right?

526
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,420
Fine.

527
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,100
Let me play with you.

528
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,580
Dou Zhao grows up in a manor.

529
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,580
Is she as rude as you?

530
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,519
I...

531
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,700
(Find the Truth)

532
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,679
My Lordship, be careful of the stairs.

533
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,820
Song Mo.

534
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,700
Song Mo, don't go.

535
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,540
I can't drink.

536
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,759
Yes, Your Highness.

537
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,060
How can the Young General

538
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,220
lose when it comes to drinking?

539
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,790
Keep drinking!

540
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,199
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

541
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,250
Look at Song Mo.

542
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,430
- Your Highness.
- He will vomit if he keeps drinking.

543
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,580
My wife.

544
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,919
Dou Zhao is waiting for you.

545
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,300
I understand.

546
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,639
Go back.

547
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,919
- Be careful, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

548
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,020
- Let's keep drinking.
- Enjoy, Your Highness!

549
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,079
- Let's go.
- Come on.

550
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,220
This way.

551
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,820
Let's drink!

552
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,540
You are only
thinking about Dou Zhao now.

553
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,599
A buddy who is married

554
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,180
is no longer loyal.

555
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,199
You are busy training the troops

556
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,620
and are married.

557
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,359
I don't think there's a chance

558
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,540
to drink like this anymore
in the future.

559
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,740
You told me yourself.

560
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,740
A woman will have a huge grudge
if you make her wait.

561
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,820
Do you not care about
your buddy's grudge then?

562
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,380
You just value her more than us.

563
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,580
Congratulations on your marriage,
Your Lordship.

564
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,460
Thank you, Your Lordship.

565
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,639
Thank you, Your Lordship.

566
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,780
You may leave.

567
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,780
Ms. Longevity.

568
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,260
Ms. Longevity.

569
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,940
Come here.

570
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,940
Why are you here?

571
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,790
Shush.

572
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,100
Come here.

573
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,580
Your Highness.

574
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,919
We've searched all over Yizhi Hall.

575
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,300
We didn't find the letter.

576
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,900
- Yes!
- Yes!

577
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,839
A few days ago, hidden scouts discovered the
messenger who sent the letter to Uncle

578
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,300
was brought to Eastern Palace indeed.

579
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,820
His fate is unknown

580
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,340
and the letter is missing.

581
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,160
Are you suspecting His Highness?

582
00:28:25,088 --> 00:28:26,399
He has been suspicious of me

583
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,559
and kept testing me.

584
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,260
He must have a secret.

585
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,380
We still don't know whether people inside
or outside the residence

586
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,740
is friend or foe.

587
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,500
It's so dangerous.

588
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,420
Aren't you afraid that I might run away?

589
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,020
I was just joking.

590
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,540
You amaze me, dear.

591
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,820
Let me remove your crown for you.

592
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,340
You are so pretty, my dear.

593
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,260
Come with me.

594
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,700
Sit down.

595
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,820
I have something to give you.

596
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,020
I hid it for many years.

597
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,980
I'm sure you want to see it as well.

598
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,780
Wait for me.

599
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,820
Don't peek.

600
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,820
I obtained a storybook
called Records of the Enlightened Age.

601
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,980
This is the chart
that is recorded inside.

602
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,700
The story matches
the current situation.

603
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,820
In Records of the Enlightened Age,

604
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,520
Lord Qing will commit treason
in the 27th year of the Chengping era

605
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,020
which is next year.

606
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,820
As expected of

607
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,340
the female Zhuge Liang I married
after visiting Zhending three times.

608
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,079
Did I not make myself clear?

609
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,620
This is treason.

610
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,300
Why do you look so indifferent?

611
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,360
It's not that I feel indifferent.

612
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,580
His Majesty only has two sons.

613
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,639
Who ascends the throne

614
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,940
is still undecided.

615
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,820
Even if Lord Qing
is going to rule the land,

616
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,140
it's also

617
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,820
not surprising, right?

618
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,660
You are right.

619
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,999
However, the issue

620
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,709
is not with Lord Qing
or the crown prince

621
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,100
but you.

622
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,689
You have control
of the Imperial Guard now.

623
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,900
No one can go against you.

624
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,279
What they need to do now

625
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,879
is to get your support

626
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,180
or overturn you.

627
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,140
Thank you
for telling me everything honestly.

628
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,620
However, there's no rush about this.

629
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,180
Today

630
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,060
is our wedding.

631
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,279
Yes.

632
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,479
It's all my fault.

633
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,519
I always want to tell you

634
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,140
everything on my mind.

635
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,820
I didn't take note of the time.

636
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,220
There's no rush indeed.

637
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,620
You haven't eaten the whole day.

638
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,940
I'm sure you are starving.

639
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,940
Let me order the kitchen
to make you some food.

640
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,620
There's no need.

641
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,919
I don't want the servants to think

642
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,940
you've married a wife who is a glutton.

643
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,919
Sure.

644
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,060
I'll cook for you.

645
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,159
Let me grill it.

646
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,660
Your hand is injured.

647
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,660
It's all right.

648
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,860
Let me do it.

649
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,660
A year ago,

650
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,740
you were threatening me
with a sword on my neck.

651
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,980
I didn't expect us

652
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,820
to become a family a year later.

653
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,140
A family.

654
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,940
I grew up with my uncle
in the military camp.

655
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,180
I don't know
how it feels to be with a family.

656
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,780
Until I see Uncle and Aunt together,

657
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,260
I finally understood

658
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,020
that a family should look like them.

659
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,980
What about the Duke's Residence?

660
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,140
I mean when Madam Jiang was still alive.

661
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,620
Back then,

662
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,860
I also didn't have a family.

663
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,900
Me too.

664
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,620
When I was young, I saw other people
having three members in their families.

665
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,980
I was wondering

666
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,580
why Mother would abandon me

667
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,940
and why I couldn't stop it.

668
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,500
When I couldn't figure it out,

669
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,580
I would hide in the hills.

670
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,319
I saw Gao Laozhuang's chubby wife

671
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,820
chasing after him after he got drunk.

672
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,540
Everyone from the estate
would come out and watch.

673
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,719
I also saw

674
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:37,319
how a mover would buy
two biscuits for his daughter

675
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,900
after he walked the streets.

676
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,340
After meeting many people
and experiencing many things,

677
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,740
I realised

678
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,820
there were

679
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,540
many kinds of families.

680
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,940
However, there are more good families
than the bad ones.

681
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,020
There are benefits
of growing up in the military camp too.

682
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,020
I learned how to be independent.

683
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,799
I'm best at making grilled fish.

684
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,020
It's my own recipe.

685
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,640
Try it.

686
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,839
I heard

687
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,980
you could slice a living fish
3,000 times

688
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,980
and it could still swim
after releasing it back into the water.

689
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,500
Is it true?

690
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,580
It's too late

691
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,980
to feel afraid now.

692
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,730
Ms. Longevity!

693
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,980
Zhangru.

694
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,620
Both of you are really here.

695
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,860
Don't cry.

696
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,740
Don't cry, Zhangru.

697
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,220
Don't cry.

698
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,220
All right.

699
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,500
Who bullied you?

700
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,679
Who could bully me?

701
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,140
I'm happy.

702
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,580
Ms. Longevity,

703
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,279
I'm 99% happy

704
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,460
that you're married today.

705
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,220
However, there's a little sadness.

706
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,279
It's hard to find a good man

707
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,460
to marry happily.

708
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,399
However, I think

709
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,679
I will never get married in my life.

710
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,079
There are many men in this world.

711
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,199
It's not difficult

712
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,540
to find a good one.

713
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,980
Your Lordship,

714
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,860
am I right?

715
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,100
Yes. Of course.

716
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,520
They are all capable soldiers
of the Imperial Guard.

717
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,679
They have a clean background, a military
position, and achievements in battle.

718
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,740
Most of them have
even been granted a title.

719
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,780
They won't do.

720
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,860
Those who are physically capable
are simple-minded.

721
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,799
Zhangru.

722
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,199
Just tell us

723
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,740
your requirements honestly.

724
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,959
Let His Lordship help you search.

725
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:08,980
There were also scholars
among the Imperial Guards.

726
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,460
Scholars?

727
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,679
No way.

728
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,170
They are always talking pedantically.

729
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,540
So annoying.

730
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,460
The person I like

731
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,860
must have a skill

732
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,740
and knows a bit of martial arts,

733
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,260
so he can protect me.

734
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,140
He needs to be handsome

735
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,100
and cool.

736
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,140
Most importantly,

737
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,420
he should be quite polite.

738
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,900
Forgive me.

739
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,740
You are from the Zhao family?

740
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,900
Zhangru.

741
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,260
Do you already have a candidate

742
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,340
for the person you like?

743
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,620
- I...
- Who is it?

744
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,799
Who is it?

745
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,639
No.

746
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,980
I was simply saying.

747
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,060
It's not even close.

748
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,700
Ms. Longevity.

749
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,660
I broke your gift
that blesses you with more children.

750
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,399
Don't worry. I fixed it for you.

751
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,220
Otherwise, you won't get many children.

752

(What is she talking about
in her sleep?)

753
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,620
Good morning, Your Lordship.

754
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:25,969
Your Lordship,

755
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:27,740
why did you come out from your study?

756
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,900
(Find the Truth)

757
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,420
Your Lordship.

758
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,740
Are you awake, Ms. Longevity?

759
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,380
Have you seen Ms. Longevity?

760
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,449
I haven't.

761
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:00,600
What's wrong?

762
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,860
The bride ran away last night?

763
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,940
Your Lordship.

764
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,260
Mr. Chen, where's my wife?

765
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,860
Come with me.

766
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,540
Your Lordship.

767
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,099
(Virtuous Wife,
Madam Jiang's Memorial Tablet)

768
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,240
Madam Jiang,

769
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,180
Dou Zhao should address you
as my mother-in-law today.

770
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,540
I'm sure you are surprised as well.

771
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,180
I actually married Yantang.

772
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,860
He was domineering at first.

773
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,740
I was afraid of him and avoided him.

774
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,940
Gradually,

775
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,500
I knew about the pain in his heart.

776
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,300
The death of the Duke of Ding
almost killed him.

777
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,100
Later, you passed away

778
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,340
and his father wanted to harm him.

779
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,239
Loyalty and filial piety
became blades that hurt him.

780
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,359
(Achievements Like Mountain)

781
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,860
Who wouldn't go mad
after experiencing all that?

782
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,580
Thankfully, he has endured everything.

783
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,940
I will always be by his side

784
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,300
and not let him repeat his mistakes.

785
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,980
In the future,

786
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,660
I will support Yantang

787
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,660
and help him fulfill his wish.
