1
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:09,839
This is Uncle's keepsake,

2
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:12,640
and also an old item belonging
to Your Majesty.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,160
Until his death,

4
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:18,120
he held it tightly in his hand.

5
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:21,200
If there's any suspicion
surrounding his death,

6
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:23,320
I ask Your Majesty
to investigate thoroughly.

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,119
Meisun,

8
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,680
I remember the Grand Mentor
was strict with me

9
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,079
(Young Emperor. Young Duke of Ding)
when we were studying back then.

10
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,359
(Young Emperor. Young Duke of Ding)
And you had all the freedom you wanted.

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,040
I even remember that one time

12
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:54,880
I asked you to sneak me
out of the palace.

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,000
Father was furious

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,759
and locked you up for days.

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,880
You were always protecting me
at the time.

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,120
It was your idea

17
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,519
but I was the one getting punished.

18
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,959
Time passes so quickly.

19
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,599
Now, you're the emperor

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,319
and it's my duty to serve the country
and the throne.

21
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,120
Meisun,

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,879
I'm lucky

23
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:26,200
to have you around.

24
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,120
See there?

25
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,760
Once we've reclaimed
the lost lands in the north,

26
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,640
we'll go there to watch the sunrise.

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,600
We haven't dealt with the pirates
in the southeast yet.

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,920
How can we focus on the north?

29
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,000
Even if we could reclaim
the north in the future,

30
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,680
or you're not afraid of my achievements
overshadowing the throne,

31
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,519
I still fear you would accuse me
of deceiving and betraying the emperor.

32
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,599
Don't get started with that.

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,760
Back in the Eastern Palace,

34
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,000
the Grand Mentor taught me
how to rule with this ruler.

35
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,120
Now that the Grand Mentor
has passed away,

36
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,560
I would still need you
to set me straight with this ruler

37
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,280
if I start making foolish decisions
in the future.

38
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,680
Jiang Meisun.

39
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

40
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:06,920
I'm granting you a special status.

41
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,759
You can enter the palace fully armed,
need not bow before me,

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,319
and no hierarchy between us.

43
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,640
Let alone the question
of deceiving and betraying the emperor.

44
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,320
If Your Majesty makes a mistake
in the future,

45
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,599
I won't hold back.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,800
Uncle always said

47
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,919
his biggest wish in life

48
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,879
was to pacify the pirates

49
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,720
and return to the capital

50
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,479
to have a proper chat with Your Majesty.

51
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,800
He's been saying that for fifteen years,

52
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,040
His feelings remained the same.

53
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,039
But when did

54
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,680
Your Majesty's heart start to change?

55
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,319
Or is it that the heart

56
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,639
of an emperor can't trust anyone?

57
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,879
Insolence!

58
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,520
Your Majesty.

59
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,200
Your Majesty.

60
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,919
Find out

61
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,120
who tortured

62
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,479
and killed Meisun.

63
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,639
Your Majesty.

64
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,719
Do not spare any one of them!

65
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,960
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

66
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,479
- Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

67
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,120
- Hurry! Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

68
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,520
Send Official Lu here quickly!

69
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:27,880
Your Majesty.

70
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,159
Take this rebellious brat away

71
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:31,599
from here!

72
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,920
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

73
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,500
=Blossom=
(Adapted from the novel "Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

74
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,420
=Episode 8=

75
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,839
Mother.

76
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,240
Bring it over.

77
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,480
How is she?

78
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,199
All of you can leave now.

79
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:21,839
Go.

80
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,439
Go.

81
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,279
I've talked to everyone in the capital

82
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,879
who has any say in this.

83
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,319
Luckily, His Majesty
regained consciousness in time.

84
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,720
Otherwise, the entire Song Clan

85
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,399
would likely be doomed.

86
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,120
What about the officials' memorials?

87
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,160
Especially
the Grand Secretariat's stance.

88
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:56,120
I can take it.

89
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:58,360
All right.

90
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,839
Don't get agitated.

91
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,797
There are still some people

92
00:06:01,798 --> 00:06:03,920
who defend the Duke of Ding
and Yuantang.

93
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,360
But some say

94
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,360
that though the Duke of Ding is dead,

95
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:09,279
his army still remains.

96
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,399
Now, Yuantang has become
the heart of the Ding Army.

97
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,959
He's even barged into the palace

98
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,959
and rebuked His Majesty.

99
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,560
What if he ever rises up in rebellion
to seek revenge?

100
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,800
If we don't deal with it properly now,

101
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,399
the consequences will be disastrous.

102
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,720
His Majesty
may have regained consciousness.

103
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,639
But he hasn't said a word
about Yuantang's sentencing.

104
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:45,000
We can only gamble
on His Majesty's decision for now.

105
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,600
Preserved fruits.

106
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,360
Give me one.

107
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,079
Slowly.

108
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,600
Why hasn't the new prescription shown

109
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,040
any improvement?

110
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,240
Someone!

111
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,467
Make sure the lady's medicine is brewed

112
00:07:12,468 --> 00:07:13,520
with a stronger dose.

113
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,520
Those in Futing have heard

114
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,439
about the Marshal's death.

115
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,360
If anything happens to Lord Song,

116
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,960
the army's morale will collapse.

117
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,800
Dou Shishu and his students
have been impeaching him nonstop.

118
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,519
If something happens to Lord Song,

119
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,480
I'll have the entire
Dou Family wiped out!

120
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,800
General Yan,

121
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,600
don't stay at this manor anymore

122
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,200
and follow me to the capital.

123
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,120
With our brothers from the Ding Army,

124
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,399
it might still be possible

125
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,600
to save Lord Song
if we try to break him out.

126
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,440
Lord Song has yet to be convicted.

127
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,399
If you do this,

128
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,279
it will be treason for real.

129
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,200
Even if the prison break succeeds,

130
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,960
what about the lives
of hundreds of people

131
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,040
from the Jiang and Song Clan?

132
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,199
Lord Song is in this situation

133
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,959
because you tricked him with your words!

134
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,880
If you dare to interfere again...

135
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,720
Rebelling against the emperor
and damaging the ruler's dignity.

136
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,839
According to the law,
that's punishable by death.

137
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,040
His Majesty hasn't dealt with it yet.

138
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:20,960
The Grand Secretariat has been debating
the punishment for days with no result.

139
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,480
Why do you think that happens,
General Yan?

140
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,679
His Majesty knows
the Marshal died unjustly

141
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,559
and is trying
to test the court's loyalty

142
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,759
by questioning Lord Song's case.

143
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,080
That's the first reason.

144
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,040
As long as the emperor feels guilty,

145
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,759
the power struggles in the court

146
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,720
will be handled
by Grand Secretary Wu and Wang Xingyi.

147
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,000
What about the second reason?

148
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,480
No matter how much His Majesty
values the Duke of Ding,

149
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,240
no one can resurrect a dead man.

150
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,400
Song Mo, the living one,
is the variable.

151
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,919
If you break him out of prison,

152
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,919
it will turn

153
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,320
His Majesty's loyal
and filial Young General

154
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,279
into a hateful rebel.

155
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,560
His Majesty has already sent
the Ministry of Imperial Ceremony

156
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,799
to Futing to investigate
the Duke of Ding's death.

157
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,180
Even the Earl of Yunyang
couldn't obtain any information

158
00:09:14,181 --> 00:09:15,559
from the Ministry of Imperial Ceremony.

159
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,039
How did you know about it?

160
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,400
General Yan, you have been staying
at my residence for several days.

161
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,519
You should know

162
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,480
I do not only have business in Futing.

163
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,400
I have long-standing clients
among high officials in the capital.

164
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:28,799
There are plenty of ways

165
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,960
to gather information.

166
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,759
Of course, I hope

167
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,799
that you're on our side.

168
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,720
If so,

169
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,840
here's the deal,

170
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,960
You'll follow us to the capital
and rescue Lord Song.

171
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,120
Once he's safely out of prison,

172
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,080
you can have Mr. Chen back.

173
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:52,320
Otherwise, Mr. Chen and I
will die together.

174
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:54,840
I won't be alone too.

175
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,600
No.

176
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,080
This is too dangerous.

177
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,640
It's precisely because it's dangerous.

178
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,960
I know you value loyalty

179
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,000
and wouldn't let Mr. Chen die

180
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,440
with us, right?

181
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,000
We're allies.

182
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,200
It's our obligation to save Lord Song.

183
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,399
But you threatened me in such a manner.

184
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,200
So that changes things.

185
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:25,440
I'm only a soldier.

186
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,000
So my actions and words
are far from elegant.

187
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,039
Fourth Young Lady, as an ally,

188
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,360
please save Lord Song.

189
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:37,399
Please come with us and save Lord Song.

190
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:42,679
I will accept

191
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,039
your request.

192
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:52,220
(Zhaowen Bookstore)

193
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,240
Young Lady,

194
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,559
threatening us with Mr. Chen

195
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:55,679
is not the act of a gentleman.

196
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,960
Besides, this is a risky mission.

197
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,919
I don't want Lord Song to die either.

198
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,519
(Zhao Liangbi)
Young Lady.

199
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,200
(Zhaowen Bookstore Manager)
Mr. Zhao.

200
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,600
I came here unexpectedly.

201
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,040
We've prepared everything needed.

202
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,208
For some news, we'll have to wait

203
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:07,200
for another one or two days.

204
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,799
It's just a few small paper shops.

205
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,759
They're acting
like they have spies everywhere.

206
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:11,879
General Yan,

207
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,679
this is about Lord Song's life.

208
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,399
This way, General Yan.

209
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,640
These goods are
for the Ministry of Imperial Ceremony.

210
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,920
The profit margin may be small.
But the quantity is large.

211
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:01,919
The real money comes

212
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,200
from this scrap paper.

213
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,640
The idea came from Young Lady,

214
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,680
to collect scrap paper
from all the residences in the capital.

215
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,880
After pulping and grinding it down,

216
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,720
we make it into toilet paper
and sell it to various residents.

217
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,960
The better-quality paper,

218
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,279
mixed with lime and scented oil,

219
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:13,799
goes to the palace's Paper Office.

220
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,399
This way,

221
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:18,000
all the news from the palace,
the ministries, the ministers,

222
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,519
and various shops

223
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,799
are all connected.

224
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,919
You're actually supplying

225
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,279
nearly all the paper used
in the capital.

226
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:34,519
But that's not the point here.

227
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,720
General Yan, please follow me.

228
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,240
Wisteria paper?

229
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,000
It's only regular paper.

230
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,799
But in this world,

231
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:54,519
only the emperor and Grand Secretariat
use wisteria paper

232
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:57,480
to write memorials and petitions.

233
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Your business even reached the emperor.

234
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,440
In business,

235
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,200
the most important thing is honesty.

236
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,799
Once you know someone's ability,
you'll know if they are trustworthy.

237
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,759
The physicians
who have been treating His Majesty

238
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:21,679
returned home last night.

239
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:22,760
His Majesty's health is stable.

240
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,720
The officials and the Grand Secretariat
have been at a standstill for days.

241
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,720
But His Majesty still hasn't issued
a verdict.

242
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:32,444
Things would be much easier

243
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:35,360
if we could just get a hint
of His Majesty's intentions.

244
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,399
Does that mean we just wait

245
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:39,760
and let Lord Song's fate
in prison remain uncertain?

246
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,240
You've been with Lord Song
for over ten years.

247
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:45,080
He's not someone who just sits back

248
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,799
and waits to die.

249
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,480
Before he barged into the palace,

250
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,640
he must have already figured out
a way to break through.

251
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:52,659
If you ask me,

252
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,179
since His Majesty fell ill
and started recovering,

253
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,819
he still hasn't sentenced Song Mo.

254
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,200
This shows
His Majesty doesn't want to kill him.

255
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:02,340
We should hear something
from the palace within three days.

256
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:05,819
So let's all wait a little longer.

257
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:07,000
That's the Imperial Prison.

258
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,340
Those who killed the Marshal

259
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,059
will do everything they can
to make sure Lord Song dies in there.

260
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:13,659
I've already come up with a plan

261
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:15,140
and sent Su Lan to handle it.

262
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,120
Just be patient a bit longer.

263
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,800
That's enough.

264
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,319
What you did is a capital offense.

265
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,520
To the court officials,

266
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,199
it looks like you
and your uncle are in this together,

267
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,679
and it's hard to avoid
suspicion of treason.

268
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,400
If you write a confession,

269
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,199
give in, and admit your mistake
to His Majesty,

270
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,959
you might have a chance
to plead for mercy.

271
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,760
Don't you agree?

272
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:02,839
There are 720 pressure points
in the human body

273
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:05,400
and 78 joints.

274
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,160
He doesn't even know
where it hurts the most.

275
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:11,079
Eunuch Wang,

276
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,240
do you need my help
to teach your subordinate?

277
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:17,880
I see.

278
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,359
It seems there's no point
in saying more.

279
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,400
It's time for things to get serious now.

280
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,960
Is this really necessary to be jailed

281
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,479
for such a petty crime?

282
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:47,240
Eunuch Wang,

283
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,839
are you using torture?

284
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:51,640
Sorry to disturb you.

285
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:52,479
You can continue.

286
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:55,559
I'll just watch from here. Go on.

287
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:01,280
Earl of Yunyang,

288
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,359
why are you...

289
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:07,439
Look what I have here.

290
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,400
The official paper
the Court of Judicial Review issued.

291
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,839
There's nothing I can do

292
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,080
if the Court of Judicial Review wants
to imprison me.

293
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,520
Song Mo's treason is clear

294
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,559
and death is inevitable.

295
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,880
Are you going

296
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,240
to die along with him?

297
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,479
What's wrong with me wanting to?

298
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:25,240
You won't let me into prison.

299
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,160
Are there no laws anymore?

300
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,359
Let's go to my aunt's place
and reason this out.

301
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,240
As long as you want this.

302
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,760
Open the door.

303
00:16:57,359 --> 00:16:59,559
These servants dared to go this far.

304
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:02,120
Luckily, I brought the medicine.

305
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,480
Where's the medicine box? Bring it in!

306
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,079
How is

307
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,559
His Majesty?

308
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:14,159
He woke up two days ago.

309
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,599
But he still needs to rest.

310
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:17,960
I tried to see him.

311
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,680
But my aunt sent me away.

312
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,240
Mr. Wu and the others
didn't get to see him.

313
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,040
Even the Crown Prince was scolded

314
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,440
when he went to tend to him.

315
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,399
How did you manage to get in?

316
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:33,559
Easy.

317
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,520
I picked on someone I didn't like

318
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:36,760
and beat him up.

319
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:47,919
Who hit me?

320
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,119
Me.

321
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,520
You're too caught up in the situation.

322
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,280
Even your female teacher sees things
more clearly than you do.

323
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:00,240
Female teacher?

324
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:03,879
You mean Fourth Young Lady Dou?

325
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:05,359
She sent you here?

326
00:18:05,879 --> 00:18:06,440
Yes.

327
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,240
Or else I would not have come here.

328
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,480
I've been running around Qianqing Palace
like a headless chicken.

329
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,960
Aunt keeps avoiding
and refusing to see me.

330
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:12,720
Aunt.

331
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,359
Song Mo didn't mean
to disrespect the emperor.

332
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,720
He did it out of loyalty
and filial piety.

333
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,919
Please spare him this time, Aunt.

334
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:17,760
- Send him away.
- Aunt!

335
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,040
I assure you that he won't do it again!

336
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,599
Aunt!

337
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,399
All thanks to a eunuch
from the Paper Office

338
00:18:21,879 --> 00:18:23,040
who delivered me this embroidered pouch.

339
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,079
He said a lady from a bookstore gave it.

340
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:27,319
I can tell

341
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,440
the only one who could come up
with this idea

342
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:30,879
is that female teacher of yours.

343
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,919
(Stay in prison after request papers from the Court of Judicial Review.)
She told you to remain in prison

344
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,960
after requesting for official paper
from the Court of Judicial Review?

345
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:37,839
Yes.

346
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,720
As long as I'm here,

347
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,760
no one would dare to harm you.

348
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:46,800
Do you really think

349
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,639
she would dare send this out

350
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:52,200
with her "exceptional"
embroidery skills?

351
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,720
This embroidery

352
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,639
is quite unique.

353
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:01,879
Tell me

354
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,399
what this is.

355
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,119
She's mocking me.

356
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,440
At a time
when half the court wants you dead,

357
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:17,359
she had the eunuch
from the Paper Office deliver things.

358
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:19,200
That's a task that puts lives at risk.

359
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,680
Anyone who helps you like this

360
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,319
is truly a person of chivalry.

361
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,020
(Zhaowen Bookstore)

362
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,680
Sir.

363
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:34,200
This is...

364
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,879
Keep it safe.

365
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,680
I cannot help with matters
like the embroidered pouch again.

366
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:45,960
Over the last couple of days,
His Majesty has only met with Mr. Wu

367
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,480
and some officials
from the Grand Secretariat.

368
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,960
Most of the time,
he either writes his official decrees

369
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,079
or stares blankly at that broken ruler.

370
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,879
Beyond that,

371
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,599
I'm afraid I can't say more.

372
00:19:58,599 --> 00:19:59,520
Thank you, sir.

373
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,359
All right.

374
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:07,200
Young Lady.

375
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,505
The enemy is in the dark,
but we are in the light.

376
00:20:21,506 --> 00:20:22,560
We can't afford to wait any longer!

377
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,640
I've already had my men set up an ambush

378
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:28,080
around the Northern Pacification Bureau.

379
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,520
Fireworks will signal the time,
and we'll act at midnight.

380
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,200
General Yan,

381
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,359
please wait one more day.

382
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,760
We've waited for three days.

383
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,200
Do we still have to wait?

384
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,879
Are you planning

385
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:40,240
to delay us on purpose?

386
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,720
The situation has already turned around.

387
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,720
His life is hanging by the thread.

388
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,680
We cannot wait anymore.

389
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,960
We must save Lord Song.

390
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,839
Your action will only send
Lord Song to his death.

391
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:50,639
A bunch of fools.

392
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:51,440
What did you say?

393
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,040
She said, your foolishness
is beyond saved.

394
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,280
You!

395
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:53,800
Enough.

396
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,440
Since you want to save Lord Song.

397
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,119
I'll show you something.

398
00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:07,440
Stay still!

399
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,079
Dou Zhao,

400
00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:10,559
what's the meaning of this?

401
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,480
I'm tired.
I don't want to waste time explaining.

402
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,599
Lock them in the coal shed.

403
00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:14,280
You!

404
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:14,919
Dou Zhao!

405
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:16,680
My apologies, gentlemen.

406
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,280
Move it!

407
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,240
Quickly now!

408
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:20,720
Move!

409
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,440
As the head of the Ministry of Rites,

410
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,520
you should have entered
the Grand Secretariat by now.

411
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:32,680
But Official Wu feels

412
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,559
you're still too inexperienced.

413
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,879
Since he's the one in charge
of the Grand Secretariat.

414
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
You must understand that.

415
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,079
I really have no accomplishments

416
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:46,919
to convince them.

417
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,559
Official Wu is experienced and wise.

418
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,760
I completely agree with him.

419
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,680
Grand Princess Shude once said

420
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,159
you are a versatile talent.

421
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,680
I will definitely use you.

422
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,760
For example,

423
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,079
Song Mo is awaiting trial
in prison right now.

424
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:06,760
The six ministries and nine ministers,

425
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,040
including your students,

426
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,760
are all sending petitions
for his death sentence.

427
00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:13,760
What do you think of this?

428
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:23,040
Song Mo is a renowned general,

429
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,760
known for his victories.

430
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:27,200
No one among the younger generation
can match him.

431
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,119
If we kill such a pillar of the court,

432
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,760
it will certainly demoralize
the Three Armies.

433
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,319
But the Ding Army has been stationed

434
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:36,680
in Futing for too long

435
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,280
and is beyond the court's control.

436
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,680
They've become reckless,

437
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,680
even leaving the camp without decree

438
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:44,079
and coming to the capital.

439
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,599
I mean,

440
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:57,159
even if Song Mo has been disrespectful,

441
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,599
he is likely being provoked
by his subordinates.

442
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:08,720
So we have to deal with the trouble
at its source.

443
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,159
I'll let you handle this matter.

444
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,879
I shall comply, Your Majesty.

445
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,040
By the will of Heaven,
the Emperor decrees,

446
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:25,119
the auspicious signs are here.

447
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:27,879
The era name is changed to "Fengming."

448
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,440
Today, a special pardon

449
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,000
is granted to Song Mo,
the legitimate son of Duke of Ying,

450
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,760
and Gu Yu, the Earl of Yunyang.

451
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,000
Song Mo is removed
from his military duties

452
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:42,159
and expected to reflect on your actions.

453
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,960
This is the emperor's will.

454
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,200
Eunuch Wang,

455
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,480
why a special pardon?

456
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,599
Do you not know?

457
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,359
Today, His Majesty held a grand ceremony

458
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,280
to announce the change in era

459
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,399
and grant amnesty to all.

460
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,399
Thus, a special pardon.

461
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,720
But what about Duke of Ding's injustice?

462
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,720
What about the Jiang Clan's fate?

463
00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:24,079
The Jiang Family is spared from death

464
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:25,520
but demoted to commoners.

465
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,480
The men will be exiled to Tieling,

466
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,240
and the women and children
will be sent back to their homeland.

467
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:33,440
His Majesty has been very merciful.

468
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:34,599
Lord Song,

469
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:36,639
go home and recuperate.

470
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,440
Since you've been pardoned,

471
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,120
I'm sure your parents
will come to pick you up.

472
00:24:53,399 --> 00:24:54,000
Your Lordship.

473
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,660
(Lyu Zheng, Butler
in Duke of Ying's Residence)

474
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:57,079
The Duke can't come in person.

475
00:24:57,319 --> 00:24:59,879
Please return quickly.

476
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,879
Tell my parents

477
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:05,240
that I'll return on my own.

478
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,800
Yes, Your Lordship.

479
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,200
I've become a disgrace
to the Duke of Ying's family.

480
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:20,159
I should keep a low profile.

481
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,159
This is General Yan's signal.

482
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,119
This very signal almost cost you,
your life.

483
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,359
Once the fireworks are set off,

484
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,800
it will be an appropriate time
for action.

485
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:45,000
Where is she?

486
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,599
Lord Song,

487
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,000
come this way.

488
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,159
How did you know I would be pardoned
and released from prison?

489
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,119
Information from the Paper Office.

490
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,840
His Majesty has been writing
official decrees day and night,

491
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,360
burning incense, and paying respects.

492
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,440
He places that broken ruler on the desk.

493
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,599
It shows that his remorse
for Duke of Ding's death

494
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,760
is greater than his suspicions.

495
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,639
That's why he won't kill you.

496
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,919
Why wait until today, though?

497
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,000
Because today marks
the seventh day of Uncle's death.

498
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:38,839
Dou Shishu and his followers

499
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,560
have been impeaching me every day.

500
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:43,400
You used an embroidered pouch
to have Gu Yu protect me.

501
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,200
What exactly are you trying
to achieve here?

502
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:48,760
This is a business deal
between me and General Yan.

503
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,599
Since you are safe now,

504
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:53,000
I hope we can settle our affairs soon.

505
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:07,079
I've already instructed my men

506
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:08,919
to release General Yan and his men.

507
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:11,240
I ask that you keep your promise

508
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,040
and return Mr. Chen to me.

509
00:27:21,879 --> 00:27:22,879
You went

510
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:26,560
against your uncle only for this reason?

511
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,599
Even fireworks come in different colors.

512
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,399
My uncle and I are different.

513
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,200
Thank you.

514
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:56,440
What did you say?

515
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,600
I didn't hear that clearly.

516
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:05,319
I said,

517
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,440
thank you.

518
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,319
The fireworks are too loud.

519
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,760
I still can't hear it clearly.

520
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,480
Can you repeat that, Lord Song?

521
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,920
I heard it loud and clear.

522
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,240
He said he likes you.

523
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,040
Shut up.

524
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,760
He didn't hear it clearly.

525
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:26,800
Ah, yes. I misheard it.

526
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,280
He said he wants to marry you!

527
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:30,919
Shut up.

528
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:31,960
Stop spouting nonsense.

529
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,320
I'll wait for your good news at home.

530
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,880
No words can express how thankful I am.

531
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:53,560
I'm hosting a banquet
at Guanghe Tower the following night.

532
00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:55,520
I hope you will grace us
with your presence.

533
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,720
I'll also return Mr. Chen to you
at that time.

534
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:18,159
Your Lordship.

535
00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:19,480
Your Lordship.

536
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:22,599
- Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship.

537
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,240
You're...

538
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,760
What happened?

539
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:31,359
The boys were worried about your safety

540
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:33,080
and wanted to break into the prison.

541
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,360
But Fourth Young Lady managed
to talk them out of it.

542
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,280
She talked us out of it?

543
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:36,800
Quiet.

544
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:41,839
Entering the prison
was a form of self-sacrifice.

545
00:29:42,639 --> 00:29:44,840
I was betting His Majesty feels guilty
about Duke of Ding's death.

546
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,559
So he would show mercy
to the Jiang Family.

547
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,559
She figured it out.

548
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,839
But you didn't see it?

549
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,000
I admit

550
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,839
we were reckless.

551
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,200
I'll go and receive
twenty lashes as punishment.

552
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,359
I'll go too.

553
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:03,159
Me too.

554
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,320
It happened because you were worried.
So forget about the punishment.

555
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,680
No, thanks.
I'll go and receive my punishment now.

556
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,480
Go after you wash your face.

557
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,000
It's very late.
How about you go back inside first?

558
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:35,879
Mo,

559
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,840
I hunted this wild deer for you.

560
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,280
The antlers are perfect for your health.

561
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,839
How is Mother's condition?

562
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,680
Father is taking care of her.

563
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,520
You don't want to get involved.

564
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:11,639
But don't forget, I'm also a Jiang.

565
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,159
I'm not looking down on you.

566
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,960
Yuantang is lucky

567
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,480
to survive.

568
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:19,919
Now, many eyes are on this matter.

569
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,240
So you would
put the Jiang Family's safety

570
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:24,159
above the Song Family's?

571
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:26,240
Mo.

572
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,000
Do you want me to sever ties
with the Jiang Family?

573
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,319
Let me send it.

574
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:37,040
That's not my intention.

575
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,119
It's just
that the situation is still unstable.

576
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:41,440
So we must be cautious
with our words and actions.

577
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,319
Come in.

578
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:52,720
Father. Mother.

579
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,559
I've acted recklessly

580
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,879
and made you worry.

581
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,399
You really need to change

582
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,800
your arrogant and reckless nature.

583
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,760
Look at what you've done to your mother.

584
00:32:05,879 --> 00:32:07,680
She hasn't had a full night's rest
in days.

585
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,800
Mother.

586
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:18,800
Mo.

587
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,159
You look so worn out.

588
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,280
Your...

589
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,800
This...

590
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,000
Let me see.

591
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,800
The Shadow Guard's methods

592
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:40,599
are lethal.

593
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,480
It's just for show.

594
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,000
No one would truly dare
to make things hard for me.

595
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:47,760
Forgive me for making you worried.

596
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,680
But seeing what happened to Uncle.

597
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:51,440
I can only do this.

598
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:58,359
Mother.

599
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,680
I know you just reached home

600
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,440
and it's not the right time
to talk about this.

601
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,680
But I think

602
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,280
it's time for you to settle down.

603
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:16,960
Do you have

604
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,399
someone you like?

605
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,440
- Marvelous!
- Good!

606
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,040
Eat one, Mother.

607
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,119
Be honest with me.

608
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,559
Is she

609
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,680
Fourth Young Lady Dou?

610
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,319
Young Lady, you're so kind to Mr. Chen.

611
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:07,399
She risked so much
just to bring him back.

612
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,760
It's not just for Mr. Chen.

613
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,600
For Song Mo and the Duke of Ding,

614
00:34:14,319 --> 00:34:15,959
this is a true injustice.

615
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,480
If I hadn't known,
I would have been better off.

616
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,140
But knowing about this
is hard to ignore.

617
00:34:22,339 --> 00:34:24,080
Where are you getting these ideas from?

618
00:34:24,299 --> 00:34:25,939
It must be Lu Zheng and Lu Ming

619
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,260
who have been exaggerating

620
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,480
and stirring up trouble here.

621
00:34:32,019 --> 00:34:33,979
They're right, though.

622
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,719
Fourth Young Lady Dou is willing
to help you.

623
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,440
So she must be a wise
and principled young woman.

624
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,359
It's just a pity
she was born into the Dou Family.

625
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,640
We can't be sure
she won't be used by her Fifth Uncle.

626
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,160
Fifth Uncle has yet entered
the Grand Secretariat?

627
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,640
Official Wu is still
the Grand Secretary?

628
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:53,120
(According
to the Records of the Enlightened Age,)

629
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,839
(Mr. Wu clearly took a leave of absence)

630
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,120
(Virtuous Minister)
(to return home this year.)

631
00:34:57,799 --> 00:34:59,000
(Fifth Uncle entered
the Grand Secretariat)

632
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,279
(and gradually took control.)

633
00:35:00,279 --> 00:35:01,620
(Dou Shishu)

634
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,799
(The change of the era name
to Fengming by His Majesty)

635
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:05,879
(wasn't mentioned in the records too.)

636
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,640
(Could my advice)

637
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:10,359
(really have changed)

638
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,120
(the course of events?)

639
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,000
(Won't the future be even harder)

640
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:16,160
(to predict after this?)

641
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:19,359
There's also the matter of Mr. Wu Shan.

642
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,760
What happened to the Wu Family?

643
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,759
Official Wu cut ties with the Dou Family

644
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,319
to strengthen his own position.

645
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:34,600
He plans to match make between Dezhen
and the Sixth Young Lady Liang.

646
00:35:36,319 --> 00:35:38,960
(Dezhen is truly in love this time.)

647
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,319
(He has set his sights
on Fourth Young Lady Dou,)

648
00:35:41,799 --> 00:35:42,919
(refusing to give up.)

649
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,000
Even if I'm never destined to be
with Fourth Young Lady Dou in this life,

650
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,640
my feelings for her remain unshakable
and will never change.

651
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,760
I can't marry anyone else
just to please others.

652
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:57,359
If I don't prune and tend it,

653
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,919
it'll just grow out of shape.

654
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,199
Will the sky not fall

655
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,040
just because you refuse?

656
00:36:06,279 --> 00:36:07,560
If I refuse,

657
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,120
can Meisun come back to life?

658
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,799
Everything else can be negotiated,

659
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:20,239
but not this.

660
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,720
This is not something
you can decide by will alone.

661
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:28,160
Dezhen's father passed away early,

662
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:30,160
and he's always been filial
to his grandfather.

663
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:31,239
How could this happen?

664
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:35,879
It looks like he truly loves her.

665
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:39,600
The Dou Family seeks power and profit.

666
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,040
How could their marriage
be based on love?

667
00:36:42,879 --> 00:36:45,559
Dezhen caught a cold in the rain
and has been burning with a fever,

668
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,760
refusing to seek medical help.

669
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,319
If anything happens to him,

670
00:36:48,799 --> 00:36:50,040
Wu can't bear it.

671
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,399
This situation
is what Dou Shishu wishes for.

672
00:36:55,919 --> 00:36:58,040
Both Dezhen and Wu are stubborn.

673
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:00,080
I'll figure out a way
to smooth things over.

674
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:09,120
Mother, time for your medicine.

675
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,040
Father,

676
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,199
I'm sorry.

677
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:19,120
You should learn from Official Dou.

678
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,800
Understand the emperor's will,
and avoid harm for personal gain.

679
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,160
That's the true skill.

680
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:23,680
I will.

681
00:37:23,759 --> 00:37:26,160
Do you really think
forcing Song Mo to confess

682
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,199
will help you rise to power?

683
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:30,919
Have you thought about the emperor

684
00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:33,080
and the Grand Secretariat's intentions?

685
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:34,279
Can we servants decide

686
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:36,680
who is guilty or innocent?

687
00:37:37,399 --> 00:37:38,359
I understand that now.

688
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:45,080
The Shadow Guard has already arrived
in Futing to investigate.

689
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:47,080
I should head there as well.

690
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:49,520
Until we find the leads

691
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,040
in the Duke of Ding's case,

692
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,000
do not act rashly.

693
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:54,919
Yes.

694
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:17,399
What orders do you have for us?

695
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,320
Announce the imperial decree.

696
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:30,160
These past few days,

697
00:38:30,399 --> 00:38:31,448
first, Grand Secretary Wu

698
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:32,666
rejected the emperor's decree

699
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:34,640
to appoint Fifth Master Dou
as Grand Secretary.

700
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:37,279
Then Mr. Wu Shan refused to marry.

701
00:38:37,919 --> 00:38:39,279
The whole capital knows

702
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,399
that the Wu Family
and the Dou Family are at odds.

703
00:38:42,919 --> 00:38:45,160
Lung abscess is due to infection.

704
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,120
He got soaked in the rain
and refused treatment or medicine.

705
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,120
By the way,

706
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,520
has Imperial Physician Li returned
to the capital?

707
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:52,919
He is already on his way.

708
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:54,199
He should be arriving tonight.

709
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:54,919
Good.

710
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:00,120
Have you prepared
the gift list I asked for?

711
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:01,839
Yes.

712
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,919
Chen Qushui has been staying
at Yizhi Hall for a long time.

713
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,094
He probably knows

714
00:39:06,095 --> 00:39:08,239
almost everything about this household.

715
00:39:09,399 --> 00:39:10,520
It doesn't seem right

716
00:39:10,919 --> 00:39:11,919
to let him go like this.

717
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:15,160
We're not just allies.

718
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,199
She also saved me.

719
00:39:16,399 --> 00:39:17,680
Since I promised her,

720
00:39:17,919 --> 00:39:19,240
I can't go back on my word.

721
00:39:20,879 --> 00:39:22,319
Keeping promises is important.

722
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,359
But Fourth Young Lady and Dou Shishu

723
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,279
seem to be working together.

724
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,000
Just when the good things pass,

725
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:29,719
trouble follows.

726
00:39:30,279 --> 00:39:31,919
I fear this gentlemen's agreement

727
00:39:32,399 --> 00:39:33,719
can't protect us from treachery.

728
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,680
Grandfather, no need
to persuade me anymore.

729
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,239
A pine tree grows naturally

730
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:45,560
in the way of life.

731
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:49,560
But to make it look better,

732
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,680
you would twist its branches with wire,

733
00:39:53,919 --> 00:39:55,319
forcing it into shape.

734
00:39:57,399 --> 00:39:58,199
Grandfather,

735
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,560
is that how you see me too,
a plant you can reshape?

736
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,600
I let you go when you wanted
to be sent out to gain experience.

737
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:08,800
You are secretly fond of fine woodcraft.

738
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,759
I pretended not to know about it.

739
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,839
When the family was stable,
I could still protect you

740
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,359
when you acted willfully.

741
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,040
But times have changed.

742
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:28,199
The court is full of new officials,
and predators are everywhere.

743
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,199
If something...

744
00:40:34,279 --> 00:40:36,040
If something happens to me,

745
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,879
who will protect you?

746
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,319
Who will safeguard the Wu Family?

747
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,839
You're giving me no way out!

748
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,799
If you're not fond
of Sixth Young Lady Liang,

749
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,960
I've already shortlisted
a few other noble daughters.

750
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,319
Take your pick,

751
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,000
except the daughters of the Dou Family?

752
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:12,000
Even if you threaten to end your life,

753
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,239
I won't agree.

754
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:28,199
This is Physician Li.

755
00:41:28,399 --> 00:41:29,920
He's here to check on Mr. Wu Shan.

756
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,239
Please, follow me.

757
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,440
This way, please.

758
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,640
My apologies for this offense.

759
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,640
Please wait for a moment.

760
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,960
The one in charge will return soon.

761
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:52,520
The floor is cold.

762
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:00,759
Grandfather,

763
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:02,480
do you think

764
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:06,160
I stopped seeing any physicians
and taking medicine

765
00:42:06,879 --> 00:42:09,879
just to force you into asking
for Fourth Young Lady Dou's hand for me?

766
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:13,480
She doesn't even have feelings for me.

767
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:16,239
I just don't want to settle

768
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,640
and use marriage as a way
to secure the family's position.

769
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:22,440
That would be lying to myself

770
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,960
and hurting someone else!

771
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:30,640
I only want to break free from this cage

772
00:42:31,879 --> 00:42:33,279
and live true to myself.

773
00:42:33,919 --> 00:42:35,399
Is that really too much to ask?

774
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,480
Do you think of me, your grandfather,

775
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,520
as a cage?

776
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:45,199
You can't see

777
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:47,960
how I've been protecting you
from harm every single day.

778
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,399
Do you think fiddling with these things

779
00:42:50,879 --> 00:42:53,000
will make everything go your way?

780
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:13,000
Fourth Young Lady,

781
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,640
will we ever meet

782
00:43:13,879 --> 00:43:15,120
a fifth time?

783
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,839
Even if your feelings remain the same,

784
00:43:16,879 --> 00:43:18,360
seeing you would still make me happy.

785
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,280
You took advantage of my trust

786
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,800
and tipped off your Fifth Uncle.

787
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,440
