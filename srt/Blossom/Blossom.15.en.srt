1
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,260
You may leave.

2
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,380
Still yearning for it, Your Highness?

3
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,570
The most tempting things

4
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,250
are often those that harm us.

5
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,300
I was thinking we could

6
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,800
have a smoke together.

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,530
I came in such a hurry,

8
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,460
I forgot to bring mine.

9
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,180
Use mine.

10
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,610
I dare not.

11
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,340
During your absence,

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,740
I've already quit this habit.

13
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,480
You always say you dare not.

14
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,320
Yet the only person who dares to defy me

15
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,560
is you.

16
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,160
Congratulations on returning safely

17
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,440
from Lizhen.

18
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,400
If there's nothing else,

19
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,840
I shall take my leave.

20
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,480
I haven't allowed you to leave.

21
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,619
I want to hear your music,

22
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,480
just like in the old days.

23
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,560
Just like my smoking habit,

24
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,400
my guqin

25
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,480
has long been gathering dust.

26
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,400
That's the Duke of Jining's
signal flare.

27
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,400
Miss!

28
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,720
Ming is missing!

29
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,819
Madam has sent people
to search everywhere.

30
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,970
It's been two hours,
and they still haven't found her.

31
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,939
(She left when she wasn't selected.)

32
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,280
(She was never seen again.)

33
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,240
(Could they be together?)

34
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,859
The guards are nearby.

35
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,790
I'll go gather the men.

36
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,880
My lord.

37
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,640
The Duke cares most
about his reputation.

38
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,990
This matter cannot be made public.

39
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,800
Why don't I go with you?

40
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,659
=Blossom=
(Adapted from the novel "Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

41
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,920
=Episode 15=

42
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,320
I'll go check first.

43
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,640
Please come later.

44
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,560
How could you be so careless?

45
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,600
I didn't see it.

46
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,440
Never mind.

47
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,760
Fourth Young Lady.

48
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,480
Sister!

49
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,280
No, it's not what you think.

50
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,099
You see, I wasn't selected.

51
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,360
I was feeling upset.

52
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,000
Then I saw a little rabbit.

53
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,979
Fourth Young Lady,
please don't blame Fifth Young Lady.

54
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,379
We saw a rabbit

55
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,409
and wanted to set it free.

56
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,299
Yes.

57
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,920
We led the horse here on foot.

58
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,600
Nothing inappropriate happened.

59
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,120
What happened to your foot?

60
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,059
I twisted it by accident just now.

61
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,200
It's nothing.

62
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,760
This place is so remote.

63
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,960
You can't ride horses anymore.

64
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,279
You'll have to ride with me.

65
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,139
- I'm fine.
- I'm fine.

66
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,780
- Take her back first.
- Take him back first.

67
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,280
You are engaged to him.

68
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,200
It's only reasonable for you two
to ride back together.

69
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,400
When you arrive,

70
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,219
just send someone to pick me up.

71
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,600
That doesn't seem very reasonable.

72
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,059
Even though they're engaged,
they're not married yet.

73
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,400
It's still inappropriate.

74
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,880
The Duke and I share a bond.

75
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,410
Naturally, I should take him back.

76
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,160
A bond?

77
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,840
It's just a dislocation.

78
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,339
I admire your poise,

79
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,920
though you're a bit frail.

80
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,640
When you join the Imperial Guard,

81
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,800
I'll personally mentor you.

82
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,520
Thank you, Lord Song.

83
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,200
The Imperial Guard?

84
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,760
Fourth Young Lady.

85
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,520
Are you alright?

86
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:54,859
Sorry.

87
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm so sorry.

88
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,019
Are you alright?

89
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,859
Mr. Dong,

90
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,059
the hunt is over now.

91
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,940
Why are you still shooting arrows
everywhere?

92
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,400
Everyone, I sincerely apologize.

93
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,400
Lord Song was wearing brown clothing,

94
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,400
and I mistook him for a brown bear.

95
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,539
I was startled

96
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,680
and shot an arrow.

97
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,440
I'm truly sorry.

98
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,200
Fourth Young Lady,

99
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,360
are you okay?

100
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,299
Zhao,

101
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,440
are you alright?

102
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm fine.

103
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,259
Where on earth did they go?

104
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,859
- Father.
- Ming!

105
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,979
- Mother.
- Ming!

106
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,139
Where have you been?

107
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,219
Are you alright?

108
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,690
I went to the forest to clear my head.

109
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,499
I got lost.

110
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,320
Luckily, my sister found me.

111
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,419
Nanny Zhou, quickly escort Ming back.

112
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,099
- I'll take her back myself.
- Alright.

113
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,240
Come on, Ming.

114
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,380
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

115
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,240
You silly child.

116
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,760
Stop right there.

117
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,160
Competing to win the Emperor's favor.

118
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,379
How much longer

119
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,080
will you disgrace the Dou family?

120
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,560
You still dream of serving the court?

121
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,080
Are you even capable of that?

122
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,600
Don't think I don't know.

123
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,960
You're just trying

124
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,600
to delay your marriage
to the Duke of Jining.

125
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,320
And another thing,

126
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,200
a woman participating in gambling...

127
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,300
Do you want to drag
the entire Dou family down with you?

128
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,760
Don't think you can get away with this
by staying silent.

129
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,440
Walking out on me now?

130
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,360
She's like a different person.

131
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,160
Stop right there!

132
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,600
Why didn't she talk back today?

133
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,440
Fine, I won't press further.

134
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,320
(Once again, life hangs by a thread.)

135
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,400
(Is fate truly inevitable?)

136
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,160
(Can we never escape this arrow?)

137
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,640
You once told me,

138
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,160
if I gather enough strength,

139
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,440
I can topple mountains

140
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,600
and reverse rivers.

141
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,880
I've already changed so much.

142
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,560
Why does it still turn out this way?

143
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,080
All things have their fate.

144
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,580
Cause and effect are cyclical.

145
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,810
Look at that large rock in the water.

146
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,160
Though it weighs a hundred pounds,

147
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,760
it can only split
a single stream of water.

148
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,240
In the end, everything still gathers
behind the large rock.

149
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,899
One person's strength

150
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,120
is insignificant

151
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,280
in the grand river of history.

152
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,320
All things are predestined.

153
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,800
So nothing can really change.

154
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,259
What's wrong?

155
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,560
What happened?

156
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,390
Nothing.

157
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,340
If I hadn't stopped you,

158
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,740
you would've fallen into the river.

159
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,800
What's wrong?

160
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,560
Maybe it's because
I haven't eaten anything.

161
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,680
I feel a bit weak.

162
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,560
You know,

163
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,400
when I first joined the army,

164
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,000
I worked as a cook.

165
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,840
This is a reunion dish from Futing.

166
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,659
Vegetables, meat, eggs...

167
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,800
Anything goes in.

168
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,800
It's called Fortune Soup.

169
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,080
It smells amazing.

170
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,880
My mother used to make it for me.

171
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,939
Every time, she'd add something new.

172
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,240
Mushrooms, seafood,

173
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,400
anything, really.

174
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,720
She said,

175
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,080
life is like that.

176
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,019
It's like an old dish
you're used to eating.

177
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,070
Add a few new ingredients,

178
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,960
and the flavor becomes
completely different.

179
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,400
That's true.

180
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,680
Everything is changing.

181
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:20,040
Just like how Father
will have a new lover,

182
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,480
new children,

183
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,920
and a new family.

184
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,880
Every family experiences conflict

185
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,379
due to legitimacy, seniority,

186
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,560
status and rank.

187
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,320
Everyone is vying for themselves

188
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,080
and their children.

189
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,000
When the Lizhen troops arrived
at Zhenbei Pass,

190
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,840
a son born out of wedlock
started a rebellion.

191
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,040
When strife happens
within the imperial family,

192
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,960
it becomes a state affair.

193
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,680
Now that you have the Emperor's favor

194
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,160
and military power,

195
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,859
the Crown Prince and Lord Qing
will surely try to win you over.

196
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,160
What do you plan to do?

197
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,360
I plan to

198
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,280
copy you.

199
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,840
Copy me?

200
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,259
The current Song Mo

201
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,880
has long let go of hatred.

202
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,560
He focuses only on fame and fortune.

203
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,920
I'll observe their moves first

204
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,100
before deciding what to do.

205
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,480
Someone's coming.

206
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,040
Hide.

207
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,760
I haven't had the Fortune Soup yet.

208
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,400
You have something on your mind.

209
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,080
You've been off all day.

210
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,160
What exactly happened?

211
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,640
The arrow.

212
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,000
It has something to do with the arrow.

213
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,640
How could a single arrow
cause this much alarm?

214
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,280
You think you can read my mind,
don't you?

215
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,560
Be it today's incident

216
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,160
or Wei Tingyu's situation,

217
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,200
does reading my thoughts
make you fulfilled?

218
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,160
Reading faces and noticing details

219
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,760
was a skill I used
to interrogate criminals.

220
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,259
Most of them were tortured.

221
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,259
Their limbs broken.

222
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,829
Some even bit off their own tongues.

♪Standing side by side with you♪

226
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,219
Knowing what others think

227
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,320
doesn't make me fulfilled.

228
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,720
Right now, I only want to help you.

229
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,440
I want to share some of your burden.

230
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,539
I want to lighten the load
on your shoulders.

The further you are,
the lighter my burden will be.

234
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,160
It's for your own good,

235
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,699
and for mine.

236
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,840
Why?

237
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,280
I don't understand.

238
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,480
Is it because of Wei Tingyu?

239
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,459
Let's just say it is.

240
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,900
What do you mean by “let's just say”?

241
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,419
You're being childish.

00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:37,340

243
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,120

We're getting extra training

248
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,440
all thanks to the Duke of Jining.

249
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,659
From now on,

250
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,400
we're surely in for tough days.

251
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,419
What are we going to do?

252
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,419
- Duke!
- Stop talking.

253
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,920
Duke...

254
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,939
Duke...

255
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,779
Duke, come here.

256
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,659
Come, come.

257
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,579
- Quickly.
- Please.

258
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,459
Come, come.

259
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,600
Quick, sit down.

260
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,580
- Please sit.
- Wait...

261
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,659
Song Mo hasn't arrived yet.

262
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,790
I'm not supposed to sit down.

263
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,539
This is how we usually do things.

264
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,279
We sit down, report,
and discuss matters.

265
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,659
In an hour, it's over.

266
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,059
Yes. Please eat.

267
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,200
Thank you.

268
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,299
I heard Lord Song
is planning to discipline us.

269
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,379
Discipline "us"?

270
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,520
Just you.

271
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,560
We're all just here to train with you.

272
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,779
Exactly, it's all because of you.

273
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,579
We're probably all in for tough times.

274
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,720
That's right.

275
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,880
What do you mean by that?

276
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,619
Song Mo and Official Dou

277
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,289
have a mountain of grudges.

278
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,390
Lord Song and the Dou family
are like fire and water.

279
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,770
Everyone knows that.

280
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,020
You're the Dou family's
future son-in-law.

281
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,300
Do you think he'll let you off?

282
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,320
This is so unfair.

283
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,840
Lord Song...

284
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,120
Tribute candied olives.

285
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,880
One piece costs 300 coins.

286
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,840
Which one of you

287
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,099
is so generous?

288
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,179
The Duke.

289
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,259
The Duke shared them with everyone
to boost morale.

290
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,559
After all, our drills

291
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,990
- never started this early.
- Hey...

292
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,499
Yes, that's it.

293
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,920
I see.

294
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,259
In the military, there are rules
for standing and sitting.

295
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,720
Private eating is strictly forbidden.

296
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,120
Those who ate these

297
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,139
will carry a one-stone weight

298
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,600
and crawl for ten miles.

299
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,779
Here, we speak only of military rank.

300
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,539
We don't recognize titles or nobility.

301
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,920
Anyone who disagrees

302
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,240
will be dismissed from duty.

303
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,000
As the instigator,

304
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,480
you'll crawl an extra ten miles.

305
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,880
But didn't you eat it too?

306
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,800
Because I know

307
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,960
the most important thing
in the military is unity.

308
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,560
Today, I'll share the punishment
with you.

309
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,539
Lord Song.

310
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,059
Lord... no.

311
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,200
Sir,

312
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,530
it's their fault.

313
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,770
I didn't even want to eat it.

314
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,539
Silence! Move!

315
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,339
Wait, sir, let me explain.

316
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,600
- Hurry up!
- Keep up!

317
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,320
Move, move!

318
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,840
Hurry up!

319
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,720
Keep moving, quickly!

320
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,080
Faster!

321
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,680
I can't do it anymore.

322
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,720
Get up.

323
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,880
I can't.

324
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,520
I can't keep going.

325
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,960
Lord Song, why are you making it
so hard for me?

326
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,160
My lord!

327
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,080
Well done.

328
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,080
It's so high.

329
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,920
How can I climb up there?

330
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,779
Lord Song, please spare me.

331
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,080
Anyone who doesn't make it

332
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,800
won't get lunch.

333
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,160
No food?

334
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,179
That's not fair.

335
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,539
Let's do this,

336
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,480
you give me a hand and help me up, okay?

337
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,080
Here.

338
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,920
Take it.

339
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,480
One, two.

340
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,920
There's plenty for everyone.

341
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,720
You're the Duke of Jining after all.

342
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,630
Your eating manners are atrocious.

343
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,000
Lord Song, you don't understand.

344
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,680
I'm not used to physical training.

345
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,579
This steamed bun today

346
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,720
tastes better than all the delicacies
at my estate.

347
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,120
Then I should seize the chance
to train you more.

348
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,139
No, no.

349
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,280
Please, Lord Song.

350
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,419
Aren't we kindred spirits?

351
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,349
Right?

352
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,300
Why are you targeting me like this?

353
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,479
I know, the Fourth Young Lady

354
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,840
and I are engaged.

355
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,910
But I have absolutely no intention
of siding with the Dou family.

356
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,440
Duke,

357
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,240
aren't you going to marry
the Fourth Young Lady?

358
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,339
Marry her?

359
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,800
It's all decided by our parents.

360
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,120
I have no choice.

361
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,939
You don't understand,
the Fourth Young Lady is rude and crude.

362
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,440
We're not a good match at all.

363
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,939
Lord Song.

364
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,240
No, I mean

365
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,560
sir,

366
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,560
why are you looking at me like that?

367
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,360
You're right.

368
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,320
The Fourth Young Lady

369
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,120
is indeed not a good person.

370
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,320
You think so too?

371
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,920
Great minds think alike.

372
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,299
That Fourth Young Lady
was unfilial as a child,

373
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,539
raised on a rural estate,

374
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,069
and grew up among lowly people.

375
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,190
She disregards her elders
and the rules of propriety.

376
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,019
If not for her looks,

377
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,859
she'd be utterly worthless.

378
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,120
But, to be fair,

379
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,800
she does have one good quality.

380
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,080
She has good taste. She chose me.

381
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,080
She's even urging her uncle
to set a date.

382
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,539
Oh well,

383
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,139
I'll just treat it as marrying

384
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,579
a hen that lays golden eggs.

385
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,000
Here, Lord Song,

386
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,720
have an egg.

387
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,370
You.

388
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,090
Come train in riding and archery
with me.

389
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,019
Lord Song...

390
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,030
Lord Song...

391
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,280
I haven't finished eating yet.

392
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,610
- Aren't they kindred spirits?
- This kind of training is dangerous.

393
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,120
It looks like the Duke won't survive.

394
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,120
- Kindred spirit?
- Get on the horse.

395
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,560
More like punching bag.

396
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,920
(Tranquility and Serenity)

397
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,579
(Yearning day and night, thousands
of words unsaid, longing to meet again.)

398
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,990
I don't really understand paintings.

399
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,960
But these verses are truly filled
with deep emotion.

400
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,680
Sister,

401
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,240
I swear I didn't seduce him.

402
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,760
I swear.

403
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,200
If you want me to believe you,

404
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,800
then burn this painting.

405
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,560
Since you like this painting,

406
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,800
you should keep it.

407
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,760
I don't like Wei Tingyu.

408
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,560
Even though we're engaged,

409
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,160
I will never marry him.

410
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,520
So you were testing me earlier.

411
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,120
But even so,

412
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,700
Mother will never agree.

413
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,120
She'll beat me to death.

414
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,779
I know your mother

415
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,099
has been harsh on you

416
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,800
because of your failed
marriage prospects.

417
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,000
But whether you learn painting
or calligraphy,

418
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,560
or get married,

419
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,320
it shouldn't be just to please her.

420
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,480
You're an adult now.

421
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,280
You should start making decisions
for your own life.

422
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,920
(Yizhi Hall)

423
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,459
Wei Tingyu is a foolish

424
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,539
and dark-hearted man.

425
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,280
He's unworthy of the Fourth Young Lady.

426
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,760
He has countless flaws,

427
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,880
yet he's engaged to Dou Zhao.

428
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,179
He's engaged to her,

429
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,120
yet he insults her behind her back.

430
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,640
This man has terrible character.

431
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,520
Should we tell the Fourth Young Lady
about this?

432
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,600
But I still think

433
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,179
Dou Zhao is lying.

434
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,560
Stay away from me.

435
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,680
The further you are,
the lighter my burden will be.

436
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,200
It's for your own good

437
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,880
and mine.

438
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,040
I need to figure out
what she's thinking.

439
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,160
Lord Song,

440
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,680
a eunuch is outside asking for you.

441
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,309
Let him in.

442
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,480
Yes.

443
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,920
Lord Song.

444
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,339
The Duke of Jining says you injured him
during training

445
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,680
out of personal grudge.

446
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,539
He has rallied the sons of several dukes

447
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,160
to submit a complaint to the palace.

448
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,579
(Submitted by the Duke of Jining,
Wei Tingyu)

449
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,880
This Wei Tingyu

450
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,720
is quite interesting.

451
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,579

In the end, it's still
about the engagement.

457
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,490
Song Mo and Dou Shishu are on bad terms.

458
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,310
Who would have thought
he'd extend his hatred

459
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,960
and take revenge on Tingyu?

460
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,139
You all saw it too,

461
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,360
how much Tingyu has suffered.

462
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,139
Why bother with a mad dog

463
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,360
that bites indiscriminately?

464
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,539
In my opinion,

465
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,669
even though Song Mo has been reinstated,

466
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,799
he spends all his time

467
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,379
loitering around

468
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,659
the opera house.

469
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,979
What future does he have?

470
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,200
Truly disgraceful.

471
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,560
I've even heard

472
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,920
that at night,

473
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,960
he'd invite the performers
to give him foot massages.

474
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,859
Really?

475
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:33,360
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

476
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,979
Pipe down,

477
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,200
they're all regulars here.

478
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,059
Ask Dou Shishu to find Tingyu a position

479
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,619
(Duke of Jing)
at the Ministry of Rites.

480
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,739
That should solve everything,
shouldn't it?

481
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,000
For now,

482
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,179
just focus on getting
this marriage done.

483
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,000
Settle down first,
and then build a career.

484
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,379
It wasn't easy to get
both families together

485
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,840
to discuss the engagement.

486
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,219
But look at you,

487
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,280
you're fixated on the opera performance.

488
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,499
The younger generation isn't interested.

489
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,720
They've all left.

490
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,000
Bravo!

491
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,960
Fifth Young Lady.

492
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,200
Fifth Young Lady.

493
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,400
Fifth Young Lady.

494
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,080
Why are you avoiding me?

495
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,539
My parents are downstairs.

496
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,680
Please leave.

497
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,819
Fifth Young Lady,

498
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,800
don't you know how I feel?

499
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,280
It's impossible for us.

500
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,240
These two truly seem
to have mutual feelings.

501
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,690
Why doesn't the Duke propose
a new marriage?

502
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,299
Him marrying the Fifth Young Lady
would be perfect for everyone.

503
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,280
Perhaps Wei Tingzhen refused.

504
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,280
This Wei Tingyu...

505
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,200
If he had a spine,

506
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,339
he wouldn't have given up
after just a few days on the job.

507
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,679
Lately, I've heard that Lord Song

508
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,890
was accused of misconduct
at the Imperial Guard training grounds.

509
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,390
The Duke of Jining led the complaint,

510
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,410
claiming he was severely injured
during training.

511
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,939
Right after Lord Song learned

512
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,459
about the Duke's engagement to you,

513
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,619
he started targeting him.

514
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,800
Why do you think he did that?

515
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,920
Are you suggesting

516
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,969
that Song Mo is jealous because of me?

517
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,760
I didn't say that.

518
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,939
But now that you mention it,

519
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,320
it makes perfect sense.

520
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,800
You...

521
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,200
Wei Tingzhen, seeing that Song Mo
is out of reach,

522
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,980
has started pushing
for the marriage again.

523
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,259
I thought that winning first place
in the Ladies' Etiquette Contest

524
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,800
would earn me an official position.

525
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,400
That way, I could spend a few years
in Liaodong,

526
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,040
and the marriage would be forgotten.

527
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,160
- But now...
- No need to help me.

528
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,139
Fourth Young Lady,

529
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,040
you left the opera to come here.

530
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,720
Are you secretly meeting your lover?

531
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,760
I heard you

532
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,440
take opera singers home every night
for foot massages.

533
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,979
Cold feet at night

534
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,040
is a sign of kidney deficiency.

535
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,560
You should take care of your health.

536
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,720
Let's leave.

537
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,579
The Duke of Jining

538
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,939
is bedridden from his training
at the Imperial Guard,

539
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,840
yet you don't seem to worry about him.

540
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,520
Instead,

541
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,960
you seem more concerned about me.

542
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,080
Do you really want to marry Wei Tingyu?

543
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,499
Do you really need opera singers

544
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,760
to sing you to sleep?

545
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,480
I never could fool you.

546
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,080
But you,

547
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,800
you still haven't answered my question.

548
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:50,979
Fourth Young Lady,

549
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,120
why are you running away?

550
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,520
What are you doing?

551
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,920
Fourth Young Lady, are you all right?

552
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,240
A dignified lord

553
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,920
bullying a helpless woman?

554
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,320
Helpless woman?

555
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,200
That's not how you described her.

556
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,800
I...

557
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,219
What did I say about her?

558
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,499
It doesn't matter.

559
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,579
What matters

560
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,280
is I saw you bullying her.

561
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,520
Why are you laughing?

562
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,219
Fourth Young Lady,

563
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,360
don't be afraid.

564
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,320
In broad daylight...

565
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,640
no,

566
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,280
under the bright moonlight,

567
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,200
he wouldn't dare act improperly.

568
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,299
What are you doing?

569
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,440
You...

570
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,600
Just you wait.

571
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,040
Scoundrel.

572
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,579
Fourth Young Lady.

573
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,720
Mr. Wei.

574
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,400
Please follow me.

575
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,160
Bravo...

576
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,400
Duke,

577
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,400
we're alone now,

578
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,640
so I'll speak frankly.

579
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,920
- I...
- Say no more.

580
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,040
I know you want to confess.

581
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,419
You had your mother arrange
a marriage with my family,

582
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,539
and even won

583
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,080
the Ladies' Etiquette Contest for me.

584
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,659
For you?

585
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,579
Exactly.

586
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,320
I know you're obsessed about me.

587
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,099
I'm grateful for it.

588
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,240
But the more you do this,

589
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,259
the more uneasy I feel.

590
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,520
Because I...

591
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,120
Why did you kick me?

592
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,139
I get it now.

593
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,619
Emotionally speaking,

594
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,579
I owe you

595
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,579
an apology.

596
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,179
It's only fair for you
to hit or scold me.

597
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,320
But matters of the heart

598
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,619
aren't up to anyone to decide.

599
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,759
Even if you win my body,

600
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,619
you won't win my heart.

601
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,800
Enough, Duke.

602
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,240
I know your heart isn't with me.

603
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,960
You love someone else.

604
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,640
So why not annul our engagement
and marry her instead?

605
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,819
Marriage is a matter

606
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,840
decided by parents and matchmakers.

607
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,040
I've lost both my parents,

608
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,240
and my sister is like a mother to me.

609
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,880
I dare not go against her wishes.

610
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,160
I know this is unfair to you

611
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,760
and even more unfair
to the one I truly love.

612
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,120
If Dou Sushi could intervene,

613
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,200
things would be so much easier.

614
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,000
(You and Dou Ming are the ones
who are mutually in love.)

615
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,480
(You won't fight for your love,)

616
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,920
(and you expect me to?)

617
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,539
(If I were Dou Ming,)

618
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,680
(I'd have slapped you already.)

619
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,960
Fine.

620
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,000
Since you can't decide,

621
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,859
let both families follow tradition

622
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,080
and perform a marriage divination.

623
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,840
Marriage divination?

624
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,160
There's no need to rush things.

625
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,339
Let me go home and discuss this

626
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,560
with my sister.

627
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,880
I'll take my leave now.

628
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,320
A marriage divination?

629
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,379
Wei Tingyu hesitates and doesn't act.

630
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,560
He's truly spineless.

631
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,659
No wonder Lord Song
despises him so much.

632
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,139
Even I want to punch him.

633
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,000
He's passive, noncommittal,
and irresponsible,

634
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,859
leaving all the tough decisions
to women.

635
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,939
He truly has the temperament

636
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,819
of someone raised among women.

637
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,480
Completely unreliable.

638
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,320
I wonder what Dou Ming thinks of this.

639
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,379
As for the Fifth Young Lady,

640
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,880
I've quietly sent someone
to keep an eye on her.

641
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,560
But do you really want
to leave this to fate

642
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,960
and rely on divination?

643
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,880
Fate?

644
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,320
Fate sounds perfect.

645
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,480
No one can defy fate.

646
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,960
Just as you expected, Lord Song.

647
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,099
Deep down,

648
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,259
the Fourth Young Lady doesn't want
to marry Wei Tingyu either.

649
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,560
She's just putting on a facade.

650
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,360
Then let her finish her act.

651
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,080
(Memorial)

652
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,520
These are memorials submitted recently

653
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,960
by the Duke of Jining
and the Duke of Jing.

654
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,040
Tell Wei Tingyu

655
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,640
that if he wants to complain,

656
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,859
he should first master archery
and horseback riding

657
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,120
and become a proper duke
before coming forward.

658
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,000
From now on,

659
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,880
do not present his memorials to me.

660
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,960
Understood.

661
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,520
Your Majesty,

662
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,379
although Song Mo holds an important post
in the Imperial Guard,

663
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,179
he spends his nights at the opera house,

664
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,360
disturbing respectable women.

665
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,440
It tarnishes the court's reputation.

666
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,979
However, Song Mo has indeed fixed

667
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,779
the lax atmosphere
in the Imperial Guard.

668
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,400
Your family and the Duke of Jining's
family have an engagement.

669
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,840
Official Dou,

670
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,320
surely your remarks aren't driven
by personal motives?

671
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,480
You...

672
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,800
No one is perfect.

673
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,080
Since he has let go of the past

674
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,960
and is wholeheartedly loyal
to the court,

675
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,640
I am pleased.

676
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,200
You two,

677
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,240
in private, are in-laws,

678
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,320
but in public, you are pillars
of the court.

679
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,709
Must you attack each other
in front of me

680
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:11,240
over private matters?

681
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,800
- We are at fault.
- We are at fault.

682
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:25,040
Cultivate the family, govern the state,
bring peace to the world.

683
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,259
Without family,

684
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,560
a person is like a kite
with a broken string.

685
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,120
Ungrounded.

686
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,619
Whether it's Song Mo

687
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,200
or the Dou and the Wei families,

688
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,680
don't repeat the Wu family's mistake

689
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,420
and turn the court
into a laughing stock.

690
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,280
We understand.

691
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

692
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:50,360
(Aspire for Greatness)

693
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,120
Ill?

694
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,859
She has just agreed

695
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,739
to perform the marriage divination.

696
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,099
How could she fall ill so suddenly?

697
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,520
The Fourth Young Lady said
it's because of the cold weather.

698
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,960
Her spirits are fine,

699
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,629
but her forehead is still burning hot.

700
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,770
She can't get out of bed.

701
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:04,979
Have you called a doctor?

702
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,299
Make sure to take good care of her,

703
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,699
lest her illness worsens.

704
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,840
Yes.

705
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,360
She agreed to the marriage divination.

706
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,899
At least she's come around.

707
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,560
She's not as resistant
to the marriage anymore.

708
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,480
Why do you still look so troubled?

709
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,770
Nothing.

710
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,440
I was just thinking,

711
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,440
since this is a marriage divination,

712
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,219
isn't it inauspicious

713
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,840
to fall ill now?

714
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,840
The birth dates have been matched.

715
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,560
Burning tortoise shells
is just a formality.

716
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,520
Seventh Master, Seventh Madam.

717
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,320
The Duchess of Jing has arrived.

718
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,760
This is the renowned Mr. Ma
from the Capital.

719
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,640
He's performed readings
for many noble families.

720
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,840
Okay, you may leave.

721
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,360
Ming.

722
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,280
Ming.

723
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,600
Ming.

724
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,200
Ming.

725
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,880
What are you doing?

726
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,179
I wrote you letters,

727
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,259
but you didn't reply.

728
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,419
So I came to see you in person.

729
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,659
Go back. I don't want to see you.

730
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,800
Don't push me.

731
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,760
Are you hurt?

732
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:25,299
Are you all right?

733
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,440
I'm fine.

734
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,600
You just got into trouble recently.

735
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,659
If someone

736
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,920
sees us like this,

737
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,680
you'll be condemned.

738
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,320
So you're worried about me?

739
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,659
- Well?
- No sign of Wei Tingyu.

740
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,659
They say he and the Duke of Jing

741
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,600
don't believe in these superstitions.

742
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,240
It seems they're pressed
and looking for a solution.

743
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,259
What about the marriage divination?

744
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,019
Wei Tingzhen said,
as the eldest sister,

745
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,160
she will head the ritual.

746
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,699
Tell Mr. Chen and Su Lan

747
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,840
to act.

748
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,979
Ming, don't worry.

749
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,179
Everyone is in the main hall right now,

750
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,419
performing the divination ritual.

751
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,560
No one will come here.

752
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,139
I just have a few heartfelt words.

753
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,320
Once I've said them, I'll leave.

754
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,480
They're already performing divination.

755
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,779
What else is there to say?

756
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,080
Even if you say it, I won't listen.

757
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,819
- Leave now.
- Ming.

758
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,440
This is all my sister's doing.

759
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,680
I...

760
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,419
Give it back.

761
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,600
Give it back.

762
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,280
Red beans grow in the southern country.

763
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,080
In spring, how many will sprout?

764
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,080
Look.

765
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,240
Our hearts are clearly connected.

766
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,960
Why do you...

767
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,560
I've sent someone to inquire.

768
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,760
Besides reading poetry and painting,

769
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,560
your favorite pastime

770
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,120
is visiting the Drunken Bordello.

771
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,179
Your house is filled

772
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,819
with countless beautiful maids.

773
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,939
Even when painting,

774
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,120
you need several maids
to prepare your ink and brushes.

775
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,040
Why do you still come to see me?

776
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,819
Heaven and earth as witnesses,

777
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,419
I, Wei Tingyu, hereby swear,

778
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,459
that from today onward,

779
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,139
I will dismiss all the maids
in my residence

780
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,920
and never step foot in a brothel again.

781
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,240
From now on,

782
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,640
I will only paint Dou Ming.

783
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,520
If I break this vow,

784
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,539
may I be pierced by swords

785
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,840
with no place to rest in death.

786
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,320
I haven't even said yes.

787
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,800
Why make such a harsh vow?

788
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,920
Do you believe me now?

789
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,120
Even if you really love me,

790
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,880
you still wouldn't defy your sister.

791
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,480
And I don't want to disgrace my family.

792
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,440
Don't worry.

793
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,960
I've already thought of a solution.

794
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,680
Let me show you something.

795
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,539
Someone! Thief!

796
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,779
- Thief!
- Quick, run.

797
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,219
- Thief!
- Go.

798
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,079
- Someone!
- Ming.

799
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,640
I haven't shown you this yet.

800
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,299
- Catch the thief!
- Search the courtyard.

801
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,560
Catch the thief!

802
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,619
- Quick!
- Catch the thief!

803
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,960
Don't let him escape.

804
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,739
How could there be a thief
in broad daylight?

805
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,659
Seventh Master,

806
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,579
it seems he's run
into the inner courtyard.

807
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,819
They're going after him now.

808
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,659
Hurry.

809
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,280
Are Dou Ming and Dou Zhao still there?

810
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,800
Yes, go check on Ming.

811
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,539
Madam Wei, please stay here for now.

812
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,400
What's the capital turning into?

813
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,000
There are thieves everywhere.

814
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,440
This is ridiculous.

815
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,219
- Hurry.
- Take a look at this pouch first.

816
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,059
This is no time for that.
Hurry and leave.

817
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,139
You haven't seen what's in it yet.

818
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,979
- Now is not the time.
- Someone, catch the thief!

819
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,019
Quick, run.

820
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:10,859
Check over there.

821
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,699
- Ming.
- Quickly.

822
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,240
Don't forget to check the pouch.

823
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,800
Young Lady.

824
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,459
Young Lady, are you alright?

825
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,600
I'm fine.

826
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,640
(Wei Tingyu, Dou Zhao)

827
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,800
(It's exactly the same.)

828
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,280
("Good fortune" again.)

829
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,120
(At this rate,)

830
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,240
(I fear it'll lead to heartbreak again.)

831
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,240
Quickly, go.

832
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,600
"Bad fortune."

833
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,480
Raising false alarms about a thief.

834
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,139
(Wei Tingyu, Dou Zhao)
She thinks she can annul the engagement

835
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,080
with such a cheap trick?

836
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,600
Disrespecting gods and spirits.

837
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,419
No wonder she's a motherless child.

838
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,219
Luckily, Madam anticipated this

839
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,779
and had some tortoise shells

840
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,720
marked with “good fortune"
prepared in advance.

841
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,259
The wisdom of age prevails.

842
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,819
When she agreed to the divination,

843
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:29,000
I knew she would cheat.

844
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:31,960
Someone's coming.

845
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,659
They're back?

846
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,960
- Quick.
- Quick.

847
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,760
Ming.

848
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,020
Shh.

849
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,160
(Wei Tingyu, Dou Zhao)

850
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,320
This...

851
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,299
How could it be?

852
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,240
Bad fortune?

853
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,280
When did Ming come up with this idea?

854
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,339
Quick, swap it.

855
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,480
Don't let Ming...

856
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,659
Ming took away the tongs.

857
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,280
Then use your hands.

858
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,099
Madam, it's scalding.

859
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,819
- Useless fool! I'll do it.
- It's hot.

860
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,819
Be careful, Madam.

861
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,099
Be careful...

862
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,360
Quickly.

863
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,040
(Wei Tingyu, Dou Zhao)
There.

864
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,059
Someone's coming. Quick.

865
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,200
Quick.

866
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,600
We checked.

867
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,659
Some house guests

868
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,840
must have made a mistake

869
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,360
and thought they saw a thief.

870
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:44,280
Sorry for the disturbance, Madam Wei.

871
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,800
No harm done.

872
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,099
Male water, female metal.

873
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,579
(Wei Tingyu, Dou Zhao)
There are no cracks in the match.

874
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,640
This is very good fortune.

875
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,059
First, it entails wealth.

876
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,579
Second, success in career.

877
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,599
What about children,

878
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,480
the most important thing?

879
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,880
Of course, in great abundance!

880
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,539
If this couple weds,

881
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,400
it will bring blessings
to both families.

882
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,139
Wonderful.

883
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:07,979
In my opinion,

884
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,299
this wedding should be settled quickly.

885
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,520
There's an auspicious date next month.

886
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,339
As the mistress of my family,

887
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,360
I've already prepared the bridal dowry.

888
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:27,059
After all this, it still turned
out to be "good fortune".

889
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,280
How frustrating.

890
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,240
Someone's here. I'll explain later.

891
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,419
Do as I instructed.

892
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,560
Yes.

893
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,240
Madam Wei, please wait.

894
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,600
Madam Wei.

895
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,080
Weren't you unwell?

896
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,080
I'm sorry I was disrespectful
and offended you.

897
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:49,619
These lily bulbs

898
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,859
were imported from Jiangnan.

899
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,000
Please accept them

900
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,880
as a token of apology

901
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,259
and our harmonious relationship.

902
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,840
I hope this marriage
can be settled quickly.

903
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,120
This illness

904
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,880
has really changed you.

905
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,640
Thank you.

906
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,000
Wang Yingxue is clever,

907
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,179
so I must always think
one step ahead of her.

908
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,320
It doesn't matter
what the tortoise shells say.

909
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:23,920
What matters is

910
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,800
we arouse Wei Tingzhen's suspicion.

911
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,779
Wei Tingzhen already harbored doubts.

912
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,579
With you suddenly being so nice to her,

913
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,059
she's bound to investigate thoroughly.

914
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,109
So,

915
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,550
what will she investigate?

916
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,779
I need you two

917
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,280
to put on a show.

918
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,619
Once she's married,

919
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,899
Dou Zhao

920
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,989
and her family assets

921
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:59,659
will be under your control.

922
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,519
I only wish

923
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,299
that the person I love

924
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,819
can have a fulfilling life.

925
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,659
(Duke of Jining's Residence)

926
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,800
Wait.

927
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:11,500
♪The golden fiery steed rides
across the vast horizon♪

928
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:15,210

929
