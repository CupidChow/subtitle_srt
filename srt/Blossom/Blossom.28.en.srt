1
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,959
Candidates who passed the written exam
may now enter!

2
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,100
(Echoes of Strength and Discipline)

3
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,870
In the written exam,

4
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,230
Second Young Master Song
did better than the rest.

5
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,419
As for Mr. Mu, he succeeded
through unclear advantages.

6
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,649
I wonder what tricks Official Mu pulled

7
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,870
to get him through.

8
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,329
The imperial examinations
are the only chance

9
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,499
for commoners to rise.

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,049
If such fairness is lost,

11
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,670
won't it dishearten the people?

12
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,369
Pay your respects!

13
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,490
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

14
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,990
Rise!

15
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,790
The martial arts exam begins!

16
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,480
- Impressive!
- Incredible!

17
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,400
Having such talent on our side

18
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,379
is like having
an unbeatable chess piece.

19
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,510
It's helpful in achieving success.

20
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,960
My son has some skills
in martial arts as well.

21
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,040
How about we see

22
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,960
how his skills measure up?

23
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,139
Quickly, take him away.

24
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,280
Yes, sir.

25
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,950
The martial exams focus on restraint.

26
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,110
Such eagerness reveals

27
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,390
one's intentions.

28
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,990
Who would have thought
the Song Family produced

29
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,569
Song Yantang, who won first prize
in hunting for consecutive years

30
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,179
and another talent who excels
in literature and martial arts.

31
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,440
Top scores for every subject

32
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,630
and even his discourse
in strategy is insightful.

33
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,160
Song Han, as the top scorer,
is there anything you desire?

34
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,000
Your Majesty,

35
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,760
all my martial skills were taught

36
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,910
by my elder brother.

37
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,760
But compared to him,

38
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,400
I still have much to learn.

39
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,600
Today, I humbly request
an additional match

40
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,040
to test myself against my brother.

41
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,760
I hope Your Majesty will grant this.

42
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,019
Your Majesty,

43
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,139
Song Han is too audacious.

44
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,560
The martial exam is already over.

45
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,740
Even if he is the top scorer,

46
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,560
he shouldn't make such
a personal request to Your Majesty.

47
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,950
This isn't the Song Family's backyard!

48
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,790
Your Majesty, please.

49
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,259
Madam wants me to remind you
that your current state

50
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,929
does not permit such exertion.

51
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:06,779
That's right.

52
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,899
You should refuse this match.

53
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,040
I agree with him.

54
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,390
I know my limits.

55
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,840
So don't worry.

56
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:21,939
Your Majesty,

57
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,440
Song Han is young and impulsive.

58
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,590
I hope Your Majesty can forgive

59
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,360
his impertinence.

60
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,209
No matter.

61
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,729
Since he's the top scorer,

62
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,950
I want to see his skills too.

63
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,510
You shall personally test him.

64
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,950
I shall obey, Your Majesty.

65
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,479
=Blossom=
(Adapted from the novel "Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

66
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,700
=Episode 28=

67
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,070
Whoever captures the flag

68
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,470
within half an hour wins!

69
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,760
Mo, let's use the blades.

70
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,990
Sure.

71
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,830
If you can't beat me today,

72
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,400
all of Official Dou's efforts

73
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,240
will be in vain, right?

74
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,120
I seek fame and success
through my own merits.

75
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,920
If you want to get in my way,

76
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,760
why not just kill me

77
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,560
in front of His Majesty?

78
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,070
You've taught me

79
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,680
the adaptive technique many times.

80
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,080
Did I

81
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,070
finally get it right?

82
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,360
It seems you've learned more

83
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,950
than just blade work.

84
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,950
To turn the tide against Yantang

85
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,950
is rare indeed.

86
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,449
Announce the decree.

87
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,710
Song Han has shown
exceptional bravery and strategy,

88
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:38,640
earning first place in the martial exam.

89
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,680
I shall appoint him
as a Tengxiang Guard

90
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,400
and grant him the Songhe sword.

91
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,290
Your Majesty, if I may request

92
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,400
another favor.

93
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,710
Speak.

94
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,440
My parents have passed away.

95
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,040
In a time of distress and desolation,

96
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,280
I am left entirely alone.

97
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,190
I dare to ask

98
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,160
for Your Majesty's grace
to grant me a marriage

99
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,800
with the princess

100
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:14,710
to live in harmony and happiness.

101
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:24,200
I'll consider your marriage carefully.

102
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

103
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,070
Hold still.

104
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,830
It doesn't hurt.

105
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,990
If this wound were any deeper,
it would leave a scar.

106
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,920
It's just a minor wound.

107
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,259
Besides,

108
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,950
I have you as my physician.

109
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,200
No injuries scare me.

110
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,040
Yes, this injury is nothing major.

111
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,320
But Song Han injured the others

112
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,520
just to win.

113
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,110
You must be careful with him.

114
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,710
With Song Han's impressive performance

115
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,230
and Lord Qing's emerging ambitions,

116
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,520
could Song Han have pledged
his allegiance to him?

117
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,620
Song Han has always been diligent
in his studies

118
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,380
and skilled in archery
and horseback riding.

119
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,920
Given the state of our family,

120
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,769
it's understandable he wants

121
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,809
to secure his future.

122
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,950
But he shouldn't have aligned
with Lord Qing.

123
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,870
(Lord Qing couldn't use Yantang.)

124
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,920
(So he has turned to Song Han.)

125
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,710
But you don't have to worry.

126
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,049
Once Song Han is engaged

127
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,390
and establishes his own residence,

128
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,790
we can take the opportunity
to distance ourselves from him.

129
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,760
By the way,

130
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,280
I heard Song Han asked
His Majesty for a marriage proposal.

131
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,070
Jingyu is the only princess.

132
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,990
She's been spoiled since childhood

133
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,800
and might not agree to the marriage.

134
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,580
(Drunken Bordello)

135
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,400
You're favoring
your son-in-law's family,

136
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,470
allowing Song Han to rise
and compete against my son,

137
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,070
leaving him crippled.

138
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,449
Official Mu, that's not right to say.

139
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,929
If I truly had that intention,

140
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,870
why use such underhanded tactics?

141
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,950
If your son's leg is broken,

142
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,500
blame the Songs,

143
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,200
not me.

144
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,680
Everyone knows

145
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,999
you climbed the ladder

146
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,470
by buttering the Grand Princess

147
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,640
and driving Wang Xingyi away.

148
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,470
Now that the big plan isn't complete,

149
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,470
you're already targeting me.

150
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,870
I didn't know you love gossip.

151
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,680
Are you looking for a reason

152
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,040
to take my Deputy Chief position?

153
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,520
Let's see

154
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,350
what tricks you have up your sleeve.

155
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,590
Fine.

156
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,320
If that's how you feel,

157
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,710
let's see what happens next.

158
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,070
Han, come here.

159
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,320
Quite grand, isn't it?

160
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,160
What a rare sight.

161
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,920
Congratulations.
It's truly something to celebrate.

162
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,070
Today, let's enjoy the night with Han.

163
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,640
Yes, make sure Han enjoys his night.

164
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,739
I did say it during the hunt.

165
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,499
He claimed first place in the exams,

166
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,019
earned His Majesty's treasured sword,

167
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,899
and is about to become
the Prince Consort.

168
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,350
He sure has a bright future ahead.

169
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,040
Official Song, something's happened.

170
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,780
(I, the Princess, will not marry you.
Yours truly, Zhu Rongying)

171
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,409
(I, the Princess, will not marry you.
Yours truly, Zhu Rongying)

172
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,159
That Song Han is a shameless

173
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,640
and deceitful scoundrel.

174
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,980
You cannot let Rongying marry him.

175
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,710
It's better than marrying her off
to Lizhen, isn't it?

176
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,750
This isn't your concern anyway.

177
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,470
Why are you so anxious?

178
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,230
I'm being loyal.

179
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,070
You? Loyal?

180
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,350
Are you saying I'm indifferent
to Rongying?

181
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:09,040
Rongying is my only daughter.

182
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,040
Do you think I'd push her into the fire?

183
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,929
At least Song Han
is a martial arts champion.

184
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,070
What about you?

185
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,350
You're the one despised by everyone,

186
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,750
disgracing the royal family.

187
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,560
Calm down, Your Majesty.

188
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,769
Yu and Rongying

189
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,169
have been close since childhood.

190
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,920
They're always standing up
for each other.

191
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,640
So, what do you think about this?

192
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,440
I'm already troubled.

193
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,870
Rongying refuses to marry,

194
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,070
and now he adds more to my trouble.

195
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,139
Since the founding of this dynasty,

196
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,520
it's been tradition

197
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:53,230
to grant the champion's request.

198
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,449
Song Han

199
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,409
has always had

200
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,680
a rebellious streak.

201
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,219
Besides, his background

202
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,200
isn't worthy of Rongying.

203
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,280
Why not grant another princess title
and betroth him to her?

204
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,800
Grant another princess title?

205
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,649
I've heard

206
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:17,070
the Miao family of Futing
is related to Consort Dowager Miao.

207
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,460
After the Consort Dowager's demise,

208
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,099
the Miao Family doesn't hold
any position in court.

209
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,170
So they fell into decline
and ventured into trading.

210
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,909
The eldest daughter,

211
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,259
Miao Ansu, has a good reputation

212
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,870
and is a sworn sister
of the Duke of Ying's wife.

213
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,590
Let's make her a princess

214
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,379
and marry her to Song Han.

215
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,560
This way, it's still within
the Duke of Ying's circle and closer.

216
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,470
That's a good idea.

217
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,830
If you say one more word...

218
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,640
Go announce the decree.

219
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,070
Yes, Your Majesty.

220
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,099
Song Han is asking for too much.

221
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,280
An illegitimate child dares to ask
for a princess's hand in marriage.

222
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,230
He's dreaming of instant success.

223
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,619
But that Miao girl

224
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,379
is close to the Duke of Ying's wife.

225
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,280
- I fear...
- Dou Zhao was a girl of humble origin.

226
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,800
Now, she's well-connected,

227
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,750
thanks to Miao Ansu
who is working tirelessly

228
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,230
to make money and support her.

229
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,280
Directress Su.

230
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,550
Yes, Your Majesty.

231
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,560
The princess is newly married.

232
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,160
You will accompany her
into the residence as an attendant

233
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,640
and keep an eye on those sisters.

234
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,830
Yes, Your Majesty.

235
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,920
By the grace of Heaven,
the Emperor issues this decree.

236
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,320
Miao Ansu,

237
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:54,830
a woman of virtue and wisdom,

238
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,950
is hereby titled Princess Anyu.

239
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:03,920
She is granted a golden seal,
an annual stipend of two thousand dan,

240
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:08,680
and is to marry Song Han
of the Duke of Ying's household.

241
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,230
As decreed by the Emperor.

242
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,950
She's been made a princess.

243
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,350
This is wonderful, Su!

244
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,240
Xingshuang,

245
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,750
bring a dry cloth.

246
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,339
The snow's all over the cat.

247
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,590
He'll start sneezing again.

248
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,040
Yes, Young Master.

249
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,760
Xingshuang...

250
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,230
Greetings, Princess Anyu.

251
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:45,830
Get up.

252
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,040
I never wanted this.

253
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,449
We should go to the palace now

254
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,120
and beg His Majesty
to rescind the decree.

255
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,080
- Leave us.
- Yes, Young Master.

256
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,790
Defying an imperial decree
is a capital offense.

257
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,020
Or

258
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,220
do you also look down on my background

259
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,580
and rather disobey?

260
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,380
That's not what I mean.

261
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,820
I've admired you for a long time.

262
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,700
But I know

263
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,900
the one you truly want
to marry is Princess Jingyu.

264
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,700
For His Majesty to force me upon you,

265
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,660
it's unfair to both of us.

266
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,220
Do what you must as a princess.

267
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,340
Don't sacrifice your glory for my sake.

268
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,279
I've already written a petition

269
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,300
stating I've fallen gravely ill.

270
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,260
That way, the marriage can be annulled.

271
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,300
Then

272
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,340
how will you marry in the future?

273
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,740
My cat is spoiled.

274
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,540
It knows it has a home to return to.

275
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,430
When it gets lost,
someone will always find it.

276
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,620
So it goes out often.

277
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,100
I'm not that lucky.

278
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,780
The people

279
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,180
who would come looking for me

280
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,260
and shelter me from the storms

281
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,300
are all gone.

282
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,980
I'll go to His Majesty and ask him
to call off the marriage.

283
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,260
I'm willing.

284
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,319
(Baifu Restaurant)

285
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,460
Su.

286
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,879
Su, don't worry.

287
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,759
We won't let you walk into this trap.

288
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,530
How about this?

289
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,119
You can hide out in the countryside
for a few days.

290
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,839
Ms. Longevity has experience
in breaking off engagements.

291
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,599
We'll make sure
to sabotage this marriage for you.

292
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,280
But I've already agreed
to marry Song Han.

293
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,380
Great. Then we'll...

294
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,780
What!

295
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,700
Are you out of your mind
or just being foolish?

296
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,820
Have you met him?

297
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,210
Song Han is good
at pretending to be weak

298
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,550
and knows how to talk people...

299
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,420
I'm marrying him willingly.

300
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,959
With the honor of a royal marriage

301
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,740
and the title of princess,

302
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,020
this will be a huge boost
to our business.

303
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,239
Plus, he's orphaned

304
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,279
and needs my help.

305
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,740
So he won't mistreat me.

306
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,180
Also, you hold power in the household.

307
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,359
So we'll live in harmony
as sisters-in-laws.

308
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,700
This marriage is actually a good one.

309
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,230
You make a convincing argument.

310
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,239
But you're overlooking
the most important thing.

311
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,719
You may have genuine feelings for him.

312
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,110
But what about his feelings for you?

313
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,460
Besides, he has questionable motives.

314
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,860
His situation was tough before.

315
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,060
So it's understandable
that he put on a facade.

316
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,279
Zhao,

317
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,999
we would often find plants
with poor roots

318
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,220
when we used to plant rice and flowers.

319
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,759
But with proper care,

320
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,500
they eventually grow.

321
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,980
Marriage is like transplanting a plant.

322
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,700
I believe I can change him.

323
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,439
Young Master,

324
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,060
you've been waiting for four hours.

325
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,420
Thank you for your guidance,
Eunuch Wang.

326
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,060
Official Song,

327
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,060
please be seated.

328
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,660
This used to be
the late Duke of Ying's seat.

329
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,420
(Secret Letter)
Now, it's yours, Second Young Master.

330
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,220
(Duke of Ying's Residence)

331
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,039
Anping,

332
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,799
stop opening up the gifts.

333
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,460
The families of nobles care about face.

334
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,080
My sister is a princess.

335
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,990
Even coming to his house without a formal
princess's residence is already a great honor.

336
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,799
Keep it down.

337
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,919
Don't let your brother-in-law hear this.

338
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,760
You might cause trouble
for your older sister.

339
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,199
Enough nagging.

340
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,860
Most of these gifts
are from our business friends.

341
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,439
He's not the firstborn
or a legitimate son.

342
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,820
What can he say about this?

343
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,060
Exactly.

344
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,660
What's so special about these gifts?

345
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,740
Gosh, stop opening them.

346
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,239
My apologies, Son-in-law.

347
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,100
Anping had a bit too much to drink.

348
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,300
He's just excited.

349
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,780
Please don't take offense.

350
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,060
No matter.

351
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,860
These gifts and money are meant
for Princess Anyu.

352
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,060
Anping, are you the princess's
younger brother?

353
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,999
Yes.

354
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,199
Mother. Father.

355
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,300
Since my brother-in-law has spoken,
as the only male in the family,

356
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:45,460
shouldn't my sister's gift money
and betrothal gifts all go to me?

357
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,860
Insolence!

358
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,279
Who's this?

359
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,420
Who are you?

360
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,260
You dare hit me?

361
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,540
Do you know how I am?

362
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,479
My sister is a princess granted
by the emperor,

363
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,060
and I'm her only younger brother!

364
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,399
This is the Empress's jade token.

365
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,980
Seeing this token is like seeing
the Empress herself.

366
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,599
You, a mere commoner,

367
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,060
dare to openly take
the Princess's gifts.

368
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,199
Such disrespect toward the royal family.

369
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,439
Guards, take him out

370
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,790
and give him twenty lashes.

371
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,380
Father! Mother!

372
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,420
Move it!

373
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,479
- Madam.
- Forgive us.

374
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,639
Please, have mercy.

375
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,959
- Forgive us, Your Majesty.
- Forgive us.

376
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,399
It's my fault for not teaching
my son manners.

377
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,540
Directress Su.

378
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,460
The Princess requests your presence.

379
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,860
Out of respect for the Princess,

380
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,719
we will let this go.

381
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,580
If you dare to insult
the royal dignity again,

382
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,820
it won't be just lashes.

383
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,940
Thank you, Your Majesty.

384
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,650
My poor son!

385
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,679
Anping, are you all right?

386
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,060
Mother, my face is all swollen
from being hit.

387
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,840
My poor son.

388
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,900
(Noble Integrity)

389
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,639
The auspicious time has arrived.

390
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,580
The newlyweds shall perform their bows.

391
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,500
First bow.

392
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,500
Second bow.

393
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,900
An illegitimate son marries

394
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,079
a merchant's daughter
who turns into a princess.

395
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,220
No wonder only
a lady official is presiding.

396
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,620
Even the Duke and Duchess
didn't show up.

397
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,780
That's right.

398
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,919
The Duke
and Duchess of Ying have arrived

399
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,420
to congratulate the martial champion
and Princess Anyu!

400
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,620
Greetings, Your Grace.

401
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,690
Greetings, Your Grace.

402
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,580
Zhao,

403
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,140
I knew you would come.

404
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,460
Of course, I would come.

405
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,060
Here, cover it properly.

406
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,820
Look at all this.

407
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,980
So much gold, silver, and jewels.

408
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,540
- Look.
- There are all kinds of jewels.

409
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,940
Today is the Princess's wedding.

410
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,260
Let's all celebrate.

411
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,540
Thank you all for coming.

412
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,740
According to tradition,

413
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,900
a wedding officiant should be someone
who has experienced full blessings.

414
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,820
My parents have passed away.

415
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,340
I once thought

416
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,580
I would never know warmth.

417
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,340
Fortunately,

418
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,060
someone came

419
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,140
into my life.

420
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,860
Now,

421
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,879
I treasure the beauty of a good marriage

422
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,100
and the value of a good partner

423
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,700
more than anyone.

424
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,540
So,

425
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,620
Song Han,

426
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,500
I wish you all the same happiness.

427
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,300
A harmonious couple
and deeply affectionate.

428
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,940
I believe

429
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,900
this is Song Yichun's greatest wish too.

430
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,900
I will remember.

431
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,399
Ceremony complete!

432
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,239
- Good!
- Good!

433
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,319
- Congratulations!
- Wishing them a happy life together!

434
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,460
Congratulations!

435
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:44,220
(Diecui Pavilion)

436
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,740
Since you're here to congratulate Ansu,

437
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,380
why didn't you attend
Ansu's wedding ceremony?

438
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,559
A bunch of ordinary people making
so much noise.

439
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,700
What's the point?

440
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,740
But you all

441
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,700
acted out a great show
of brotherly love.

442
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,780
Why are you looking for me?

443
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,220
I taught you acupuncture to save lives.

444
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,500
But today I'll teach you something

445
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,700
to save yourself.

446
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,900
What do you mean?

447
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,620
Leave Mantis Song.

448
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,860
He's now a target.

449
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,980
For your sake, and for the Dou Family,

450
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,380
you can't follow him into danger.

451
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,780
I just want to break free from this game

452
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,500
to gain my freedom.

453
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,639
Do you know who controls the pieces?

454
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,020
Even the Emperor

455
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,380
could be a pawn.

456
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,180
We don't know yet who will win.

457
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,660
Even if that day comes,

458
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,500
I'll accept my fate.

459
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,980
Indeed,

460
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,919
love makes

461
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,700
even the wisest foolish.

462
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,380
Don't say I didn't warn you.

463
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,220
If Mantis Song faces
a great misfortune again,

464
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,980
the freedom you see

465
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,020
will be in jeopardy.

466
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,540
Congratulations, Second Young Master.

467
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,060
Thank you.

468
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,100
Congratulations, Second Young Master.

469
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,820
We wish you a long and happy life.

470
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,980
Look at him.

471
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,940
Greetings, Second Young Master.

472
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,719
Congratulations on your marriage

473
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,220
and wishing you many children.

474
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,239
He's relying on his new wife now
after his father died.

475
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,079
Exactly.

476
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,620
Congratulations, Second Young Master.

477
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:48,060
Let's go.

478
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,759
For an illegitimate child
to achieve this level

479
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,999
is already incredible.

480
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,210
What more could he want?

481
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,959
He relied on his father
when he was alive.

482
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,580
Then on his brother
when his father died.

483
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,460
Now, he's relying on his new wife.

484
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,220
I can't help but envy.

485
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,980
(Double Happiness)

486
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,980
Best wishes on your marriage,
Prince Consort.

487
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,300
Thank you, Prince Consort.

488
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,799
Thank you, Prince Consort.

489
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,940
You can leave now.

490
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,340
Best wishes on your marriage,
Prince Consort.

491
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,940
Directress Su,

492
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,460
get some rest now.

493
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,700
Thank you, Prince Consort.

494
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,380
Your Highness.

495
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,399
I'm not used to people waiting on me.

496
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,959
So I poured the nuptial wine myself.

497
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,260
Is that improper?

498
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,700
Your Highness, you worry too much.

499
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,500
It's not a problem.

500
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,180
I don't like having people
in my room too.

501
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,540
So I've dismissed the servants.

502
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,980
You should call me Ansu,

503
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,220
like before.

504
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,100
It's too formal to call me like that.

505
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,820
A Princess is a Princess.

506
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,740
I dare not overstep.

507
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,260
According to tradition,

508
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,820
shall we have our nuptial wine first?

509
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,839
Muyu,

510
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,679
I have a wedding gift for you.

511
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,780
Could you turn around?

512
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,380
Muyu!

513
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,940
Your face...

514
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,700
This

515
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,220
is the handkerchief I gave you
when we first met.

516
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,460
Did you keep it all this time?

517
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,020
Your Highness,

518
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,660
I'm sorry.

519
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,900
This handkerchief symbolizes
our beginning.

520
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,380
I planned to return it today,

521
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,700
marking the outcome of our relationship.

522
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,380
I'm not used to being served closely

523
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,479
because

524
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,860
I often can't control myself.

525
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,279
I don't know

526
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,780
why I've become like this.

527
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,180
Your Highness,

528
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,940
forgive me.

529
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,380
I'll stay away tonight.

530
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,380
Rest well.

531
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,540
(Duke of Ying's Residence)

532
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,740
Princess Anyu has arrived!

533
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,660
Did you sleep well last night?

534
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,980
Thank you for your concern.

535
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,620
I feel much better.

536
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,420
- I...
- Princess.

537
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,039
Given your noble status,

538
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,700
everyone should greet and serve you tea.

539
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,220
That's right.

540
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,060
We are all subjects

541
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,500
and the Princess should be the head.

542
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,960
We must respect the hierarchy.

543
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,039
That's right.

544
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,380
The Princess's marriage
is a favor granted by the Emperor.

545
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,620
Why not let the Princess manage
the household

546
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,300
to show unity?

547
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,660
Sister-in-law is the head
of the household.

548
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,420
So I should serve tea.

549
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,580
Princess,

550
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,740
this doesn't comply
with royal etiquette.

551
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,660
The lady of the house
should serve tea to the Princess.

552
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,140
The royal dignity cannot be compromised.

553
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,060
The Directress is right.

554
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,380
It was my oversight.

555
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,460
Bring the tea here.

556
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,860
The lady of the house should kneel
and serve tea to Princess Anyu.

557
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,380
Zhao,

558
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,140
- let me serve you.
- Princess,

559
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,860
this is not following royal etiquette.

560
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,860
If this is not appropriate,

561
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,100
then please inform the Empress

562
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,260
and request another princess.

563
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,700
There's no need for that.

564
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,820
Let's support each other

565
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,100
in the days to come as always.

566
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,900
(Mo's True Emotion)

567
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,900
(Melody of Bamboo and Pines)

568
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,679
Princess, you're of a higher status.

569
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,580
You shouldn't be doing
such menial tasks.

570
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,300
And that servant maid, Su Lan,

571
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,620
how can she order you around?

572
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,220
Where are her manners?

573
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:03,079
We're friends who grew up together.

574
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,580
There's no hierarchy between us.

575
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,279
That was in the past.

576
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,540
Now you're a princess.

577
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,460
Your every word and action reflects
on the royal family.

578
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,020
Princess.

579
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,820
Prince Consort.

580
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:25,030
This is the most popular snack
in the capital right now.

581
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,340
I had someone lined up to buy it.

582
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,620
Try it.

583
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,060
How is it?

584
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,460
Delicious.

585
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,180
Yes, it's delicious.

586
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,420
I'll take some to Zhao.

587
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,100
I'll go with you.

588
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,839
Zhao, you're slacking off again.

589
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,220
Didn't I tell you the opera book
hasn't been found yet?

590
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,180
Why don't you ask Ansu?

591
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,079
She used to organize
all the books and items

592
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,340
for the autumn festival.

593
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,159
She knows

594
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,500
where everything is.

595
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,820
But now she's a princess.

596
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,999
When I went to Xixiang Place
to assign tasks,

597
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,540
the lady official scolded me.

598
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,990
I wanted to reason it out with Ansu.

599
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,300
But Song Han stopped me.

600
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,199
Acting high and mighty.

601
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,159
One day,

602
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,260
they might beat us to set an example.

603
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,719
If it weren't for Madam's care,

604
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,160
she wouldn't be where she is today.

605
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,020
Don't say things like that.

606
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,900
They've been under the sun all day.

607
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,500
But the paintings aren't dry yet.

608
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,940
It's getting windy.
Put all these away quickly.

609
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,620
Ansu,

610
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,620
we'll deliver the snacks later.

611
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,900
Let's go back first.

612
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,780
I have a gift for you.

613
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,190
I wanted to give it to you
during the autumn festival.

614
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,940
But I'm not sure if you'll like it.

615
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,660
Let's go and take a look.

616
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,060
This is the room

617
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,980
I prepared for you.

618
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,940
You can grind ink, balance the ledgers,

619
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,580
or anything you want here.

620
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,060
Have you been sleeping here alone
these days?

621
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,020
Yes.

622
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,260
I was afraid I might hurt you

623
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,620
if my illness acted up.

624
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,060
I took you away from Yizhi Hall earlier

625
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,580
because I didn't want you to be sad.

626
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,460
Sometimes people just say things
in the heat of the moment.

627
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,460
You don't need to take it to heart.

628
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,180
They weren't wrong.

629
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,450
When the Miao Family fell into decline,

630
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,639
if it weren't
for Zhao treating me like a sister

631
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,860
and guiding me,

632
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,279
I wouldn't be any different
from the servants.

633
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,919
Sister-in-law didn't mean any harm.

634
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,820
She's just used to ordering you around

635
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,380
and can't change it overnight.

636
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,180
If there's only one person

637
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,700
who values you

638
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,180
in this world,

639
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,380
it's already enough.

640
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,439
(Yizhi Hall)

641
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,199
Your Graces,

642
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,780
our spies in Liaodong have reported.

643
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,940
According to the court's decree,

644
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,870
the grain price at the horse market
should be seven taels for every ten dan.

645
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,860
However, Lord Qing
has secretly inflated the price

646
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:16,400
to twenty taels each month.

647
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,239
He only submits thirty percent
to the court.

648
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,680
This has thrown Liaodong into chaos.

649
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,839
Lord Qing is using his power

650
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,100
to accumulate private wealth.

651
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,759
This is a serious matter

652
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,940
and needs careful planning.

653
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,380
If we act rashly without a backup plan,

654
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,620
Lord Qing might cover it up

655
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,980
and retaliate.

656
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,380
Sister-in-law, I'm sorry.

657
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:52,919
Please don't make things difficult
for the Princess and ruin your friendship.

658
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,679
You talk about friendship.

659
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,409
We've been called animals,

660
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,260
don't we deserve an explanation?

661
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,580
If I hadn't come,

662
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,540
were you planning
to flay Dou Zhao alive?

663
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,399
Today, we sever our ties.

664
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,519
If we meet again,

665
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,860
