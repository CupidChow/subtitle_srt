1
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,200
This withered tree has not bloomed
or grown leaves for decades.

2
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,070
Why sweep every day

3
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,000
when there is nothing to clean up?

4
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,219
Master says

5
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,750
sweeping is part of our cultivation.

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,019
Regardless of fallen leaves,

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,750
it must be swept daily.

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,040
How stubborn.

9
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,259
The Abbot was referring

10
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,440
to your heart,

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,270
not just this small patch of ground.

12
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,750
It's raining.

13
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,249
Come sit with me for a while.

14
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,840
Have some tea to kill time.

15
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,990
The old tree has blossomed!

16
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,750
Look!

17
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,910
(You were born emotionally detached)

18
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,480
(and indifferent since childhood.)

19
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,510
(Like this withered tree.)

20
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,150
(Although there's life,)

21
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,899
(it bears no flowers or leaves.)

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,200
This withered tree neither blooms

23
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,430
nor grows leaves.

24
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,550
Its dark, lifeless appearance

25
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,240
doesn't fit with the elegance
of this courtyard.

26
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,040
Why not have someone dig it up
and toss it out?

27
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,270
Every living thing
has its purpose for existing.

28
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,910
One day, when you've grown

29
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,990
and experienced the world,

30
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:42,790
you'll understand
that even a withered tree can revive.

31
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,240
If I can understand when I'm older,

32
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,550
why did my father send me here, then?

33
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,400
Everyone has their own path in life.

34
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:00,379
Being emotionally detached
may be a burden in the world.

35
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,600
But in the Buddhist realm,
it can be a blessing.

36
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,680
You are fated to walk this path,

37
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,510
so your Dharma name will be Yuantong.

38
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,839
=Blossom=
(Adapted from the novel "Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

39
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,100
=Episode 18=

40
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,050
Come and take a look, sir.

41
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,649
(Now, this is weird.)

42
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,230
(He's even sending me back home.)

43
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,790
(The fierce soldier has turned
into someone compassionate.)

44
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,299
(What is he up to?)

45
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,520
Come and take a look.

46
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,289
(Oh my.)

47
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,640
(I once accused the Dou Family
of having ulterior motives.)

48
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,760
(Now, I'm the one with a motive.)

49
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,320
(How can I change this impression?)

50
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,020
(Dou's Residence)

51
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,150
Thank you for saving me earlier,
Your Lordship.

52
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,360
You even took time escorting me back.

53
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,070
I acted rashly
during the Dragon Boat Festival.

54
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,699
Please take this as my apology.

55
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,760
I hope you can forgive me, Official Dou.

56
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,400
See you.

57
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,760
You're not here to propose, are you?

58
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,280
No, I'm not.

59
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,139
I was on duty today

60
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,320
and just happened to pass by.

61
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:04,059
But the incident with your horse
wasn't purely coincidental.

62
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,899
Firecrackers don't go off on their own.

63
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,360
My man is investigating.

64
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,630
I hear you've offended some
by rejecting marriage proposals

65
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,270
for your fourth daughter.

66
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,640
A man without faults
can still be envied for his treasures.

67
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,480
When you possess
something precious like jade,

68
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,250
giving it up too easily
as "The Spring and Autumn Annals" says

69
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,950
only leads to it
being taken for granted.

70
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,760
Ms. Longevity is far more valuable
than a piece of priceless jade.

71
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,539
I'd sooner resign from my post

72
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,630
than allow her
to be with those scoundrels.

73
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,920
(Her father might seem soft by nature.)

74
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,300
(When it comes to major issues,
he does have some backbone.)

75
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,250
Your Lordship, do you enjoy reading
"The Spring and Autumn Annals" as well?

76
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,630
I only browse through it occasionally.

77
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,699
The lessons
in "The Spring and Autumn Annals" reveal

78
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,130
new insights each time you read it.

79
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,760
When time allows,

80
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,920
we must discuss it further.

81
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,430
Certainly.

82
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,760
Don't let me keep you.

83
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,310
Lu Ming, buy me a copy
of "The Spring and Autumn Annals."

84
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,590
Make sure it's the latest edition
with the imperial annotations.

85
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,590
I thought Your Lordship had
a photographic memory.

86
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,969
You read it once and sent it
to the orphanage afterward.

87
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,830
Did I ever say I bought it to read?

88
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,440
It's for display.

89
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,089
You're not reading
"The Spring and Autumn Annals,"

90
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,470
but romance.

91
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,329
Your Lordship, we've caught the person
who startled the horse.

92
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,760
It was Hai Changbo's servant.

93
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,489
He refused to say anything.

94
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,710
Does he even need to?

95
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,059
It's obvious he was upset

96
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,560
because his proposal was rejected.

97
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,390
But this firecracker is larger
than normal.

98
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:30,000
It's already against regulation.

99
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,819
Someone's likely hiding gunpowder.

100
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,030
Should we investigate?

101
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,019
Let's do it.

102
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,950
It's also a good chance
to deal with Hai Changbo.

103
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,580
(Twilight in Spring)

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
(Imperial Gift)

105
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,290
If anyone pressures you
to discuss marriage in the future,

106
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,200
just show them this.

107
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,830
You have the right to choose

108
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,680
and to refuse.

109
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,830
Even if it's your father or your uncle,

110
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,950
no one can force you anymore.

111
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,070
He could have asked
His Majesty to grant him the marriage.

112
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,800
But instead, he requested His Majesty

113
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,510
to allow you to marry freely.

114
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,560
It shows he genuinely wants
the best for you.

115
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,560
If you agree to marry me,

116
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,409
hang a red tassel on this magnolia tree

117
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,830
in five days.

118
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,710
I can see it from afar.

119
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,280
If you don't,

120
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,270
hang a white one,

121
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,880
and I'll never bother you again.

122
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,550
Little Zhuang Zhou,

123
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,470
Ji Jianming?

124
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,830
What are you doing here?

125
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,319
What did I tell you?

126
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,479
After all that,

127
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,980
they still ended up getting married.

128
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,439
Now, you're hiding in Zhending.

129
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,180
Do you think
you can stay hidden forever?

130
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,839
This situation could blow up
or be resolved quietly.

131
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,399
If a clever person doesn't step in,

132
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,740
it could cause a lot of trouble
for the Dou Family.

133
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,820
Do you want to hear my solution?

134
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,260
I'm not interested in any tricks
that harm others

135
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,360
for personal gain.

136
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,959
It's not about personal gain this time.

137
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,580
It's me sacrificing for others.

138
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,780
Let's take this to the next level
and get married.

139
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,340
Gosh, Ji Jianming!

140
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,039
You and I share
a deep and pure friendship.

141
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,380
I don't want to take anything
to the next level with you.

142
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,580
You said it,

143
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,419
you and I share a deep
and pure friendship.

144
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,039
From now on, don't say anything nonsense

145
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,740
like going separate ways again.

146
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,950
Childish.

147
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,180
It's repaired?

148
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,079
It isn't easy
to repair this foreign item.

149
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,090
It's going to cost more
than just buying a new one.

150
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,919
Yeah, it cost three months of my salary.

151
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,940
A little keepsake
to mark our reconciliation.

152
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,500
Don't break it again.

153
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,380
Also,

154
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,529
your father said not to go back
if anything happens.

155
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,820
He'll handle it all.

156
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,529
But no matter what we choose now,

157
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,940
someone is bound to be upset.

158
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,260
If Father doesn't choose a side,

159
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,199
it's going to offend the imperial family

160
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,540
and upset the emperor.

161
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,140
My father is a scholar at heart,

162
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,340
he doesn't understand how to adapt.

163
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,140
He won't be able to handle it.

164
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,740
But I can't let this matter fall
into Fifth Uncle's hands.

165
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,100
Are you worried that Fifth Master Dou

166
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,399
might use your marriage

167
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,479
to drag the Dou Family

168
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,740
into the power struggle over the throne?

169
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,140
Politics in officialdom are dangerous.

170
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,380
Many have lost their lives

171
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,380
in pursuit of fame and power.

172
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,580
I only want a peaceful, joyful,

173
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,820
free, and stable life.

174
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,580
Teach me to read the stars.

175
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,130
You have the fate to understand the causes
of the universe.

176
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,580
Why do you need to look at the stars?

177
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,660
But the road ahead is dark,

178
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,420
and I can't see anything.

179
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,020
Why cling to the mundane world?

180
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,020
Exploring the world, sailing the seas,

181
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,220
how delightful it is.

182
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,340
Do you remember anything
from your past life?

183
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,519
Who could possibly remember that?

184
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,159
When I read the stars,
I can only see the present.

185
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,780
I don't claim to know everything.

186
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,740
Is everything in life destined?

187
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,439
Will what's meant to happen

188
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,340
will happen?

189
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,060
Have you heard of planetary movements?

190
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,399
As the stars shift, so do people.

191
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,919
If everything were truly fated,

192
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,759
why would you be worrying here?

193
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,479
It's because life is full of uncertainty

194
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,900
that it's so fascinating.

195
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,420
(Zhaowen Bookstore)

196
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,180
Young Lady, you're back.

197
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,580
What has Song Mo been up to lately?

198
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,420
Song Mo is just doing his usual duties.

199
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,533
By the way, Hai Changbo

200
00:11:22,534 --> 00:11:25,220
is suspected of privately making
gunpowder and firecrackers.

201
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,020
Song Mo is investigating the case.

202
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,340
Well, well.

203
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,700
He's still working in the court
and investigating cases?

204
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,679
At a time like this,

205
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,700
he still have the mind
to investigate cases?

206
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,759
Is there anything wrong?

207
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,060
Nothing is wrong.

208
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,639
He does his job,

209
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,900
and I'll do mine.

210
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,420
Manager Zhao,

211
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,340
show me the latest gold-spotted paper.

212
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,359
His Lordship is part
of the Imperial Guard.

213
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,020
What's wrong with him going to court?

214
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,559
Higher!

215
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,079
A little higher!

216
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,859
- Why is it white?
- Higher!

217
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,839
- Fifth Master sent you to the manor,
- Come on, a little higher!

218
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,799
- and now you sneak back home.
- I said, higher.

219
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,559
What if someone notices?

220
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,959
Higher.

221
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,540
- Let's go back, Young Lady.
- Higher.

222
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,449
Su Xin,

223
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,700
- take down that white kite.
- A little higher.

224
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,260
Yes, Young Lady.

225
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,260
I'll do it.

226
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,620
How did you get into this courtyard?

227
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,839
The gatekeeper let us in
to pick up the kite.

228
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,159
Stop playing under this tree.

229
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,300
Understand?

230
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,500
Come on, let's go.

231
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,719
Su Xin,

232
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,700
take down that white tail too.

233
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,860
- Hurry.
- Yes, Young Lady.

234
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,880
The firecracker factory
on the city's outskirts

235
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,359
is indeed connected to Hai Changbo.

236
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,599
It turns out Hai Changbo
has been colluding with people

237
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,060
from the eastern Shenji Camp.

238
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,660
Hai Changbo is someone close
to Lord Qing.

239
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,060
So this batch of gunpowder
is linked to Lord Qing as well.

240
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,900
Does that mean Lord Qing

241
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,399
is involved with the Shenji Camp too?

242
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,870
If that's the case, then Hai Changbo

243
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,780
did that not only
for the proposal rejection.

244
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,620
Your Lordship!

245
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,839
Your Lordship, I've discovered
someone has been tailing me.

246
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,479
I was worried it was Hai Changbo's men.

247
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,630
So I captured the person
and interrogated him harshly.

248
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,780
Then...

249
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,100
What happened next? Speak quickly.

250
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,580
He confessed.

251
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,440
He said

252
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,460
he worked for Chen Qushui.

253
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,060
Chen Qushui's people
were tailing His Lordship?

254
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,580
But Chen Qushui

255
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,940
and Hai Changbo
have no connection at all.

256
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,100
If he's Chen Qushui's man,

257
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,860
then he's also Dou Zhao's people.

258
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,900
Dou Zhao actually sent someone
to follow me?

259
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,479
Yet, you beat him up?

260
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,790
How else would I have known
he was working for Chen Qushui?

261
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,050
But don't worry, Your Lordship.

262
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,279
This guy is weak.

263
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,719
He confessed pretty quickly.

264
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,780
I didn't go too hard on him.

265
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,940
What should I do now?

266
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,380
I couldn't take the beating.

267
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,660
So I gave in.

268
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,119
Later, Lord Song loosened
my bonds himself.

269
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,519
Then he gave me a gold ingot

270
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,980
and let me go.

271
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,879
Did His Lordship say anything?

272
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,060
His Lordship asked me

273
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,060
to send his regards to you.

274
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,540
I've never seen
so much money in my life.

275
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,999
So I didn't dare act recklessly.

276
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,900
So I brought
the gold ingot back to you.

277
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,199
It must have been hard on you.

278
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,799
Consider this gold as your medicine fee.

279
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,020
Take it.

280
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,140
Thank you, Fourth Young Lady!

281
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,140
Fourth Young Lady,

282
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,940
it's my fault
for choosing the wrong person.

283
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,140
Please punish me.

284
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,999
I asked you
to send someone to follow him.

285
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,460
It's not your fault.

286
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,460
I just feel embarrassed
about this whole situation.

287
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,980
Young Lady,

288
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,580
why don't you have some snacks
and rest for a while?

289
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,200
What happened?

290
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,079
It seems there was an explosion
at a firecracker factory in the suburbs.

291
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,740
I don't know if Lord Song is there.

292
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,140
Fetch the water!

293
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,840
Put out the fire!

294
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,620
- Fetch more water!
- Quickly!

295
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,319
Over here!

296
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,439
Why is there an explosion?

297
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,020
Whose firecracker factory is it?

298
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,100
Song Mo!

299
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,820
Song Mo!

300
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,340
Hurry! Fetch more water!

301
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,620
Keep the water coming!

302
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,700
- Song Mo!
- Fourth Young Lady!

303
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,639
Fourth Young Lady, why are you here?

304
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,780
Where is His Lordship?

305
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,140
I couldn't find him.

306
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:03,980
What should we do now?

307
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,180
Song Mo!

308
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,399
Did you see His Lordship?

309
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,479
His Lordship is inside.

310
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,860
He hasn't come out yet.

311
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,399
- Song Mo!
- Fourth Young Lady!

312
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,540
Young Lady!

313
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,300
Song Mo!

314
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,319
Fu! Fu!

315
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,919
I found it. It's all right now.

316
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,330
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

317
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,420
Thank you, sir.

318
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,700
Come on, let's go.

319
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,180
It's very dangerous here.

320
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,700
Why are you here?

321
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,990
Come with me.

322
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,740
Is there anything important?

323
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,300
I grew up in the manor

324
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,220
and surrounded myself
with advisors and guards.

325
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,580
My only thought

326
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,740
was to avoid harm

327
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,780
and live according to my own will.

328
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,710
But never considering

329
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,140
what I truly wanted.

330
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,780
Until just now,

331
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,380
then I realized.

332
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,700
Song Mo,

333
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,280
I like you.

334
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,279
Actually, I've noticed

335
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,460
I had some feelings for a long time.

336
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,359
But I didn't dare

337
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,380
to face a future I couldn't control.

338
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,260
Now,

339
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,060
I'm even more afraid of losing you.

340
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,460
I know

341
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,100
you have to stand tall

342
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,340
and smile through the hardships

343
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,500
just to survive.

344
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,700
But you can be yourself

345
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,580
when you're with me.

346
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,340
I will respect
whatever decision you make

347
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,100
and protect you.

348
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,660
But

349
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,660
I may not be a good wife.

350
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,020
I can't submit to being just a wife

351
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,340
who follows her husband's lead.

352
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,340
But I will try to be your good partner.

353
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,700
All right.

354
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,900
All right, then.

355
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,519
I won't

356
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,700
let those rules bind you.

357
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,490
You fear the seven rules of marriage.

358
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,740
I'll make you seven promises.

359
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,740
Your Lordship,

360
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,740
the warehouse is filled with fireworks.

361
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,780
We might not be able
to put out this fire.

362
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,500
Then clear the surrounding area.

363
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,999
Your Lordship.

364
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,140
Don't let the fire spread.

365
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,220
- Your Lordship, we'll clear it.
- Your Lordship.

366
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,839
- How can you be so tactless?
- What's wrong?

367
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,980
Just go.

368
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,580
Su Xin. Su Lan.

369
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,500
You should go and help too.

370
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,279
It's your fault that we were discovered.

371
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,740
I just want to see more clearly.

372
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,500
Although I've agreed to this marriage,

373
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,500
I fear it won't be easy

374
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,100
for my Fifth Uncle, my father,

375
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,399
or even your father to accept.

376
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,660
It doesn't matter.

377
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,279
Once I've decided to marry you,

378
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,279
I'll take care

379
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,980
of your father's side.

380
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,740
It will be a proper marriage.

381
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,580
How could I let you face it alone?

382
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,140
I'll help you too.

00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,500
is approaching..

388
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,980
I'm afraid there won't be enough time

389
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,660

00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,159
It seems like too much
to have the top hunter

400
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,100
personally teach me how to ride.

401
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,420
This horse is quite valuable.

402
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,060
Are you really willing
to let me ride it?

403
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,300
Of course.

404
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,980
Do you like it, Your Highness?

405
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,980
Of course.

406
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,820
As long as you like it,

407
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,340
I'd be happy to oblige.

408
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,919
This is actually my first time riding.

409
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,500
I'm a little nervous.

410
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,620
The key to riding is relaxation.

411
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,060
As long as you sit properly,
nothing will happen.

412
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,420
Song Mo,

413
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,559
horseback riding is really fun.

414
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,159
Could you come and teach me every day?

415
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,460
If you're willing,

416
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,860
it would be my pleasure.

417
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,540
Stop playing.

418
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,740
The melody of "The Mountain Spirit"
conveys deep and tender emotions,

419
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,340
where the grace and charm
of the admired one shine through.

420
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,180
You haven't yet grasped
the deeper meaning behind it.

421
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,340
Now that Mother is gone,

422
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,020
what's the point
of practicing these things?

423
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,860
You...

424
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,860
Your Grace. Second Young Master.

425
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,900
What is it?

426
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,940
Take some time to appreciate
this melody thoroughly.

427
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,100
Yes, Father.

428
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,439
Go on.

429
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,319
His Lordship has been out with Princess Jingyu
for three days straight.

430
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,319
They just went
to the racetrack together.

431
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,020
Everyone is saying

432
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:22,340
that they might've fell for each other.

433
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,180
His Majesty did have the intention
to grant the marriage during the hunt.

434
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,740
He certainly didn't miss
this opportunity.

435
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,140
Ever since Song Mo divided
the household,

436
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,020
he has been acting recklessly
because of His Majesty's favor.

437
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,060
If he becomes prince consort,

438
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,580
he'll trample
the Duke of Ying's household

439
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,780
under his feet.

440
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,500
Marriage is dictated by the parents.

441
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,420
If you set up a match
for His Lordship first,

442
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,700
His Majesty won't be able
to grant a marriage, right?

443
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,119
Your Grace,

444
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,399
these are all young ladies
from prominent families.

445
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,239
They are graceful and wise,
with gentle and virtuous personalities,

446
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,300
all of a similar age to His Lordship.

447
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,860
Leave.

448
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,599
Your Grace, you seem dissatisfied.

449
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,860
If you have any preferences,
feel free to say it.

450
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,260
My son has a difficult temperament,

451
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,100
no proper lady can tame him.

452
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,580
You should find him

453
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,900
someone strong-willed and sharp-tongued.

454
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,500
A strong-willed woman?

455
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,439
You certainly have a unique taste
in selecting a daughter-in-law.

456
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,900
This is the first time
I've heard of such a thing.

457
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,999
But there is one candidate.

458
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,639
In the western part of the capital, the Fourth
Young Lady of the Dou Family, Dou Zhao.

459
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,119
She's talented, proud,

460
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,919
unreasonable, and fierce.

461
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,319
She grew up in the countryside
in Zhending.

462
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,580
They say she's quite
a strong-willed woman.

463
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,519
Is that true?

464
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,660
Absolutely.

465
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,799
The Duke of Jining was willing
to bear the disgrace

466
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,170
of leaving her to marry her sister,

467
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,339
Fifth Young Lady Dou.

468
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,079
That shows the Fourth Young Lady Dou

469
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,279
is certainly not a gentle,
virtuous type of woman.

470
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,480
Perfect.

471
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,460
That's perfect!

472
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,140
Get going and handle it.

473
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,340
Yes, Your Grace.

474
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,500
Your Grace,

475
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,140
are you certain of Dou Zhao?

476
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,980
What's wrong with the Dou Family?

477
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,359
Song Mo and the Fifth Master Dou

478
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,100
have been fighting like cats and dogs.

479
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,220
If these two were to marry,

480
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,940
there would be no peace

481
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,100
at Yizhi Hall.

482
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,820
By the way,

483
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,900
to be safe,

484
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,799
go to Zhending

485
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,580
to gather information about this woman.

486
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,159
Yes, Your Grace.

487
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,860
(Tea)

488
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,540
Fourth Young Lady's mother left her

489
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,039
with maybe

490
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,220
one or two thousand taels
of silver at most.

491
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,239
The Fifth Young Lady's
maternal grandfather

492
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,140
is the Minister of War.

493
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,100
So she's definitely better off
than Fourth Young Lady.

494
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,740
Isn't Dou Zhao the richest in Zhending?

495
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,660
That was in the past.

496
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,359
The maritime trade isn't doing well now.

497
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,039
- Her wealth has almost been depleted.
- Exactly.

498
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,719
Her family fortune is all managed
by the Madam of the Dou Family.

499
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,079
Now, she's relying completely

500
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,919
on her mother's dowry to get by.

501
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,740
She's nothing but a sharp-tongued,
domineering woman.

502
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,879
There was a heavy rain
that almost flooded Zhending.

503
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,750
Originally, the idea was
to use sorghum instead of wheat.

504
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,570
No matter how much we tried
to persuade her,

505
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,220
Fourth Young Lady just wouldn't agree.

506
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,399
She insisted on delivering the wheat.

507
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,679
Isn't that forcing us?

508
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,980
Not a strong-willed woman.

509
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,599
But a poisonous one, a wicked one.

510
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,990
Fourth Young Lady once set her eyes

511
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,999
on Young Master Pang Kunbai
of the Pang Family

512
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,540
and insisted on marrying him.

513
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,719
Naturally, he refused.

514
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,039
So she ordered her guards

515
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,959
to beat him up.

516
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,679
Dou Zhao is well-known
within a hundred li.

517
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,839
Her grandmother raised her.

518
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,850
But she's nothing more
than an ungrateful creature.

519
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,070
In pursuit of a better family,

520
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,350
she abandoned her grandmother
and returned to the Capital.

521
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,010
She even bribed the county office,

522
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,910
waiting for the Pang Family
to file a complaint.

523
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,839
Young Master Pang was instead branded

524
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,820
with a bad reputation
for bullying women.

525
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,700
What a sin.

526
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,160
Is she really that outrageous?

527
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,779
It looks like she truly

528
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,859
is a heartless and ruthless woman.

529
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,999
(Yizhi Hall)

530
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,919
I heard you

531
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,100
spoke well of me
in front of His Majesty.

532
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,959
Not only has His Majesty
reinstated my position,

533
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,500
but he also praised me.

534
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,189
The reason you were reinstated

535
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:55,079
is because you have great foresight.

536
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,129
His Majesty saw and approved
of your deep love for your daughter.

537
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,980
Despite some criticism,
he couldn't bear to be too harsh on you.

538
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,500
But I didn't do anything.

539
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,039
That's not true.

540
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,220
Not only for Dou Zhao,

541
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,919
but we also have to thank you

542
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,800
for the firecracker incident
in the suburbs.

543
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,100
The firecracker incident?

544
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,200
What does that have to do with me?

545
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,810
You were not afraid of powerful figures

546
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,719
and dared to beat Hai Changbo
out of the residence.

547
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,340
Very few in the court have such courage.

548
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,799
It's because of you

549
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,620
that Hai Changbo was exposed,

550
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,940
which led to the firecracker case
being solved so quickly.

551
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,620
This accomplishment
belongs entirely to you.

552
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,860
In truth, I should thank you.

553
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,919
Hearing you speak this way

554
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,140
is quite refreshing.

555
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,020
- Please, have a drink.
- You too.

556
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,740
This wine is excellent.

557
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,860
It would be a waste to keep this wine
in my residence.

558
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,260
Please accept them.

559
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,300
This is an imperial gift,
Sweet Dew wine.

560
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,660
As a token of my gratitude.

561
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,380
The works of the hundred schools
of thought are vast and diverse.

562
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,140
Yet, you can focus and study them.

563
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,780
That's rare indeed.

564
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,180
(The Spring and Autumn Annals)

565
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,580
This is a rare edition
from the previous dynasty.

566
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,319
If you like it,

567
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,060
I'll give it to you.

568
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,700
No, I can't accept this.

569
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,980
A gentleman does not take
what others hold dear.

570
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,359
Since you read it often,

571
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,620
you should keep it.

572
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,780
I've long heard that your handwriting
is graceful and elegant.

573
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,520
But I've never had the chance to see it.

574
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,380
These Four Treasures of the Study
deserve someone refined.

575
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,220
It would be a waste

576
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,460
for a military man like me.

577
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,140
These are decorative ink sticks,

578
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,700
a purple brush,

579
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,380
and an enamel inkstone.

580
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,860
It's said the inkstone can warm
the ink and keep it from drying.

581
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,620
Absolute nonsense!

582
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,859
Go out and ask around

583
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,959
about how Song Mo seized

584
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,700
his family's residence through coercion.

585
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,840
After he saved me
when the horse was startled,

586
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,820
I saw he wasn't as people say.

587
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,809
He's talented
both in martial and literary skills,

588
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,500
well-mannered and steady.

589
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,420
People only envy the capable.

590
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:29,219
I think the rumors outside are baseless.

591
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,590
It's completely unfounded.

592
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,560
I promised Ms. Longevity
she could decide on her own marriage

593
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,620
after the bride replacement incident.

594
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,220
Besides,

595
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,150
she has an imperial decree.

596
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,780
The world has truly turned upside down.

597
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,460
She actually gets
to choose her own husband!

598
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:49,900
Dou Zhao is being reckless.

599
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,260
But you're being just as foolish.

600
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,340
Even if you act foolishly,

601
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,900
the Duke of Ying, that old fox

602
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,100
surely won't agree to this marriage.

603
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,940
Master!

604
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,260
Master!

605
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,959
Master, Duke of Ying has sent betrothal gifts
on Lord Song's behalf.

606
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,940
The chests are all lined up
at the front gate.

607
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,900
Are you saying it's
from the Duke of Ying, Song Yichun?

608
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,079
Yes, Fifth Master.

609
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,300
The visiting card clearly bears
His Grace's name.

610
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:28,999
I was right, wasn't I?

611
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,879
Within three days,

612
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,939
your father will undoubtedly come
with a proposal.

613
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,060
It's as you've predicted.

614
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,719
If I openly express my wish
to marry you,

615
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,119
he will make sure it doesn't happen.

616
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,350
Instead, taking the opposite approach

617
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,790
and letting him choose
a so-called beautiful yet unruly woman

618
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,380
to ruin my match with the Princess.

619
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,759
Of course,

620
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,140
Princess Jingyu's support
has been crucial in all of this.

621
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,490
Congratulations on your clever maneuver,
Your Lordship.

622
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,100
Congratulations on a swift victory,
Fourth Young Lady.

623
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,260
Mission accomplished!

624
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,820
Success through hard work!

625
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,879
A joyous and blessed union!

626
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,159
United in purpose and action!

627
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,780
Harmony in marriage,
with mutual support!

628
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,399
Is that wrong?

629
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,790
Or is it blessed with offspring,

630
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,799
long-lasting prosperity,
success and prosperity,

631
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,290
and fortune in the Year of the Dragon?

632
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,860
Master,

633
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,300
it's from the jeweler's shop.

634
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,980
(For the long term,
this marriage is a great match.)

635
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,300
Bring the betrothal gifts inside.

636
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,100
Yes, Master.

637
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,439
(Twilight in Spring)
A little higher.

638
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,279
That's it.

639
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,640
A little higher. A little bit more.

640
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,119
(Twilight in Spring)

641
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:12,959
Looks good.

642
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,980
(Picturesque Scenery)

643
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,380
The paper-cutting is stunning.

644
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,279
It is, right?

645
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,020
(Double Happiness)

646
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,999
The sleeve length
should be shortened by half an inch,

647
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,890
and the skirt could use
an extra inch in length.

648
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,690
For the headdress,

649
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,880
we can add a phoenix flying
through peonies embroidery,

650
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,380
with some red and blue gemstones
and cat's eye gems.

651
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,220
That's enough, Su.

652
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,460
But stop fussing over these.

653
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,060
You came all this way

654
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,319
and we haven't even had
a moment to chat.

655
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,439
You've been busy picking fabrics,

656
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,799
measuring,
and choosing patterns non-stop.

657
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,180
Look at your fingers.

658
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,940
I'm enjoying it, though.

659
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,660
Don't you dare say it looks bad.

660
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,960
Even if you embroidered a bald phoenix,
I'd still wear it.

661
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,210
By the way,
I've arranged an escort agency

662
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,079
to deliver the private savings
you kept with me

663
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,670
and the profits
from the potato business here.

664
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,860
It is already on the way here.

665
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,759
Are you sure Song Mo can be trusted

666
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,460
with that much money?

667
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,199
Ms. Longevity! Su!

668
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,719
This is the 28th flower I tried

669
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,839
for wedding pastries.

670
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,880
Su Xin, Su Lan.
Try them on Ms. Longevity's behalf.

671
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,980
I have an upset stomach.

672
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,409
I have to go now.

673
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:29,340
I need to help Su adjust
the wedding garment.

674
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,660
You...

675
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,839
Su.

676
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,140
Ru,

677
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,399
stop messing around.

678
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,599
How can anyone digest

679
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,100
seven to eight wedding pastries a day?

680
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,359
But I just want to make

681
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,140
the best pastries for Ms. Longevity.

682
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,140
This is the best already.

683
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,180
If you sent these out,

684
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,260
half the snack shops in the Capital

685
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,060
would have to shut down.

686
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,250
Really?

687
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,179
Did you hear that?

688
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,320
Fourth Young Lady.

689
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,679
- Fourth Young Lady.
- Grandmother.

690
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,820
Grandmother.

691
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,420
Old Madam won't
let anyone else touch this chest.

692
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,620
She insisted on handing it
to you herself.

693
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,860
I saved up

694
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,300
these jewels and property for you.

695
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,980
It never hurts to have a little extra
for your dowry.

696
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,440
The more secure you are,

697
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,460
the more at ease I'll be.

698
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:28,540
This pendant is an heirloom
of the Cui Family.

699
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,060
In the future,

700
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,260
the elite officials
of the Cui Clan's Academy

701
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,700
will support you
as His Lordship's wife.

702
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,479
I even said

703
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,260
I would take you out traveling.

704
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,420
But I ended up marrying first.

705
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,580
Grandmother,

706
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,919
I'll definitely...

707
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,060
No rush.

708
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,540
Good things don't stick around
with troublemakers.

709
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:56,110
As long as Song Mo values you,

710
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,260
you'll find beauty
in every corner of the world.

711
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:02,540
Marriage isn't the only path for women.

712
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,029
Since you're getting married,

713
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,740
make sure it's a marriage
that brings you happiness.

714
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,740
If anyone mistreats you,

715
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,900
don't suffer in silence.

716
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,900
This will always be your home.

717
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,959
By the way, we've been busy all day.

718
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,740
Where's Uncle?

719
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,919
This son of mine
might not be very good with words

720
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,270
and a bit slow.

721
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:31,650
At least he values loyalty
and keeps his promises.

722
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,260
Ms. Longevity,

723
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,380
the bracelet your mother left you
wasn't just one,

724
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,220
it was a pair.

725
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,330
A pair?

726
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,820
Shiying was supposed
to wear the other one.

727
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,119
When you were born, it was agreed

728
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,799
that these bracelets would be passed on

729
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,020
to you and your husband.

730
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,900
(Two perfect jades, a perfect couple.)

731
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,260
(Their love is pure and true,
like flawless jade.)

732
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,500
(On the first anniversary
of Guqiu's death,)

733
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,860
(Shiying buried both the bracelet)

734
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,460
(and a jar of wine)

735
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,420
(under the big tree in the manor.)

736
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,820
(Years later,)

737
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,340
(the tree was cut down
during the military settlements.)

738
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,220
(Then several floods...)

739
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,700
Ms. Longevity is getting married.

740
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,220
Without this bracelet,

741
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,620
how could Guqiu be at peace?

742
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,260
Father.

743
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,460
Forgive me,

744
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,460
Ms. Longevity.

745
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,420
Let us find it.

746
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,020
Why are you standing here watching

747
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,289
from a distance instead of going over?

748
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,780
They said meeting before the ceremony
brings bad luck.

749
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,180
It's just a bracelet,
is it worth all this?

750
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,540
That bracelet holds memories
my mother left me.

751
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,220
An emotionally detached person like you
wouldn't understand.

752
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,980
You're feeling uncertain
about the marriage.

753
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,730
So you're clinging
to something sentimental.

754
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,820
Why don't I give you
something practical instead?

755
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,279
This is a rare, fast,
and enduring horse,

756
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,140
which I handpicked
from the Liaodong market.

757
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,940
If you grow tired, start to regret,

758
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,759
or be mistreated someday,

759
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,319
you can ride it to find me at any time.

760
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,110
I guarantee
Song Mo won't catch up with you.

761
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,780
It's that Ji Yong again.

762
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,300
Bai.

763
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,720
Bai.

764
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,140
Bai, come back.

765
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,860
My mother spent her life hoping

766
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,060
to be a perfect couple
with a strong mutual connection.

767
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,860
But I still can't find
the other bracelet.

768
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,380
Does this mean she's disappointed in me?

769
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,860
Ms. Longevity.

770
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,900
Why are you covering my eyes?

771
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,340
Your father said meeting the bride
before the ceremony

772
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,980
brings bad luck.

773
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,380
I'll help you find it.

774
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,500
There's no need.

775
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,180
We've searched for so long.

776
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,860
It's probably lost for good.

777
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,559
There's so much to do for the wedding.

778
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,880
You should go and take care of it.

779
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,420
Don't worry about this.

780
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,780
Tomorrow is the big day.

781
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,460
As for the bride's departure,
I'll check over with you again.

782
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,780
The dowry includes 100 taels of gold,
500 taels of silver,

783
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,380
and five trunks of embroidered gowns...

784
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,279
Let me go. I wasn't eavesdropping.

785
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,420
Let me go!

786
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,340
- Move!
- Let me go!

787
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,580
His Lordship is about to get married,
and he dares to eavesdrop.

788
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,799
- You rude brat!
- Speak!

789
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,100
Who sent you here?

790
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,900
Uncle?

791
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,180
- Ms. Longevity?
- Uncle?

792
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,460
Let me go!

793
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:41,919
I didn't know it was you, Official Zhao.

794
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,060
Forgive me for offending you.

795
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,020
After fighting
to get half a month's leave,

796
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,170
I rushed all the way here
to offer my congratulations,

797
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,060
only to be mistaken for a thief.

798
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,020
Tell me, do I look like a thief?

799
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,180
With this many armed guards,

800
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,740
is this a wedding or a prison?

801
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,999
Sir,

802
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,879
His Lordship stationed

803
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,319
the guards here to prevent any mishap
like the bride switch incident.

804
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,559
Seeing your muddy shoes
and lingering by the wall, I...

805
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,740
- Come inside now.
- That's why I got it wrong.

806
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,780
You messed up again.

807
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,180
(Cui's Residence)

808
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,700
You saw that, right?

809
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,729
Just by looking at Song Mo's men,

810
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:27,780
you can tell he's naturally suspicious
and ruthless in his ways.

811
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,220
Are you really going to marry

812
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,140
a cruel and violent man like him?

813
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,550
Uncle,

814
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,799
people say I'm selfish,

815
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,860
fierce, greedy,

816
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,660
and have the face of a shrew.

817
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,999
Outsiders are bound to be biased.

818
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,460
So their opinions don't count.

819
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,660
Song Mo isn't like that.

820
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,580
When he was in Futing,
he dedicated himself to the people,

821
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,360
leading his troops to eliminate pirates.

822
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:53,839
He is completely sincere and devoted
to protecting the people.

823
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,490
How could he be a cruel
and violent thug?

824
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,959
Don't let your feelings cloud
your judgment

825
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,060
or be fooled by his appearance.

826
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,759
I've heard rumors

827
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,999
that he killed all the guards

828
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,889
in his residence for no reason.

829
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:09,580
Do you really think someone like that
could be a good person?

830
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,379
Don't you realize

831
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,420
a Duke's household
is a den of tigers and wolves?

832
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,899
A noble family is not the same
as an official household.

833
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,519
Just look at the Duke himself.

834
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,919
The Duke of Ying's family
isn't exactly a good one to marry into.

835
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,060
I know you are concerned for my sake.

836
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,079
But I believe

837
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,380
he truly cares for me
and will protect me.

838
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,340
I am willing to marry him.

839
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,660
Since you've made your decision,

840
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,980
I'll support you.

841
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,300
Your mother once said,

842
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:47,380
there's no right or wrong in choices.

843
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:49,639
As long as it comes from the heart

844
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,940
and with no regrets,

845
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,740
she would definitely support you.

846
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:57,060
She never regretted marrying
your father.

847
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,380
If Guqiu's spirit knows

848
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,220
you've found a worthy husband,

849
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,460
she would be even happier than I am.

850
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,079
(Wang Yingxue)
Did you deliver that letter?

851
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,940
I want to see
how she marries into that family.

852
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,860
She was replaced the last time.

853
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,920
This time,
they're breaking off the engagement.

854
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,080
