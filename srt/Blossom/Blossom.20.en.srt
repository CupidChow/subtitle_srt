1
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,320
Lord Song.

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,089
(Song Ancestral Hall)

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:12,059
Lord Song.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,569
The Duke requests your presence.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,160
The elders from both families are here.

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,470
I'm not going.

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,960
I don't see the need to be there.

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,840
Since everything is already arranged,

9
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,390
why put on airs and graces now?

10
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,710
Lord Song.

11
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,960
His Majesty has decreed.

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,800
If word of this gets out,

13
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,590
people would chastise both of you
for being ill-mannered

14
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,200
and disregarding your family duties.

15
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,219
Even the officials

16
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,609
may call you disrespectful and rude.

17
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,630
My reputation has never been pristine.

18
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:41,830
I don't care.

19
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,680
You should go.

20
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,660
It's good for you
to see what's going on.

21
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,099
Ms. Longevity.

22
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,270
Even in a war, civility comes first.

23
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,840
Besides, we'll be staying
here for a long time.

24
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,910
We can't avoid them forever.

25
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,630
You have never been one
to back down so easily.

26
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,160
What's wrong with you now?

27
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,390
Are you scared?

28
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,160
Why would I be scared of them?

29
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:06,040
But I promised you

30
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,990
that you wouldn't have
to deal with such trouble.

31
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,710
This is only our first day of marriage.

32
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,880
It's fine.

33
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,270
Come on.

34
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,519
=Blossom=
(Adapted from the novel "Blossom" by Zhi Zhi)

35
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,559
=Episode 20=

36
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,980
(Duke of Ying's Residence)

37
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,440
You offered tea to Huisun first?

38
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,510
You offered tea
to a dead person before us.

39
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,280
You have no regard for rules.

40
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,579
We didn't know that all of you

41
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,230
have been waiting for us here.

42
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,720
It's just that

43
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,110
the dead must always
be remembered and honored.

44
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,979
That's what His Majesty said

45
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,510
during one of his hunting trips.

46
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,209
What a glib tongue.

47
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,329
(Wife of the Eldest Uncle)

48
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,760
Even the tea has turned cold.

49
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,929
Is this how you act
right after you married into our family?

50
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,630
Yes, the tea has gone cold.

51
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,910
You should brew

52
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,899
(Wife of the Third Uncle)
a new pot of tea for us.

53
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,040
Come on.

54
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,720
Eldest Uncle, Third Uncle,
have you forgotten

55
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,070
what happened here?

56
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,049
Yizhi Hall detached itself
from this residence

57
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,160
soon after my mother passed away.

58
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,990
As the saying goes, "when
everyone has left, the tea turns cold."

59
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,350
That's why the tea is already cold.

60
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,049
Do not forget

61
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,450
that you are the future Duke of Ying!

62
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,480
You are right, Father-in-law.

63
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,460
Now that I am married to Lord Song,

64
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,630
that makes me the future duke's wife.

65
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,710
Father-in-law, drink some tea.

66
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,050
(General)
This is for you, Sister-in-law.

67
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,800
My brother used to play chess with me
whenever he returned.

68
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,000
We may not play regularly anymore,

69
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,200
but you're here to keep him company.

70
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:12,470
Thank you, Han.

71
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,390
It's not like I'd have
your brother all to myself.

72
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,339
Now that you have
a sister-in-law to dote on you,

73
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,760
you should visit us more often.

74
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,559
See?

75
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,570
Han is such a sensible child.

76
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,289
Actually, we have prepared gifts
for our new niece-in-law.

77
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,240
All that talking
made us forget about it.

78
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,430
Bring the gifts.

79
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,590
Thank you for the gifts.

80
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,879
I guess there's a lot I need

81
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,360
to learn from you as a newly wed.

82
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,040
Since I am now part of this family,

83
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,030
I shall humbly learn from you.

84
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,290
It's not that much.

85
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,329
Now that Yantang is married,

86
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,920
our family has decided to do our part

87
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,510
and renovate Yizhi Hall

88
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,270
as a token of our affection.

89
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,540
That's a wonderful idea.

90
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,280
Once Zhao deposits her dowry
into the residence's treasury,

91
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,240
you may proceed with the renovations.

92
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,000
This farcical ceremony

93
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,950
and your sweet promises

94
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,259
are just a ruse

95
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,150
to confiscate Zhao's dowry.

96
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,450
By tradition, the eldest daughter-in-law
is the mistress of the household.

97
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,420
Eldest Aunt, instead of handing over
the tokens and keys to the treasury,

98
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,610
you keep eyeing on my wife's money.

99
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,579
Yantang.

100
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,240
That's not true.

101
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,699
Even though we've separated
from the main residence

102
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,150
after your mother died,

103
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,049
your eldest aunt is still responsible

104
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,909
for managing the finances

105
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,720
and daily operations of the household.

106
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,379
Your wife has just
married into our family.

107
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:41,939
Someone has to guide and teach her.

108
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,989
That's not necessary.

109
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,060
My wife has already calculated

110
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,390
and declared all her assets
in front of His Majesty.

111
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,370
Even the Ministry of Revenue
has adopted her calculation formulas.

112
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,340
I wasn't so calculative in the past,

113
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,600
but since you are so particular
about money,

114
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,240
we should separate
the treasury accounts too.

115
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,150
What are you saying?

116
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:05,240
The Emperor has always advised us
to maintain harmony in the family.

117
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,000
It's improper for you to defy.

118
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,499
Besides, running the household

119
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,470
is no easy task.

120
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,329
There are dozens of issues that
need to be settled every day.

121
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,950
It's normal to stay up late.

122
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,760
- Third Aunt...
- Third Aunt,

123
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,070
those are exactly our biggest concerns.

124
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,059
Money is simply superficial.

125
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,070
Family harmony matters the most.

126
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,560
Since all of you care about me,

127
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:28,969
I shall let Eldest Aunt

128
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,920
manage my dowry.

129
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,259
Su Lan.

130
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,590
Call Mr. Chen here.

131
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,479
Yes.

132
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,660
I knew my daughter-in-law
would be sensible.

133
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,120
Your elder is willing
to go all out to help you.

134
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,040
You must be grateful.

135
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,000
You are right, Father-in-law.

136
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,200
This...

137
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,950
I thought you lost

138
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,950
all your money in Futing?

139
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:03,870
Yes.

140
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,760
However, that was not my only asset.

141
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,510
My other ventures
have been successful.

142
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,360
The Miaos' potato
business has taken off.

143
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,000
I funded 80% of their starting capital.

144
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,300
Young Lady.

145
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,059
I did a rough calculation.

146
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,560
There's about 70,000 taels here.

147
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,459
- Zhao has a keen eye for business.
- This...

148
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,630
This is the dividend
she earned this year.

149
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,630
You mean, 70,000 taels
is just the dividend?

150
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,939
Just two chests of these

151
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,760
is worth ten years' of food
expenses in the residence.

152
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,499
Don't act like an ignorant fool.

153
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,880
She might laugh at you.

154
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,529
I was planning to deposit my dowry

155
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,569
and the dividend here

156
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,160
into the residence's treasury

157
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,649
to share the elders' burden

158
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,470
by managing the residence's accounts.

159
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,990
By then, our wealth is expected
to grow by 20% every year.

160
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,320
Our real estate, trading,
and agricultural ventures

161
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,070
can generate at least
70,000 to 80,000 taels in profit.

162
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,920
Now that Eldest Aunt
will manage everything,

163
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,520
I'm sure you will earn more than I do.

164
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,619
70,000 to 80,000 taels a year?

165
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,990
How could I?

166
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,560
Yes, yes.

167
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,059
My dowry also includes

168
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,800
some farming lands and shops

169
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,069
that I have co-invested with other

170
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:09,919
aristocratic ladies.

171
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,720
If our profits were to fall,

172
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,110
I'm afraid they'd stop working with us.

173
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,550
After all, it's important

174
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,520
to maintain business credibility.

175
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,999
Once you lose it,

176
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,869
it's hard to maintain
business connections,

177
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,280
and you might even
offend other stakeholders.

178
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,539
Everyone in the capital knows

179
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,280
(Eldest Daughter-In-Law)
that you're a skilled businesswoman.

180
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,580
My mother-in-law spends all her time
managing the household.

181
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,899
It's not even worth mentioning

182
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,520
compared to your business ventures.

183
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,169
I guess it's better

184
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,899
that we keep our accounts separate

185
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,289
so that we don't end up arguing

186
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,350
over money matters.

187
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,950
As a man,

188
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,950
it is pathetic to eye
on his wife's dowry.

189
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,310
Miss Miao,

190
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,950
take the money back

191
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,280
so that we don't
attract unwanted gossip.

192
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,049
Sure, I'll continue managing
Zhao's business on her behalf.

193
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,190
Take them back.

194
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,320
- No...
- This is...

195
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,480
Zhao.

196
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,139
Mind telling me

197
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,689
how you earned so much money?

198
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,099
I didn't expect

199
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,990
that we have such
a capable niece-in-law.

200
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,619
Yichun, why don't we let her

201
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,929
manage the residence's

202
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,809
private assets as well?

203
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,409
She's family, after all.

204
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,449
We can trust her, right?

205
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,320
Yes, that's a great idea.

206
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,760
If that's what you wish,

207
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,230
I wouldn't say no,

208
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:27,440
but if my father-in-law doesn't agree,

209
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,950
I wouldn't defy him.

210
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,139
Yichun.

211
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,259
You...

212
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,400
Yichun.

213
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,560
I'm keeping my hands off this.

214
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,160
Wait.

215
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,750
- Yichun.
- Yichun.

216
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,320
- Yichun.
- Yichun, you can't just leave.

217
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,449
Zhao.

218
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,499
Can you also

219
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,379
reserve a spot for us

220
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,200
- in your business ventures too?
- Yes, Zhao.

221
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,720
We have some savings.

222
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,480
- We can pass them to you...
- I thought she

223
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,470
was good at observing palace politics,

224
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,470
but I didn't know she's also good

225
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,160
at managing household affairs.

226
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,200
I know you want to protect her,

227
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,990
but the deaths of
the Duke of Ding and Mrs Jiang

228
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,950
are connected.

229
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,320
In this large residence,

230
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,320
we can only start investigating
through money allocations

231
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,640
and what the servants say and do.

232
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,520
Young Lady is trying to gain power here

233
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,320
so that she could help you

234
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,379
win the favor of the household.

235
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,629
By then, we will get to access
the matching tokens.

236
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,820
That's right.

237
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,379
(Meritorious Service)
Yichun.

238
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,739
You can't just stay out of this.

239
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,769
We're talking about
70,000 to 80,000 taels.

240
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:37,160
As they say, money is king.

241
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,459
Exactly.

242
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,510
We don't have to be scared

243
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,529
since the matching tokens
are still in our hands.

244
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,750
That's right.

245
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,040
Have I not treated you well?

246
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,290
She's only been here for a day,

247
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,289
and yet she's already got you
all under her thumb?

248
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,430
No...

249
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,520
You're a disgrace to our ancestors!

250
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,950
What a stubborn man.

251
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,430
Come on.

252
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,160
Yichun.

253
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,950
This is about money.

254
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,339
Stop wasting your
breath on him, Brother.

255
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,520
Come out!

256
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,120
Your Grace.

257
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,870
Don't worry.

258
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,590
Everyone in the residence
is loyal to you.

259
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,859
She's just a newcomer.

260
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,529
The servants wouldn't listen to her.

261
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,870
She'd soon realize
how difficult it is to survive here.

262
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,640
I underestimated Dou Zhao.

263
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:33,019
To think a young lass like her

264
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,520
could be so sly.

265
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,409
Perhaps I made a mistake

266
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,670
and infuriated that defiant son of mine?

267
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,339
Everyone in the capital knows

268
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,440
that my father and I
have separated our households.

269
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,929
As for my uncles, aunts

270
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,289
and their daughter-in-law,

271
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,139
you don't have to
worry about their assets.

272
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,110
Better yet, you don't have
to interact with them,

273
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,040
or else you might fall sick from anger.

274
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,689
I approached them

275
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,470
not to let them infuriate me.

276
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,970
Your father doesn't want me
to manage the residence's treasury

277
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,520
and tries to convince
his brothers to stop me.

278
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,400
However, they've never been of one mind.

279
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,569
Your uncles are money-hungry.

280
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,390
Your eldest aunt
isn't as strong as she looks.

281
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,440
Your third aunt is an easy read.

282
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,219
They may seem to follow
your father's arrangements,

283
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,200
but they all have their own minds.

284
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,750
Only your eldest uncle's
daughter-in-law is clever enough

285
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,029
to know that if she gets caught between you
and your father,

286
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,440
the deal would be off.

287
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,920
She may be our breakthrough point.

288
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,830
What's wrong?

289
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:36,280
You know them well
though you've only met them once.

290
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:40,040
How could my wife be so clever?

291
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,200
Back when I saved Wu Shan in the manor,

292
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,830
you also immediately recognized
the hidden dynamics in my family.

293
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,139
In fact, you're better at identifying

294
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,070
the subtle expressions
on people's faces.

295
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,689
If the Duke of Ying's Residence

296
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,139
tries to do anything funny,

297
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,289
get Mr. Chen to find me
at the Imperial Guards.

298
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,430
Don't carry the burden alone.

299
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,990
You just called me
a strategist last night,

300
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,440
and now you don't trust me?

301
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,830
It's not that.

302
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,360
I'm just worried.

303
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,019
By the way,

304
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,320
let me give you something as protection.

305
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,320
This is my first time.

306
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,070
It's fine.

307
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,680
Stay calm.

308
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,120
Look at your target.

309
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,710
Aim.

310
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,350
This is even louder than the fireworks.

311
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,800
- Careful, it's hot.
- You didn't even blink.

312
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,950
It's normal to be scared
on your first try.

313
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,400
The more scared you are,
the calmer you need to be.

314
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,760
Stay calm.

315
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,760
Relax.

316
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,280
I'm beside you.

317
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,120
I missed.

318
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,040
You're already doing a good job.

319
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,640
If you can hit the wind chimes today,

320
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,230
you'd pass your first entrance test.

321
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,520
Try it.

322
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,990
I'm going to freshen up.

323
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,790
I hit it!

324
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,070
I hit it!

325
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,700
My dear.

326
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,520
You have talent.

327
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,280
What happened to your hand?

328
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,950
Show me.

329
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,310
Why is it bleeding again?

330
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,409
It's fine.

331
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,550
It's nothing.

332
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:11,550
Yantang.

333
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,520
I said I can bathe by myself.

334
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,520
Your hand is still injured.

335
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,660
Before it heals, you need
to keep it away from water.

336
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,449
Allow me.

337
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,590
It's fine.

338
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,590
I can manage myself.

339
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,320
Allow me.

340
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,180
If I can't take care of you
when you're injured,

341
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,990
how could I call myself your wife?

342
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,680
I didn't expect that
the mighty General Song

343
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,440
can feel shy sometimes.

that your back is covered in scars.

356
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,990

Ms. Longevity, I'm sorry.

You got these scars from defending

363
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,470
our nation and people.

364
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,310
In fact, you injured your shoulder
to protect me.

365
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,230
There's nothing to apologize for.

366
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,480
Yantang.

367
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,600
When two people live together,

368
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,350
the most important thing

369
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,099
is to make each other feel
more comfortable

370
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,270
and free.

371
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,200
In the future,

372
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,600
no matter what happens,

373
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,990
we need to be honest with each other

374
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,470
and face everything together,

375
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,000
won't we?

376
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,710
Sure, I promise you.

377
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,660
(Reinvigorating Spring)

378
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,720
Your Lordship.

379
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,550
You're here, Ming.

380
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,310
You're hiding something from me?

381
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,920
I'll see it anyway.

382
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,110
Let me look.

383
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,159
Ming.

384
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,270
You'll get to see it
when I finish drawing.

385
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,790
No, I want to see it now.

386
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,110
Ming.

387
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,510
This is a secret.

388
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,790
Fine.

389
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,990
Have some fruits, Your Lordship.

390
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,040
Let me see!

391
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,819
Why are you keeping it from me?

392
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,400
- I'm not showing you.
- Let me see!

393
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,470
Your Lordship, come on.

394
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,510
Ming, I'll show you when it's done.

395
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,880
Ming, you look so pretty today.

396
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,360
Your Lordship, Your Ladyship.

397
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,839
The Eight Treasure soup
for Madam Wei is ready.

398
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,110
Time to greet her.

399
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,549
Greet her?

400
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,990
All we do is greeting those people.

401
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,440
How annoying.

402
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,449
Fine, you may leave now.

403
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,590
Yes, Your Lordship.

404
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,750
I'm going, then.

405
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,510
Thank you, Ming.

406
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,280
Go.

407
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,000
How dare you talk back?

408
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,550
What happened?

409
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,120
Did Nanny Zhou do anything wrong?

410
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,929
She was trying to order you around,

411
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,489
and all I did was to rebuke her.

412
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,230
You're serving the young duke's wife,

413
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,249
and I'm serving the senior duke's wife.

414
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,910
Rebuking me is an act of disrespect
towards your mistress's sister-in-law.

415
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,169
Make sure you remember that

416
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,550
on behalf of your mistress.

417
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,920
Your Ladyship.

418
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,160
- Nanny.
- Your Ladyship.

419
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,200
Ming.

420
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,550
Serve the soup now.

421
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,310
Hurry up.

422
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,310
Your Ladyship.

423
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:48,030
You have to kneel and lift the bowl
over your head to show your respect.

424
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:54,790
I prepared the rehmannia root

425
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,160
in the soup all by myself.

426
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,080
I heard this soup is beneficial

427
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,270
for your constitution.

428
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,139
Since this is the Duke's residence,

429
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,270
we're very particular
about rules and decorum.

430
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:09,470
From helping your mother-in-law
get dressed in the morning,

431
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,710
to preparing your
mother-in-law's bed at night,

432
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,160
these are your duties
as a daughter-in-law.

433
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:20,310
Make sure you learn
and follow all these rules

434
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,550
in the days to come.

435
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:27,440
Your sister is already contributing
her wealth and power

436
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:30,729
towards the Duke of Ying's Residence.

437
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:31,870
And you?

438
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,099
Do you even know

439
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,969
how much money we have,

440
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,510
and how long it'll last?

441
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,030
The current deficit

442
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:44,880
is caused by the grand funeral
held years ago

443
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,079
when the previous duke and duchess died.

444
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,939
You must have heard
how much Dou Zhao's dowry

445
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,750
and personal assets are.

446
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,800
We took you in,

447
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,560
yet you're not showing any gratitude.

448
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,490
All you're doing now is keeping
my silly brother happy.

449
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:05,160
Have you thought about

450
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,640
the residence's future?

451
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,020
What happened to the benefits
your mother promised us?

452
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,940
What are you doing?

453
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,980
Ming, come on.

454
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,180
Get up.

455
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,500
Are you fine?

456
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,020
What happened to your hands?

457
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,100
As your sister, it's normal for me

458
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,620
to teach your wife about decorum.

459
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,020
This has nothing to do with you.

460
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,020
This is my residence,

461
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,500
not yours.

462
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,580
Of course this is my business.

463
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,460
If it's about money,

464
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,580
I can sell my paintings
and calligraphy works.

465
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,089
I know you're jealous
of Dou Zhao's dowry,

466
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:45,959
but you can't vent out

467
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,439
on Ming.

468
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,620
What did you say?

469
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,689
I've paid so much for you
over the years,

470
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,200
and you've been taking it for granted.

471
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,839
Now, all I'm asking
is that she contribute some money

472
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,340
to help the residence,

473
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,380
and you're chastising me?

474
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,599
The heavens must be blind.

475
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,839
They should have sent

476
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,999
a bolt of lightning to strike you!

477
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,460
Sister-in-law.

478
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,870
I was wrong.

479
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,550
I shouldn't have started this argument
between you and my husband.

480
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,660
As for your request,

481
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,340
I will ask my mother when I return home.

482
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,959
Slow and steady does it.

483
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,260
Be careful.

484
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,060
Put them here.

485
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,500
So many gifts.

486
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,700
This must be a first in the Capital.

487
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,980
I hope you'll enjoy
the gifts I prepared.

488
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,380
Let's talk inside.

489
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,540
This way.

490
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,860
You're trying to embarrass my daughter.

491
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,220
Still, if you weren't
as rich as you are now,

492
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,260
I'm sure Song Mo
wouldn't treat you so well.

493
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,140
My daughter Ming and the Duke of Jining
are happily in love.

494
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,540
They don't need
these material possessions.

495
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,420
You are

496
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,260
just a pitiful girl.

497
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,159
Hearing these words from your mouth

498
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,620
is actually surprising.

499
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,900
Money is hard-earned,

500
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,020
but love fades easily.

501
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,839
This is what

502
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,660
I learned from you years ago.

503
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,999
Seventh Madam.

504
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,060
The Duchess of Jining is back.

505
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,500
Your looks haven't changed
over the years, Mother.

506
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,359
We don't look like
mother and daughter now.

507
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,860
Instead, we look like sisters.

508
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,100
Exactly.

509
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,199
I feel so relieved

510
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,879
now that you're no longer here,

511
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,340
so I look younger naturally.

512
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,460
On the contrary,

513
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,180
it's only been a while
since you got married,

514
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,799
and you've lost so much weight.

515
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,580
Has Wei Tingzhen been abusing you?

516
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,259
Is this how the Duchess of Jing

517
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,860
behaves as a sister-in-law?

518
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,740
Someday,

519
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,660
I'll settle these scores with her.

520
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,839
Mother.

521
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,639
The Duke is protective of me.

522
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,220
He treats me very well.

523
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,060
As if.

524
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,220
What gifts did he bring

525
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,759
the last time he came?

526
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,220
Just look at your sister today.

527
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,140
The Duke and I don't care about that.

528
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,860
But your residence needs to maintain
a certain standard of living.

529
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,799
Even if he doesn't care,

530
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,460
his sister won't just sit by and watch.

531
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,900
Mother.

532
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,780
You don't have to worry about me.

533
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,319
She's nice to me, too.

534
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,460
That's enough.

535
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,900
Don't try to fool me.

536
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,559
You think I don't know

537
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,180
what kind of person Wei Tingzhen is?

538
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,639
If she knows

539
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,780
how much Dou Zhao's dowry is worth,

540
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,629
she'd make your life hellish

541
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:03,860
in the Duke's residence.

542
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,140
You insisted on marrying him,

543
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,460
and now you can't even tell me
how much you're suffering there.

544
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,980
You useless girl.

545
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,500
I know everyone is comparing

546
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,540
my sister's dowry and mine,

547
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,180
but why are you also
doing this to me, Mother?

548
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,919
What else can I say?

549
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,790
Ever since I was born,

550
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,940
everything I do is a mistake
in your eyes.

551
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,820
If that's the case,

552
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,540
I shall not linger around and annoy you.

553
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,380
Your Ladyship...

554
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,919
Look at her.

555
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,479
She's unhappy about her in-laws,

556
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,999
and she's bickering with me?

557
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,959
Look at her behavior.

558
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,300
She's just like her father.

559
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,679
Madam.

560
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,759
You don't know

561
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,199
how much Ming is suffering

562
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,700
over there.

563
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,060
Ming.

564
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,140
What happened?

565
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,220
Why are you crying?

566
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,889
Ming must be missing home

567
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,220
since she just got married.

568
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,140
Why don't we let them chat

569
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,260
while we enjoy a drink?

570
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,670
After getting married, I realized

571
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,220
that your advice was true.

572
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,060
The Duke's residence

573
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,380
is not as wonderful as outsiders think.

574
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,140
They insist on putting up appearances
even when they're broke inside.

575
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,180
I don't have the capabilities

576
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,140
to cover their deficits

577
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,060
or maintain their facade.

578
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,260
Let's not talk about the past.

579
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,340
You should focus on the future.

580
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,399
The higher a family's status,

581
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,940
the bigger their deficits.

582
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,460
Don't blame yourself.

583
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,239
My dowry is nothing

584
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,060
compared to the debts

585
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,900
they have accrued.

586
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,479
How can I, a domestic lady,

587
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,180
get the money to pay their debts?

588
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,359
While domestic life can seem trivial,

589
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,380
there are many things
to pay attention to.

590
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:35,380
For example, the rice
from Liaodong may be softer,

591
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,700
but it costs 900 wen per dan.

592
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,740
Meanwhile, rice from Jiangnan is firmer,
and it only costs 700 wen.

593
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,890
So, when you're cooking rice or congee,
for every two parts of Liaodong rice,

594
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,190
mix in one part of Jiangnan rice,

595
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,780
and it'll taste just as good.

596
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,239
You can save

597
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,300
up to 500 to 600 taels a year.

598
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,359
You can deposit half of it in the bank

599
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,940
and invest the rest in the tea trade

600
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,540
to earn thousands of taels a year.

601
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,020
That's an amazing idea.

602
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,600
Sister, you must be the goddess
of wealth in your past life.

603
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,039
Besides,

604
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,220
you need to manage
your residence's assets.

605
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,359
If you have any taverns or shops
that haven't been making profits,

606
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,640
you should sell them off

607
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:12,370
and reinvest the money in booming trades
like fragrances and apparel.

608
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,060
No need.

609
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,060
Ming.

610
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,380
My father and I will support Ming,

611
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,060
so she doesn't have to
learn your miserly ways.

612
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,300
I will make sure

613
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,460
that Ming doesn't live in poverty.

614
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,569
I'll get my father

615
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:41,079
to assign a position for her husband.

616
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,820
Once the Duke's career takes off,

617
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,079
they won't have to worry over

618
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,340
such material concerns.

619
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,800
Come on.

620
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,820
Mother.

621
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,260
Did you really mean that?

622
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,740
But, Grandfather has always been fair,

623
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,180
and he despises nepotism.

624
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,799
Why would he...

625
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,940
You know,

626
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,540
when you have children,

627
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,620
you can't live for yourself.

628
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,380
Back when my father was demoted,

629
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,700
I had to cast my pride aside
and sell porridge to earn a living.

630
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,340
Now, I'll do this again

631
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,100
for your sake.

632
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,380
I'll beg my father to make an exception.

633
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,599
(One hundred taels)

634
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,940
Take these.

635
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,999
Mother.

636
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,540
I can't take these.

637
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,380
I know that you're

638
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,279
facing a difficult time too.

639
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,220
How did you get so much money?

640
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,820
I may be useless,

641
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,060
but I cannot be a bad daughter.

642
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,799
Illegal moneylending is a major crime.

643
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,380
The palace takes it seriously.

644
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,980
Mother.

645
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,759
Let's think of other solutions,

646
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,900
shall we?

647
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,260
As a woman in the house,

648
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,300
other than being a noble lady,

649
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,060
what advantage do we have?

650
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,700
We can't possibly be like Dou Zhao

651
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,180
to affiliate ourselves
with random hooligans

652
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,860
and their lowly trades.

653
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,420
Ming.

654
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,420
Remember this.

655
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,300
You are a duchess.

656
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,780
Never get involved
in such despicable business.

657
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,100
Keep the money.

658
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,599
Don't be a pushover
in the Duke's residence.

659
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,740
I'll always support you, understood?

660
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,759
Once the Duke has a stable career,

661
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,620
your sister-in-law won't
order you around anymore.

662
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,540
Really?

663
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,260
By then, my worries

664
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,740
will come to an end.

665
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,980
Mother.

666
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,860
Silly girl.

667
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,060
Mind the step.

668
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,220
Go.

669
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,900
Even though you scold her often, Madam,

670
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,060
you love her deeply.

671
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,300
I need to secure a position for the Duke

672
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,580
and arrange everything for her.

673
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,380
Pawn off a few more items

674
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,780
from my personal treasury.

675
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,900
Yes, Madam.

676
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,060
(Yizhi Hall)

677
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,820
(Ledger)
The purchases seem exaggerated.

678
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,799
Check every entry and tell me how much
money has been embezzled.

679
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,530
Madam.

680
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,470
We don't have the matching tokens,
so we can't order the servants around.

681
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,119
They've been rejecting

682
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,600
all our requests.

683
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,839
At this rate,

684
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,120
they're forcing us to pay
from our own pockets.

685
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,830
And that's only one
of our many problems.

686
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,619
What's more,

687
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,259
someone has been spying and listening in

688
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,260
everything you're doing here.

689
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,310
They'd sneak to the Duke's
main residence at night.

690
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,359
I recorded every single one of them.

691
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,489
These servants

692
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,570
are loyal to the Duke of Ying.

693
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,620
In fact, we seem to be

694
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,700
unwelcome in the residence.

695
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,380
What do you think, Lord Song?

696
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,020
Should I replace all our servants
with a new batch?

697
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:37,780
We cannot control the Duke's servants,

698
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:40,900
but we can control ours, can't we?

699
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,140
It's not that simple.

700
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,820
All the servants in the Duke's residence

701
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,580
must have had ties to the previous dukes

702
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,460
since generations ago.

703
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,340
Some of them even watched me grow up.

704
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,580
It's not just hard to replace them.

705
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,180
It'll makes me feel bad.

706
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,439
But, we can't let those
servants get their way

707
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,999
and torture our mistress.

708
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,119
Su Lan.

709
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,900
I am married to Lord Song.

710
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,020
Don't see him as an outsider.

711
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,820
I was wrong.

712
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,060
I am sorry, Your Lordship.

713
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,260
Even if we replace our servants now,

714
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,820
it'll take time to gain their loyalty,

715
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,820
and we might attract spies instead.

716
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,300
The Crown Prince and Lord Qing
are trying to win your favor.

717
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,949
If they plant their spies here,

718
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,860
our situation would turn worse.

719
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,540
Your Ladyship, Your Lordship.

720
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,279
We don't have to replace

721
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,140
everyone from the main residence.

722
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,999
They're loyal to the Duke's residence,

723
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,540
not Song Yichun himself.

724
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,380
Your Lordship,
you used to be quite violent,

725
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,759
so they saw you as the enemy

726
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,199
of the Duke's residence.

727
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,740
That's why they're on
Song Yichun's side.

728
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,159
You're right.

729
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,999
If His Lordship

730
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,439
can take control
of the entire residence,

731
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,159
and Her Ladyship obtains
the treasury's matching tokens,

732
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,780
the servants will be on our side.

733
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,140
Now, the key issue

734
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,780
is that Lord Song was beaten up,

735
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,340
and there are signs of foul play
in his mother's death.

736
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,339
Even though we've already replaced

737
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,599
many of our servants,

738
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,020
perhaps some of them

739
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,439
may know the truth behind all these.

740
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,140
That's why we need to keep them here.

741
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,020
Did I say anything wrong, Your Lordship?

742
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,700
You just told Su Lan

743
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,500
not to see me as an outsider,

744
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,180
but what did you just call me?

745
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:26,860
Yantang.

746
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,860
Say that again.

747
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,300
Yantang.

748
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,999
They're all here.

749
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:36,919
What are you doing?

750
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,300
- Not anymore.
- Not anymore.

751
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,460
Why are you staring at me like this?

752
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,740
I've always said that
I have a bad reputation.

753
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,300
Now that I think of it,

754
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,540
you used to have an ugly reputation too.

755
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,500
I didn't want to get married back then,

756
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,260
so I didn't care what they
have to say about me.

757
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,460
But, now that we're a married couple,

758
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,959
if you want to advance further,

759
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,999
we can't let Wang Yingxue
and Song Yichun

760
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,420
spread malicious gossip
and damage your reputation.

761
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,260
I need to put an end to this.

762
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,439
I wanted to give you a carefree life,

763
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,199
but now, I'm involving you

764
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,660
in our family affairs.

765
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,220
It's my fault.

766
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,500
My family is no better than yours.

767
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,060
It's no one's fault.

768
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,959
Besides, you said I'm your strategist,

769
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,460
so I have to share your burden.

770
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,580
Strategist, is it?

771
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,700
What's wrong with that?

772
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,500
In fact, you...

773
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,479
What are you doing?

774
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,340
We're discussing serious issues here.

775
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,959
Everything you've been
discussing in this room

776
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,260
isn't serious at all.

777
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,660
Then, what sounds serious to you?

778
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,279
Call me Hubby.

779
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,500
Song Mo.

00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,279
I was wondering why
His Lordship looked miffed,

786
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,530
and it's because Young Lady
hasn't called him Hubby yet.

787
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,620
I never thought

788
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,540
we would work together
in the same residence.

789
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,839
Just months ago,

790
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,359
we were still enemies.

791
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,780
The future is hard to predict.

792
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,420
I was wondering

793
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,730
what would happen now

794
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,479
if that arrow didn't
miss your vital organs

795
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,620
during the siege.

796
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,039
My friend.

797
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,420
Look, the scar is still here.

798
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,500
Mr. Chen.

799
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:45,940
We have the best Ganlubai wine here.

800
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:48,060
Let me offer some to you
to show my apology.

801
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,389
- Sure.
- This way.

802
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:50,530
This way.

803
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,460
Your Grace, bad news!

804
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,820
Why are you yelling?

805
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,540
Mind your manners.

806
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,900
I think something's wrong.

807
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,980
Everyone in Yizhi Hall
is moving things around.

808
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,599
All those camphor wood chests
are filled with money

809
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,060
to the brim.

810
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,860
There were six or seven people
calculating everything,

811
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,100
so busy until they have
no time to drink water.

812
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,879
Even when we did our year-end
accounts every year,

813
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,780
we'd finish in a day or two.

814
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,780
How much dowry did she bring exactly?

815
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,420
I know the Dous are famous merchants,

816
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,159
but they're not that rich, are they?

817
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,460
Exactly.

818
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,860
Keep an eye on them.

819
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,140
Investigate what's going on.

820
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,460
Yes, Your Grace.

821
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,039
(Duke of Jining's Residence)

822
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,999
If it looks like it's going to rain,

823
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,780
keep the Duke's paintings

824
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,999
so that they don't get wet.

825
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,140
Yes, Your Ladyship.

826
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,500
Well?

827
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,980
Do you like it?

828
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,900
Yes, I do.

829
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,620
I'm glad to see

830
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,060
that you like it.

831
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,820
You were drawing this that day,
weren't you?

832
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,559
That's right.

833
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,820
I wanted to give you a surprise.

834
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,420
It's beautiful.

835
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,260
Your Ladyship.

836
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,279
Your Ladyship.

837
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,390
Madam wants to see you now.

838
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,020
Understood.

839
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:22,290
Can you come with me?

840
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,300
Ming,

841
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,839
I haven't finished painting today.

842
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,039
- Once I'm done...
- But...

843
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,180
Ming.

844
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,580
Ming, don't worry.

845
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,660
My sister is already married off,

846
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,460
while you're married into this family.

847
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,820
You need to show your prowess

848
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,540
as the mistress of the residence.

849
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,060
Don't let them push you around.

850
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,270
Sister-in-law.

851
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,639
Look at this!

852
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,820
How are you the mistress
of the household?

853
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,039
The residence is heavily in debt now!

854
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,439
What have you been doing?

855
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,999
How unfortunate for us.

856
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,719
If my brother
married your sister instead,

857
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,980
our residence wouldn't be in this state!

858
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,340
Are you mute?

859
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,060
You're right, Sister-in-law.

860
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,740
My mother just gave me
some money last month.

861
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,620
It's only been a while,

862
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,860
and I'm thinking if we could

863
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,079
reduce our spending instead.

864
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,439
Reduce our spending?

865
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,079
This is the Duke's residence!

866
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,159
That's all you can do to keep us afloat?

867
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,519
As the mistress of the residence,

868
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,620
aren't you afraid that people
might laugh at you?

869
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,479
If the residence keeps spending
without any source of income,

870
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,039
we'd eventually go broke
no matter how rich we are.

871
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,839
That's why my mother
begged my grandfather

872
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,159
to appoint the Duke as
the Deputy Commander

873
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,180
of the North Warden's Office.

874
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,980
(Letter of Appointment)

875
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,940
This is his letter of appointment.

876
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,079
I wanted to share this piece of news

877
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,460
together with the Duke and you.

878
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,980
That's more like it.

879
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,159
You're the one

880
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,359
who made Ming lose her child.

881
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,300
If you can't give me
an explanation today,

882
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,489
we'll take this case to court.

883
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:35,299
Sister, you warned me

884
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,759
that the Duke wouldn't
make a good husband.

885
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,979
Do you regret it?

886
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,179
I'm a beast!
