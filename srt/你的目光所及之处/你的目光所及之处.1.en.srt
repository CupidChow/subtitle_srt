You, go that way.

8
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,390
You're damn fast, aren't you?

9
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,000
All right.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,750
With Min Gyeong, I thought, "Well, it can happen."

11
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:09,170
But the three of them, that's overdoing it!

12
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,610
Why are you guys so tall, dammit.

13
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,350
Min Gyeong?

14
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,830
She was pretty, that's true. Though she was a bit short.

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,600
Do you want to die?

16
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,560
And Hyeon Jeong, then?

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,240
I was hardcore in love with her!

18
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,630
- She is the one who came to me first— 
 - I'm on the verge of being traumatized, right now.

19
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,130
Even though I don't like the Christian religion, the faithful Kki Ppeum...

20
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,390
I was sure Kki Ppeum would never be like that.

21
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,410
- Kki Ppeum was indeed the most charming of them all. 
 - Hey!

22
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,580
Why is this guy so conceited?

23
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,800
Even in terms of looks, I'm more... Don't you think?

You're laughing?

 - Go easy on him.

30

I was wondering why you didn't appear.

31
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,580
You're this buffoon's servant, aren't you?

32

That's right, I am.

33
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,980
Wait, but this darned servant—

34
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,280
Are you okay?

35
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,900
What should you do?

36
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,400
My dad is the chairman of TB Group.

37
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,770
 We are long-time friends, 

38
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,330

42
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,990
I apologize.

43
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,930
It wasn't playing house!

44
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,700
It really hurt.

45
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,050
So you haven't fixed your habit yet, I see.

46
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,850
I'm telling you that I got hit in order to avoid making an issue, this time.

I'll send you to England, so keep that in mind.

52

Who would have thought that taking the blow would be worse?

58
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,430
In the future, don't take it and just hit them.

59

That'd be better, right?

60

By the way, how can you tell them you're the chairman's son?

61
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,680
Dammit, that jerk was the one who was acting up.

62
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,500
He was saying his dad was a board director.

63

Try to act up again.

It's tasty.

95
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,850
And it's nice because there's no one from school.

96

What?

98
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,720
I should approve of it, right?

99
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,780
- Approval? 
 - Approval.

103

You are the attacker? And you are the defense? 
 (T/N: jargon, similar to "top" and "bottom")

104
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,570
- Pardon? 
 - Sorry?

105
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,110
Nothing.

106
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,680
Attack? Defense?

107
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,120
Ah! You really startled me!

108
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,680
Sorry.

109
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,890
It's because of the fine dust.

110
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,030
This is that boy.

111
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,210
My first customer.

112
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,990
It had lifted my mood because he was so good-looking.

113
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,080
It's you?

114
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,090
So, do you approve of my taste?

115
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,840
A little bit.

116
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,070
What's with you?

117
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,760
Why are you following us?

118
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,000
My mom kept telling me about you.

119
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,380
But you are better than I thought.

120
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,270
Hey. Usually, people look at me rather than him.

121
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,790
Sure.

122
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,930
Your number, please.

123
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:44,120
Woah! So, not my number,

124
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,150
but Kang Gook's number?

125
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,600

126
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:03,170

127

Hey. What was that?

128
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,440
What?

129
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,880
You went around flirting while I was in Japan.

130
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,350
I also saw her for the first time today.

131
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,030
You're pretending to be all serious and cool,

132
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,520
all by yourself, I see.

133
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,590
What are you saying?

134
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,610
Are you happy that you gave her your number?

135
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,590
I didn't give it to her.

136
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,190
What, then?

137
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,180
A fake number.

I'm sorry.

I don't know why either,

152
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,100
but my dad told me to apologize to you. It's seriously hurting my pride.

153
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,410
I'll accept it.

154
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,930

No.

Even if he was, it's none of your concern.

00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,590
Sure.

159
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,920
I apologized, so we're set.
