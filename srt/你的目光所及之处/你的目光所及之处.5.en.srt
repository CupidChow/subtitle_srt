00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,620
Hey! Just because I told you to walk, did you really have to walk?

8
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,280
You should've taken a bus or a taxi.

9
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,260
You're acting as you please again.

10
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,420
Get in quickly.

[Episode 5 - Yet Another Kind of Gaze]

12
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,350
Why did I do that to you?

13
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,700
Because you're mean.

14
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,360
This is different.

15
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,580
It was another kind of anger.

16
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,580
Have you felt like that towards me, too?

17
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,580
I don't know what you are talking about.

18
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,780
Hug me.

19
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,250
Like my mom.

20
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,740
Taejoo...

21
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,090
I asked you a favor.

22
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,120
I'm sad.

23
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,120
I don't get why we have to do physical education.

24
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,460
Isn't it better than studying?

25
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,800
I think studying is better.

26
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,330
Suit yourself.

27
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,630
What's up with you?

28
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,250
It's dodgeball today; your class against mine.

29
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,760
So what? Don't you have any friends?

30
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,110
Why are you coming over here to cause a ruckus?

31
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,800
I really don't have any friends.

32
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,530
I couldn't make any.

33
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,230
You really have a bad personality.

34
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,680
What?

35
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:10,620
Okay, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

36
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,850
There are two people left.

37
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,550
Our class, fighting!

38
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,740
What are you doing, leaving your own classmates aside?

39
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,700
Because I have no friends. I'm sorry.

40
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,760
- It's annoying. 
 - Stop it already.

41
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,600
I am strong. Let's win for sure!

42
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,820
- Of course. 
 - What do you mean, "Of course?"

43
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,060
- What do you think this is? 
 - Then you can leave.

44
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,220
You can guard me well so that the ball doesn't hit me.

45
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,860
It's my specialty, after all. Since I'm a real bodyguard.

46
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,030
He says he's a real bodyguard. How funny!

47
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,470
- You can't get influenced by him, got it? 
 - Okay.

48
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,070
Why? Don't you find this funny? This is really funny.

Aren't you my bodyguard?

That time you lied about your wrist cast.

Think of this as punishment for it.

60

Without even a thought, you went over there.

 - "Do it?"

Do what?

72
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,580
Say it.

Aren't you saying let's do a bout?

Instead of here, let's do it at night at the training hall.
