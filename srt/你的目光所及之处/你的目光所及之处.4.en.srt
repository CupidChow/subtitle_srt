I  have a long-time friend.

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,690
A shadow-like being who doesn't go away even for a moment.

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,710
Stop it! Don't cause trouble again.

9
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,440
Stop provoking me!

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,730
Please, I'm asking you.

11
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,300
That shadow grew a conscience.

12
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,830

Will you really be okay?

16
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:45,550
Don't overreact. I won't get stabbed.

Is it okay for you to take it off like that?

21
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,320
It was fake from the beginning.

Yes.

36

No.

Or does Taejoo like you?

53
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,900
It's not like that. I'm like a bodyguard.

I'm living at Taejoo's house and earning living expenses and other things.

64
