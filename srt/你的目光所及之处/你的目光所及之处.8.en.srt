5
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,740
Let him come in.

6
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,650
Despite this, you were good as a bodyguard, Gook.

7
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:03,380
I'm sorry—

8
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,710
Try explaining why you had to walk in here

9
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,970
with your own feet.

10
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,880
I know I cannot win.

11
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:20,560
Since I don't have anything, but you have everything, Chairman.

12
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,630
So...

13
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:32,710
You must've known all of this, but you threw away the rest of your life over a mistake you made in one moment.

14
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,370
I came to just talk for five minutes.

15
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:46,810
After all, we were together for 15 years. I thought we should talk just for five minutes.

16
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,100
I told you that I'll hit Gook if you did something wrong.

17
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,850
I'll go.

18
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,430
I'll go to England.

19
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,710
After going?

20
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,770
After going...

21
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,670
Without anyone...

22
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,520
I will study alone and also go to university.

23
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,710
I'll do well.

24
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,750
How can I believe that?

25
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,750
Isn't it enough if I go tomorrow?

26
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,380
I can really do well.

27
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,880
Believe me just this once.

28
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,930
I'll really show you.

29
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,020
Get Han Taejoo's plane ticket for tomorrow.

30
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,550
Go ahead with what was planned.

31
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,380
In return,

32
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,390
just for a moment...

33
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,510
Just for today... I'll go home and come back.

34
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,210
I made it so that you're free. Why would you come?

35
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,290
Are you asking because you don't know?

36
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,880
I don't want to go to England.

37
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,420
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,170
Kim Pilhyeon, that crazy bastard. I want to kill him.

39
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,700
What did we do that it's already dawn?

40
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:43,000
I don't know since when, but I've wanted to keep hugging you.

41
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,860
I like you.

42
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,620
What kind of confession are you doing to someone who's flying in a few hours?

43
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,720
To England... have a safe trip, Taejoo.

44
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,900
If you're going to be like this, you should've just accepted when I tried to kiss you that time?

45
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,180
We didn't even get to do that.

46
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,140
Am I a pervert

47
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,300
to kiss someone whose lips are bleeding?

48
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,450
I'll be able to see you again, right?

49
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,030
Look for another delicious rice cake place.

50
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,280
I'll come back.

51
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,230
You shouldn't.

52
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,830
You and I have different paths to walk. Just enjoy your time over there—

53
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:10,010
My dream is to live happily,

54
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:18,710
but I'm the happiest when I'm together with you.

55
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,910
So, I'll come back.

56
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,440
I'm not allowed to take my eyes off of you.

57
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:33,000
You're not allowed to take your eyes off of me.

58
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,440
Even when I want to close my eyes,

59
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,280
because of that, I can't.

60
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,510
Even when you want to close your eyes,

61
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,140
because of that, you can't.

62
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,680
- Because I like you. 
  - Because I like you.

00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,410
♫ Suddenly, far away ♫

64
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,250
♫ You are far away ♫

65

♫ In the shadow, I wander looking for you ♫

66
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,510
♫ Among countless moments that made me sway ♫

67
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:42,960
♫ You brush by me ♫

68
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,950
♫ Bring me out from the hollowness I am locked in ♫

69
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,430
♫ I've been lost ♫

- I want to runaway.
 - I want to runaway.

♫ Among the countless times that you made me sway, 
you brush by me ♫

78
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,420
Having a rice cake place that it's this successful wasn't what I wished for.

79
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,250
Don't complain about this.

80
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,710
Gook, are you really going to leave?

81
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,470
Yes, I should go.

82
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,840
But... why is it Japan?

83
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,600
I just wanted to go there once.

84
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,710
When are you coming back?

85
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,860
When nothing comes to mind anymore.

86
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:29,710
Because I can't see a handsome Gook like you, how do I keep living?

87
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,000
How do I keep living by just looking at her?

88
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,080
Mom, calm down a bit.

89
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:48,410
Take it. Think of it as your pay for working part-time.

90
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,760
Thank you, Ma'am.

91
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,530
Hyemi.

92
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:02,770
Ugh, what a pain!

93
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,560
Do you really have to go?

94
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,140
I'll call you often.

95
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,600
For sure?

96
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,330
For sure.

97
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,500
Do you know how long I waited for this day?

98
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,700
- Cream... 
 - I was scared since you were next to Hyemi!

99
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:28,150
Our Gook is way more handsome than Pilhyeon.

100
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,640
And more mature.

101
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,500
Mother.

102
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,120
Don't you have a gift for me?

103
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,750
I ordered it, but it hasn't been delivered yet.

104
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,700
I'm sorry.

105
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,540
Is college fun?

106
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,050
I don't know. We always just learn weird things.

107
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,260
Should I also go and study abroad?

108
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,190
Are you an idiot?

109
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,280
Have a safe trip, you bastard.

110
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,980
You better call often.

111
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,300
- It's been a long time. 
 - Hey!

112
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,640
That means it's been a long time. Did you meet him for the first time in a long time?

113
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,930
Our Gook.

114
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,250
He's such a frail boy.

115
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,320
How can he live anywhere on his own?

116
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,470
That bastard isn't weak, Mother.

117
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,500
Damn it! I told him not to go.

118
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,200
Did you call Taejoo?

119
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,680
- Yeah.
 - What did he say?

120
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,200
He didn't say much?

121
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,640
I don't know. I told him that Gook is going to Japan but he didn't say anything.

122
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:08,000
Our little Gook. Our frail little Gook.

123
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,300
Without Taejoo, what's he going to do?

124
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,580
How can he live like that?

125
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,350
What is he going to do?

126
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,630
Mother, I'm telling you, Kang Gook isn't weak!

127
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,690
But it's time for him to be here.

128
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,890
Hello. I came for the interview.

129
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,850
Damn it! I'll get my spot stolen again.

130
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:57,970
It's been three years since Taejoo left.

131
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,090
Taejoo hadn't come back and

132
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:06,260
