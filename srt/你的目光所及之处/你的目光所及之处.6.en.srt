What's up with you? Why are you like this while classes are going on?

00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,810
- What's up with you? 
 - I'm Kim Pilhyeon.

00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:56,820

Are you that girl? Kang Gook's?

Hey, don't go! Those guys are fighting.

They're fighting?

I don't know. Just go.

But we were going to eat these together.

15
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,160
- Why are you eating this now of all times? 
  - Damn it!

16
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,900
Han Taejoo is being like that because he got hit by the ball, right?

17
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,520
Seriously, why is his personality like that?

18
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,010
You also think Han Taejoo's personality is weird?

19
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,830
Wow. You too?

20
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,210
You're charming.

21
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,340
You're interesting as well.

22
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,140
Is that a good thing?

23
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,350
I said don't go. They're fighting. Go next time! Give it to them next time!

24
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,510
Do you want to just eat them with me?

25

Didn't you wear these pants backward?

29
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:50,580
No, I'm not wearing them backward. Am I?

30
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,670
I told you they were fighting.

31
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,970
Welco— I thought you were a customer!

32
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,160
Seeing as we have no customers, will we be okay?

33
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,050
There were a lot of customers during lunchtime, okay?

34
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,190
Congrats.

35
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,880
- Mom. 
 - Yeah?

36
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,530
People get jealous in friendships, too. Right?

37
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,700
They do. It happens often.

38
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,740
They do, right? I think I did before, too.

39
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:40,400
- I think I did, too. 
 - What is it? Gook and Taejoo got jealous?

Should I kill you?

45
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,000
I shouldn't have done that.

46
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,140
Yeah, so why'd you do it?

47
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,610
Stop provoking me. Please, I'm asking you.

48
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,940
Han Taejoo, I asked you for a favor.

49
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:47,090
- What are you doing? 
 - Stop avoiding the subject and tell me. Why'd you do that?

50
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:52,260
You said since we're doing this for life, no matter what the problem is, we have to resolve all of them.

51
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,480
If we talk about this, we can't do this for life.

52
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,800
You being with Choi Hyemi really pisses me off.

53
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,410
I thought it was jealousy as a friend,

54
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,880
but I like you.

55
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,660
I want to be with you all day.

56
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:32,840
And if we're together, I want to hug you. If I don't see you, I want to whine.

57
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,460
Don't push it, seriously.

58
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,390
Adapting to your whining is really my limit now.

59
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:49,410
You're being like this right now because you think of me as your mom.

60
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,910
Don't misunderstand and piss people off for no reason! I'm telling you, give it a rest!

61
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,170
Do you see me as a brat who can't even tell that apart?

62
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,970
You're speaking cruelly on purpose right now.

63

- You really do as you want, don't you? 
 - Yeah.

64

I've always done as I want.

65
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:21,210
So I'm asking what your feelings are since you're so great. Say it.

66
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,130
If I leave, whose loss do you think it'll be?

67
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:31,890
You're my lifelong patron so you must think it'll be my loss, but!

68
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,300
But that's not it.

69
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:42,700
I can live without you, but you can't.

70
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,880
I'm not asking about that though.

71
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,630
If you're going to listen, then know all of this while listening.

72

Out of 15 years, that one week you spent in Japan

73
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,720
felt the most free and happy to me.

74
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,930
Go tell that to Dad right now.

75
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,440
That it was hard as hell to clean up behind that jerk Han Taejoo all this time.

76
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,990
That he should hand over the money before you expose the things that thug Han Taejoo did.

77
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,820
Make sure to tell him. Got it?

78
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,810
That's right.

79
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:57,220
You were always smarter than me. This time, what you said was probably right.

80

I'm not having a really hard time.

- What my mom said was correct. 
 - Huh?

00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:36,980
I don't want to acknowledge it, but I did feel like that was the case from the start.
