Bear with it.

8
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,630
This reminds me of my mom.

9
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,700
Mom also did this sometimes.

10
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,690
Aren't you going to wash up?

11
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,670
You should wash up, too.

12
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,570
I'll do it later.

13
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,570

15

00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,130
So just wash up already.

Did you reply to her?

21
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,790
I'm going to try to meet up with her this Saturday.

22
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,300
I'll pop out while you're being tutored.

23
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,080
Wow!

24
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,410
You're making plans on your own and reporting them to me.

25
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,290
You're being weird.

26
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,620
You told me to date.

27
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,370
Careful! You have to dry my shiny hair with care.

28
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,460
That's right.

29
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,680
You really made this well.

30
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:22,110
But you shouldn't neglect me just because you are dating.

31
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,390
That'd be good.

32
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,080
What?

33
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,040

34
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,510
(I'd like to.)

35
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,370
But have you ever dated before?

36
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,660
You haven't even done it once.

37
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,430
Oh, Kang Gook. You're obviously gruff.

38
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,960
I don't think it'll be any good.

39
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,730
This big brother will teach you a little tomorrow.

40
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,800
What do you think? Aren't you thankful?

41
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,180
I'm not really that thankful.

42
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,100
You are!

43
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,230
Be careful with your hand.

44
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,000
Yes.

45
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,680
How could you... to my friend...?

46
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,380
Friend?

47
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,100
I saw you give her the same present.

48

I'm not allowed to take my eyes off you.

50
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:00,490
Even when I want to close my eyes, because of that, I can't.

51
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,050
I want to run away.

55
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:42,140

Everything is fine, except for the fact that you're bad at talking.

68
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:39,480

75
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:03,800
You like making stuff, to make yourself look good. You could talk about art and things like that.

76
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,400
I told you I'm not going to do it.

Try it out. I thought it was a good idea.

But you're saying that a cool girl like Seong Mingyeong went to hunt you down.

79

No, forget about that for now. I told you we have to coach Kang Gook on his date right now.

80
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,280
So, Hyeonjeong and Mingyeong were friends, huh.

81
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,540

87
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,070
It's not the fourth one. It's the new transfer student.

Isn't it a bit boring when it's just the two of us?

107

What do you think? Your heart fluttered, right?

108
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,300
Dating is something like this.

Just one move in an unexpected moment.

110

Same goes for skinship. I don't know if you'll be able to pull it off though. (T/N: "skinship" -  touching)
