00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,910
Did something bad happen to you?

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,920
No.

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,320
Then, why did you do that?

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,240
I don't like that bastard.

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,200
Kim Pil Hyun seemed fine.

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,070
And he's cute.

11
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,180
Look at yourself before calling someone cute.

12
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,480
Hey! Don't you remember getting caught in my armbar?

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,610
Now I might even fight better than you.

14
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,710
Really?

15
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,040
Then there must be no reason for me to keep being your bodyguard.

16
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,880
Didn't I tell you not to say something like that even as a joke?

17
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,880
Yeah, I'm sorry.

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,680
Let's have a bout today.

19
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,840
Okay.

Even though I was always by Tae Joo's side...

21
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,580
Aren't you coming?

22
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,880
Tae Joo was always...

23
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,860
 above me. 

24
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,590
Stop it!

25
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,730
Don't cause trouble again.

26
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,450
Why are you acting like this?

27
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,710
It's a joke.

We eat the same thing and hang out every day.

32
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,620
How is it like this?

33
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,620
It's not even the first nor second time you've seen it.

34
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,580
So what's with you suddenly?

35
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,790
- Who's that? 
 - I don't know.

36
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,580
- Take a look at it. 
 - No need.

37
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,480
Kang Gook? 

38
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:28,780
Why did you give me a different phone number?

39
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,480
What is it?

40
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,800
Did you tell her?

41
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,310
- Why? Isn't it fun? 
 - It's not fun for me.

42
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,490
It's just a gift. Don't resent me later. I'm telling you to go ahead and experiment with everything you want.

43
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,110
Do it all.

44
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:01,310
Kang Gook's number is 010-892-3777. He said he gave you the wrong one. You can thank me later. 

45
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,100
Is he your ideal type?

46
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,180
No, its a weird guy.

47
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,990
His name is Kang Gook, even his name is handsome.

48
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,090
Just give up.

49
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,050
Why?

50
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,990
It looks like a relationship that you shouldn't meddle in.

51
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,370
What does that mean?

52
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:33,700
When you become my age, you can see everything.

53
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,240
These two had a killer chemistry.

54
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,040
I think differently.

55
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,290
There's no going easy on the other, okay?

56
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,560
There's no way.

57

Did you reply?

58
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,440
I'm not going to do it.

59
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,300
Do it. It's an order.

60
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:25,490
You can't do this here. This is the only place where I can act impudently with you.

61
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,720
This is something I've never heard in my life.

62
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,720
Of course, you and I, there's nothing we—

63
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,830
Should I really kill you?

64
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,020
You'd be more at ease if you admit it. There's nothing we can do.

65
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,340
I'm going to touch your ear.

66
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,040
What's the matter?

67
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,050
You know I have to touch your ear to calm down.

68
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,200
Even then, it's a no.

69
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,430
But...

70
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,010
you should stop exercising your chest muscles.

71
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,940

72
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,390
Oh...

73
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,900
Hey, are you okay?

74
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,100
I'm sorry, I didn't do it on purpose. 
 - As expected.

75
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,440
"I didn't do it on purpose."

76
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,590
Why? Did he call?

77
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,490
- He didn't do it on purpose. 
 - Well, of course, I'd be happy to get a handsome son-in-law.

78
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,290

It would be nice if it goes well for them two, though.

Mom, why are you like this, really?

82
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,880

84

it's uncomfortable and tiresome.

Ah, it's uncomfortable!

86
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,180

What do you mean, "What do I do?"

You can do it.

You sprained my arm and all. Dammit, it's so uncomfortable.

00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,630
Just taking off my jacket is difficult. How am I going to do from now on?
