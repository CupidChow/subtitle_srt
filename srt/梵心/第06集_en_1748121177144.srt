00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,320
And I can't stop falling

00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,920
You are a long-time fan, right?

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,520
Yes.

30
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,320
You don't like me anyway.

31
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,320
I won't be here to love you.

32
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,920
Mr.

33
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,320
I have done the task you told me.

34
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,720
I have covered the money,

35
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,720
the school, and the hospital.

36
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,320
The men in the manor thought I was a kind person.

37
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,320
But they didn't know

38
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,720
that you asked me to do these things.

39
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,320
It's useless to take these money after you live for so long.

40
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,720
It's better to do something.

41
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,720
Qi Ci,

42
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,320
you haven't been in the hospital for so many years.

43
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,720
You are sick and old.

44
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,920
Don't go ahead.

45
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,920
Qi Ci, get up.

46
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,920
Qi Ci, get out of here.

47
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920

00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,920

50
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,920
Qi Ci, get out of here.

51
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:49,920
Mr.

52
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,920
The recent days

53
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,920
seem to have made your life more lively.

54
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,920
Qi Ci.

55
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,920
Qi Ci.

56
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
Qi Ci.

57
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,920
Qi Ci.

58
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
Qi Ci.

59
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,920
Qi Ci, get out of here.

60
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,920
Qi Ci.

61
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
You...

62
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
How can I teach you today?

63
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,920
What are you doing?

64
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,920
Let me go.

65
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
Let me go.

66
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
What's the matter?

67
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
This woman lied to me for drinking.

68
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,920
She even asked me to call her sister-in-law.

69
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,920
I've never been so embarrassed.

70
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,920
Get out of here.

71
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,920
I'm going to break her skin now.

72
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
Stop it.

73
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,920
Qi Ci.

74
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,920
She made me so embarrassed yesterday.

75
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
I have to teach her a lesson.

76
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
Get out.

77
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
You...

78
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
I don't know why she's so bad at drinking.

79
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,920
Well,

80
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
did you...

81
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,920
go...

82
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
last night?

83
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,920
No.

84
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,920
All right, go ahead.

85
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,920
You're still here

86
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,920
if you don't go.

87
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,920
I...

88
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
I...

89
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,920
I...

90
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,920
I...

91
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,920
Did anything happen

92
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,920
last night?

93
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,920
Why don't I remember anything?

94
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
I think it's...

95
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
I'm afraid.

96
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,920
How could my clothes be broken?

97
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
Why did she treat me

98
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,920
so badly the next day?

99
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,920
I can understand.

100
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Men will be shy, too.

101
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
She's leaving now.

102
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Miss Nanxian should be kind-hearted.

103
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,920
As a guest,

104
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
she's too ordinary

105
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,920
and she'll only hate people.

106
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,920
If Brother Chong Yang doesn't say it,

107
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,920
I'll tell her.

108
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
Miss Chu,

109
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,920
I think

110
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,920
she's not only annoying,

111
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
but also happy.

112
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,920
Miss Chu, you've known her for so long.

113
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,920
Why don't you know her?

114
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
You...

115
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
I have something to do.

116
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,920
I'll leave it to you.

117
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,920
The flower has been split in half.

118
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,920
I need to get the leaves out.

119
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,920
Qi Nanxin,

120
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,920
what are you doing?

121
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,920
Your Majesty,

122
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
are you still putting a spell on me?

123
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
I didn't do anything.

124
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Thanks, Your Majesty.

125
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
Fucking wretch.

126
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
Condductor,

127
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
Dongyuan,

128
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
you diğer me now and know

129
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
what's going on in me.

130
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
Don't blame me.

131
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,080
Too hot for me to swallow.

132
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,440
It's notany反應.

133
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,440
Let me gonna give you some smaller changes.

134
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,920
This is a good childVia Jean.

135
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,220
There are known that

136
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,400
some of them are already full of oxygen.

137
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,800
I should try it.

138
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,140
Let's change the place.

139
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,040
Be careful.

140
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,940
Your Highness!

141
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,800
Do you know we're not going to change as long as you wait?

142
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,060
использовать

143
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:45,960
One

144
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,460
лин

145
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,780
Easy.

146
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,120
why didn't you notice?

147
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,720
Okay.

148
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,360
What are you doing?

149
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,160
Cheng Yang,

150
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,160
do you want to drink?

151
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,920
Nonsense.

152
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,040
I...

153
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,440
I just want the wildflower to bloom soon.

154
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,000
Why are you so fierce?

155
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,400
Listen to me.

156
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,240
Without my permission,

157
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,920
you can't move the wildflower.

158
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,200
I see.

159
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,760
How did you get so many flowers in the dream mansion?

160
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,880
Today is your birthday.

161
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,840
You've been loving flowers the most.

162
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,880
Your birthday?

163
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,480
Where is she?

164
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,200
She's been married for three years.

165
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,720
She's been in love with you.

166
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,560
No.

167
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,680
Now you're still thinking about your wife's portrait

168
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,360
in the room.

169
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,040
Mr. Meng is so passionate.

170
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,280
It's none of your business.

171
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:13,960
I...

172
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,080
I'll give Wan Ting He to you in three months.

173
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
I'll see how I can fix you.

174
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,040
Go to work.

175
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:18,760
I...

176
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,080
Did you hear that?

177
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,880
Recently,

178
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,560
another girl has disappeared.

179
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,000
It seems like she's looking for a wildflower.

180
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,800
She's been...

181
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,840
Wildflower?

182
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,680
She's just disappeared.

183
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,840
Someone else is looking for her.

184
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,240
She's not afraid of dying.

185
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,640
I heard that she's been missing for five days.

186
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,080
I guess she can't come back.

187
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,800
You two, come here.

188
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,840
Wildflower?

189
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,040
Is there really such a flower?

190
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,920
If it's true,

191
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,440
if I take it and feed it to Chongyang,

192
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,120
is it called...

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,080
There's still something.

194
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,480
Uh...

195
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,760
It seems dangerous to hear that.

196
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,400
I got it.

197
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,200
You'll treasure this.

198
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,920
Liu,

199
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,280
forget your parents and have a good time.

200
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,200
As long as I'll remainhide,

201
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,160
I'll have the credit to show you that I'm like a person.

202
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,760
That's all for now.

203
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,440
Bye.

204
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
Goodbye.

205
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,360
Master Hu.

206
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,440
Have you ordered food?

207
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,960
Sure.

208
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,000
This is our first time to meet each other.

209
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,400
Do you remember it?

210
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,680
You are only coincidental with us

211
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,360
with this place in the future.

212
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:48,920
Nice birthday!

213
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,600
Thanks!

214
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,520
Haoling,

215
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,560
Haoling,

216
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,320
Let's get married.

217
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,320
Ling'er,

218
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,160
I will find a way to wake you up.

219
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,560
I will find a way to wake you up.

220
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:03,560
The moment I hugged you, I shed tears.

221
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,560
The world is full of colors.

222
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,160
You only belong to me.

223
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:18,360
Even if it's a farewell, it's a farewell.

224
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,560
How can it be?
