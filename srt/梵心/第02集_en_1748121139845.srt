crabs, blood, ousters, fire

look and hole is better than

26
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:54,940
I focus only

27
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,200
where it belongs

28
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,460

Episode 39

35
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,780
What brings you here?

36
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,700
You changed your mind?

37
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,180
Who are they?

38
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,020
They are Meng's family.

39
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,380
They asked me to buy a hundred bowls of tangerine.

40
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,780
It's very hard to find them.

41
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,220
So many people came to get tea.

42
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,860
Is this your home?

43
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,500
Yes.

44
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,020
I came to the south of the river

45
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,300
to take this boat

46
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,980
to find the people of Yongye.

47
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,980
I didn't expect you to bring them here.

48
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,380
I mean,

49
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,140
I finally found you.

50
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,700
I want to see

51
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,940
if your heart can open the fire.

52
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,260
It's so beautiful.

53
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,820
What is this?

54
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,580
What are you doing?

55
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,540
What are you doing?

56
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,700
Let him bloom.

57
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,300
How can I let him bloom?

58
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,140
It's a matter of time before he blooms.

59
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,140
It's a matter of time before he blooms?

60
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,740
But if I let him bloom,

61
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,140
you can let me stay by your side.

62
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:44,860
Okay.

63
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,420
Then I'll see

64
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,620
if you can survive that time.

65
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,780
Why should I listen to you?

66
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,700
You can listen to me,

67
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,660
but I want to kill you.

68
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,540
It's also a very easy thing.

69
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,500
Haven't you found Yan Yu?

70
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,660
Not yet.

71
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,820
A hundred bowls of tangerine

72
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,740
have been found.

73
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,140
Only

74
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,260
21 bowls of tangerine.

75
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,300
It's been three months.

76
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,660
You know that Wan Ting He is my key.

77
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,900
You still don't want to let him bloom.

78
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:41,900
It seems that I have to re-do it.

79
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,700
Master.

80
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,900
I'll find him right away.

81
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,540
Master.

82
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,660
He ate it.

83
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,380
Last thing he made

84
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,540
will have to be cared for and Лi Where could it be?

85
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,380
Stop talking like your mum,

86
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,580
don't think about things really bad,

87
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,460
don't always do the same.

88
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,380
I think that

89
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,260
Mr. down when he came back,

90
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,620
after he ate the nine bowls of tangerine

91
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,500
I'll talk to

92
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,900
Is he still with me?

93
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,380
Go get him!

94
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,100
No...

95
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,100
I'm not a child.

96
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,100
I'm not a child.

97
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,100
I'm not a child.

98
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,100
I'm not a child.

99
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,100
Go out.

100
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,100
Yes.

101
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,100
Hua Ling,

102
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,100
I will let you wake up early.

103
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,100
If it weren't for that person,

104
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,100
we wouldn't have separated for so long.

105
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,100
Você.

106
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,100
auction

107
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,100
What a perfect spot.

108
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,380
Heart of a Internet walked the big stone.

109
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,260
Are you supposed to

110
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,900
just spend it here?

111
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,020
In the future you'll

112
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,740
honor my name at Shiyue integrate.

113
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,140
That's enough.

114
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,560
I will go with you

115
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,700
all my life

116
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:30,860
while you spent your time there.

117
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,300
This place is so cold.

118
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,900
There are any snowy places

119
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,740
as cold assomeone.

120
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,180
When I didn't get to touch snow last time,

121
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,900
When I first saw you,

122
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,540
it was five years ago

123
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,980
when I was in Mobei.

124
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,780
Unfortunately,

125
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,780
I only have three months left.

126
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,900
I don't know if I can see you again.

127
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,660
I can't see you again.

128
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,300
It's snowing.

129
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,420
It's so beautiful.

130
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,380
Did you see it?

131
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,060
It's snowing.

132
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,540
It's so beautiful.

133
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,340
So beautiful.

134
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,860
So beautiful.

135
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,380
I haven't seen such beautiful snow for a long time.

136
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,140
So beautiful.

137
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,860
I haven't seen such beautiful snow for a long time.

138
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,140
It's so beautiful.

139
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,860
It's so beautiful.

140
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,140
Don't forget to give me your gentle hug.

141
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:36,940
Mr. Meng.

142
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,180
Mr. Meng.

143
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,540
Mr. Meng, you must be the master of this place.

144
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,060
I'm not your master.

145
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,700
Leave now.

146
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,020
Come out, Mr. Meng.

147
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,700
You must be the master for me, Mr. Meng.

148
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,340
Uncle, what's going on?

149
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,060
Let's go.

150
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,660
Zhang Zala's daughter, Tao Chun.

151
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,740
In the past, Mr. Meng has seen a patient in the hospital.

152
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,180
He's not forgetful to others.

153
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,820
This Meng Daifu loves his wife the most.

154
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,380
How could he fall in love with her?

155
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,300
And Tao Chun's daughter

156
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,060
is in love with her.

157
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,380
As a result, Tao Chun's daughter is crazy.

158
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,220
She went to find the love flowers in the village.

159
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:05,860
In the village,

160
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,180
she went to find the love flowers in the village.

161
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,540
Tao Chun also went there and didn't come back.

162
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,620
Please help me take a look.

163
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,580
Mr. Meng is here.

164
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,500
Mr. Meng.

165
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Mr. Meng is here.

166
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,100
Mr. Meng.

167
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,820
Mr. Meng.

168
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,620
Mr. Meng.

169
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,380
I beg you.

170
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,820
Please help me find my daughter.

171
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,660
I've never seen Miss Tao Chun.

172
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,980
But I can send someone to help you find her.

173
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,980
You go back and wait for the news, okay?

174
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,820
Will you really help me find my daughter?

175
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,540
Mr. Meng is a good man.

176
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,340
But he's our man.

177
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,460
We should thank him.

178
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,380
Yes.

179
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,060
Yes.

180
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,700
Mr. Meng.

181
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,220
Mr. Meng.

182
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,140
He must be fine.

183
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,260
Thank you, Mr. Meng.

184
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,580
Thank you, Mr. Meng.

185
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,580
Don't worry.

186
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,340
Okay.

187
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,060
Let's go.

188
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,580
Let's go.

189
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,260
Let's go.

190
00:08:59,260 --> 00:08:59,820
Let's go.

191
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,580
Let's go.

192
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,100
Let's go.

193
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,780
Let's go.

194
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,340
Stop.

195
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,540
What are you doing here?

196
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,140
You're looking for someone to send you off?

197
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,980
I took your money.

198
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,300
I won't say anything.

199
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,180
I came to tell you

200
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,740
that Wan Ting He has been released.

201
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,940
He'll be sent to your mansion in a few days.

202
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,380
That's not too bad.

203
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,900
So don't bully me again.

204
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,100
What's wrong?

205
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:29,980
Master.

206
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,820
The master of this flower shop said

207
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,540
he can send Wan Ting He to the palace for 100 houses next month.

208
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,380
Okay.

209
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,660
You can go now.

210
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,180
Yes.

211
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,340
Mr. Meng.

212
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,180
Right here.

213
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:42,820
Right there.

214
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,620
Bye.

215
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,580
Okay.

216
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:44,740
See you.

217
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,940
I know something.

218
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,420
I happened to come here to see Lu Hua

219
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,300
I got a few beads and made them into powder.

220
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,260
If you're okay,

221
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,260
I'll leave first.

222
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,380
By the way,

223
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,940
Wan Ting He,

224
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,100
I'll send someone to your mansion in a few days.

225
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,140
Okay.

226
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,220
Miss, please.

227
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,340
Go and check on her.

228
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,580
Yes.

229
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,940
Shall we really go to find Tao Chun?

230
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,060
What did she say?

231
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,900
Only this girl has no other family.

232
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,340
If so,

233
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,740
help her.

234
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,980
Let them reunite.

235
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,300
Yes.

236
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,860
I'm sorry.

237
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,860
I'm sorry.

238
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,860
I'm sorry.

239
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,900
I'm sorry.

240
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,900
I'm sorry.

241
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,900
I'm sorry.

242
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,900
I'm sorry.

243
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,900
I'm sorry.

244
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,900
I'm sorry.

245
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,900
I'm sorry.

246
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,900
I'm sorry.

247
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,900
I'm sorry.

248
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,900
I'm sorry.

249
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,900
I'm sorry.

250
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,900
I'm sorry.

251
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,900
I'm sorry.

252
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,900
I'm sorry.

253
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,900
I'm sorry.

254
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,900
I'm sorry.

255
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:29,900
I'm sorry.

256
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,900
I'm sorry.

257
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,900
I'm sorry.

258
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,900
I'm sorry.

259
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,900
I'm sorry.

260
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,900
I'm sorry.

261
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,900
I'm sorry.

262
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,900
I'm sorry.

263
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,900
I'm sorry.

264
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,860
I'm sorry.

265
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,860
I'm sorry, bro.

266
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,700
No, thanks.

267
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,740
No, thanks.

268
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,020
I'll leave the salt for you.

269
00:11:49,100 --> 00:12:02,900
Myiety,

270
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,220
I'll just beer.

271
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,220
I want you to kiss me

272
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,220
Let time listen to me

273
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:15,220
Full of light and fire

274
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,220
Embrace that moment

275
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,220
The yellow line is falling

276
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,220
This world is full of colors

277
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,220
You only belong to me

278
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:37,220
Even if it's goodbye, it's the last time

279
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,220
How can it be?
