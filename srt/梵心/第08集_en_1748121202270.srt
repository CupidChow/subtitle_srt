1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Memories are not broken, they are all right.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The moment of the miracle, I will never be able to see it.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I want to fall into the pit of a bridge.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Your courage is all my luxury.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The world is sick, the good team is alive.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If you don't die, it's hard to live.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Love is with you, I will be reborn.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I will die, I will be silent.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I am the desert, love is white.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I will show you the red carpet.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Can you remember me?

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,480
The wind avoid the 分。

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I discs, resources.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I chase you through PLAYING my house.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The rain and wind, rain sways from the factors behind.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The Earth is red, so I shall not ever verbatim.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Don't get lost, don't die.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,080
The Long Ballad

19
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,080
Episode 22

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,600
Who are you?

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,280
Why do you keep following me?

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,840
Take care of me.

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,520
Save me.

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,440
Once I break into your house,

25
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,120
I'll blow away theomatic stuff that we both made.

26
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,240
You can follow me out at the end and take care.

27
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,080
love one another

28
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,460
Will I find out who's lost?

29
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,940
through your masteresse

30
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,180
All the details of the details.

31
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,100
sir

32
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,240
Xie thank you,

33
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,320
You hear the rumors

34
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,600
They say the love bee

35
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,720
can make the one who loves her feel at ease.

36
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,800
Well,

37
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,840
is it too ridiculous for Miao?

38
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,040
I don't think it's ridiculous.

39
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,360
It's said that

40
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,680
the person from Miao River

41
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,960
is good at using the magic of the mongrel.

42
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,440
It's used for the love of men and women.

43
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,320
If I remember correctly,

44
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,680
Xisi,

45
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,960
are you the one from Miao River?

46
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,320
Sir,

47
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,760
the one from my grandfather's generation

48
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,440
has already been to Nanyang City.

49
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,400
You should know it better than me.

50
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,400
The things from Miao River

51
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,800
have been passed down to me for a long time.

52
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,000
Really?

53
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
I want to find you

54
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,240
to learn more about the magic of the mongrel.

55
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,640
If you want to know more,

56
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,280
I'll go back to look for it.

57
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,920
Let's see if I can find anything

58
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,840
about the magic of the mongrel in the remains of the tribe.

59
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay.

60
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,440
Then, please help me find out

61
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,320
if this thing is yours.

62
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,840
Xisi,

63
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,760
is this token yours?

64
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,760
Yes.

65
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,760
Who in your family

66
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,360
has this token?

67
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,880
In addition to me,

68
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,280
there are some of the management members.

69
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,120
Sir,

70
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,680
where did you get this token?

71
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,400
I picked it up.

72
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,720
But I have a lot of people in my family.

73
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll go back and look it up.

74
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,840
Xisi,

75
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,560
you should pay more attention to the people around you.

76
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,800
Don't let them use it.

77
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,360
Yes.

78
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,280
The token may be just a coincidence.

79
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,320
Xisi doesn't know who made this thing.

80
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,520
The bones from the mountain top

81
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,840
are actually the magic of the mongrel?

82
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,560
It's a good thing that people know who it is.

83
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,800
Mr. Meng.

84
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,040
I just saw Meng Xisi.

85
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,440
You're awake.

86
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,520
Why is she here?

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,080
Do you know each other?

88
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,080
How do you know each other?

89
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,400
She knows you're from the Yongye Clan.

90
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,520
I saved Meng Xia's life once.

91
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,880
In order to repay me,

92
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,920
they're willing to be my servants in the era.

93
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,680
Actually, it's just that my identity

94
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,160
is not convenient to walk outside.

95
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,880
They've made a mistake for me.

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,880
The Meng family of Nanyang City

97
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,280
is actually your servant.

98
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,200
Brother Chu Yang,

99
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,760
you're so awesome.

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,560
Oh, right.

101
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,880
There are many bowls of tangerines in the garden.

102
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,600
It's very difficult to plant them.

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,120
Many flowers were taken from me

104
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,560
by Meng family.

105
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,400
Do you think

106
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,680
the garden

107
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,320
has something to do with Meng family?

108
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,640
It's just some flowers.

109
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,920
Don't think too much.

110
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,480
No wonder the bone and the mongrel moved.

111
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,200
So Chongyang went to the garden.

112
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,320
What did he do there?

113
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,000
Well,

114
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
will Lord Chongyang

115
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,960
suspect you?

116
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,560
He probably won't.

117
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,320
But he has found the secret of the bone and the mongrel.

118
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,960
He'll find out about it sooner or later.

119
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,800
My Lord,

120
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,960
you and Lord Chongyang

121
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,680
are young brothers.

122
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,960
If Lord Chongyang finds out about it,

123
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,840
you'll be lying to him.

124
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,360
Well...

125
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
What do you know?

126
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,560
A brother who is like a brother.

127
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,640
A good brother.

128
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,400
Since he saw the flower spirit

129
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,560
die in front of him

130
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,600
and didn't let go of the old one,

131
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,280
I only hate him.

132
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,680
But why is Ji Nansheng there?

133
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,800
Why is he in the night palace?

134
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,920
Their relationship doesn't seem normal.

135
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,760
Chongyang,

136
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,360
do you know how to be heartless?

137
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,800
Mr. Meng, you're here.

138
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,800
I'm here to deliver something.

139
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,920
By the way, Miss Nansheng,

140
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,760
I saw your hand injured some days ago.

141
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,640
This is my best new window medicine.

142
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
Take it and try it.

143
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,200
Mr. Meng, you're too polite.

144
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,960
My hands are almost healed.

145
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,640
You're so polite.

146
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,640
I'm sorry.

147
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,640
I'm sorry.

150
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,640
I'm sorry.

151
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
I'm sorry.

152
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
I'm sorry.

153
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
I'm sorry.

154
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
I'm sorry.

155
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,640
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,640
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,840
You're the one who's taking care of me.

158
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,400
I have to take care of you.

159
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,600
I'm not.

160
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
Xisi.

161
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Mr. Meng.

162
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,840
Why are you here?

163
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,280
I got a good tea.

164
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,000
I thought of bringing it to you.

165
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
I'm glad to hear that.

166
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,240
Mr. Meng is so polite.

167
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,800
He even gave me a new window medicine.

168
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,040
Miss Nansheng,

169
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,040
you can use your hands to plant flowers and plant plants.

170
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,440
But you must protect her.

171
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,160
Mr. Meng, you're too polite.

172
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,240
It's so hot.

173
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
Xisi.

174
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,000
Xisi, you're here.

175
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,520
You bring me good toys every time you come.

176
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,120
What's this?

177
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
This is the good wine I brought back from the north.

178
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,960
Try it.

179
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
I don't want it.

180
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't drink.

181
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,280
Although he saved me,

182
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,000
I also helped him to plant flowers,

183
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,320
right?

184
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,240
Didn't you...

185
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,760
borrow it?

186
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,160
Borrowed?

187
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,240
By the way, Miss Yingying,

188
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,480
this is the silk I brought back from Yangzhou

189
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,440

204
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,240
I wonder if you have a new person now.

205
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
New person?

206
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,240
Who do you think it is?

207
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,240
I'm in the night palace all day.

208
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
How can I know?

209
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
In the night palace,

210
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,240
there are many ladies.

211
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,240
I wonder how you feel about her.

212
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,240
You're talking about Ji Nansheng.

213
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
You're really interested in her.

214
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,240
I'm interested in her.

215
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,240
I don't have any idea about her.

216
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,240
But now,

217
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,240
you're more interested in her.

218
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,240
Do I?

219
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,240
Chongyang,

220
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,240
you're really interested in her.

221
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,240
What are you doing?

222
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,240
I'm not doing anything.

223
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,240
I'm just checking what you're doing.

224
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,240
What do I do?

225
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,240
What does it have to do with you?

226
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,240
Why are you so fierce?

227
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,240
You were happy when you were giving her a gift.

228
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
Did you get jealous?

229
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,240
What did I get jealous?

230
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,240
Take it.

231
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,240
Since you asked me if I was jealous,

232
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,240
I'll reward you.

233
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,240
I'll reward you.

234
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,240
I'm not jealous.

235
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,240
I want to be strong and not give up.

236
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,240
I want to be strong and not give up.

237
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,240
Every time I learn, I want to be with you.

238
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,240
Let time pass by.

239
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,240
Let the firefly fill the sky.

240
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,240
Let the firefly fill the sky.

241
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,240
Let the firefly fill the sky.

242
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,240
Let the firefly fill the sky.

243
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,240
Let the firefly fill the sky.

244
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,240
Let the firefly fill the sky.

245
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,240
Let the firefly fill the sky.

246
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,240
Let the firefly fill the sky.

247
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,240
You hung high from the roof,

248
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,240
