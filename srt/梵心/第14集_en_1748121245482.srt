1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,340
My timing is all because of you

2
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,080
Love misstep

3
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,680
I will endure no more

4
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,240
Love your true self

5
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,840
Death is just a delusion

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,720
I am a fool

7
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,660
With determination

8
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,320
You free to roam

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,200
To cut off the memory

10
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,900
But I am just a Government

11
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,340
Walk and do what I want

12
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:10,280
The Sea by the Bay

13
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,360
Zhu Xia Ochie

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,860
What is this all about?

15
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,360
What does it say?

16
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,220
What have you used in this?

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,880
Wow

18
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,340
It's just a bottle of Xue Huagao.

19
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,540
Nonsense!

20
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,940
Did you do it on purpose?

21
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,140
Look at my face.

22
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,340
What's it like now?

23
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,260
Why did it turn into this?

24
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,580
Miss Zhu,

25
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,660
how can you be a star

26
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,260
when your face turns into this?

27
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,140
Meng Xizi,

28
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,380
you did it on purpose.

29
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,460
You did it on purpose.

30
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,860
Why did you hurt me?

31
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,300
You said I hurt you

32
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,500
just by a bottle of Xue Huagao.

33
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,380
I won't admit it.

34
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,380
You dare to ask?

35
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,940
I'm going to find Brother Chongyang now.

36
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,020
He won't let you go.

37
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,860
Chu Yingying,

38
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,180
do you think Chongyang

39
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,620
still has the heart to be with you?

40
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,580
What do you mean?

41
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,940
I think

42
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,180
he has the heart

43
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,340
to be with that girl, Miss Nanxing.

44
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,500
Nonsense!

45
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,820
What does she have in mind?

46
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,500
What she likes is me.

47
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,740
It's me!

48
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,380
Miss Zhu,

49
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,860
don't be so sad.

50
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,100
I don't care.

51
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,180
Please give me back my face!

52
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,580
Please give me back my face!

53
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,820
Miss Zhu, I'm a doctor.

54
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,300
Of course I can cure your face.

55
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,140
And

56
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,620
I can still let Chongyang

57
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,460
put his heart on you.

58
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,500
You...

59
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,500
What can I do?

60
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,180
The Xue Huagao before

61
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,460
does have some problems.

62
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,060
You should go back and take this.

63
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,700
Your face will be better in three days.

64
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:50,940
How do I know

65
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,420
if you'll lie to me again?

66
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,260
Do you still have other options

67
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,700
other than to believe me?

68
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,420
Hello?

69
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,460
Miss Zhu,

70
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,100
if you want to get the antidote,

71
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,540
you need to pay some price.

72
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,100
You moved these flowers to the night palace.

73
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,780
You don't need to come here to take care of them.

74
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,660
No.

75
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,300
These flowers are just used to adapt to their water soil.

76
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,060
They will affect their growth.

77
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,940
You didn't say you'd come to help me.

78
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,140
Then I won't.

79
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,020
What's wrong?

80
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,540
Are you okay?

81
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,500
I'm fine.

82
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,100
Hurry up.

83
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,580
You're bleeding.

84
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,260
Does it hurt?

85
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,620
No.

86
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:19,940
No?

87
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,940
No.

88
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,380
It's okay.

89
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,100
I've been alone for so many years.

90
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,820
I've been hurt so much.

91
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,340
I'm used to it.

92
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,180
Now it's okay.

93
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,380
You're with me.

94
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,500
I'm not afraid of anything.

95
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,940
Don't worry.

96
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,940
I'm here.

97
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,660
I won't let you get hurt again.

98
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:28,940
Okay.

99
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,140
By the way,

100
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,860
we haven't been to the Night Palace for a long time.

101
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,580
I wonder if it's open now.

102
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:03,460
Give it to me, FR-CNV.

103
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,420
Great!

104
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,980
It's closed again.

105
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,740
And there are only four rooms to be built.

106
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,460
I need more excrements for blood tonic.

107
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,180
Phase three.

108
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,180
You need to wrap it up with Title IV.

109
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,420
Why?

110
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,860
You've been willing to open it all along, haven't you?

111
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,940
It's important.

112
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,100
What do you think that is?

113
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,100
It's snowing.

114
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,100
What a beautiful snow!

115
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,100
It's so beautiful.

116
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,100
I'm so happy.

117
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,100
You smiled.

118
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,100
I saw you smile this time.

119
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,100
You look so beautiful when you smile.

120
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,100
I smiled.

121
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,100
And,

122
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,100
don't wear deep-colored clothes anymore.

123
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,100
You look so dirty.

124
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,100
Wear a light-colored one.

125
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,100
It's my turn now.

126
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,100
Don't you like me?

127
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,100
I do.

128
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,100
Why is the snow stopped?

129
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
It's snowing.

130
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,100
I'm so happy.

131
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,100
Yan Xiu Ren,

132
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,100
be calm.

133
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,100
I found out

134
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,100
that my body's ability to stay longer

135
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,100
is even worse than this stone.

136
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,100
Chou Yang,

137
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,100
your deep-sea flowers are blooming.

138
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,100
They're blooming.

139
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,100
Look.

140
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Even my body's self-reliance

141
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,100
is getting worse.

142
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,100
I'm getting more and more angry.

143
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,100
You're from the Yongye Clan.

144
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,100
The process of death is very slow.

145
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,100
I never said I'm dying.

146
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,100
I even have some expectations.

147
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,100
And now,

148
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,100
it's different.

149
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,100
I'm so happy.

150
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,100
Isn't it too exaggerated?

151
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,100
Don't you like it?

152
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,100
No.

153
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,100
I just think...

154
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,100
I'm so worried about you.

155
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,100
I even took your house

156
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,100
as my favorite.

157
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,100
I'm sorry.

158
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,100
I'm sorry.

159
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,100
Then,

160
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,100
your clothes,

161
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,100
can I change them?

162
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,100
Now?

163
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,100
No.

164
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,100
Now,

165
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,100
I'm getting more and more shameless.

166
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,100
I'm hungry.

167
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,100
I'll make something to eat.

168
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,100
I'm so hungry.

169
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,100
I'm so hungry.

170
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
I'm so hungry.

171
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,100
I'm so hungry.

172
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,100
I'm so hungry.

173
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,100
I'm so hungry.

174
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,100
I'm so hungry.

175
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,100
I'm so hungry.

176
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,100
I'm so hungry.

177
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
I'm so hungry.

178
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,100
I'm so hungry.

179
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,100
I'm so hungry.

180
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,100
I'm so hungry.

181
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,100
I'm so hungry.

182
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,100
I lost you.

183
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,100
How could I

184
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:35,100
be so lonely?

185
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,100
The more I want to be with you,

186
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,100
the more I want to be with you.

187
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,100
Every snow flower is like you.

188
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,100
Let the world be bright.

189
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,100
The sky is full of light.

190
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,100
The moment I hug you,

191
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,100
the light is falling.

192
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,100
The world is full of colors.

193
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,100
