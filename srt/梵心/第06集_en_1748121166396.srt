1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,600
The same is all my luxury

2
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,320
Thousand soldiers happen one after another

3
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,960
If you want to praise, you're ugly

4
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,500
Love Pharisees pairs together

5
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,100
Life and death is so March

6
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:40,900
I am silent

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,760
In love with the sea

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,240
Look at the sadness in my48

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:52,320
I am watching the

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,200
And I justYes

11
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,120
I justPS

12
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,360
The

13
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,880
original Crazy

14
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,920
Am просто

15
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,040
Zhong Drag

16
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,320
赵幸棒

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,520
先

18
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:55,440
Kang

19
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,620
I've killed him.

20
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,220
I didn't do a favor.

21
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,300
Mr. Bang 6000,

22
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,460
if you need nothing,

23
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,620
I need to go back.

24
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,820
Wait a minute.

25
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,980
I'll play first.

26
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,580
Start.

27
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,440
I have progress.

28
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,520
Sir,

29
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,360
why did you come so late?

30
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,760
Is there anything important?

31
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,040
Drink with me.

32
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,100
At last...

33
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,700
it was quite late.

34
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,080
Oh, I forgot.

35
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,160
Xisi.

36
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,120
We seem to

37
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,840
not have experienced this drink for much time.

38
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,240
When was the last time you sang like that?

39
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,500
It has been more than three years.

40
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,240
Do you still remember the grade you drank at that time?

41
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,360
You would always tell me

42
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:53,380
about your heartbeats every time.

43
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,600
are not enough to eat.

44
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:02,880
Qi Ci,

45
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,560
after the flower forest is destroyed,

46
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,000
you seem to have changed a lot.

47
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,480
Only when you lose it,

48
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,680
will you cherish it.

49
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,520
Qi Ci,

50
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,960
in the end,

51
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,000
you lose it.

52
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,280
I'm not a good person.

53
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,160
I know

54
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,200
it's the birthday of the flower forest.

55
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,040
I don't want you to think about it alone.

56
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,840
I'm not a good person.

57
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,240
I'm not a good person.

58
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm not a good person.

59
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,840
I'm not a good person.

60
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,760
I'm not a good person.

61
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,840
I'm not a good person.

62
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,840
I'm not a good person.

63
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,920
I'm not a good person.

64
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,040
I'm not a good person.

65
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,840
I'm not a good person.

66
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,920
I'm not a good person.

67
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,920
I'm not a good person.

68
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,920
I'm not a good person.

69
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,920
I'm not a good person.

70
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,040
I'm not a good person.

71
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,520
How wygląda?

72
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,200
What else should I do?

73
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,920
I lost him too early in class

74
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,960
for letting him use a magic skill to drive us away.

75
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,000
He's not coming home?

76
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,400
Those girls aren't trailblazing, right?

77
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,480
Why is he so門kin?

78
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,760
Let's go.

79
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,720
We're in this relationship now.

80
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,080
It's not good to talk to each other at all.

81
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,880
No.

82
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,360
I didn't write my name on the note I gave him.

83
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,720
Did he not know it was me?

84
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,000
L contraband,

85
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,120
Commander,

86
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,600
where is front?

87
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,080
Find her.

88
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,160
Don't go.

89
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,760
His lordship!

90
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,240
That girl...

91
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,480
You're at the gate.

92
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,120
Chengyan,

93
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,320
I knew you would come.

94
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,200
You scared me.

95
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's late.

96
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,480
What are you doing here?

97
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:47,720
Don't want to kill me.

98
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,720
Overseas.

99
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,160
Kiss of course.

100
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
It's a good thing.

101
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,480
Do you remember

102
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,840
the love I told you?

103
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,720
I do.

104
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,800
It's on the top of that mountain.

105
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,680
Don't you want to go there?

106
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,680
No.

107
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,320
But many girls have disappeared.

108
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
Let's go and check.

109
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,760
If we find them,

110
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,160
it's a good thing.

111
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,040
I don't care.

112
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,440
But I care.

113
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,160
You can go with me.

114
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,160
Let go.

115
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,040
No.

116
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,960
Brother.

117
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,720
Brother Cheng Yang.

118
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,480
Go with me.

119
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,920
Okay?

120
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:28,840
I'm not going.

121
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,520
Let's go, Brother Cheng Yang.

122
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,040
Let's go.

123
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,520
I'm so tired.

124
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
Cheng Yang.

125
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,440
Cheng Yang.

126
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,040
Cheng Yang.

127
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,640
Cheng Yang.

128
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,480
Cheng Yang.

129
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,600
Ying Hao Cheng.

130
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,400
Slow down.

131
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,000
What a beautiful garden!

132
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,160
No wonder they said

133
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,720
this is the garden of God of the Mountains.

134
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,320
This seems to be the bowl I planted.

135
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,600
It's so beautiful.

136
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,400
Chuyang, look!

137
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,720
What a beautiful flower!

138
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Oh my god!

139
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,640
Love?

140
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,240
You smiled.

141
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,600
No.

142
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,640
I saw it!

143
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,560
You smiled?

144
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
No,

145
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,840
no way!

146
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,840
I was just here for a proper event,

147
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,480
for you.

148
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,200
Yes, we came here to look for these flowers.

149
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,560
But

150
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,240
the garden looks plain,

151
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,880
Even if you can't find the flowers,

152
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,840
you can still walk out safely.

153
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,680
What's going on

154
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,280
with the girls who disappeared?

155
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,040
Ying Haocheng.

156
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,960
Why is Ying Haocheng

157
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,640
different from what I've seen before?

158
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,840
Why is there someone else?

159
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,960
Something's wrong.

160
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,840
Let's go.

161
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,640
It doesn't seem like a fire.

162
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,880
It's a tiger.

163
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,560
It seems that the girls who disappeared

164
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,280
are all here to meet the tiger.

165
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,440
Who is it?

166
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,200
It's a big flower

167
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,800
on this mountain.

168
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,320
It's a flower-yellow tiger.

169
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,320
You're poisoned.

170
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,600
I'm a bit dizzy.

171
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,440
Be careful.

172
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,120
Be careful.

173
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,200
It's a tiger.

174
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:52,880
But

175
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,440
there's a poison in their bones.

176
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,400
It seems that someone went to the top of the mountain

177
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,920
to find it.

178
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,000
Yes.

179
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,820
Of course.

180
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,840
I'm sorry.

181
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
I'm sorry.

182
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,840
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,840
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,840
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
I'm sorry.

190
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,840
I'm sorry.

191
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,840
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
I'm sorry.

193
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
I'm sorry.

194
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,840
I'm sorry.

195
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,840
