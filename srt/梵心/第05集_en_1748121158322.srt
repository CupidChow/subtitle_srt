we together

18
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,380
we need to consider

19
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,500
I believe everything will go well

20
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,700
And podía optimize

21
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,100
I try again

22
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,540
and do it again

23
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,520
happeninginger

24
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,220
I...

25
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,020
Since you're so impatient,

26
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,860
why don't you

27
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,500
do as you please?

28
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,180
No.

29
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:56,980
I...

30
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,060
I... I...

31
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:00,900
I...

32
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,660
I...

33
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,260
What's wrong?

34
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,740
Brother!

35
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,220
Why are you looking at me?

36
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,900
Are you the star of the star?

37
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:30,900
I...

38
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,700
So you're also from Yongye Clan?

39
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,180
No.

40
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,020
Brother.

41
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,980
What's going on?

42
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,220
Actually,

43
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,380
he's here to borrow the dorm.

44
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,740
Borrow the dorm?

45
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,580
When did Ye Gongguan become a guest?

46
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,180
You're not lying, Brother Chongyang.

47
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,500
Brother Chongyang?

48
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,940
Is there a problem?

49
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,620
No, there's no problem.

50
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:05,980
I'm a flower-gatherer.

51
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,100
My name is Jin Lansheng.

52
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,180
I like him.

53
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,660
We're

54
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,420
lovers.

55
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,500
Here.

56
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,340
We're lovers.

57
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,340
We're lovers.

58
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,100
Brother Chongyang,

59
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,660
why are you with this woman?

60
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,580
Brother,

61
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,420
do you really like her?

62
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,420
Yes.

63
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:37,820
I like her.

64
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,820
For so many years,

65
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,260
I've never seen anyone you like.

66
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,340
What's so good about this woman?

67
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,220
Why do you like her?

68
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,660
Because she's a flower-gatherer,

69
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,780
she'll treat flowers like a child.

70
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,620
Like a child.

71
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,300
She looks pretty when she smiles.

72
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,580
I think I can forget

73
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,900
all the troubles I see in her smile.

74
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,580
She's also very strong.

75
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,620
She's also very brave.

76
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,900
She'll protect her own safety

77
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,900
and protect others' safety.

78
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,060
Although she's a bit angry sometimes,

79
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,100
she still blames me.

80
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,580
When I'm with her,

81
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,140
I can feel the warmth of this world

82
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,420
and the truth of this world.

83
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,140
Brother,

84
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,420
she's a human after all.

85
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,460
She can't be with you forever.

86
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,620
I'll be with her

87
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,420
for a while.

88
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,020
I can always be with my brother.

89
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:44,700
I can use you.

90
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,620
Changsheng,

91
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,020
stop making trouble.

92
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,620
Brother.

93
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,620
Okay.

94
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,180
You and Yingying just came back.

95
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,820
Go to bed.

96
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,100
Chouyang,

97
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,420
are all the words you just said

98
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,460
true?

99
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,300
Yes.

100
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:23,860
It's true.

101
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,500
Remember,

102
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,060
you can't tell Changsheng and Yingying

103
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,700
what happened to Shi Yehua.

104
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,060
You can't let them know

105
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,220
you're a wild girl.

106
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,460
Then what you just said

107
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,460
are all lies.

108
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,820
Tell me,

109
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,340
I'm brave

110
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,660
and I'll protect others.

111
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,100
They're all lies.

112
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,860
They're all lies.

113
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,140
I'm still allowed to let you

114
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,860
lie in front of me

115
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,420
because you can help me raise flowers.

116
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,740
Don't think too much.

117
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,380
Do I need to find you?

118
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,260
If I didn't do it for the sake of my life,

119
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,980
I could like you.

120
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,620
Chouyang,

121
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,220
why are you...

122
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,020
Why are you here?

123
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,260
Your brother asked you to come here.

124
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,980
What did you give my brother?

125
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,380
It's been hundreds of years.

126
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,420
I'm not here to see you.

127
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,420
I'm here to see you.

128
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,900
I've never heard my brother say

129
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,980
he likes a woman.

130
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,540
Who are you?

131
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,620
Remember,

132
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,780
Shi Yehua can't tell Changsheng and Yingying

133
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,260
or let them know

134
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,420
you're a wild girl.

135
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,020
I...

136
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,460
Who am I?

137
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,500
I...

138
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,700
I'm your sister-in-law.

139
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,300
You...

140
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,540
You're not my sister-in-law.

141
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,940
What sister-in-law?

142
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,260
I'm not.

143
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,900
My brother won't...

144
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,820
Brother,

145
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,540
you've been a brother for so many years.

146
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,100
It's not easy to get you out of this.

147
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,100
Why are you

148
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,460
now having someone with you?

149
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,980
You don't understand him.

150
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,180
I'm enough if my brother has me.

151
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,820
I can't do it.

152
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,140
And Yingying.

153
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,140
Why do you want to be with me?

154
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:31,900
Changsheng,

155
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,140
listen to me.

156
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,060
Listen to me.

157
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,740
The family's company

158
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,100
is different from the woman's.

159
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,660
Let's go and drink with her.

160
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,780
You won't change me.

161
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,580
Who won't change?

162
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,260
Let's go.

163
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,420
Well,

164
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,460
I'm going to get my husband.

165
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,340
What's wrong?

166
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,260
You'll need to drink by yourself.

167
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,060
I don't need to drink by myself.

168
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:05,780
But...

169
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,900
Who's in the West?

170
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,940
His face.

171
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,220
He has a lot of mouth.

172
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,900
Although he saved me,

173
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,380
I also helped him to raise flowers.

174
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,580
We're

175
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,940
different.

176
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,420
Why does he always treat me like that?

177
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,100
I'm telling you.

178
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,060
Why did he go to sleep?

179
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,620
Heucian Hospital

180
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,020
Yang Hua

181
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,580
who found a warm place in Yang Hua's grave.

182
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,460
Why did he go there?

183
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,540
Don't say that.

184
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,060
You're quite like his 싶iness.

185
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,580
Do you think

186
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,180
Why didn't you say you liked me?

187
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,260
Why?

188
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,260
Why did you have to

189
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,380
marry me

190
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,020
after you broke up with me?

191
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,100
Listen,

192
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,700
if you do this to me again,

193
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,180
I...

194
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,340
I won't live if I can't hit you.

195
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,700
I won't suffer from this

196
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,060
and suffer from this.

197
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:32,940
OK.

198
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,020
Why are you here?

199
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,260
Would I just add some water prescribed?

200
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,660
Why are you angry?

201
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,700
Besides, you're not...

202
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,620
You said this morning

203
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,420
that you liked me as a fake.

204
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,660
You're lying.

205
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,300
Since you don't like me,

206
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,980
I'll drink with a man.

207
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,300
It's none of your business.

208
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,540
I'll leave now.

209
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,100
Okay.

210
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,020
You're leaving.

211
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,140
What's the cost?

212
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,060
Yes.

213
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,860
You don't like me anyway.

214
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,860
I won't love you anymore.

215
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,760
I must go now.

216
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:14,020
Why do I meet you suddenly?

217
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,540
I'm like the person in life

218
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,100
That I remember

219
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:28,320
Hard feelings

220
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,080
I've wasted our time

221
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,640
How can I work?

222
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:11,640
There is light and tears

223
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,640
This world is full of colors

224
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,640
You are only a rain drop

225
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:25,640
Even if it's a farewell, it's a life and death song

226
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,640
How can it be
