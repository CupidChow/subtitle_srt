YoYo English Channel YouTube

4
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yingying

5
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yingying

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Brother Zhuang Yang

7
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Fortunately

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I am waiting for you

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
How did you become like this

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Mao Xieci

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
He turned my face like this

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
He also lied to me

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
He took Jin Nanxing away

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Where is Nanxing?

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Where is Nanxing?

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't know

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I will take you to the hospital

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yingying

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yingying

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Sorry

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I was too worried

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If I could go back to when I was a kid

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yingying

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yingying

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yingying

26
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You have become an ordinary person

27
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Chong Yang

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What does it feel to see someone you care about leave you

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Now you finally understand

30
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You killed Yingying

31
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yes

32
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Where is Nanxing?

33
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Don't worry

34
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
She is alive now

35
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But when she dies

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I can't guarantee

37
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Meng Xieci

38
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Why did you do this

39
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't know

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't know

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't know

42
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Why did you do this

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You are asking me why

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Because of Hua Ling

45
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Because I didn't save her three years ago

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You blame me

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I shouldn't blame you

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
My Meng family has served you for generations

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Even the first one in the ancestral training is that you Chongyang's order is higher than everything

50
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Including the lives of our Meng family

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Even the lives of my family

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I have done it for generations

53
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I am no exception

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But you

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I only asked you this time

56
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You saved my wife's life

57
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But you said you couldn't save her

58
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I can't save her

59
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The Yongye clan

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Can't awaken people who have lost consciousness

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Even if you force her to wake up

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
She didn't think about her life

63
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Would you like to see Hua Ling like that

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
So what

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
She is stronger than a cold corpse

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Now

67
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Even the corpse

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What did you say

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
How is Hua Ling

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
She left

71
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Where is Jin Nanxing

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Did you make a mistake on Jin Nanxing

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's right

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yan Yan

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The body of a girl is the best container of foreign countries

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The missing girl at the top of the mountain

77
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's all you, right

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Correct

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I should have been there

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
When I was looking for that token

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I doubted you

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Pity

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You trust me too much

84
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Xizi

85
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Why do you say

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We will become like this

87
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Chongyang

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You are too naive

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Do you think I will still be like before

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
To be your brother

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I want you to be like me

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Lose your lover and suffer for a lifetime

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Then I will ask you one last time

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Nanxing

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You used to have a brother

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Zhu Ying Ying

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Now why are you the only one left

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Like a dog in a dead family

99
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Meng Xi Ci

100
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Where is Jin Nanxing

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Chongyang

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Do you think I don't know

103
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You are just like me now

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Are you an ordinary person

105
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Is it really easy for you to kill me now

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You are really not afraid of the sun

107
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
As long as you tell me

108
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Where is Jin Nanxing

109
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What do you want me to do

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I promise you

111
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
it is good

112
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
In this case

113
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Then break your wish

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I will do it

115
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Chongyang

116
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Chongyang

117
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Chongyang, you go quickly

118
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Don't come

119
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Nanxing

120
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Nanxing

121
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Nanxing

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Chongyang

123
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Chongyang, what's wrong with you

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You go quickly

125
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's okay

126
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Meng Xi Ci told me

127
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
In your body

128
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Bones have been removed

129
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The insect has gone out of my body

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
But the flower spirit did not come back

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Chongyang, don't stand here

132
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You go quickly

133
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm fine

134
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Meng Xi Ci killed Yun Ying

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
He is crazy

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I know

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I know everything

138
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Chongyang

139
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Chongyang

140
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Chongyang

141
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Chongyang

142
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What's wrong with you

143
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Don't waste your energy

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
If it was before

145
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
This chain is for you

146
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's not a threat at all

147
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But now

148
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Don't talk about iron chains

149
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm afraid you can't even pull a rope

150
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Meng Xi Ci

151
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What do you know

152
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Chongyang

153
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What does he mean by this

154
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Nanxing

155
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You don't know yet

156
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Chongyang

157
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Is dying

158
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Meng Xi Ci

159
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't talk

160
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It seems that the old god

161
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't want you to die so easily

162
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Chongyang

163
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What does he mean by this

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Aren't you from the Youyue tribe

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Won't the Youyue tribe die

166
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Chongyang

167
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You didn't expect it, did you

168
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I actually know

169
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The secret of the stone flower

170
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Just when you were seriously injured

171
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I guessed it when I came to me

172
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Stone flower

173
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What's wrong with the stone flower

174
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Chongyang

175
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You can't bear to tell him even this

176
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
OK, let me tell you

177
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Then let me tell you

178
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Don't want to drink

179
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Suddenly

180
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The year is like a person who is lost

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Lock the door of memory

182
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Eternal promise

183
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I lost you

184
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
How to balance

185
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,000
How to bear to be broken

186
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The more you want to try hard not to get close

187
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The more painful it is

188
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Every snow flower is like you

189
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Let time pass

190
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The fire in the sky

191
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Embrace that moment

192
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Tears fall

193
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
This world is all colors

194
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You only belong to me

195
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Even if it's separation

196
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's a life and death song

197
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So what
