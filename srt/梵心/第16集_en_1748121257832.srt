1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,580
All my bad dreams

2
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,100
Shoulder is tight, or object is tighter

3
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,640
You need rot and suffer

4
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,300
I love you, I'm loudly

5
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,880
Creatureiers of the whole new world

6
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,540
Let me cover your mistakes

7
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,960
Give you a red candy

8
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,720
Terrible, thHHHalак

9
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,320
Isal is magic

10
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,960
And i only used up all the éléments

11
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,700
I was the ذ specializeer

12
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:05,060
Don't worry, the fit man is falling.

13
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:05,260
Please do not have Guo'ai

14
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,900
because of your love for me.

15
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,980
Don't trot, like a flower

16
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:24,600
Chongyang!

17
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,820
Why are you here?

18
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,700
What are you doing?

19
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,660
Gu Changsheng, where are you?

20
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,020
You're here to kill yourself.

21
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,020
Gu Changsheng.

22
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,180
Gu Changsheng.

23
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,380
Gu Changsheng.

24
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,060
Where are you?

25
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,140
Tuoyang.

26
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,620
Where are you?

27
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,540
Will he like this?

28
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,460
Where's Nanxing?

29
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,260
My ability is getting worse.

30
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,140
I can't feel Nanxing's breath.

31
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,700
He won't be in danger.

32
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,380
I have to find him.

33
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,780
Go.

34
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,620
Gu Changsheng.

35
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,260
Come out.

36
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,580
Brother.

37
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,540
Where's Nanxing?

38
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,300
How do I know?

39
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,060
He's with you all day.

40
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,700
You don't know who knows.

41
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,180
Brother.

42
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,740
You're suspecting me because of that woman.

43
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,980
You don't believe me?

44
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,820
I know you because I suspect you.

45
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,940
Where's Nanxing?

46
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,900
If I don't tell you,

47
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,100
how can you kill me?

48
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,220
Kill me?

49
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,060
Brother.

50
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,740
Our Yongye Clan won't die.

51
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,780
Unless

52
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,180
someone gets killed by Shi Yehua secretly.

53
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,100
So,

54
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,980
you really hid Nanxing?

55
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,820
It's me.

56
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,420
Let me ask you again.

57
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,780
Where's Nanxing?

58
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:12,780
Brother.

59
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,740
I don't want you to die.

60
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,260
I want you to live forever.

61
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,660
Gu Changsheng.

62
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,900
It's right here for us to jump through the safe hallway with Jinummy.

63
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,940
No, the Gang need a helping hand.

64
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:39,860
Sleep tight.

65
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,580
Zitao.

66
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,300
Go back to your room.

67
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,380
It won't work.

68
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,180
If it doesn't work now,

69
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,340
we're no longer family.

70
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,300
What's called a long lost family human relationship.

71
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,180
Talk about a long lost family human relationship.

72
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,180
Mom.

73
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,100
Chu Yao...

74
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,380
Chu Yao, where are you?

75
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,940
ностью!

76
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,580
Nanxing!

77
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,660
Why did Gu Changsheng treat me like this?

78
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,620
What did I do wrong?

79
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,300
Nanxing!

80
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,340
Nanxing!

81
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,620
Where are you?

82
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:55,900
Chongyang!

83
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,220
Chongyang!

84
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,460
Chongyang, I'm here!

85
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:00,980
Nanxing!

86
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,980
Chongyang!

87
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,180
I'm so scared!

88
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,660
Why are we here?

89
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,420
Because it's quieter here.

90
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,660
Chongyang,

91
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,260
I'm so scared

92
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,540
if you're not by my side.

93
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,780
Chongyang,

94
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,140
I'll kill you again.

95
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,220
違う

96
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,340
actions

97
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,540
You're awake.

98
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,260
What?

99
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,220
Oh?

100
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,100
You didn't promise to come here for a while,

101
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,020
right?

102
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,940
Now you still want us to go too?

103
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,620
Why not?

104
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,940
Isn't it the same as it was by far?

105
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,860
I tend to feel shy.

106
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,020
Because of you?

107
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,580
and let me down.

108
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:03,940
Chongyang.

109
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,260
Thank you.

110
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,300
You saved my life,

111
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,660
and made me experience

112
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,020
the life of happiness

113
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,300
that I've never had.

114
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,420
I should thank you.

115
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,140
A thousand years ago,

116
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,420
I've been living in the dark.

117
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,220
Your appearance

118
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,140
is the light of my darkness.

119
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,780
I'm worried that I'll regret it.

120
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,940
I don't want to die.

121
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,380
I'd rather be the lonely one

122
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,980
who can bear to live forever.

123
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,380
Not only would I want to live anować

124
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,020
my life with you.

125
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,540
I'm not afraid of the world.

126
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,540
I'm afraid of the world.

127
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,540
I'm not afraid of the world.

128
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,540
I'm not afraid of the world.

129
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,540
I'm not afraid of the world.

130
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,540
I'm not afraid of the world.

131
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,540
I'm not afraid of the world.

132
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,540
I'm not afraid of the world.

133
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,540
I'm not afraid of the world.

134
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,540
I'm not afraid of the world.

135
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,540
I'm not afraid of the world.

136
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,540
I'm not afraid of the world.

137
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,540
I'm not afraid of the world.

138
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,540
I'm not afraid of the world.

139
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,540
Don't tell me.

140
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,540
Your teacher will tell.

141
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,540
I'm afraid of the world

142
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,540
I'm afraid of the world.

143
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,540
I'm not afraid of the world.

144
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:12,540
Director 탡东

145
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,900
Every piece of snow flower is like you asking me

146
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,660
Let time pass by

147
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,180
The fire of the sky

148
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,580
Embrace that moment

149
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,860
The tears of the light

150
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,740
This world is full of colors

151
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,220
You only belong to me

152
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,360
Even if our relationship is separate

153
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,140
What should we do?
