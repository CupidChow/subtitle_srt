1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,100
Don't know what I'm talking about

2
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,920
A veteran's soldier

3
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,640
Don't care what the future holds

4
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,420
I'll put you through all Dear

5
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,700
What is love and what is lack

6
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,680
Give that Mrs. You can't let the magic flow

7
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,080
March and I aren't leaning toward the bright future

8
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,360
And I'll follow you

9
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,240
To the place I turn

10
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:04,800
It was a despair in the throwsai

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,680
Though my and love do not have a flower

12
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,240
If you do not want it to last

13
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,040
Episode 17

14
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,060
No.

15
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,060
Hey,

16
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,720
it's you that

17
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,740
Update princess Chongyang's

18
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,680
maid.

19
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,320
You...

20
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,340
Why the hell you don't know how to be vocal?

21
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,340
Embroidery?

22
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,180
What is it?

23
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,620
Tell me.

24
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,820
It smells good, Yang Yang.

25
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,780
Have you made dinner?

26
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,500
What are you doing here?

27
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,580
You think this is your home?

28
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,740
This...

29
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,780
Is not it?

30
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,740
Who allowed you to be here?

31
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,060
Get out of here.

32
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,820
Our home doesn't welcome you.

33
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,460
I don't need your welcome.

34
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,780
As long as Brother Chong Yang welcomes me,

35
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,460
I won't cook for you.

36
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,300
You...

37
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,180
Take these things with you.

38
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,340
Get out of here.

39
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,860
I'm not leaving.

40
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,820
I'll be working hard for the whole morning.

41
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,500
Why do you have to be so loyal to me?

42
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,260
Besides,

43
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,460
we will live in the same house in the future.

44
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,340
We will learn to live together.

45
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,580
Who allowed you to live with us?

46
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,420
This house doesn't have your room.

47
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:57,780
It's okay.

48
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,100
I don't care.

49
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,980
I can live with Brother Chong Yang.

50
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:06,340
Enough.

51
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,100
Don't be angry.

52
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:07,820
Have a taste.

53
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,540
I've been cooking for a whole morning.

54
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,500
Who's sweating?

55
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,660
Who knows

56
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,180
if you'll poison inside.

57
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,780
I've been found out.

58
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,500
If I really poison inside,

59
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,580
will you drink it?

60
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,420
Drink it.

61
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,780
I'm not afraid of poison.

62
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,700
Then drink it.

63
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,900
It's sweet.

64
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,260
What is this?

65
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,820
It's...

66
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,740
Red sugar water.

67
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,420
Red sugar?

68
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,140
No, it's not.

69
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,220
Miss Chu.

70
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,140
Do you want some red sugar water?

71
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,180
Jin Nanxiu.

72
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,500
Recently, my body has become weaker.

73
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,500
It's getting more and more painful for me.

74
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,060
I even lost my strength in the garden.

75
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,180
It seems that I've lost my last breath.

76
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,380
It's getting closer.

77
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,420
You're here to hide here?

78
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,820
I was supposed to cook for you.

79
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,660
Changsheng and Yingying have made you angry again?

80
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,740
It's okay.

81
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,540
In fact, every day

82
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,420
is a good day.

83
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,580
In the past,

84
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,700
I was on a boat alone

85
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,300
to the south of the river.

86
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,900
I've seen a lot of beautiful scenery.

87
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,540
Unfortunately, no one told me.

88
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,460
Now,

89
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,380
you and them are with me.

90
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,740
I don't have to feel lonely anymore.

91
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,620
So...

92
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,140
So I want to stay with you forever.

93
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,100
What forever?

94
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,380
I'll stick to you forever.

95
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,100
I'm afraid

96
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,940
I can't stay with you for the rest of my life.

97
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,380
You're the one who's been with me.

98
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,900
I just want you to be a flower.

99
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,060
You're not

100
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,420
anything to me.

101
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,420
Drink it forever.

102
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,900
It's like a,â€‹

103
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,460
as if

104
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,420
everything we've happened

105
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,880
is nothing to me.

106
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,500
Don't you like me at all?

107
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,900
My memories...

108
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,960
They're always like this.

109
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,060
The more I think about it, the harder it is to get close to it.

110
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,660
The more I feel pain, the more I think about it.

111
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:35,060
Every snow flower is like you and me.

112
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,860
Let time pass by.

113
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,460
The sky is full of light and fire.

114
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,860
The eternity is there.

115
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,060
The flowers are falling.

116
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,860
All these moments are written.

117
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,060
I thought Xiyin's hometown was the Zouyan Flower of Jinanxing.

118
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:04,060
Now it seems that Xiyin's hometown is not Zouyan Flower,

119
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,260
but the person of Jinanxing.

120
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,260
Then let's catch Jinanxing now.

121
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,460
Maybe he is the daughter of the family who has been looking for him.

122
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,460
It's not that easy.

123
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,860
He has a relationship with Chongyang.

124
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:23,660
Chongyang doesn't say it, but he treats Jinanxing differently.

125
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,460
Now that you have caught Jinanxing,

126
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,660
you are not making me go up.

127
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,860
The family is wise.

128
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,860
But since Chongyang is so fond of Jinanxing,

129
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:37,660
you can use this woman.

130
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,460
Yes. Then I'll go down first.

131
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,860
Jinanxing, are you really a Yan woman?

132
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,460
Only Yan women can be hardworking.

133
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,060
I always thought Yan women is just a legend.

134
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,860
For thousands of years, no one has seen a Yan woman.

135
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,860
Hua Ling, you saved me.

136
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,860
Tomorrow.

137
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,060
Little.

138
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,860
You let me kill you, not just indulge you,

139
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,060
you want to tell me it's not about anything,

140
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,060
now on our lives.

141
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,660
I've been stayed too much love.

142
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,260
I thought I've been through so much with you,

143
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,060
but the iron can good deed.

144
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,300
Attendant Jin.

145
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,780
Go upstairs and have a look.

146
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,140
Stand by the window,

147
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,940
Let me go.

148
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,700
Cheers to Nan,

149
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,140
you have driven me away.

150
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,740
So you move here?

151
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,260
Yes.

152
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,380
Miss Zhu,

153
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,780
You're here to buy flowers?

154
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,300
Jinan Xing,

155
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,900
you're the one who took a boat

156
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,700
and jumped from the sea.

157
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,060
It's really hard.

158
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,980
Why did you care about me today?

159
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,580
I didn't care about you.

160
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,300
I just understand

161
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,420
why you've been talking about Brother Chongyang.

162
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,100
Then tell me, Miss Zhu,

163
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,060
why do I keep on holding him?

164
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,580
How much money

165
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,740
can you sell for your entire life?

166
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,660
You just care about Brother Chongyang's career

167
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,260
and his unreachable wealth, right?

168
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,700
Miss Zhu,

169
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,420
you're so smart.

170
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,020
But no matter how rich Brother Chongyang is,

171
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,500
how much money can he give you?

172
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,980
This money

173
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,260
needs your 100 songs tightly documented.

174
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,580
I'm so sure

175
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,180
of thisHarvest my 100 songs.

176
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,620
Where you're going,

177
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,860
I'm not going to leave Nan'an City

178
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,780
and won't ever near Brother Chongyang again.

179
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,820
I'm not sure.

180
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,500
Ms. Zhu,

181
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,380
I think what you said

182
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,820
makes sense.

183
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,420
But,

184
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,700
my goal

185
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,420
is not to let 100 people know,

186
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,740
but to let 1000 people know.

187
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,260
In the future,

188
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,900
there might be 10,000 people.

189
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,780
You...

190
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,300
Can you give it to her?

191
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,780
Ji Nansheng,

192
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,780
why are you so greedy?

193
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,860
People

194
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,380
are not greedy.

195
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,540
Besides,

196
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,940
if I'm with Chuang,

197
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,140
how many boats do I want?

198
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,020
Do I even care about your money?

199
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:11,980
You...

200
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,300
You think...

201
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,420
You think Brother Chuang really likes you?

202
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,700
He's playing with you every day.

203
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,620
He'll throw you away.

204
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,620
You can't even get a penny.

205
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,180
Then you'd better pray to him to get rid of him.

206
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,620
Otherwise,

207
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,620
you'd have to be angry for the rest of your life.

208
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,420
Ji Nansheng,

209
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,740
let me ask you one last time.

210
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,300
Are you leaving Nan'an City or not?

211
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,660
I'm not leaving.

212
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,860
Nan'an City is not your home.

213
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,740
Don't say you're rushing me away.

214
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,860
I'm not leaving even if Chongyang is.

215
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,460
I've been waiting for so long.

216
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,580
Wait for me.

217
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,740
What can I do?
