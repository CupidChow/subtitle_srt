1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
All the pain is my own

2
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,000
The disease of the past is the fire of the future

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,500
You can't live without death

4
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,000
Love is for you to be loyal to me

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll kill my life

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,500
I'm a desert, love is a sea of fire

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,000
Give you a red-egg humor

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Can you remember me

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The wind is the clear river

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And I'm just a free-range

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'll follow you to my place

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The lucky wish is falling

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And the happy wish is not to be broken

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Love is like a flower, can't stop the fall

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Master, is Chou Yang alright?

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Take care of her

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Well...

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Make sure the curtains are closed tomorrow

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Don't let any sun shine on her

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And she has a light taste

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You should be careful when you cook

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Master, I think you and Master Chong Yang

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You know each other quite well

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Stop talking nonsense

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Maybe he did

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Since he saw Hua Ling die

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He only hates her

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The golden bone is not ready yet

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Don't break it for now

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yes

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Master Chong Yang

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Master said you need to rest

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm tired from lying in bed

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I want to take a walk

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You don't have to follow me

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Why is there such a dark place in Meng's family?

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Hua Ling

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Hua Ling

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Why is Hua Ling here?

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
These three years

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Xi Ci wanted Hua Ling to wake up

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Didn't she wake up Hua Ling?

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Mr. Chong Yang

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm sorry

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I didn't mean to disturb you

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm sorry

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm sorry

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm sorry

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm sorry

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm sorry

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm sorry

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Mr. Chong Yang

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Xi Ci

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What's going on?

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
This is Hua Ling

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You don't know her

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Of course I know this is Hua Ling

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Hua Ling has been in a coma for three years

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Are you still looking for a way to save her?

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
She's fine

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
She's just asleep

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Xi Ci

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's been three years

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You still can't let go

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If it's your lover

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You can let go in three years

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
If something happens to Ji Nan Xing

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Will you still die in a dream?

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Meng Xi Ci

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Don't be angry

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm just kidding

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Now with your protection

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What accident can she have?

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Xi Ci

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll give you one last chance

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You can wake her up

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But don't do anything you regret

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll give you one last chance

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Regret

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
How can I regret it?

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
As long as I can wake Ling'er up

83
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm willing to do anything

84
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Gu Chang Sheng is not here

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Zhu Yin Yin is not here

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So boring

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
If I knew this would happen

88
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I would have gone back to the boat

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Cheng Yang

90
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You're back

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What did you do these days?

92
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I miss you so much

93
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Sorry

94
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm late

95
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What is this?

96
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This is the gift I prepared for you

97
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I don't know if you'll like it

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I like everything you give me

99
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So beautiful

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Why did you make a pink flower?

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I like it

102
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I like it

103
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I like it

104
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I like it

105
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Pink flower

106
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Pink represents you

107
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Blue represents me

108
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I didn't expect you to be happy with girls

109
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This is my first time

110
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
To be with a girl

111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm sorry

112
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Then you can only be with me in the future

113
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Memories are piled up

114
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm not the one you can't see

115
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Missing you like a knife

116
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Your face is like a knife

117
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
All of them are my regret

118
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
A thousand diseases, a lot of trouble

119
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You can't live without death

120
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Love is for you, love me

121
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'll kill my life

122
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm a shark, I'm a shark

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That night

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Are you satisfied?

125
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Let me help you remember

126
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Who came to love me

127
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Who passed away because of you

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The moon will shine forever

129
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Never be weak again

130
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
See the wind is the clear river

131
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And I'm the only one who's not afraid

132
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm only following you

133
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm the only one who's not afraid

134
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The last wish is to fall

135
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And the last wish is to fall

136
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Love is like a flower, can't stop falling

137
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Master, Madam was found by Lord Chongyang

138
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Will he bother you?

139
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm sorry

140
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm sorry

141
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm sorry

142
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm sorry

143
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm sorry

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm sorry

145
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm sorry

146
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm sorry

147
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm sorry

148
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm sorry

149
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm sorry

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Master

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
He can't even protect himself

152
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Where can he live?

153
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
By the way

154
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Is there anything else in Ye Gongguan?

155
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Gu Changsheng hasn't been back to Ye Gongguan for a long time

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Zhu Yingying has been staying in Ye Gongguan all the time

157
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Didn't come out

158
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It seems that Zhu Yingying hasn't made a move

159
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
In the days of calculation

160
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The bones I planted on Jinan Xing

161
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Will be out of stock soon

162
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We met by chance

163
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The yearning is like a person who is lost

164
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Locking the door of memory

165
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The eternal promise

166
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I lost you

167
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
How to make up

168
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The strange pain that has never been broken

169
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The more I want to try, the more I can't get close

170
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The more painful it is

171
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Every snowflake is like you

172
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Let time stop

173
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The fire in the sky

174
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Embrace that moment

175
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The tears of the yellow river

176
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
This world is all colors

177
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You only belong to me

178
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Even if it's separation, it's a song of life and death

179
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So what

180
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I want to sing

181
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I want to sing

182
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I want to sing

183
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I want to sing

184
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I want to sing

185
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I want to sing

186
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I want to sing

187
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I want to sing

188
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I want to sing

189
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I want to sing
