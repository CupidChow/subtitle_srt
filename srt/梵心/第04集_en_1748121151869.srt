I'm afraid that I'll be lost

18
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,420
My body has become so weak.

19
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,420
Even such attacks will hurt me.

20
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,420
It seems that the Night Flower is about to bloom.

21
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,420
Have my wish finally come true?

22
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,420
What are you doing?

23
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,420
I just want to ask you for a favor.

24
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,420
I don't need it.

25
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,420
Our Yan-Lv blood can help you recover your wounds.

26
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,420
I...

27
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,420
You...

28
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,420
Go away.

29
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,420
Go.

30
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,420
I...

31
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,420
Go away.

32
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,420
I...

33
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,420
Go away.

Episode 1

35
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,420
What are you doing?

36
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,420
I'm keeping you in my arms.

37
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,420
I'm going to sleep.

38
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:31,420
I'm afraid that I'll be lost in the sea of hope.

39
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,420
Are you okay?

40
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,420
I'm fine.

41
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,420
Who is she?

42
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,420
You mean that girl?

43
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,420
Her name is Tao Chuan.

44
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,420
I heard that she went to find the Love by the Sea of Hope.

45
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,420
She disappeared.

46
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,420
I don't know why she came to me.

47
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,420
She even said that she wanted my face.

48
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,420
Love?

49
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,420
Recently, a man in Nan'an sent a love letter.

50
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,420
He said that if he ate the man he liked,

51
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,420
he would follow her to his death.

52
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,420
Is there really love?

53
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,420
I've been in love for so many years.

54
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,420
I've never heard of love.

55
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,420
But all the girls in the world believe that.

56
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,420
I heard that the girls who went to find the love

57
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,420
have disappeared for the past few years.

58
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,420
They have disappeared?

59
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:35,420
Maybe the love is on the cliff.

60
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,420
I don't know.

61
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,420
But Tao Chuan is really passionate

62
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,420
for the Meng family.

63
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,420
Meng family?

64
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,420
Meng family?

65
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,420
I'll go see her body.

66
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,420
Did she get into trouble?

67
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,420
I've never seen her.

68
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,420
Then why did she disappear?

69
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,420
Or did she not die?

70
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,420
If she didn't die,

71
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,420
would she have disappeared so quietly?

72
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,420
This...

73
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,420
Have a good rest.

74
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,420
I'll find someone to check.

75
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,420
You just stay here alone?

76
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,420
I dare not stay alone.

77
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,420
What if she comes back?

78
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,420
What do you want?

79
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,420
I'll go to your house.

80
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,420
There's no other room here.

81
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,420
You can sleep on the sofa.

82
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,420
Okay.

83
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,420
I'm talking about the living room.

84
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,420
No.

85
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,420
I dare not sleep alone.

86
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,420
If you don't want me to sleep on your sofa,

87
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,420
I'll sleep on your bed.

88
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,420
You...

89
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,420
I'm telling you.

90
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,420
Don't bully me.

91
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,420
If you hurt me,

92
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,420
you'll have to take care of me.

93
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,420
Mr.

94
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,420
Mr.

95
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,420
Xisi,

96
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,420
I know

97
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,420
you've been in love with her for years.

98
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,420
But what happened to Miss Taochun?

99
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,420
Mr.

100
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,420
Don't beat me up.

101
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,420
Miss Taochun

102
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,420
has been in contact with me

103
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,420
for several times.

104
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,420
But I don't know

105
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,420
the situation.

106
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,420
It's strange.

107
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,420
Go and check on her.

108
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,420
Yes.

109
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,420
Xisi,

110
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,420
you're in charge of the clinic alone.

111
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,420
You still want to take care of me.

112
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,420
You've been working hard these years.

113
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,420
Mr.

114
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,420
What are you talking about?

115
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,420
The Meng family is in charge of the royal family.

116
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,420
They're taking care of you.

117
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,420
This is what Xisi should do.

118
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,420
By the way, Xisi,

119
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,420
should it be the day of the flower forest?

120
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,420
She's not dead.

121
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,420
She's just lost her mind.

122
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,420
I didn't save her.

123
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,420
I have my reasons.

124
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,420
You should know that.

125
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,420
I hope you won't be caught off guard.

126
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,420
You're right.

127
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,420
I believe she'll wake up.

128
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,420
Mr.

129
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,420
I won.

130
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,420
Good luck.

131
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,420
Mr. Chunyang.

132
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,420
Save the flower forest, Mr. Chunyang.

133
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,420
I can't save her.

134
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,420
Xisi,

135
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,420
I advise you to live and die.

136
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,420
Don't force yourself.

137
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,420
Don't force yourself.

138
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,420
Mr. Chunyang,

139
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,420
did you ask for your life

140
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,420
for so many years?

141
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,420
Save the flower forest.

142
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,420
I beg you.

143
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,420
Xisi,

144
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,420
I can't help you.

145
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,420
Mr. Chunyang,

146
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,420
don't go, Mr. Chunyang.

147
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,420
Mr. Chunyang,

148
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,420
please save the flower forest.

149
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,420
Mr. Chunyang,

150
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,420
please save the flower forest.

151
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,420
I beg you.

152
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,420
I don't want to die.

153
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,420
I don't want to die.

154
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,420
I don't want to die.

155
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,420
I don't want to die.

00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,420

I don't want to die.

165
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,420
I don't want to die.

166
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,420

00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,420
I don't want to die.

168
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,420
I don't want to die.

169
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,420
I don't want to die.

170
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,420
I don't want to die.

171
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,420
I don't want to die.

172
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,420
I don't want to die.

00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,420

192
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,420
I lost you.

193
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,420
How could I ever

194
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:13,420
That I've neverSorry

195
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,420
The more I want to never談

196
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,420
The greater my pain

197
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,540
Every lyrics you 응

198
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:36,540
Let time be light, the sky is dark

199
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:44,540
Embrace the moment, the light is falling

200
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,540
This world is full of colors

201
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,540
You only belong to me

202
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,540
Even if it's a farewell, it's a song of life and death

203
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,540
What can I do?
