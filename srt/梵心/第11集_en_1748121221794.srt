我只是你去我 Rich, life will be tight

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,320
How long do you have to wait for the flower to bloom?

5
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,560
Before I die,

6
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,640
you must bloom.

7
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,880
It turns out that death is not so terrible.

8
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,240
Because I know what love is.

9
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,760
It's almost late.

10
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,480
Don't worry.

11
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,520
You need to destroy your heart!

12
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,960
Besides,

13
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,560
I am your husband.

14
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,120
It's okay.

15
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,880
Stop it!

16
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,680

17
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,000
Let's go, Brother Yan!

18
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,920
I...

19
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,000
You're a grown-up now.

20
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,400
You don't like me anyway.

21
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,200
I'm not in your eyes.

00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,400
Why have you saved me again?

25
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,720
Aren't you don't like me?

26
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,600
Are you not like me

27
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,440
while I'm waiting for you to appear again

28
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,160
without saving me?

29
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,600
I still thought

30
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,560
Oh, no.

31
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,540
La La

32
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,500
Sorry.

33
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,480
I just realized,

34
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,640
I lie only

35
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,340

thought

48
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,700
because the endless life

49
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,500
is the way God gives us.

50
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,180
Now it seems

51
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,140
the way God gives us

52
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,660
the way the Yongye Clan is is far from that.

53
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,100
You have

54
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,540
a special ability

55
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,700
that ordinary people can never have in their lives.

56
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,820
Life and youth

57
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,700
will naturally

58
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,900
make you pay a small price.

59
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,340
Naturally.

60
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,420
But now,

61
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,700
I don't know why

62
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,060
my strength is slowly disappearing.

63
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,260
My ability

64
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,900
is slowly disappearing.

65
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,220
That's because

66
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,660
you're getting closer to death.

67
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,340
Your body

68
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,180
is becoming more like an ordinary person.

69
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,660
In the end, even the sun won't be afraid of you.

70
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,220
Do you think

71
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,220
this is good or bad?

72
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,820
I will let you live

73
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,860
but I can't let you love me.

74
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,380
Because

75
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,580
I can't be with you forever.

76
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,500
Thank you.

77
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,100
I knew it.

78
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,260
I was so angry.

79
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,780
Miss Lanxin.

80
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,500
Mr. Meng.

81
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,220
Come in.

82
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,700
Mr. Meng,

83
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,900
why are you here?

84
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,940
I have something to do.

85
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,900
I heard that your room is nearby.

86
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,100
I came here to check it out.

87
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,820
By the way, Mr. Meng,

88
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,900
the dinner you want is ready.

89
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,260
I'll send someone to your house.

90
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,060
No rush.

91
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,700
I just came here to check it out.

92
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,900
Your room is so beautiful.

93
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,900
I have to rely on myself.

94
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,220
And I like painting too.

95
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,700
Mr. Meng,

96
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,380
come in and have some tea.

97
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,100
Okay.

98
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,860
Mr. Meng,

99
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,860
I'm sorry.

100
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,060
I have a lot of flowers in my room.

101
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,780
So I have to work more.

102
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,060
It's okay.

103
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,140
Mr. Meng,

104
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,060
I don't have any good tea here.

105
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,700
Have some first.

106
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,500
Miss Lanxin, you're welcome.

107
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,820
Miss Lanxin has always been a dream.

108
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,580
Her parents are not around.

109
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,660
My parents died.

110
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,380
I have only one daughter.

111
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,980
My parents died early.

112
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,820
I have only one daughter left.

113
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,700
Miss Lanxin's family

114
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,700
died of a stroke of a heart disease?

115
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,940
I had an accident at the age of ten.

116
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,980
My parents died

117
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,860
because they wanted to save me.

118
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,100
Well,

119
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,020
Miss Lanxin's childhood accident

120
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,580
is so painful.

121
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,620
So I have to live a better life.

122
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,700
My parents gave me two lives.

123
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,620
I have to cherish them.

124
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,780
Miss Lanxin is alone outside.

125
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,900
She is a woman.

126
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,420
She is hard to find.

127
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,820
If you need anything,

128
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,820
come to Meng's Mansion to find me.

129
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,780
Thank you, Mr. Meng.

130
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,860
This is the newest snow flower cake in our clinic.

131
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,100
It's good for your health.

132
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,900
Miss Lanxin, don't worry.

133
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,340
Mr. Meng,

134
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:51,940
I...

135
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,540
I'm not taking the road.

136
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,900
You're being too polite.

137
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,940
I don't have much time.

138
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:57,900
Miss Lanxin,

139
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,100
take it.

140
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,300
Thank you, Mr. Meng.

141
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,580
It seems that I've been looking for

142
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,780
Yan Yu for years.

143
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,420
It's you.

144
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,580
You used your body to make gold bones.

145
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,100
You can survive.

146
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,620
I only want to sing this song.

147
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,940
How can I do it?
