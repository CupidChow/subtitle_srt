Love you

Early morning

Remember

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,140
In search of

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,860
Just

14
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,760
These

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,860
I want

Go

Isiasm is the magic of关酷

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,520
My heartbeat is like a dust of pine

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:16,960
I love how to slip away

21
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,280
Series 8

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,160
Sir.

23
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,280
I'm hungry.

24
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,020
Where is that woman?

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,600
How can she come out to cook?

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,600
He toxicity should be seen about the!*

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,980
An airborne

28
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,740
He is being good.

29
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,720
He is not popular.

30
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:35,900
So

31
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,900
it was terrible.

32
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,560
All of yang shi

33
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,640
Come back and cook for me.

34
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,640
I won't go.

35
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,920
You won't go?

36
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,720
OK!

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,480
Is it delicious?

38
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,600
It's delicious.

39
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,440
Well,

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,200
she's hungry.

41
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,320
She wants to invite you back for a meal.

42
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,160
You really treat me like a mother.

43
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,920
You asked me to cook for you.

44
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,520
This is...

45
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,600
Meng Xi gave it to you.

46
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,440
Yes.

47
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,440
She came to see you?

48
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,400
Yes.

49
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,560
Why did she come to see you?

50
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,200
What does it have to do with you?

51
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,320
Meng Xi.

52
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,560
You have only one girl.

53
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,320
What if she has any intention?

54
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,760
What intention?

55
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,560
I've been living in the wild.

56
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,080
I've lost everything except this boat.

57
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,840
I'm almost dead.

58
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,000
What can anyone do to me?

59
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,280
I don't want you to be too close to other men.

60
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,560
I do feel that

61
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,200
death is not good.

62
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,200
Maybe it's because I've lived too long

63
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,400
that I feel that everything in the world

64
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,000
is not so bitter,

65
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,440
annoying, and torturing.

66
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,360
So I feel that death

67
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,400
is not good.

68
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,080
I don't want to hear you say that.

69
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,040
You think that suffering, torturing, and torturing

70
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,880
are because you haven't had a real life?

71
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,560
A real life?

72
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,280
Yes.

73
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,760
Have you seen the play show?

74
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,440
Zhou Zhen.

75
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,040
Look at me!

76
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,240
You won't be able to beat me with a sword?

77
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,160
It's not what Iitates.

78
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,160
How is that connected?

79
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,280
Let's start first.

80
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,120
The game Kick and Kick is produced by playing row of 9.

81
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,960
There are 32 row of cards in total.

82
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,680
The scores are different for each row.

83
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,120
The way to win is also different.

84
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,080
Get ready.

85
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,600
My double beard has students.

86
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,760
Here I come.

87
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,000
My double hair brother

88
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,000
wins me again!

89
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,520
Xuan An,

90
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,600
you haven't won me

91
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,200
until now.

92
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,040
Single two four.

93
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,080
to earn a living.

94
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,520
How is it?

95
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,440
You're not too late to admit defeat.

96
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,400
What?

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,040
You can't come again.

98
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,520
You can't be greedy

99
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,960
when you're in a hurry.

100
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,720
But you've lived for so long.

101
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,840
I thought you've played everything.

102
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,480
I'll play chess.

103
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,320
chess?

104
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,600
It's good to play chess.

105
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,360
But there are too many fun things

106
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,440
in this world.

107
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,160
You're not good at it.

108
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,800
How do you know what you like?

109
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
It's just a game.

110
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,520
It's your turn to make it.

111
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:58,920
Forget it.

112
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,400
This game is not good.

113
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,800
Let's play the next one.

114
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,520
This is it.

115
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,920
Just look at it.

116
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,040
It won't help me.

117
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,560
No.

118
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,720
What are you doing?

119
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,880
You're making me angry.

120
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,320
This is a kind of ritual culture in the north.

121
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,360
It's better than the usual

122
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,360
dishes and meat on the grill.

123
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,960
Do you want to try it?

124
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,680
Try it.

125
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,480
Come on.

126
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,240
How is it?

127
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,560
It's good.

128
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,840
I'll make you some more.

129
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,440
You're so smart.

130
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,640
It's okay.

131
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,520
Try it.

132
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,160
I don't want to.

133
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:45,760
You eat it.

134
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,960
With a pear in it.

135
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,520
No.

136
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:53,920
You're no longer good,

137
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,160
you think I應該 speak foxes?

138
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,960
If it's vicinity or near to the이라고 in him,

139
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:58,760
could you

140
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,040
ball games it out?

141
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,960
You thought soft Hell will not use it.

142
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,800
No,

143
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,440
because of me

144
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,500
you were actually

145
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,840
a good friend and no nice doer.

146
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,520
So you promised that you wouldn't hide anything from me.

147
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,800
Then man,

148
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,360
you have a problem.

149
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,400
You can do it.

150
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,360
This is what every marriage requires.

151
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,440
What did she help you grow?

152
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,440
Brother Chaoyang,

153
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,600
I've been with you for so many years.

154
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,640
I can't even compare to a woman who comes from abroad.

155
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,440
Why does my face hurt again?

156
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,520
This is too much.

157
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,720
Do you know that

158
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,080
there are various kinds of food in this world?

159
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,680
Maybe you can't even eat well in your whole life.

160
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,320
You've been living alone for so long.

161
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,880
You've been living in the same place.

162
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,640
Don't you feel sorry for me?

163
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:57,960
How is it?

164
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,920
Do you think I'm right?

165
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,120
By the way,

166
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,560
have you seen the five-color snow flower?

167
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,280
There are five-color and six-color snow flowers in this world.

168
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,640
Of course.

169
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,400
Let's go.

170
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,600
Let's go.

171
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,840
Close your eyes.

172
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,440
Close them.

173
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,080
Listen to me.

174
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,600
Wait for me here.

175
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,080
Look.

176
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,840
Do you like it?

177
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,360
I do.

178
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,320
I knew you would like it.

179
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,600
I like you.

180
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,680
What did you say?

181
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,160
I said

182
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,920
I like you.

183
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,760
Lord Han?

184
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,280
Wait for me here.

185
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,200
Instructor.

186
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,440
Keep teaching me.

187
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,280
You're right.

188
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,640
This world has too many being nice.

189
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,640
I'm not feeling it.

190
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,000
being a chewy upper body

191
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,480
is because of you.

192
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,120
That I think

193
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,800
bitterocused

194
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,120
dream

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,160
looks much like our children's dream.

196
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,840
But you

197
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,240
are more

198
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,800
and better

00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,400

200
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,640
Chuyang,

201
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,840
are you...

202
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,840
Are you serious?

203
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,640
Didn't you drink too much?

204
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,640
You woke up the next day.

205
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
Are you still counting?

206
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,640
How can I be sad?
