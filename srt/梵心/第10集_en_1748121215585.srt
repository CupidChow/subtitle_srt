1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,120
The closer the distance, the worse it is

2
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,800
Your pose reflected the situation

3
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,520
Which prevents there being no shooting

4
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,240
Your love has melted you

5
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,700
My life is dead

6
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,080
I am a fool, I love beamaan

7
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,800
You know clearly what I can to show you

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,840
You will never regret

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,020
See your face proposal

10
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,640
But I will go only with you

11
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:07,280
Firstly, appreciate the love on the solitude

12
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,000
Secondly, stoked that you shouldn't love my life

13
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,920
Secondly, Mazes won't stopëŒ€

14
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,840
Episode 3

15
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,360
How long has it been since Master and I have had a drink at least?

16
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,240
If we drink traveling, it will make us relax?

17
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,760
Do you have any worries?

18
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,200
Of course, after you have a long life,

19
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,720
you will find

20
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,960
that there is nothing that can make you worry.

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,480
Except...

22
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,600
Except what?

23
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,280
Nothing.

24
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:58,680
Come in.

25
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:01,920
I won't NZ Good food.

26
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,280
But please don't leave

27
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,600
such a small place in the country.

28
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,880
You took all the quiet awareness

29
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,680
to see

30
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,800
that there could be no one

31
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,340
here

32
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
onapper Qaran.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,480
The camp has overwhelmed you.

34
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,440
Don't worry.

35
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,040
Brother, who are you?

36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,640
You're walking on the night road alone.

37
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,280
It's dangerous.

38
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,160
Where are you going?

39
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,680
Brother,

40
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,840
I'm just selling flowers.

41
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,600
I don't have money.

42
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,480
Who wants your money?

43
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,240
We can't leave the city.

44
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,400
You don't even want my life.

45
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,680
Don't worry.

46
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,360
We don't want your life.

47
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,760
But we're rich and rich.

48
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,160
As long as you leave Nan'an City,

49
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,400
you can't live without me.

50
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,520
You'll be saved.

51
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,520
I'm leaving.

52
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,560
Can you tell me

53
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,920
who asked you to come here?

54
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,040
You're a liar.

55
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,560
How dare you talk to us?

56
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,720
You don't believe me?

57
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,680
Xu Han.

58
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,600
You're making me angry.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,240
This girl

60
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
is really good-looking.

61
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,800
Brother,

62
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,480
do you want to...

63
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,400
Brother,

64
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,680
don't call me Brother.

65
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,880
Fine, just leave.

66
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,240
Brother.

67
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,960
Brother,

68
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,240
don't call me Brother.

69
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,880
Don't call me.

70
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,400
Such a pretty face.

71
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,800
It's a pity that I'm a flower.

72
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,240
You're laughing.

73
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,840
What's that sound?

74
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,400
Sound.

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,040
I didn't hear it.

76
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,000
It seems to be a memory.

77
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,400
Why do you tend to calendar the feelings and beg me for changes?

78
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,200
Who sent you here?

79
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,880
This girl.

80
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
Sounds like a rising star in GuchU.

81
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,560
Xintong.

82
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,400
Go.

83
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,400
Yes.

84
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,360
Brother.

85
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,880
Thank you, Mr. Meng.

86
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,680
Ms. Nanxin,

87
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,880
you should thank Mr. Chongyang.

88
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,600
He was listening to your call

89
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,760
when we were nearby.

90
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,280
That's why he brought me here to save you.

91
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,720
Thank you.

92
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,120
Thank you.

93
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,200
I have no objection to your kindness.

94
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,040
I should say thank you in a positive way.

95
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
Is that enough?

96
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,360
Say thank you in a positive way.

97
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
Is that enough?

98
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,480
Ms. Nanxin,

99
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,800
do you have any other injuries?

100
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,160
Do you want to check them out

101
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,280
in the first place?

102
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,360
It's okay, Mr. Meng.

103
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,920
I'm not hurt.

104
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,640
But

105
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,520
the two people just now

106
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,200
came here to help Yin Yin.

107
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
They want to force me to leave Nan'an.

108
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,520
Ms. Yin Yin,

109
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,480
you should leave now.

110
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,800
Why?

111
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,680
Then you should ask him.

112
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,680
I'll find Yin Yin to ask him about this.

113
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,360
You'd better ask him.

114
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,960
Yin Yin is your person.

115
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,520
You should be responsible for it.

116
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,200
What do you mean by my person?

117
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,920
Ms. Nanxin,

118
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,080
I'll take you there.

119
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,760
No, Mr. Meng.

120
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,320
I'm fine.

121
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,040
Thank you for today.

122
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,560
I'll leave now.

123
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,400
Lan Zhan,

124
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,720
I'll go back to order a banquet.

125
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,640
Okay.

126
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,640
Chong Yang,

127
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,600
the more I put it down,

128
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,080
the more painful it will be.

129
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,120
Are you ready

130
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,280
Well, please wait for me and take care of Ye Ye.

131
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,160
Brother Chuangyang,

132
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,560
what does it matter

133
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,660
why you who invited me here?

134
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,660
Ye Ye,

135
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,540
what have you done to Ji Nianxing?

136
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,520
I...

137
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,400
I did nothing.

138
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,780
I need to hear all you concocted for me.

139
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,660
I'm sorry.

140
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,180
Brother Chou Yang.

141
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,020
Why are you looking at me like this?

142
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,700
What's the matter with those two?

143
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,220
Ying Ying.

144
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,340
You've never lied to me.

145
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,220
Because I didn't teach you to lie.

146
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,260
To be honest,

147
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,060
I don't want to ask you about it again.

148
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,460
Right.

149
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,980
I just want to thank Nanxing.

150
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,980
She always keeps you company.

151
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,660
She always stays in the Ye Palace.

152
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,540
I hate her. I hate her.

153
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,380
Ying Ying.

154
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,020
No matter how much you don't like someone,

155
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,700
you can't do that.

156
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,980
Then what can I do to drive her away?

157
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,780
You're a liar.

158
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,180
No matter if I'm a liar or not,

159
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,220
you don't have the right to restrict her freedom.

160
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,820
I'm a liar.

161
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,340
You dare not admit it.

162
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,620
I'm wrong.

163
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,220
Of course, I have my reason.

164
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,660
But you have to apologize to her

165
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,780
to see Jian Nanxing next time.

166
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,860
Brother Chou Yang.

167
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,500
Now,

168
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,340
go back to the Chou Yang Palace and apologize to her 100 times.

169
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,580
Go.

170
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,300
Why do you stop my visit now?

171
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:08,940
Qiqi.

172
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,340
Why are you here with us today?

173
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,460
Qiqi?

174
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,220
Miss Chou.

175
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,860
Miss Chu, please have a seat.

176
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,660
I heard that Miss Chu's shop is successful.

177
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,900
Congratulations.

178
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,500
Congratulations.

179
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:21,900
It's okay.

180
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,900
I have a lot of things to do.

181
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,300
Miss Chu, you're welcome.

182
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,180
This is the new blood flower cake

183
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,700
that our clinic has developed.

184
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,980
It's made of beauty and nutrition.

185
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,460
Miss Chu, please try it.

186
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,300
You're so reliable.

187
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,620
We're the best doctors in the south.

188
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,900
Miss Chu, please rest assured.

189
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,140
Thank you, Miss Chu.

190
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,300
Between Miss Chu and Mr. Chongyang...

191
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,220
What's wrong with us?

192
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,740
We're doing well.

193
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,060
If we're doing well,

194
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,220
why would we be so upset if we're going to buy a brother?

195
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,100
What does it have to do with you?

196
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,460
I'm just curious.

197
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,060
Meng Xi Ci, don't blame me for not reminding you.

198
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,660
No matter how well you're in the south,

199
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,220
you're just a servant of Mr. Chongyang.

200
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,180
Don't ask too much if you're curious.

201
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,900
I'm Mr. Chongyang's servant.

202
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,100
What about Miss Chu?

203
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,020
I was adopted by Mr. Chongyang when I was eight.

204
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,500
We're family, of course.

205
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,140
I'm glad you know we're family.

206
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,740
After all, Mr. Chongyang has another girl by his side.

207
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,380
What is she?

208
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,340
Meng Xi Ci,

209
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,780
I suggest you

210
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,380
not to worry about other people's business.

211
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,220
You should worry about yourself.

212
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,420
After all, Miss Hualiin has been dead for so long.

213
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,900
You should also consider about it.

214
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,980
So that you can have more business with her.

215
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,940
You can't be happy for so long.

216
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,060
I'll go back to the hotel.

217
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,460
I'll go back to the hotel.

218
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,660
I'll go back to the hotel.

219
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:15,980

00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,180
I'll go back to the hotel.

221
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,380
I'll go back to the hotel.

222
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,780
I'll go back to the hotel.

223
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,180
I'll go back to the hotel.

224
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,500
I'll go back to the hotel.

225
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,900
I'll go back to the hotel.

226
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,300
I'll go back to the hotel.

227
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,660
I'll go back to the hotel.

228
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,140
I'll go back to the hotel.

229
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,540
I'll go back to the hotel.

230
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,940
I'll go back to the hotel.

231
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,260
I'll go back to the hotel.

232
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,500
I'll go back to the hotel.

233
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,820
I'll go back to the hotel.

234
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,260
I'll go back to the hotel.

235
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,620
I'll go back to the hotel.

236
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,460
I'll go back to the hotel.

237
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,780
I'll go back to the hotel.

238
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,180
I'll go back to the hotel.

239
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,380
I'll go back to the hotel.

240
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,620
I'll go back to the hotel.

241
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,900
I'll go back to the hotel.

242
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,100
I'll go back to the hotel.

243
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,220
I'll go back to the hotel.

244
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,500
I'll go back to the hotel.

245
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,620
I'll go back to the hotel.

246
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,620
I'll go back to the hotel.

247
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,820
I'll go back to the hotel.

248
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,940
I'll go back to the hotel.

249
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,900
I'll go back to the hotel.

250
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,220
I'll go back to the hotel.

251
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,380

252
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,420

254
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,700
I'll go back to the hotel.

255
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,820
I'll go back to the hotel.

256
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,900

00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,500
I'll go back to the hotel.

259
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:12,820
The more I want to be broken, the more I want to be broken.

260
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,180
The more I want to be strong, the more I want to be strong.

261
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,820
The more I want to be strong, the more I want to be strong.

262
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:27,460
Every snow flower wants you to kiss me.

263
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,980
Let the world light up.

264
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,340
The sky is full of light.

265
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,220
The moment I hug you.

266
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,700
The light is falling.

267
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,780
The world is full of colors.

268
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,300
You are the only one for me.

269
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,740
Even if we are separated,

270
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,540
we are the same.

271
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,860
What can we do?

272
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,980
What can we do?

273
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,980
What can we do?

274
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,980
What can we do?

275
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,980
What can we do?

276
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,980
What can we do?

277
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,980
What can we do?

278
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,980
What can we do?

279
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,980
What can we do?

280
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,980
What can we do?

281
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,980
What can we do?

282
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,980
What can we do?

283
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,980
What can we do?

284
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,980
What can we do?

285
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,980
What can we do?
