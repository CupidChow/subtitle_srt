1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,600
All dreams are my own

2
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,200
After a thousand diseases, I'm still living

3
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,800
You can't live without death

4
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,400
Love is for you, loyalty is for me

5
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,100
I'll kill my life

6
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,700
I'm a desert, I love this sea

7
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,100
I'll show you the humor of the red carpet

8
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,400
Can you remember me

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,000
The wind is the wind of the high sky

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,300
And I'm just a free-range

11
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,500
I'm just following you to my place

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,700
You and I are fated to fall apart

13
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,700
And even if we can't be separated

14
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,200
Love is like a flower that can't be stopped

15
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,500
The blood turned red

16
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
I'm going to be an ordinary person

17
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,300
Are you going to die?

18
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,800
Why?

19
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,800
When I want to end all this

20
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,800
I have to die

21
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,800
I have to die

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,800
I have to die

23
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,800
I have to die

24
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,800
I have to die

25
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,800
I have to die

26
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,800
I have to die

27
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,800
I have to die

28
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,800
I have to die

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,600
When I want to end all this

30
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Give me hope

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
If I haven't felt happiness

32
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Now

33
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,600
It won't be so painful

34
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,600
I can live for how long?

35
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
The flowers are about to bloom

36
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,400
My body is getting worse

37
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Isn't this the result you want?

38
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
I'm not going to die

39
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
I'm going to die

40
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
I'm going to die

41
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
I'm going to die

42
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
I'm going to die

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
I'm going to die

44
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
I'm going to die

45
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
I'm going to die

46
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
If you want to end all this

47
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
You have to believe in someone

48
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
But once people have their concerns

49
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,200
Who else wants to die?

50
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,200
God

51
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,200
Why torture me like this?

52
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,200
But she will die

53
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Her life is very short

54
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,200
Even if you love each other now

55
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,200
What's the result?

56
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,200
Is it still you who went to death with her?

57
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,200
Isn't it a pity?

58
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,200
You can't help her

59
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,200
You can't help her

60
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,960
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,240
I once saw people around me

62
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,640
die one by one.

63
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,240
I felt a great pain.

64
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,880
But now,

65
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,080
I'd rather give up

66
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,640
the death I've been chasing.

67
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,680
I want to spend the rest of my life with her.

68
00:03:38,200 --> 00:04:05,680
Mo Sen A

69
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,840
It's okay.

70
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,320
Does it still hurt?

71
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,920
I'm fine.

72
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,520
Changsheng,

73
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,960
don't hurt Nanxing anymore.

74
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,640
She has already let Shi Yehua go, right?

75
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,960
You will die, you know?

76
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,240
I asked her to do that.

77
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,120
Why did you leave me?

78
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,520
You are my only family.

79
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,720
Then the person you hurt

80
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,680
is no different from the person you hurt.

81
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,600
I...

82
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:09,760
I...

83
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,120
Changsheng,

84
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,080
Nanxing and you are the people I care about the most.

85
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,680
Take good care of her after I die.

86
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,240
She killed you.

87
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
I don't want to see her again.

88
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,800
I really hate you.

89
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,440
Changsheng.

90
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,000
Brother,

91
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,720
I don't want to see you die.

92
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,200
Changsheng,

93
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,880
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,800
해비 reports.

95
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,480
We can meet again in the afterlife mode.

96
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,820
slow and cool

97
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,380
You escaping

98
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,500
You can escape

99
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,140
It's finished

100
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,220
Already

101
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,500
So, why are you seeing someone?

102
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:37,300
soit

103
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:37,780
田 cow

104
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,280
Hold on

105
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:38,940
Wait a minute

106
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,940
I'm so hot.

107
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,140
Chongyang.

108
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,340
Chongyang.

109
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,740
What are you doing here?

110
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,700
Nothing.

111
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,940
The meal is ready. Go to eat.

112
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:53,820
Nanxing.

113
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,980
I may have to go out for a while.

114
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,620
Stay in the night hall.

115
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,660
Don't go anywhere, okay?

116
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,620
What's the matter?

117
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,940
Is it dangerous?

118
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,420
Don't worry.

119
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,660
It won't be dangerous.

120
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,660
I'll go.

121
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,780
Sir, what's wrong with you?

122
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,700
Sir.

123
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,540
Sir.

124
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,940
Sir. Sir.

125
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,980
I'm fine.

126
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,780
How could Chongyang's body

127
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,540
become so weak suddenly?

128
00:07:50,300 --> 00:08:02,440
Look,

129
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,340
what about his heart?

130
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,660
It's said that

131
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,500
If someone wants to end his life,

132
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,820
he has to focus on his heart

133
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,460
and plant the wild flowers.

134
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,820
The flowers will bloom when his life ends.

135
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,540
Is it true?

136
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,180
Sir.

137
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:27,740
Sir.

138
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,260
What's wrong with you?

139
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,220
Xie Zi.

140
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,100
Don't forget.

141
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,740
These days,

142
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,180
I'll live with you.

143
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,140
Okay.

144
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,540
You can live with me.

145
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,380
Do you want to go to the night house to tell them?

146
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:44,980
No.

147
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,620
Don't tell them.

148
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,300
Especially Nanxi.

149
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,220
Okay.

150
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,460
Don't worry.

151
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,980
Sir, go to bed.

152
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,740
Chongyang. Chongyang.

153
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,980
I've imagined the scene

154
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,860
where you died in front of me many times.

155
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,780
But when it comes to this day,

156
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,060
I feel a little reluctant.

157
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,620
Great.

158
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,780
It's about to bloom.

159
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,780
Great.

160
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:30,740
Chongyang.

161
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,260
I've done

162
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,820
what I wanted to do.

163
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:03,820
Sir.

164
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:05,980
Sir.

165
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,940
Why is his blood red?

166
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,540
Sir.

167
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,380
Wait.

168
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,140
Chongyang.

169
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,100
I wish you died in my hands.

170
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,180
If you really died,

171
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,860
Nanxi.

172
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,580
Will you really die?

173
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:29,500
General Kun's doing rock climbing.

174
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:39,260
our eternal promise

175
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:47,260
How can I make up for losing you?

176
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:54,260
How can I bear to let you go?

177
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,260
The more I try to stay away from you

178
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,260
The more painful it is

179
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,260
Every snowflake is like you

180
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,260
Let time stop

181
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,260
The sky is full of fire

182
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:23,260
Hug that moment, and let the blood of the emperor fall

183
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:28,260
This world is full of colors

184
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,260
You belong only to me

185
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:37,260
Even if it's separation, life and death are separated

186
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,260
So what?

187
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:58,260
The End
