1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,700
Ever since you handed the lo$% Wire Schwad to me

2
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,000
and now you're a loser

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,300
It treated me like I'm my own

4
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,000
I deceived you

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,680
and I'm beggin' you not to

6
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,240

00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,120
water

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,040
you cut your own dreams

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,340
and that's it

10
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,940
ぇ

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,860
That Irelia

12
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,860
and Irelia

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,460
were all my own

14
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,100
She was different

15
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:21,200
1st , 가 Goodbye

16
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:28,900
Here...

17
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,460
Have some food.

18
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,340
Well.

19
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,980
What are you doing?

20
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,980
I didn't do anything.

21
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,940
I just wanted to eat that piece.

22
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,660
Here.

23
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,180
Eat it.

24
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,580
I didn't expect

25
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,700
you like to eat my cooking.

26
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,700
Who's sweating?

27
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,100
If you don't eat it,

28
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,700
I won't let you eat it.

29
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,540
How about this?

30
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,260
Let's go out and eat.

31
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,460
Let's go out and eat.

32
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,340
I want to go, too.

33
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,060
If you

34
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,780
want to see us in love,

35
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,260
I don't mind.

36
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,260
You...

37
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:42,940
Okay.

38
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,660
Sit down and eat.

39
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,700
Eat it.

40
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,860
You eat, too.

41
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,300
Are you still angry?

42
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,420
I hate that woman.

43
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,060
Changsheng,

44
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,380
no matter what,

45
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,980
you're my closest brother.

46
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,460
You must have something to hide from me.

47
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,580
I don't believe you

48
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,940
will like a normal woman.

49
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,900
You're still biased.

50
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,460
I really love her.

51
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,500
You...

52
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,900
What if you love her?

53
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,820
She's just a guest.

54
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,660
She can't be with you forever.

55
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,100
Now,

56
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,780
you're with them.

57
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,180
I don't have to feel lonely anymore.

58
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,060
So...

59
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,660
So I want to...

60
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,580
What do you want to be forever?

61
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,780
I want to be with you forever.

62
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,340
Changsheng.

63
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,540
Are you a guest?

64
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,300
Are you listening to me?

65
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,660
I'm not.

66
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,620
Besides,

67
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,660
you're so loud.

68
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,820
It's hard to hear you.

69
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,100
Don't think too much.

70
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,020
Let me ask you.

71
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,940
When are you going to marry me?

72
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,980
Marry me.

73
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,180
So you've been thinking about this.

74
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,060
I'm not thinking about this.

75
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,500
What?

76
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,340
What are you going to wear?

77
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,100
What's the pajamas?

78
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,940
I'mfor the uniform.

79
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,300
Oh, really?

80
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,100
Who is it?

81
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,540
I'll protect you from way too many troubles

82
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,300
and vaihing down all the people.

83
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,380
And that way

84
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,900
I will be free from entrepreneurs and business people

85
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,140
for the rest of my life.

86
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,580
I will have the opportunity

87
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,340
to sleep alone

88
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:57,740
tonight.

89
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,300
Don't wake me up.

90
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,060
Sorry!

91
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,420
I just saw this草 laboratory

92
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,740
and wanted to ask you out.

93
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,980
we're very destined to meet.

94
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,600
Not only phones,

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,120
but also

96
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,560
Qing sharping

97
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,000
eros will be there.

98
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,220
How could you

99
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,080
win one of the losers?

100
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:39,820
For

101
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,060
Qing sharping...

102
00:06:43,340 --> 00:07:09,740
Everyone goes to the

103
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:10,540
legendary temple,

104
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:12,820
technique.

105
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,940
Mr. Meng.

106
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,500
Sorry to bother you.

107
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,500
I'll go first.

108
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,580
I want to ask

109
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,020
if Mr. Meng came to see me.

110
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,180
Wait a minute.

111
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,620
My family will be here soon.

112
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,140
Miss Hualiing.

113
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,180
Mr. Meng.

114
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,420
Don't be nervous.

115
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,380
Sit down.

116
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,420
Mr. Meng.

117
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,140
I didn't recognize you last time.

118
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,300
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,380
Please don't mind.

120
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,700
I didn't come here

121
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,020
because of this.

122
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,020
Sit down.

123
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,020
Come.

124
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,660
You're not old.

125
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,420
But your medical skills are not low.

126
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,900
I've asked someone.

127
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,140
You've solved

128
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,260
many problems in the villages.

129
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
Our clinic

130
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,020
needs doctors like you.

131
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,940
Thank you for your help.

132
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,260
If Miss Hualiing doesn't mind,

133
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,220
we can go to the clinic tomorrow.

134
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,940
I...

135
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,780
I used to want to go to the clinic.

136
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,460
But now,

137
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,420
I can't promise you.

138
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,580
Why?

139
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,980
Because the conditions in the village are worse than in the city.

140
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,940
Many villagers in the village

141
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,380
don't want to go to the clinic.

142
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,060
If I still work in the village,

143
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,300
I can help many patients with treatment.

144
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,940
Doctors can be called a doctor.

145
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,460
Money, fame and fortune are important.

146
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,060
But it's not worth it in front of people.

147
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,580
So, thank you, Mr. Meng.

148
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,660
But I'm afraid I can't promise you.

149
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,620
Since that,

150
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,100
I won't force you.

151
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,860
But I want to build a doctor's clinic in the village.

152
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,140
I wonder if Miss Hualiing

153
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,620
wants to build a doctor's clinic for Mengmeng.

154
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,180
This is the deposit for Miss Hualiing.

155
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,900
Miss Hualiing.

156
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,860
I miss you so much.

157
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,100
Chun Yang is gone.

158
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,140
Whoined him already.

159
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,300
Where is he?

160
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,380
Chun Yang.

161
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,880
Why are you here?

162
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,740
What do you want?
