1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Thank you

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,100
Toad, all my楽

3
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:56,580
山頥

4
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,300
He الفi.

5
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,460
Look.

6
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,260
Shadowanging.

7
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,140
No.

8
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,020
Farewell.

9
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:38,540
Yu Xia.

10
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,120
...

11
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,860
Farewell.

12
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,660
But this is also the way God has designed it.

13
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,660
He wants to see his friends,

14
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,660
lovers, and stay away from him.

15
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,660
If you want to end this long life,

16
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,660
you can use your heart

17
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,660
to plant a stone leaf flower.

18
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,160
But when the flower blooms,

19
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,660
you can untie it.

20
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,860
The End

21
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,460
The daughter of the Yan family can only have a short life.

22
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,860
If you want to extend your beautiful life,

23
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,260
you have to love the people of Yongye Tribe.

24
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,860
When you love each other,

25
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,860
you can break the curse of the flower blooms.

26
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,860
But...

27
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,860
I can only live for three months.

28
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,860
There is a movement of the stone leaf flower.

29
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,860
The daughter of the Yan family.

30
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,860
It hurts.

31
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,860
The daughter of the Yan family.

32
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,860
Who are you?

33
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,860
The daughter of the Yan family.

34
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,860
You are awake.

35
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,860
Who are you?

36
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,860
You are from the Yongye Tribe.

37
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,860
The taste of the Yan family

38
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,860
will attract the Yongye Tribe.

39
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,860
It seems that I guessed it right.

40
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,860
You are from the Yongye Tribe.

41
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,860
You are not afraid of me?

42
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,860
I'm not afraid.

43
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,860
You are not afraid?

44
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,860
You should know

45
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,860
what my identity means.

46
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,860
Your blood

47
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,860
has many benefits to the Yongye Tribe.

48
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,860
You are now in my eyes,

49
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,860
an irreplaceable stone.

50
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,860
And you

51
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,860
are now letting me save you.

52
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,860
Don't save me.

53
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,860
If you don't save me now,

54
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,860
I can only live for three months.

55
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,860
I will die now.

56
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,860
I will die in three months.

57
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,860
How can I save you?

58
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,860
The daughter of the Yan family is a flower.

59
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,860
Our lives are like a flower.

60
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,860
We will be in a good mood when we have time.

61
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,860
The daughter of the Yan family is only 25 years old.

62
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,860
She is a night in the moon.

63
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,860
Her head is on the head of the heart.

64
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,860
When she comes to the dance room,

65
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,860
we can only wait for death.

66
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,860
Unless...

67
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,860
Unless we can get married with the Yongye Tribe,

68
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,860
I can live on.

69
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,860
You can live on?

70
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,860
Marry?

71
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,860
You are a girl.

72
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,860
You are shameless.

73
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,860
The Yan family is married.

74
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,860
Isn't the girl a good girl?

75
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,860
Nonsense.

76
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,860
It's true.

77
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,860
There was once a Yan girl

78
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,860
who got married with the Yongye Tribe.

79
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,860
She is 80 years old.

80
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,860
I beg you.

81
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,860
I don't want to die.

82
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,860
Please help me.

83
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,860
What's wrong with that?

84
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,860
The Yongye Tribe

85
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,860
has a life of eternity.

86
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,860
How can you understand our suffering?

87
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,860
I just want to live on.

88
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,860
I just want to be a normal person.

89
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,860
The life of eternity

90
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,860
may not be a good thing.

91
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,860
Life and death are destined.

92
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,860
No need to beg.

93
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,860
I am here to find you.

94
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,860
The south of the left bank

95
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,860
is a family of my family.

96
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,860
I finally found you.

97
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:31,860
And you...

98
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,860
You should be happy.

99
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,860
I haven't killed you yet.

100
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,860
As long as you can help me,

101
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,860
as long as you can help me,

102
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,860
I will always be your food.

103
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,860
Can you leave?

104
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,860
You can leave.

105
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,860
For a thousand years,

106
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,860
the Flower of the Night has always been a flower bag.

107
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,860
There has never been any change.

108
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,860
But when Yan girl appeared today,

109
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,860
the flower bag opened a little.

110
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,860
That's why.

111
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,860
It seems

112
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,860
the person who was destined to let the Flower of the Night open

113
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,860
finally appeared.

114
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,860
You mean

115
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,860
when she appeared, the flower would open?

116
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,860
Or

117
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,860
the answer to let the flower open

118
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,860
is to find it yourself?

119
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,860
Where is the flower?

120
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,860
Where is the flower?

121
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,860
Go find it!

122
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,860
Hurry up!

123
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,860
What are you doing?

124
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:56,860
Why are you taking my flower?

125
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,860
What are you doing?

126
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,860
You took our Meng's money.

127
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,860
You said you would pay for it in a month.

128
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,860
You have been sent to heaven!

129
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,860
How could you be so easy to get hit?

130
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,860
Besides,

131
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:06,860
you have something to say.

132
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,860
Why did you hit my flower?

133
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,860
Stop talking nonsense.

134
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,860
If I can't pay for it,

135
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,860
I will kill you!

136
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,860
It's moving again.

137
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,860
It's that woman.

138
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:28,860
Brothers!

139
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,860
Throw the flower in the river.

140
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,860
We should all be smashed!

141
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,860
Brother, I beg you!

142
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,860
I'm here!

143
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,860
Don't throw the flower!

144
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,860
You didn't even say anything!

145
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,860
I've made up my mind.

146
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,860
I'll send you to the lake.

147
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,860
Okay?

148
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,860
Okay?

149
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,860
You bastard!

150
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,860
I'm not a fool.

151
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,860
I'm not a fool.

152
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,860
I'm a fool.

153
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,860
I'm a fool.

154
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,860
I'm a fool.

155
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,860
I'm a fool.

156
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,860
I'm a fool.

157
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,860
I'm a fool.

158
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,860
I'm a fool.

159
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,860
I'm a fool.

160
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,860
I'm a fool.

161
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,860
I'm a fool.

162
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,860
I'm a fool.

163
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,860
I'm a fool.

164
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,860
I'm a fool.

165
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,860
I'm a fool.

166
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,860
I'm a fool.

167
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,860
I'm a fool.

168
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,860
I'm a fool.

169
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,860
I'm a fool.

170
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,860
I'm a fool.

171
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,860
I'm a fool.

172
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,860
I'm a fool.

173
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,860
I'm a fool.

174
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,860
I'm a fool.

175
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,860
I'm a fool.

176
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,860
I'm a fool.

177
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,860
I'm a fool.

178
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,860
I'm a fool.

179
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,860
The one who looks like a dead man

180
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,860
Stops in the memories

181
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,860
With the hateful eyes

182
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,860
I lost you

183
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,860
How come

184
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,860
I've never been

185
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,860
So reluctant

186
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,860
The more I want to be strong

187
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,860
The more pain I have

188
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,860
Every snow flower

189
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,860
Is like you asking me

190
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,860
Let time go by

191
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,860
The sky is full of light

192
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,860
The moment I hug you

193
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,860
The light is falling

194
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,860
The world is full of colors

195
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,860
You pointed out the rain

196
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,860
Even if we are separated

197
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,860
We are like a song

198
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,860
How can it be

199
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:58,860
How can it be

200
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,860
How can it be
