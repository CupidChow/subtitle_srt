1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,220
sleeping so clearly now

2
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,780
as if forever

3
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,820
you sided with me

4
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,720
love your love

5
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,020
ein me

6
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,800
you call me that

7
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,680
solenn

8
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:58,600
whenever i thought there's an answer

9
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,880
Keep your spirit cool and believe you're not getting close to your一点 for too longsu.

10
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,340
That ward might just feed you the Restless tutelage even if you're not a bottee.

11
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,300
You're still so clean!

12
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,900
It's my turn now.

13
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,100
Are you sure you won't hurt her?

14
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,100
I can't get any backer right now.

15
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,500
I what?

16
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,780
Well, best we take you to the part of the ward to have our partners searching in the appropriate way.

17
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,420
I remember very well.

18
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,940
I'm doing this for you.

19
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,220
Look.

20
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,260
They're so beautiful.

21
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,460
I would come to partake whenever I feel alone.

22
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,260
I'd watch these Gracious Fireworks

23
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,900
at every possible place.

24
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,460
It has nothing to do with me.

25
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,460
What about

26
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,460
Changsheng and Yingying?

27
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,460
In my heart,

28
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,460
they are just kids.

29
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,460
I'm just their brother.

30
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,460
It's okay.

31
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,460
As long as I'm alive,

32
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,460
I'll be by your side.

33
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,460
Unless...

34
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,460
Unless you don't want me anymore.

35
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,460
There won't be such a day.

36
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,460
I'm just afraid.

37
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,460
I can't stay with you for so long.

38
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,460
I should say that.

39
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,460
Then,

40
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,460
we'll make a deal.

41
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,460
As long as I'm alive,

42
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,460
I'll be by your side.

43
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,460
Brother.

44
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,460
Okay.

45
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,460
As long as we make a deal,

46
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,460
we won't be able to go back.

47
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,980
The

48
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,460
The

49
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,460
The

50
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,460
The

51
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,460
The

52
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,460
The

53
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,460
The

54
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,460
The

55
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,460
The

56
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,460
The

57
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,460
The

58
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,460
The

59
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,460
The

60
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,460
Master.

61
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,460
On the ship of Ji Nanxing,

62
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,460
you two

63
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,460
are watching fireworks.

64
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,460
Watching fireworks?

65
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,460
I haven't watched fireworks for a long time.

66
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,460
I've watched fireworks for a long time.

67
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,460
I've watched fireworks for a long time.

68
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,460
Go out.

69
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,460
Yes.

70
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,460
I'm done.

71
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,460
Yes.

72
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,460
Those herbs

73
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,460
should be given to the servants.

74
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,460
No.

75
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,460
These herbs are not only in my hands.

76
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,460
I'm worried.

77
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,460
I just don't want you to be so tired.

78
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,460
I just don't want you to be so tired.

79
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,460
I just don't want you to be so tired.

80
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,460
I just want you to rest.

81
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,460
You care about the patient.

82
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,460
I care more about you than me.

83
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,460
What are you talking about?

84
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,460
You and the patient

85
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,460
are not comparable.

86
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,460
If everyone

87
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,460
can be like Chongyang,

88
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,460
like Changsheng,

89
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,460
the wound can heal.

90
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,460
If they die

91
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,460
at any time,

92
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,460
that would be great.

93
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,460
But it's not good.

94
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,460
They can only live in the dark.

95
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,460
Ling'er,

96
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,460
if you were to choose,

97
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,460
would you choose to be the Lord of the Night?

98
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,460
No.

99
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,460
They are too lonely.

100
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,460
Sometimes, when I see Chongyang,

101
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,460
he looks very cold.

102
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,460
But I know that

103
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,460
he is just afraid of

104
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,460
the relationship with someone.

105
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,460
Because once you have a relationship,

106
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,460
you can't bear it anymore.

107
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,460
He has to watch

108
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,460
his loved ones,

109
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,460
his family,

110
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,460
and his children.

111
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,460
He has to go with the pain

112
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,460
and live on.

113
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,460
You know how to care about him.

114
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,460
You don't care about me.

115
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,460
He and I are friends.

116
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,460
It's okay to care about each other

117
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,460
as friends.

118
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,460
I'm kidding.

119
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,460
I'm telling you the truth.

120
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,460
You're right.

121
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,460
It's not meaningful

122
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,460
to live for so long.

123
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,460
It's the most important

124
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,460
to be with the person

125
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,460
you love.

126
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,460
So,

127
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,460
no matter you like to cure the illness,

128
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,460
or do anything,

129
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,460
I'll support you.

130
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,460
But can you not be so tired?

131
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,460
I'm not tired.

132
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,460
I've been a doctor since I was a child

133
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,460
to cure the illness.

134
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,460
I want to see them

135
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,460
recover and be healthy

136
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,460
under my efforts.

137
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,460
I can live happily

138
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,460
and be with my family.

139
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,460
I'm satisfied with it.

140
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,460
Can you be with your family more?

141
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,460
Don't let your family

142
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,460
be alone.

143
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,460
What nonsense are you talking about?

144
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,460
What is it?

145
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,460
Chongyang.

146
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,460
Why can you live well in this world?

147
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,460
Why can you be happy?

148
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,460
I want you to try

149
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,460
to lose the taste of love.

150
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,460
You're in the office of the nightclub.

151
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,460
Your makeup is not safe.

152
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,460
So that those who have a plan

153
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,460
can be in trouble.

154
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,460
People who have a plan?

155
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,460
You mean Meng Xi Ci?

156
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,460
Stay away from her.

157
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,460
You're wrong.

158
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,460
Say it.

159
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,460
Say it.

160
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,460
Say it.

161
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:03,460
Yes.

162
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,460
I'm wrong.

163
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,460
What's this?

164
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,460
This is my luggage.

165
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,460
Put it on, brother.

166
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,460
I'll move it to my home.

167
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,460
Who asked you to move it to my home?

168
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,460
And

169
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,460
you can't call me brother.

170
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,460
Okay.

171
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,460
I can call you brother.

172
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,460
Just remember

173
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,460
I'm your sister-in-law.

174
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,460
Brother.

175
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,460
Brother.

176
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,460
Brother.

177
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,460
Brother.

178
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,460
She's right.

179
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,460
You two can get along well.

180
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,460
Brother.

181
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,460
Are you hiding something from me?

182
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,460
How can you let her

183
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,460
move to my home?

184
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,460
I like her.

185
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,460
If she doesn't move to my home,

186
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,460
who will move to my home?

187
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,460
Brother.

188
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,460
Okay.

189
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,460
Where's Ying Ying?

190
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,460
Ying Ying

191
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,460
has been hiding in the room lately.

192
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,460
I don't know what she's doing.

193
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,460
It's been a long time since I saw Ying Ying.

194
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,460
It's okay.

195
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,460
Changsheng,

196
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,460
go and see Ying Ying.

197
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,460
I...

198
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,460
Go.

199
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,460
How could this happen?

200
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,460
How could this happen?

201
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,460
I'm sorry.

202
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,460
I'm sorry.

203
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,460
I'm sorry.

204
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,460
Wang Xiezi.

205
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,460
Look at the situation now.

206
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,460
I'm in bed.

207
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,460
Or in sofa.

208
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,500
Is it suitable for you?

209
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,300
I'd rather sleep on the sofa.

210
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,300
Why don't we sleep on the sofa together?

211
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,620
The sofa is so small.

212
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,260
How can it be two people?

213
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,260
Okay.

214
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,300
I'm sleepy.

215
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,060
Then let's sleep together.

216
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,580
I'll be very confident.

217
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,300
We'll achieve our dream together.

218
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,420
Long life attached to each other.

219
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,140
We have far future.

220
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,260
Open air to and let go ofberards.

221
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,940
That's it.

222
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,460
Let's sing with you together.

223
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,260
Do you have any reactions?

224
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,420
Nobody's good for us.

225
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,420
