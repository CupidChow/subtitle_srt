00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,580
It's a soup made with vermicelli.

76
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,620
You must be used to it all these years.

77
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,820
No one is going to take care of you.

78
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:40,820
Okay.

79
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,740

Is there a possibility

84
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,700
that I'm rich?

85
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,300
There's a possibility

86
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,700
that I don't want to be disturbed.

87
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:07,620
Then...

88
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,100
Then I...

89
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:10,820
I don't want to take care of you

90
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,180
so quietly.

91
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,340
It's okay.

92
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,780
You'll have to die

00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,740
after three months of unemployment.

94
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,220
I'm so beautiful.

95
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,140
Are you willing to watch me die?

96
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,700
I've been living for so many years.

97
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,620
There are so many people in front of me.

98
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,780
I'll miss you.

99
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,260
I'm also a good girl.

100
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,540
I'm so excited.

101
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,820
I'm still a dead face.

102
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,220
If it weren't for my life,

103
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,340
who would have bothered you?

104
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,620
It's not because you're handsome.

105
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,540
Who would have done this to you?

106
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,180
No.

107
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:09,900
No.

108
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,300
You're not handsome and you're not good.

109
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,380
You're so stupid.

110
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:22,860
I'm so sorry.

111
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,340
I'm so sorry.

112
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,940

I'm sorry.

115
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,300
Don't touch my flowers.

116
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,140
Who are you?

117
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,820
And the girl in the peach tree

118
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,900

Your mother is still looking for you.

So beautiful.

123
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,780

If I had a face like you,

128
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,540
she would love me.

129
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,860
