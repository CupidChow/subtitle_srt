6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You're going to use my body to raise a drum?

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's already done.

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I've tried so many ways.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Until I found you.

10
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You're a girl.

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I finally knew that only the body of a girl

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
can make a drum.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Using this drum to poison the poison,

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I can wake Ling'er up.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I can wake Ling'er up soon.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But...

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You...

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
When did you...

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Give me a drum?

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's great.

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's going to be a success.

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Ling'er is going to wake up.

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Chong Lan.

24
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Gu Chong.

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Meng Xi Ci is from Miao River.

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Meng Xi Ci.

27
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
How did he become like this?

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Three years ago.

29
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The herbs today are really good.

30
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Smell it.

31
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Ling'er, are you okay?

32
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Drink some water.

33
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Did you eat something bad?

34
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Xi Ci.

35
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You're going to be a father.

36
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You're going to be a father.

37
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
A father?

38
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I...

39
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm going to be a father?

40
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I...

41
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm going to be a father?

42
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I...

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm going to be a father?

44
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Mr. Chu Yang.

45
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Please save Hualing.

46
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Save Hualing.

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I can't save her.

48
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Xi Ci.

49
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I advise you.

50
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Life and death are predestined.

51
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Don't force it.

52
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
She's my wife.

53
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
How can I not force it?

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Mr. Chu Yang.

55
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You've been serving us for so many years.

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I just want you to do one thing.

57
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Save Hualing.

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Please.

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Xi Ci.

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I can't help you.

61
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Mr. Chu Yang.

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't leave me, Mr. Chu Yang.

63
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
When Hualing was pregnant,

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
she went to help the poor people.

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
An accident happened by accident.

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But she didn't save her.

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I felt like I was hollowed out.

68
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
From that moment on,

69
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I was trying to wake Ling up

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
and revenge on Chong Yang.

71
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Why do you think Chong Yang can save your wife?

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
My ancestors have a record of the Yongye clan.

73
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
They can do everything.

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But Chong Yang just doesn't want to help me.

75
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's a pity that I've served him for so many years.

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I just want him to save my family.

77
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I just want him to save my family.

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But he doesn't want to.

79
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Chong Yang must have his own difficulties.

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
How can the Yongye clan do everything?

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Enough.

82
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Stop talking about him.

83
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It doesn't matter anymore.

84
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
With Jin Gu,

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
my Ling will wake up soon.

86
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Hualing is a doctor.

87
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
She's been a doctor for generations.

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But you sacrificed so many innocent lives for her.

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If Hualing wakes up,

90
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
will she accept you now?

91
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Shut up.

92
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Ling.

93
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Ling, you're awake.

94
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Ling.

95
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I've been waiting for this day for three years.

96
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You're finally awake, Ling.

97
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Ling, are you still not used to it?

98
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's okay, Ling.

99
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You'll get used to it.

100
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll be with you.

101
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Don't worry.

102
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm here.

103
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Ling.

104
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Ling.

105
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Ling.

106
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Ling.

107
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Ling.

108
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Wake up, Ling.

109
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Don't leave me, Ling.

110
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Wake up.

111
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Ling.

112
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Ling, don't leave me.

113
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Ling.

114
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Ling.

115
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Wake up, Ling.

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I've been waiting for so long.

117
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Don't leave me.

118
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Ling.

119
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Come back, Ling.

120
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Ling.

121
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I've prepared your favorite flowers.

122
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Ling.

123
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Mr. Meng.

124
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Life and death are predestined.

125
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Hualing may not have woken up just now.

126
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's just controlling her insect.

127
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I advise Mr. Meng

128
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
not to be too persistent.

129
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Mr. Meng.

130
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Mr. Cheng Yang is here.

131
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Ling.

132
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I miss you.

133
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I can't stop my heart from beating.

134
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We look at each other.

135
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What's wrong?

136
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You're like a person in the past.

137
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Locking the door of memory.

138
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
The eternal promise.

139
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
How can I make up for losing you?

140
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
How can I bear to let you go?

141
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The more I try to get closer to you,

142
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
the more painful it is.

143
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Every word you say is true.

144
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Every snow flower asks you.

145
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Let time stop.

146
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The fire is burning.

147
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Embrace the moment.

148
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The tears of the emperor fall.

149
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
This world is full of thorns.

150
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You belong only to me.

151
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Even if we're separated, we'll be separated for life.

152
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So what?
