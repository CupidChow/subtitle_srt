4
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Mr. Chong Yang

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This is a gift for you and Miss Nan Xing

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What do you want?

7
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Sir, I just came to give you a gift

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You are a little too nervous

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Miss Nan Xing

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I want to send someone to buy some flowers from you

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I don't know if I have time recently

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
She won't sell flowers

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That's a pity

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Nan Xing

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I have something to talk to Mr. Meng

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You go first

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Ok

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Xi Zi

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You are also the one I watched grow up

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We have been friends for so many years

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I hope you can be like when you were a kid

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So pure

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So good

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Seeing that Mr. and Miss Nan Xing are so affectionate

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm relieved

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm leaving

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Xi Zi

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I have been friends with Meng family for hundreds of years

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I don't want to break up with you

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Xi Zi

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What did you talk to Mr. Meng?

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Nothing

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What's wrong with you?

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You have to tell me what's wrong with you

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Do you know?

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Don't hold it in your heart

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What is this?

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Nothing

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is a gift from Meng Xi

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Nan Xing

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
During this time

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You must be in the night palace

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Don't need anywhere, ok?

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Ok

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Since you don't want to say it now

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Then I won't ask anything

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I will listen to you

48
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Chong Yang

49
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Why is the sleeping time getting longer and longer?

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Miss Nan Xing

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Ying Ying

52
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What's wrong?

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I have something

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I want to ask you for help

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Nan Xing

56
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Nan Xing

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Nan Xing

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Nan Xing

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Ying Ying

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You asked me to accompany you to see Mr. Meng

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But I think he is not at home

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
How about we go to the hospital and wait for him?

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Ji Nan Xing

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You came here

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Do you think you can still go?

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Ying Ying

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What do you mean?

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What do you mean?

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Why did you come here?

70
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Why did you take away Chong Yang?

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
If it wasn't for you

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Changsheng brother wouldn't have left

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Chong Yang brother wouldn't ignore me

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I wouldn't be like this

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Ying Ying

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But what does this have to do with Meng family?

77
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What?

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't move

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Let me go

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Miss Ying Ying

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,040
dearest

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
to me

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Mr. Meng

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I change

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Miss Ying Ying

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You are really know how to do

87
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Mr. Meng

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What happened

89
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Is this

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,440
If you want to cure the illness,

91
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,560
if you want to recover your face,

92
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,800
bring Ji Nanxing here.

93
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,680
Don't let Chongyang know.

94
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,280
Why?

95
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,520
Are you having an affair with Ji Nanxing?

96
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,840
Miss Zhu,

97
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,120
you don't have to know so much.

98
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,400
As long as you know that I can help you,

99
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,160
that's enough.

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,960
Meng Xi Ci.

101
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,960
I didn't expect you to be like this.

102
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,440
What are you planning?

103
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,160
You'll know soon.

104
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,000
Where's the antidote?

105
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,760
Where's the antidote, Meng Xi Ci?

106
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,280
There's no antidote.

107
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
I lied to you.

108
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,400
How come there's no antidote?

109
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,480
You lied to me.

110
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
You lied to me.

111
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,200
You lied to me.

112
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,400
You lied to me.

113
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,600
Give me back my face.

114
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,360
Give me back my face.

115
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,200
Meng Xi Ci, you bastard.

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Don't be crazy here.

117
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,800
Get out.

118
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,040
Meng Xi Ci.

119
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,120
I'm going back to tell Brother Chongyang.

120
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,840
I'm going to kill you.

121
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,960
ash reveals.

122
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,540
E вspeakindge y

123
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,480
Meng Xi ci, are you crazy?

124
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,680
Brother Chongyang

125
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,720
Brother Chongyang

126
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,800
I want to come home.

127
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,460
Brother Chongyang

128
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,720
Thanks for your特別感謝,叔叔

129
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,200
paljon了

130
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Ying Ying

131
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,080
Don't shout

132
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
It's over

133
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,020
Doesn't Chu Yao is a good friend of yours?

134
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,680
Why do you do this?

135
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,760
Shut up

136
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,760
I won't keep you until you're useful.

137
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,760
I've long wanted Chong Yang to taste the taste of losing his lover.

138
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,760
Lan Xing.

139
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
Lan Xing.

140
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,760
Ling'er.

141
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,760
You'll wake up soon.

142
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,760
She is your wife.

143
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,760
She's not dead.

144
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,760
It's been three years.

145
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,760
She'll wake up soon.

146
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,760
Are you crazy?

147
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,760
What are you going to do to me?

148
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,760
I used the girl's body to test the medicine for the flower.

149
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,760
Until I found this special golden bone.

150
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,760
Use the girl's body to raise the bone?

151
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,760
So you're the missing girl who's looking for the love flower.

152
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
Yes.

153
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,760
The legend of love flowers is false.

154
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,760
They were attacked by ancient bugs in the garden.

155
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,760
You caught them, didn't you?

156
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,760
It's nothing to tell you now.

157
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
You're right.

158
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,760
You're going to use my body to raise the bone?

159
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,760
I've practiced it.

160
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,760
I've tried so many ways.

161
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
Until I found you.

162
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,760
You're the girl.

163
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,760
I finally know that only the body of the girl can be used to make a golden bone.

164
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,760
I can wake up soon.

165
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,760
What's the matter with you?

166
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,760
You're like a person in the past.

167
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Locking the door of memory.

168
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,760
The eternal promise.

169
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,760
How can I make up for losing you?

170
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:52,760
I've never been able to bear to lose you.

171
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,760
The more I try to stay close to you.

172
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,760
The more painful it is.

173
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,760
Every snowflake is like you.

174
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,760
Let time pass.

175
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,760
The sky is full of fire.

176
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,760
Embrace that moment.

177
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,760
The tears of the emperor fall.

178
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,760
This world is all gray.

179
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,760
You belong only to me.

180
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,760
Even if it's separation, it's a life and death.

181
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,760
So what?

182
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,760
I'm not the one who should be sad.

183
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,760
I'm the one who should be sad.

184
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,760
I'm the one who should be sad.

185
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,760
I'm the one who should be sad.

186
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,760
I'm the one who should be sad.

187
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,760
I'm the one who should be sad.

188
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,760
I'm the one who should be sad.

189
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,760
I'm the one who should be sad.

190
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,760
I'm the one who should be sad.

191
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,760
I'm the one who should be sad.
