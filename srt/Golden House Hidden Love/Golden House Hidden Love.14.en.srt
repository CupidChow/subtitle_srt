[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,160
In the several thousand years of human history,

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,040
there have been many unsolved mysteries.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,960
Are the stories of Dayu controlling the flood and Nvwa mending the sky myths?

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,560
Why would the advancement of human civilization

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,760
surpass its current situations?

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,800
There are all kinds of speculations.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,760
But in fact, the truth

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,760
dates back to the ancient times.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,390
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,720
the highly developed

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,360
prehistoric civilizations once existed on Earth.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,680
Back then, the ancient people

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,080
mastered the scientific civilization far more advanced than that in modern society.

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,160
Their high-level genetic modification technology

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,280
even enabled them to develop

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,390
human potential to the greatest extent.

18
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,960
They could absorb the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,820
to stay alive and even exert extraordinary energy.

20
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,720
However, a tragic doomsday disaster

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,390
made those human beings almost extinct at that time.

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,710
Countless lives

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,910
and brilliant civilizations were destroyed overnight.

24
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,960
Only a small number of ancient people

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,560
survived the doomsday

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,330
after escaping to the underground in time

27
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,789
and entering into a frozen hibernation state.

28
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:14,450
After that,

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,190
through tens of thousands of years of self-repair,

30
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,480
our Earth conceived new intelligent lives again,

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,740
namely, the ancestors of modern people.

32
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,080
And the ancient people sleeping in the underground areas

33
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,480
woke up one after another

34
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,160
and returned to the land.

35
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,870
They saw

36
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,830
the new primitive humans who were still trying to make fire by drilling wood.

37
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,920
Out of good intentions,

38
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,020
they taught the younger generations

39
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,030
many technologies, such as farming, metallurgy,

40
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,800
construction, flood control, and precautions against natural disasters.

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,729
Many great civilization miracles

42
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,120
were the masterpieces made

43
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,850
by our ancestors with the help of ancient people.

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,759
At that time, the new human beings

45
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:51,789
[Fuxi Temple]

46
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,960
considered the ancient people with extraordinary energy as deities.

47
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,690
They built temples for them and worshipped them.

48
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,200
As the official historians of various countries exaggerated the stories about them,

49
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,720
many legendary ancient myths have been passed down till now.

50
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,240
In this way,

51
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,440
most ancient people around the world

52
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,360
fitted into the new world with the identities

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,520
of deities.

54
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,840
But there were also some low-profile ancient people

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,300
who chose to live in seclusion in deep mountains to escape from the mortal world.

56
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,070
However,

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,310
people's worship towards the deities

58
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,400
also gradually generated fear and desires.

59
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,200
The rulers feared that the power of deities

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,840
would become a threat to their royal power.

61
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,390
But they were also greedy

62
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,120
for immortality and the extraordinary power.

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,780
Therefore,

64
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,720
they used various excuses

65
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
to start wars

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,850
against the deities from time to time.

67
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,829
The ancient people were outnumbered

68
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,320
and were no match for the huge armies in the end.

69
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,920
They almost became extinct.

70
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,600
Little did they know

71
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,960
that by imparting the knowledge of weapon forging to the new humans,

72
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,160
they unwittingly unleashed a disaster upon themselves.

73
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,840
Although the ancient people who lived in deep mountains

74
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,400
survived this disaster,

75
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,920
they were hunted by the rulers continuously.

76
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,240
They were even slandered

77
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,510
and considered as horrible mountain spirits or ferocious ghosts.

78
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,880
In the blink of an eye,

79
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,750
those who had been regarded as deities became devils that everyone wanted to kill.

80
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,230
As everything keeps changing in the world,

81
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,920
no one knows the existence of the ancient people anymore.

82
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,270
Only those anecdotes and peculiar stories about ghosts and monsters

83
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,360
have been passed down from generation to generation.

84
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,079
And the tiny minority of ancient people who have survived

85
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,750
are still secretly hiding

86
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,630
in those covert corners in the world till now.

87
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,280
The Settlement Plan?

88
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,600
What is this?

89
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,820
The plan to settle down after the viscount returns.

90
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,240
I've never heard

91
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,090
a plan is needed to settle down.

92
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,120
So many things.

93
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,110
Mr. Nan, do you plan

94
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,040
to create a paradise?

95
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,980
Settling down is not a temporary thing.

96
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,310
How can we do it hastily?

97
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,220
The viscount is willing to give up his power and wealth for me

98
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,880
and spend the rest of his life in the wilderness.

99
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,840
He has shown me his sincerity.

100
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,630
Of course I should return the favor

101
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,160
by giving him a decent home.

102
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:29,850
Mr. Nan,

103
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,880
the person you've been waiting for won't come back again.

104
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,520
Mr. Nan, please face the reality early.

105
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,640
It's been more than 70 years.

106
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,640
He would have come back long ago if he wants.

107
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,350
No, he will come back.

108
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,480
He promised me.

109
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,160
According to The Robber Zhi of Zhuangzi,

110
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,320
Wei Sheng made an appointment with someone by the river.

111
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,850
That person didn't show up.

112
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,540
Wei Sheng was stubborn and wouldn't leave.

113
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,960
He held a pillar in his arms

114
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,950
and drowned due to the rising water level.

115
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,120
Mr. Nan, you are

116
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,040
no different from that stubborn man.

117
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,420
[Settlement Plan]

118
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,600
I didn't expect you to see the light of day again.

119
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,460
Brother, I've washed the dishes.

120
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:35,640
Thank you.

121
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,720
Not at all.

122
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,950
Your cooking was so delicious.

123
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,480
Washing dishes is nothing.

124
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,280
Right, Yanhai.

125
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,970
I have something to ask you.

126
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,960
What is it?

127
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,190
Wait a minute.

128
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,970
Let's talk in the tea room.

129
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,680
Brother.

130
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,000
I asked you to help me find

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,200
an antique appraisal agency.

132
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,320
Do you remember that?

133
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,000
Of course.

134
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,640
I've always kept this matter in my mind.

135
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,170
I'm still thinking about which one to choose.

136
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,710
The earrings are quite old.

137
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,960
I want to sell them as soon as possible.

138
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,920
So... please hurry up.

139
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,360
Brother, are you in urgent need of money?

140
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,310
You just got the job

141
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,000
of designing the service building, right?

142
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,710
The remuneration should be quite high.

143
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,560
Or...

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
do you also think there is something wrong with Mr. Li?

145
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,800
No.

146
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,630
Since Jin Xia's grandma passed away,

147
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,830
I've been planning on doing something.

148
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,360
I need a lot of money.

149
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,400
I'm afraid the remuneration I get from designing the building

150
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,200
is not enough.

151
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,670
What plan?

152
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,000
A settlement plan.

153
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,300
What does a settlement plan mean?

154
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,350
In short,

155
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,400
I want to give Jin Xia a home.

156
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:07,960
Brother,

157
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,320
you're so nice to Jin Xia.

158
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,880
Besides, I've been having bad dreams lately.

159
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,040
They were all related to this pair of earrings.

160
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,510
I'm worried if I keep them, they might cause trouble.

161
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,560
Selling them as soon as possible can make me relieved.

162
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,560
Trouble?

163
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,990
Were they related to your earlier episode of becoming transparent?

164
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,789
No, they were about Jin Xia.

165
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,600
Jin Xia.

166
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,000
Okay, I'll decide

167
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,440
a reliable appraisal and auction house tomorrow.

168
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,920
I don't think ordinary small pawnshops

169
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,650
are able to accept this pair of antique earrings.

170
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,940
Thank you, Yanhai.

171
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,750
Brother, don't stand on ceremony.

172
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,410
Your business is my business.

173
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,830
Have some tea.

174
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,710
You and Nan Hua have reached a consensus

175
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,120
on not to be a model, right?

176
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,270
It can't be called making a decision without asking him

177
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,200
even if you reject Ms. Xi directly.

178
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,790
You are hesitant.

179
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,840
You're making yourself upset.

180
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,170
I don't understand you.

181
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,240
But if I reject her,

182
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,470
it'll be like lying to Nan Hua.

183
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,030
He will know someday.

184
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,920
How about this?

185
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,990
Take advantage of this opportunity

186
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,310
to let him meet Ms. Xi.

187
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,630
If she's really the one Nan Hua has been waiting for,

188
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,800
fate will let them recognize each other.

189
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,600
If that's the case, there will be nothing we can do.

190
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,930
But... they've already met.

191
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,200
He fainted. That doesn't count.

192
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,710
Let them meet face to face formally.

193
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,230
What if they don't recognize each other?

194
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,280
That means

195
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,660
Ms. Xi is not the person Nan Hua has been waiting for.

196
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,060
Or they can't remember even when they meet.

197
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,520
Then don't say anything.

198
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,560
Is that okay?

199
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,240
Why not?

200
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,470
You've done enough.

201
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,760
Babes in the woods are not popular in this era.

202
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,560
Be mature,

203
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,950
Fairy Baby.

204
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
They are all here.

205
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,840
It should be enough even if you are in a hurry to sell them.

206
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,760
Thank you, Nan Hua.

207
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,920
Thank you so much.

208
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,360
If we sell these,

209
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,920
we'll have money to buy supplies.

210
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,840
But how are you going to live

211
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,410
since you've given me everything?

212
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,680
It's okay.

213
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,030
Gold and silver are worldly possessions.

214
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,430
I don't really need them.

215
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,060
It's worth it since they can help you.

216
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,680
I'm sorry, Nan Hua.

217
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,120
Our country is in danger.

218
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,520
We should devote ourselves to our country.

219
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,980
I can't stay here with you.

220
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,600
But I promise you.

221
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,840
When I collect enough money to support my comrades,

222
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,160
I'll be back when we win.

223
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,960
Wait for me, okay?

224
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,040
Okay.

225
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,830
She is...

226
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:15,240
the one who came back during the period of the Republic of China.

227
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,240
Jin Xia.

228
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,080
Ms. Xi, good morning.

229
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,160
Why are you here so early?

230
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,040
Didn't you go back again last night?

231
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,680
I went back. I just arrived.

232
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,800
How did it go?

233
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,960
Have you made up for your unfinished work?

234
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,680
Almost.

235
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,880
I still need to do some repairs.

236
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,600
Okay, keep going.

237
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,440
By the way, what did your boyfriend say?

238
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,940
He said... he needs to think about it.

239
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,520
I'll call him and ask him later.

240
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,920
Please hurry.

241
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,670
You'd better give me a reply this afternoon.

242
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,830
If he agrees, come and have his measurements taken.

243
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,680
This afternoon? So soon.

244
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,910
What? Is it inconvenient?

245
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,440
No.

246
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,920
I'll ask him.

247
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,960
Simons.

248
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,630
Ms. Lin, Mr. Zhao,

249
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,440
you're early.

250
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,760
Go back to work first.

251
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,640
Okay.

252
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,670
Mr. Zhao, Ms. Lin,

253
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,330
come. Let's talk in my office.

254
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,410
They are the two investors who came last time, right?

255
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,000
Nan Hua should be awake by now, right?

256
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,330
Hello, Jin Xia.

257
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,720
Hello, Nan Hua. You're awake.

258
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,160
Are you okay?

259
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,920
Are you tired from working overtime?

260
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,840
I... I'm fine.

261
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,800
Well, I have something to discuss with you.

262
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:33,960
What is it?

263
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,480
Well...

264
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,470
Do you remember

265
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,800
they took some photos of you in the studio?

266
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,790
After Ms. Xi saw the photos,

267
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,590
she thinks...

268
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,830
she thinks your image

269
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,320
echoes the styles of her new works very much.

270
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,320
She wants to meet you and talk to you

271
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,920
to see if they can take some sample photos of you.

272
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,510
Are you willing?

273
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:59,240
But we agreed that  it would be the last time

274
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,080
for me to be your model, right?

275
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,190
I forgot to tell you.

276
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,040
Actually, my work has been selected.

277
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,680
Really?

278
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,230
Congratulations, Jin Xia.

279
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,440
I knew you could do it.

280
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,040
But if you agree to be a model,

281
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,400
you'll have to wear more than just the outfit designed by me.

282
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,930
After all... my teacher and I will participate in the same show.

283
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,000
You have to change your clothes continuously

284
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,190
like last time.

285
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,590
No problem.

286
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,640
Really?

287
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,470
Yes.

288
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,990
It'll be the last time anyway.

289
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:40,650
No matter how many sets I have to wear, it's okay.

290
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:44,320
Thank you, Nan Hua.

291
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,520
It's good to have you.

292
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,920
Are you free this afternoon?

293
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,880
Is it convenient for you to come to the company?

294
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,700
At 3 p.m.

295
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,150
Sure, I'm free.

296
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,880
Okay, call me when you arrive.

297
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,810
I'll pick you up.

298
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,950
Okay.

299
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,070
That's it. I'm hanging up.

300
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:06,830
Bye.

301
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:07,800
Bye.

302
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,350
3 p.m.

303
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,490
I should get going now.

304
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,110
Jin Xia. Jin Xia.

305
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,240
This is not the time to think about romantic relationships.

306
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,270
You're going to participate in an international show.

307
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,640
Don't mess it up

308
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,840
and let Ms. Xi down.

309
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,760
Simons, I think you must have heard of this.

310
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,900
Mrs. Bruno said

311
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,550
she will ban you and your brand

312
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,810
outside Asia Pacific.

313
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,320
From now on, all your works

314
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,390
can't be showcased in the business districts

315
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,390
that have partnered with Mr. Bruno.

316
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,569
I've heard of it.

317
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,359
You know

318
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,829
Bruno Group is the largest luxury goods dealership

319
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:15,869
in the world.

320
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,319
It has reached a long-term partnership

321
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,680
with our headquarters.

322
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,359
How could you do this

323
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,760
at this critical moment?

324
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,300
So... what's the decision of the headquarters?

325
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,640
To withdraw the investment completely

326
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,690
and cancel the show this year.

327
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,370
Is there no room for a negotiation?

328
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,390
Unless... you can persuade Mr. Bruno

329
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,760
or his wife.

330
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,680
Okay, I see.

331
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,040
The sleeves can be longer.

332
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,040
Okay.

333
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,160
The biggest problem is the embroidery

334
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,560
is not exquisite enough.

335
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,200
Pay attention to this part before you modify it.

336
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,080
There's too much blank space.

337
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,640
-Got it.
-Got it.

338
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,600
-Okay.
-Okay.

339
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,120
All of you, remember this.

340
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,440
You must take all the details into consideration

341
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,830
before pattern making,

342
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,320
so that you don't have to keep reworking.

343
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,080
Okay.

344
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,400
Ms. Xi, should we modify this part?

345
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:30,190
[I'm downstairs at your company]

346
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,430
Just remove it.

347
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,680
And the hemline...

348
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,240
Ms. Xi, Nan Hua is at the front door.

349
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,830
I'm going to bring him upstairs.

350
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:36,470
Go ahead.

351
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,040
Ms. Xi, should we modify this part?

352
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,300
You can keep this part.

353
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,510
You're here.

354
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,480
Let's go in now.

355
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,710
Wait.

356
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,520
I brought you something.

357
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,240
It might be inconvenient to talk after we go in.

358
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,670
It's ginseng chicken soup in the thermo jug.

359
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,800
I simmered it all night.

360
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,830
You can drink it when you work overtime tonight.

361
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,120
Also, I made some tea bags

362
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,440
with wolfberries, red dates, and sanchi flowers.

363
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,230
They are good for you girls.

364
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,800
They can also refresh you and improve your eyesight.

365
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,630
When you work overtime at night, it's the best thing to drink.

366
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,760
I've divided them into small packets

367
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,890
and put them inside.

368
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,760
I also made some snacks.

369
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,640
You can eat them if you're hungry.

370
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,400
Don't worry.

371
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,310
They are low-fat and delicious.

372
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,150
Thank you.

373
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,570
You're welcome.

374
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,960
Let's go in now.

375
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,760
Nan Hua.

376
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,440
What's wrong?

377
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,830
You are so nice to me.

378
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,520
Is it because I'm the one you've been waiting for?

379
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,750
Why are you asking me this suddenly?

380
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,000
If I'm not the person you've been waiting for,

381
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,780
will you not be so nice to me in the future?

382
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,640
Maybe.

383
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,600
The problem of you two

384
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,110
is that you are too subjective in aesthetic.

385
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,790
You have not reached the level

386
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,320
of disregarding mainstream aesthetics

387
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,400
to be unique.

388
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,100
Make some changes.

389
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:25,910
Also,

390
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,970
you and Su Ke go organize the clothes.

391
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:28,920
Go.

392
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,200
Ms. Xi, Nan Hua is here.

393
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,720
Hello.

394
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,040
Mr. Nan looks more handsome than in the photos.

395
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,000
Thank you. I'm flattered.

396
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,160
Mr. Nan, let's try on the clothes.

397
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,080
Okay.

398
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,200
Widen the shoulders.

399
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,880
Take Mr. Nan's measurements.

400
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,630
Modify it according to his measurements.

401
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,480
Mr. Nan's body proportion is very good.

402
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,360
Bai Bing, listen.

403
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,360
Modify all the clothes for the show

404
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,760
according to his measurements temporarily.

405
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,360
Okay.

406
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,320
Why is she so lucky?

407
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,560
She didn't get punished after she plagiarized.

408
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,600
And she has been chosen to design clothes for the show.

409
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,200
Now her boyfriend has been chosen as a model for the show.

410
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,960
Exactly.

411
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,120
Why does good luck always fall on her?

412
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:47,880
Exactly.

413
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,680
It seems... there is no chemistry

414
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,160
between them.

415
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,080
Could it be that the earrings are just a coincidence?

416
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,400
Did I think too much?

417
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Anyway,

418
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,320
after he finishes trying on the clothes,

419
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,360
I must tell him

420
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,490
about the earrings.

421
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,470
Nan Hua is so nice to me.

422
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,600
I can't lie to him.

423
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,860
Ms. Xi, coffee is here.

424
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,210
I'm sorry.

425
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,280
Jin Xia, are you okay?

426
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,740
Ms. Xi, I'm fine.

427
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,630
I practiced gymnastics.

428
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,240
I'm flexible.

429
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,590
Fortunately, she practiced gymnastics.

430
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,640
Senior Bai Bing, did you see that?

431
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,280
Her reaction just now was too exaggerated.

432
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,360
Not a drop was spilt on her.

433
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,840
She practiced gymnastics.

434
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,770
Stop gossiping.

435
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,360
Bai Li.

436
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,590
Clean the floor.

437
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,160
Okay.

438
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,010
The rest of you get back to work.

439
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,520
Measure the waist.

440
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,390
Thank you. Thank you.

441
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,390
Let me take a look.

442
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,440
Here, coffee.

443
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,400
Ms. Xi, he's allergic to coffee.

444
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,840
Then I'm gonna ask my assistant to give him... a cup of tea.

445
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,970
Don't bother. I'm not thirsty.

446
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:53,950
Jin Xia,

447
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,650
you were so flexible just now.

448
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:58,740
Why did you quit gymnastics and become a designer?

449
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,920
I learned gymnastics when I was little.

450
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,850
I'm not interested after I grew up.

451
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,960
You still have impressive gymnastics skills

452
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,960
even though you are not interested?

453
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,000
It was my physical instinct and muscle memory.

454
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,640
Ms. Xi, I have something to do later.

455
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,790
So...

456
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,590
Okay, let's get to the point.

457
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:23,840
I invited you here

458
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,310
to mainly talk about the future formal cooperation

459
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,500
with Mr. Nan.

460
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,150
I'm very satisfied with today's fitting.

461
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,400
I didn't expect Mr. Nan to be more suitable than I expected.

462
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,110
To be honest, I don't want to consider anyone else.

463
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,440
Mr. Nan, if you are willing,

464
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,950
is it convenient for you next Tuesday?

465
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,800
Come here to take the first group of photos officially.

466
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,800
What do you think?

467
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,110
Yes. No problem.

468
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,960
Wish us a pleasant collaboration.

469
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,360
Wish us a pleasant collaboration.

470
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:52,790
By the way,

471
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,560
Jin Xia, this is for you.

472
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,080
Ms. Xi,

473
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,190
is this... a contract?

474
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,000
No, the contract is still being drafted.

475
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,150
These are the design drafts

476
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,610
you asked me for last time.

477
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,720
Actually, the earrings are not my favorite.

478
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,120
The styles of the others echo the theme better.

479
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,450
You can take a good look.

480
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,470
This is...

481
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,030
Thank you, Nan Hua.

482
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,960
Ms. Xi,

483
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,640
did you draw these?

484
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,210
You designed these?

485
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,470
I designed them.

486
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,840
What's wrong?

487
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,420
These accessories...

488
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,290
Nan Hua, what's wrong?

489
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,120
Nan Hua.

490
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,200
After I sell them

491
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,200
to raise the initial funds,

492
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,920
I will devote myself to saving the country.

493
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,490
When the country stabilizes,

494
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,160
I'll come back to you

495
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,980
to fulfill our promise made 1,000 years ago.

496
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,060
It's chaotic outside.

497
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:54,480
Be careful.

498
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,600
Nan Hua,

499
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:16,000
I'm in trouble. It's very tricky.

500
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,270
Can you help me again?

501
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,450
What can I do for you?

502
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:24,040
I need...

503
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,920
a lot of money.

504
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,230
The front-line battle is intense, and there is a shortage of medical supplies.

505
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,690
The situation is very bad.

506
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,910
How much do you need?

507
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,860
100,000 silver coins.

508
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,470
100,000?

509
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,110
But I gave all my valuable things

510
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,750
to you last time.

511
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,560
What should I do then?

512
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,310
Nan Hua, please.

513
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,470
Please think of another way.

514
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,600
Wait a minute.

515
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,650
I removed these gems

516
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,840
from the coffin

517
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,680
where I sleep.

518
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,340
They are worth some money.

519
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,850
Maybe it's not enough,

520
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,990
but it should be helpful.

521
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:56,720
This is great.

522
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,750
Nan Hua, thank you.

523
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:02,850
I'm glad that I have you.

524
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,520
I should go.

525
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,550
Be careful.

526
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,530
Write me a letter if anything happens.

527
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:28,990
Nan Hua,

528
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,920
I don't know when I can come back again

529
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,760
after I leave this time.

530
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,880
No matter how long it will take,

531
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,880
I will be here.

532
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,920
But the world is so chaotic outside.

533
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,920
I'm worried if we separate today...

534
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,430
If... you want me to stay,

535
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,630
I won't leave.

536
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,670
You have something important to do.

537
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,520
Don't delay it because of me.

538
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,720
You really don't want me to stay?

539
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,400
As long as you tell me

540
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,880
you want me to stay,

541
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,880
I will stay and be with you forever.

542
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,960
Nan Hua, I miss you.

543
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,190
I hope everything is fine when you see this letter.

544
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,920
It's been years since we separated.

545
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,250
I wonder if you are okay.

546
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,000
I think the cherry tree in the yard must be covered with blossoms now.

547
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,720
The scene of our farewell back then

548
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,800
feels like a distant memory.

549
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:08,790
Now, with victories from the frontline, success is in sight.

550
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:12,360
Everyone is raising funds to support and strengthen the army.

551
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,680
But I'm unable to do what I want to do.

552
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,800
I'm from a poor family.

553
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,400
But I'm lucky

554
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,160
to have you, who have supported me till now.

555
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,650
Now, I've used up all the money.

556
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,440
I'm penniless.

557
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,200
It makes me so anxious.

558
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,470
I hope you can forgive me for being wilful

559
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,430
for the sake of the bond we shared.

560
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,580
I've always followed my heart

561
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,070
and prioritized the safety of the country.

562
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,460
[Title deed]

563
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,770
You gave me money to buy supplies for the army.

564
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,200
Thank you.

565
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:47,550
I'm tearful when I'm writing this letter. I don't know what I'm writing.

566
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,580
I only hope when the war is over

567
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,740
and the flowers bloom,

568
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:54,030
I can reunite with you in that house

569
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:57,190
and enjoy the blooming and falling of the cherry tree's flowers in the yard.

570
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:02,240
I don't think there's anything else in the world better than this.

571
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,910
Don't worry about me.

572
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,470
Yinting.

573
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,120
Taiping,

574
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,730
in order to help Miss Zhou,

575
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,450
I have no choice.

576
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,640
I'll buy you back

577
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,480
when there is a chance in the future.

578
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,240
But...

579
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,840
I have nothing now.

580
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,320
Nan Hua?

581
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,880
Nan Hua?

582
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,000
I remember now.

583
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:52,230
I remember why Taiping was sold.

584
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,430
What?

585
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,010
And these accessories.

586
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,390
Ms. Xi,

587
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,360
are you sure...

588
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,490
you designed these?

589
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:16,710
Of course.

590
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,920
Do you know someone named... Zhou Yinting?

591
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,510
No.

592
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,930
This person is...

593
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:35,580
No one.

594
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,400
What's going on, Jin Xia?

595
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,520
I'm sorry, Nan Hua.

596
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,530
I unconsciously plagiarized

597
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,070
Ms. Xi's design of the earrings

598
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,550
when I was drunk.

599
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,330
I planned to tell you when this is over.

600
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,520
Sorry.

601
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,440
Sorry, Ms. Xi.

602
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,340
I suddenly don't feel well.

603
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,790
I'll take my leave today.

604
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:25,120
If there is anything else, we'll talk about it next time.

605
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,480
It's okay.

606
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:27,940
Are you okay?

607
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,929
I'm fine.

608
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,040
Thank you for your concern.

609
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:33,909
I'm leaving.

610
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,960
You should walk your boyfriend out.

611
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,230
He looks... really pale.

612
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,160
No need, Ms. Xi.

613
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,630
I have work to do.

614
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,030
It's not working hours now.

615
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,520
You should drive him home.

616
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,280
Aren't you two living together?

617
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,010
Ms. Xi, I have to work overtime.

618
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,240
I still need to do pattern making for a few sets of clothes.

619
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,640
And... I haven't made up

620
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,960
for my unfinished work.

621
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,820
In a word, I have many things to do.

622
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,950
Okay... then.

623
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,630
You should strike a proper balance between work and rest.

624
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:25,160
Otherwise, you will get half the results with twice the effort.

625
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:26,830
Jin Xia.

626
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,400
Are you okay?

627
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,130
I'm fine, Ms. Xi.

628
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,640
Really?

629
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,720
Yes.

630
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,560
Then... how long do you plan

631
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,620
to sit in my office?

632
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,690
Sorry, Ms. Xi.

633
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:42,970
I'm leaving now.

634
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,840
Hello, Miss.

635
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,100
My name is Nan Hua.

636
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,910
I'm an architect.

637
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:32,070
Have we... met before?

638
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,650
Finally, you are here. I've been waiting for you.

639
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:33,950
If you don't agree to be my boyfriend,

640
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,210
I'll jump into the sea.

641
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,080
Calm... down.

642
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,070
I agree.

643
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,240
Really?

644
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,360
Guys, I have a boyfriend.

645
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,660
This is my boyfriend.

646
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,360
What do you think? He's handsome, right?

647
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,920
Call me Darling from now on.

648
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,470
D-Darling?

649
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,840
You don't like it?

650
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:00,920
You can also call me Naughty Little Kiss

651
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,790
or Fairy Baby.

652
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:04,270
Darling. Darling is good.

653
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,360
You're not alone.

654
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,360
Nan Hua,

655
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,440
can you not disappear?

656
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,590
I'm your power bank, right?

657
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,960
Is it possible

658
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,320
that even if the ancient cherry tree withers,

659
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,190
I can still keep recharging you

660
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,150
as long as I'm with you?

661
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,160
If you don't mind,

662
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,560
we can try.

663
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,720
Let me recharge you for the rest of my life.

664
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:58,680
[Nan Hua]

665
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:50,920
It tastes good.

666
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,040
Will I...

667
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,320
not have a chance to drink it anymore?

668
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,150
Jin Xia,

669
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,350
how can you give up so easily?

670
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,990
Maybe Ms. Xi is not the one Nan Hua has been waiting for.

671
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:23,720
Even if she is,

672
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,390
they are not together yet.

673
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:28,710
You still have the right to compete for him.

674
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:30,670
You should try your best

675
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,840
to fight for him.

676
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:43,260
