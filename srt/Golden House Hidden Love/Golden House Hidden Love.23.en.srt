00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,160
In the several thousand years of human history,

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,040
there have been many unsolved mysteries.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,960
Are the stories of Dayu controlling the flood and Nvwa mending the sky myths?

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,560
Why would the advancement of human civilization

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,760
surpass its current situations?

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,800
There are all kinds of speculations.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,760
But in fact, the truth

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,760
dates back to the ancient times.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,400
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,720
the highly developed

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,350
prehistoric civilizations once existed on Earth.

13
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,680
Back then, the ancient people

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,080
mastered the scientific civilization far more advanced than that in modern society.

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,150
Their high-level genetic modification technology

16
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,280
even enabled them to develop

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,390
human potential to the greatest extent.

18
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,950
They could absorb the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth

19
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,810
to stay alive and even exert extraordinary energy.

20
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,720
However, a tragic doomsday disaster

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,390
made those human beings almost extinct at that time.

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,710
Countless lives

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,910
and brilliant civilizations were destroyed overnight.

24
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,950
Only a small number of ancient people

25
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,560
survived the doomsday

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,330
after escaping to the underground in time

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,789
and entering into a frozen hibernation state.

28
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:14,450
After that,

29
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,190
through tens of thousands of years of self-repair,

30
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,480
our Earth conceived new intelligent lives again,

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,740
namely, the ancestors of modern people.

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,080
And the ancient people sleeping in the underground areas

33
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,480
woke up one after another

34
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,160
and returned to the land.

35
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,870
They saw

36
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,830
the new primitive humans who were still trying to make fire by drilling wood.

37
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,920
Out of good intentions,

38
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,030
they taught the younger generations

39
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,030
many technologies, such as farming, metallurgy,

40
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,800
construction, flood control, and precautions against natural disasters.

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,729
Many great civilization miracles

42
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,120
were the masterpieces made

43
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,850
by our ancestors with the help of ancient people.

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,759
At that time, the new human beings

45
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,920
[Fuxi Temple]

46
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,960
considered the ancient people with extraordinary energy as deities.

47
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,690
They built temples for them and worshipped them.

48
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,200
As the official historians of various countries exaggerated the stories about them,

49
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,720
many legendary ancient myths have been passed down till now.

50
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,240
In this way,

51
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,440
most ancient people around the world

52
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,360
fitted into the new world with the identities

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,520
of deities.

54
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,840
But there were also some low-profile ancient people

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,300
who chose to live in seclusion in deep mountains to escape from the mortal world.

56
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,070
However,

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,320
people's worship towards the deities

58
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,400
also gradually generated fear and desires.

59
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,200
The rulers feared that the power of deities

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,840
would become a threat to their royal power.

61
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,390
But they were also greedy

62
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,120
for immortality and the extraordinary power.

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,780
Therefore,

64
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,720
they used various excuses

65
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
to start wars

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,850
against the deities from time to time.

67
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,829
The ancient people were outnumbered

68
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,320
and were no match for the huge armies in the end.

69
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,920
They almost became extinct.

70
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,600
Little did they know

71
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,960
that by imparting the knowledge of weapon forging to the new humans

72
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,160
they unwittingly unleashed a disaster upon themselves.

73
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,840
Although the ancient people who lived in deep mountains

74
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,400
survived this disaster,

75
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,920
they were hunted by the rulers continuously.

76
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,240
They were even slandered

77
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,510
and considered as horrible mountain spirits or ferocious ghosts.

78
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,880
In the blink of an eye,

79
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,750
those who had been regarded as deities became devils that everyone wanted to kill.

80
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,240
As everything keeps changing in the world,

81
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,920
no one knows the existence of the ancient people anymore.

82
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,270
Only those anecdotes and peculiar stories about ghosts and monsters

83
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,360
have been passed down from generation to generation.

84
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,079
And the tiny minority of ancient people who have survived

85
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,750
are still secretly hiding

86
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,630
in those covert corners in the world till now.

87
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,280
Stop crying, Jin Xia.

88
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,830
Crying won't help.

89
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,400
If Nan Hua sees you like this,

90
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,190
he would be very sad.

91
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,200
He's already very sad.

92
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,200
Brace yourself up, Jin Xia.

93
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,840
No, no.

94
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,390
There will be a way.

95
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,750
There will be a way.

96
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,430
When did you come?

97
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,430
It's cold.

98
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,950
It's windy by the beach. It's easy to catch a cold.

99
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,370
I brought you a coat.

100
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,640
I'm fine.

101
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,520
Go back and rest now.

102
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,650
Stop running around for me.

103
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,950
Actually, lying down is boring.

104
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,120
I want to take a walk outside too.

105
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,240
I'm sorry, Nan Hua.

106
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,159
If it weren't for me,

107
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,520
you would have directly refused

108
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,850
Grandma Zhou's legacy.

109
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:52,030
But it has become like this.

110
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,920
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,310
If it weren't for you,

112
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,300
I wouldn't have known what happiness is.

113
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,600
Jin Xia,

114
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,510
the separation in life or death is normal in life.

115
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,450
I've lived too long.

116
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,730
I can't force you

117
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,800
to get used to it or understand it like me.

118
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,730
But separation is not the worst.

119
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,200
The biggest regret

120
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,560
is not being able to say goodbye properly before getting separated.

121
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,960
So, spend the last few days

122
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,400
with me happily.

123
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,040
Okay?

124
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,520
Nan Hua,

125
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,200
let's advance the wedding to next week.

126
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,040
Let me think.

127
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,560
It will take two days to make the wedding clothes.

128
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,830
I still need to design

129
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:34,880
and prepare...

130
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,560
Wait.

131
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,720
No, I...

132
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,960
Do you want to call off the wedding?

133
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,990
No.

134
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,490
It's just that I'm about to disappear.

135
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,150
If I marry you, it will hold you back.

136
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,230
What are you talking about?

137
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,220
This is a modern era.

138
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,840
No matter how many times people get married,

139
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,900
it's not a big deal.

140
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,050
I'll be angry if you say that again.

141
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,240
In the future, if I recall I've never

142
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,120
got to marry you till I die,

143
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,920
I won't rest in peace after I die.

144
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,000
I just thought about it.

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,280
Actually, there are many ways

146
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,680
to gather a lot of energy.

147
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:16,950
Like?

148
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,270
Calling down thunder.

149
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,920
A moderate-intensity thunderstorm

150
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,160
can generate up to 10 million watts of power.

151
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,360
Power is not helpful.

152
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,370
What about wind energy, hydroenergy, and solar energy?

153
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
The energy of nature is not helpful.

154
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,870
What about non-natural energy?

155
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,310
Xiaochuan, you are so rich.

156
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,170
Don't you have any high-tech way?

157
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,590
No.

158
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,910
The technology in ancient times is far more advanced

159
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,970
than modern technology by at least a few million years.

160
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,930
It's impossible to make it available now.

161
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,070
How could it be?

162
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,160
Thank you for today.

163
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,320
We're back.

164
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,960
What's wrong with them?

165
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,850
Are they out of their minds?

166
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,200
Nan Hua, you tell them.

167
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,840
Jin Xia and I plan to get married next Saturday.

168
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,120
But we want the wedding to be simple.

169
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,640
Our best man and bridesmaid, please help us with it.

170
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,840
No problem.

171
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,600
No problem.

172
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,270
Okay.

173
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,870
Then I'm going

174
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,470
to make the wedding clothes now.

175
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,670
I may need you to help me buy materials.

176
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,390
I'll give you the list later.

177
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,010
Let's start tomorrow.

178
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,640
Then... where is the wedding venue?

179
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,670
We haven't decided yet.

180
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,440
But we think it's good enough as long as it's simple and cozy.

181
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You still need to work on it as soon as possible.

182
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,730
The clock is ticking, friends.

183
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,170
Let's talk inside.

184
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,800
Okay, let's go.

185
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,170
What's that smell?

186
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,880
So this is the smell of a home.

187
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,510
It's so fragrant and attractive.

188
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,230
I'm so happy.

189
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,430
You've done so much for me.

190
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,710
I think... I should return the favor.

191
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,210
If we are gonna get married,

192
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,670
a house and a dream won't be enough.

193
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,970
We still need a set of wedding clothes.

194
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,640
Mr. Model, I wonder if it's convenient for you tonight.

195
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,120
Of course.

196
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,370
I didn't expect myself

197
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,920
to be inspired

198
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,120
by this kind of thing.

199
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,760
Xiaochuan.

200
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,990
Did you draw this?

201
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,720
Yes.

202
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,570
Did you really draw it?

203
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,730
Yes, why?

204
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,770
Your inspiration came from...

205
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,850
Yesterday, I smelled the sachet Nan Hua gave me.

206
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,160
Then I got the inspiration.

207
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,670
What's wrong?

208
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,450
Did I plagiarize again?

209
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,180
Impossible.

210
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,850
Impossible.

211
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,870
I mean...

212
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,000
the design of this attire looks complicated.

213
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,100
Can you make it in a short time?

214
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,240
If I hurry it,

215
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,560
I think I can finish it in time.

216
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,200
It's just that...

217
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,350
I don't know if I can buy the materials nearby.

218
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,870
If I buy them online, I don't think they can be delivered in time.

219
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,600
Don't worry.

220
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,150
I'll ask someone to send a plane to get them.

221
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,560
A plane?

222
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,990
I mean... Mr. Li's private plane.

223
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,400
Great.

224
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,540
When Nan Hua wakes up,

225
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,680
I'll show it to him.

226
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,270
Don't.

227
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,690
Don't show it to him.

228
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,070
Why?

229
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:50,150
Show it to him on the wedding day.

230
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,230
Give him a surprise.

231
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,220
He will love it very much.

232
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,200
Thank you, everyone.

233
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,440
We only have one week.

234
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,280
We are really pressed for time.

235
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,430
I will pay you

236
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,960
according to the payment norms in the industry.

237
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,240
Don't talk about money.

238
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,920
We're here to help voluntarily.

239
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,850
Consider it a wedding gift for you.

240
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,400
But your time...

241
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,880
I asked for an annual leave.

242
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,360
I haven't found a new job yet.

243
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,510
I can postpone my interview for a few days.

244
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,270
Don't worry.

245
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,480
Since we are here,

246
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,590
we will help you wholeheartedly.

247
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,350
Thank you.

248
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,600
You're welcome.

249
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,960
But... why are you in such a hurry suddenly?

250
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,820
The day seven days from now

251
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,120
is very important

252
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,590
to Nan Hua and me.

253
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,670
Thank you.

254
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,040
Don't stand on ceremony.

255
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,870
I'll quit if you stand on ceremony again.

256
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:07,880
Since you've decided,

257
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,040
don't worry about anything else.

258
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,950
Leave it to us.

259
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:10,830
That's right.

260
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,100
But... Nan Hua is wearing so many clothes. Doesn't he feel hot?

261
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
He...

262
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,730
I'm going to the studio.

263
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,200
I want to go too.

264
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,720
You can't go with me.

265
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,310
Why not?

266
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,830
Your physical condition is not good,

267
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,360
and the studio is too far away.

268
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,360
Just stay at home, okay?

269
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,080
I must go just because the studio is too far away.

270
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,690
Otherwise, I won't be able to see you for quite some time.

271
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,280
Are you acting cute?

272
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,270
I really...

273
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,040
don't want to leave you, even just for a second.

274
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,120
Just let him go with you.

275
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,540
The situation can't be worse.

276
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,160
Now, each day is very precious

277
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,800
to both of you.

278
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,120
Xiaochuan is right.

279
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,630
I should have been thick-skinned

280
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,960
and asked them to make the clothes at home.

281
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,720
Why don't we give up making the wedding clothes?

282
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,880
No. We must make them.

283
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,200
I want to wear the wedding attire you're making for me.

284
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,120
Okay.

285
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,990
He has a cold and is afraid of getting chilled.

286
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,440
He should rest at home if he has a cold.

287
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,040
How can he recover like this?

288
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,090
He insisted on coming.

289
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,990
Again, Jin Xia.

290
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,720
All right, I'll leave you to it.

291
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,840
I'm going to check on him.

292
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
-Okay.
-Okay.

293
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,370
How are you feeling? Are you tired?

294
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,670
I didn't do anything.

295
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,970
Why would I be tired?

296
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
But... you've lost too much strength

297
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,960
just by sitting here.

298
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,360
Being unable to see you is the most tiring thing.

299
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,790
Okay.

300
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,670
If you're tired and you can't hold on any longer,

301
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,280
let me know.

302
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,470
Thank you for today.

303
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,870
You've thanked us 100 times.

304
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,430
Let's call it a day today.

305
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,290
See you at the same time tomorrow.

306
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,950
We're going back.

307
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:10,920
See you tomorrow.

308
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,390
Bye.

309
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,690
-Bye. See you tomorrow.
-Bye, Jin Xia.

310
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,350
Thank you.

311
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,080
Have a good rest.

312
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,240
Don't worry about me.

313
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:05,070
I can... take good care of myself.

314
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,520
Look. Before you showed up,

315
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,400
I was very independent.

316
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,870
I lived on my own.

317
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,390
I worked on my own.

318
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,680
And I bought a big house.

319
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,260
But... I don't know why

320
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,270
I seem to have become more dependent on you.

321
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,760
I can't imagine

322
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,960
what will happen to me

323
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,510
without you by my side.

324
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,280
I don't want to get remarried.

325
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,560
I just want to be with you.

326
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,600
Nan Hua,

327
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,080
I promise you.

328
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,240
I will try my best to live well and cherish my life.

329
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,710
Can you promise me

330
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,510
you will come back to me one day?

331
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,240
Okay?

332
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,100
No matter how long it will take...

333
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,690
No matter how long it will take,

334
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,950
I'll wait for you.

335
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,240
You're awake.

336
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,150
Why...

337
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,990
Why are we here?

338
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,240
We're here to make the wedding clothes.

339
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,330
Have you forgotten?

340
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,800
Maybe my spiritual energy has been consumed too fast these days.

341
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,010
So I start to forget things again.

342
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,880
I'm sorry.

343
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,500
I forgot such an important thing.

344
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,840
It's okay.

345
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
It's fine as long as we are together.

346
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,590
I'll remember it.

347
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,880
Xiaochuan, are you alright?

348
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,360
I'm fine. I'm just a little tired.

349
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,390
A little?

350
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,200
You've recharged it six times today.

351
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,880
Six times?

352
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,150
When?

353
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,610
Xiaochuan,

354
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,690
it seems... you've been increasingly forgetful recently.

355
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,290
Just like my brother before.

356
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,080
Maybe.

357
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,600
Stop recharging it so frequently, okay?

358
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,510
I'm fine.

359
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,510
Don't worry about me.

360
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,100
Chuchen has been like this for a few thousand years.

361
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,480
Who cared about him?

362
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:18,000
I'm just suffering a little.

363
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,440
I deserve this.

364
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,800
If I stop,

365
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,750
what should Chuchen do?

366
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,630
At least I should let him make it till his wedding is over.

367
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,790
According to our report,

368
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,600
tonight,

369
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,040
a Geminid meteor shower will occur in this city.

370
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,360
The best location to watch it

371
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,240
is Wangqi Town, a coastal town.

372
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,230
This will be the third meteor shower

373
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,240
occurring in this coastal town this year.

374
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,720
The rare high frequency

375
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,040
has captured the attention

376
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,270
of the astronomical community and astronomy enthusiasts.

377
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,960
People are heading to Wangqi Town

378
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,440
to watch the meteor shower.

379
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,700
A meteor shower again.

380
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,970
Why are there so many meteor showers in Wangqi Town?

381
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,430
You've been here for so long.

382
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,660
You must have seen thousands of meteor showers, right?

383
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:38,710
No.

384
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,400
Actually, I haven't seen too many meteor showers

385
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,120
in the past over 2,000 years.

386
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,080
But I've seen a lot since you came.

387
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,880
Is it... because of me?

388
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:14,010
It's because of my intervention.

389
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,210
Because of you?

390
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,360
Xiaochuan, you can change the orbits of meteors?

391
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,220
More precisely, it's because of spiritual energy.

392
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,400
When I recharged the cherry tree,

393
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,730
a lot of energy overflowed.

394
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,680
It affected the magnetic fields of celestial bodies.

395
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,510
I see.

396
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,080
I had never seen a meteor before.

397
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,970
But I saw two meteor showers this year.

398
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,830
And they landed at the same place.

399
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,040
Wait.

400
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,190
Will I... be hit again?

401
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,150
My spiritual energy is too weak now.

402
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,750
Meteors won't be attracted to this very place.

403
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:53,040
But... they might land in other places of this town.

404
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,400
He's too weak.

405
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,690
I'm afraid he can't make it to the wedding day.

406
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,710
I'm going to make the wedding clothes.

407
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,480
One day.

408
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,310
I'll finish them within one day.

409
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:33,770
The wedding...

410
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,440
will take place tomorrow.

411
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,860
Can we get everything ready by tomorrow?

412
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,590
Yes.

413
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,160
I'm sure we can.

414
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,080
Help me arrange the venue, okay?

415
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,880
Okay, I'll go immediately.

416
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,920
Thank you.

417
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,050
Put this over there.

418
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:39,960
Miss,

419
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,770
don't use too many white flowers.

420
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:42,920
Remove some.

421
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,429
Move this over there.

422
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,730
Move the flowers towards the inside.

423
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,760
Xiaochuan,

424
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,310
we are almost done here.

425
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:11,480
We did everything according to Jin Xia's requirements.

426
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,680
But we didn't have enough time.

427
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,290
We arranged everything in a hurry.

428
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,500
I don't know

429
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,170
if they will like it.

430
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:19,800
Bro,

431
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,370
let's... scatter them.

432
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,880
Chuchen, you're finally getting married.

433
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,810
It's not necessary to water this tree.

434
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,150
Why?

435
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,430
This is not an ordinary tree.

436
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,660
It's an utensil used by ancient people

437
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,320
to collect spiritual energy.

438
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,560
What are you doing?

439
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,270
Making a wish to shooting stars.

440
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,200
Making a wish?

441
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:50,400
When the cherry tree is covered with blossoms,

442
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,520
I will come back.

443
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,690
After that,

444
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,730
I won't leave again.

445
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:08,920
Nan Hua?

446
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,160
Nan Hua?

447
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,880
I'm Jin Xia.

448
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:23,620
Jin Xia? You are Jin Xia?

449
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,150
Yes.

450
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,820
You don't remember me?

451
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,130
That's not it.

452
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,160
Your outfit

453
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,430
is exactly the same

454
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,260
as that of the real Nan Hua.

455
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,120
Really?

456
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:52,720
Yes.

457
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,200
Her outfit was very special.

458
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,440
I have a deep impression. I won't be mistaken.

459
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:08,950
Maybe... it's a coincidence.

460
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,440
Maybe not.

461
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,300
Then what is it?

462
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,100
Maybe...

463
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,690
you have a connection with her.

464
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,910
If you say so.

465
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,440
I'm sorry. Yesterday, I...

466
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,240
It's okay.

467
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,840
Are you feeling better today?

468
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,470
Much better.

469
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,110
That's good.

470
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,410
I have good news for you.

471
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:10,400
We... are getting married today.

472
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,040
Today?

473
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,760
How long did I sleep?

474
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,870
Just one night.

475
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,710
But... I can't wait any longer.

476
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,550
Let's advance the wedding, okay?

477
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,360
Okay.

478
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,120
What do you think? Do you like it?

479
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,130
I like it very much.

480
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,820
Then I'm going there to get ready.

481
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,550
Okay.

482
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,180
How are you holding up?

483
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,020
I'm fine.

484
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,930
Let's go over there.

485
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,310
Thank you,

486
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,640
Xiuning.

487
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,480
We gather here today

488
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,150
for Nan Hua,

489
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,970
the person I admire the most in this world,

490
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,290
and Jin Xia, my best friend.

491
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,590
At this sacred moment,

492
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,400
I sincerely wish the two of you

493
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:38,630
togetherness, a lifetime...

494
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:50,310
living in the moment, and abundant happiness.

495
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,740
The bride and the bridegroom,

496
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,920
please read your wedding vows.

497
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,640
I've studied wedding design for so many years.

498
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,030
I never dared to hope

499
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,110
that one day I could also wear a wedding gown.

500
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,600
Will you...

501
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:36,160
marry... me

502
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,720
and become the master of the Nan family?

503
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,180
I...

504
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:02,560
I do.

505
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,040
Back then,

506
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,600
you scared me a lot.

507
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:13,770
I was afraid of you. I don't remember when

508
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:19,080
I started to want to get close to you,

509
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,150
love you,

510
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,440
and rely on you.

511
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:32,920
I...

512
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,200
I don't think I'm a very lucky person.

513
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,110
Meeting you

514
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,240
is the biggest miracle in my life.

515
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:58,960
Jin Xia,

516
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,520
you are my miracle.

517
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,120
You know what?

518
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,170
You always said I've been taking care of you.

519
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:18,840
Actually, you saved me.

520
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:25,230
This is the first time that I feel happy in my life.

521
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:30,150
Nan Hua, can you not disappear?

522
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,600
I'm your power bank, right?

523
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,960
Is it possible

524
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,250
that even if the ancient cherry tree withers,

525
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,210
I can still keep recharging you

526
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,120
as long as I'm with you?

527
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,280
If you don't mind,

528
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:54,640
we can try.

529
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,760
Let me recharge you for the rest of my life.

530
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:00,720
In the past,

531
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,430
you were part of my life

532
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,280
and supported my decisions.

533
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,200
In the future, I want to be part of your life

534
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,120
and support your decisions.

535
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,490
Because that was the first time...

536
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,090
the first time that someone needed me so much.

537
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,550
It was not my wealth or ability she needed,

538
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:36,050
but my company and care.

539
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,570
Destiny and previous lives

540
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,680
have always been the biggest villains in my life.

541
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,170
You also made me understand

542
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,110
[Title deed]

543
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,050
instead of thinking

544
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:56,640
about the intangible destiny,

545
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,110
I should cherish the one in front of me.

546
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,110
Finally, I'm no longer...

547
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,900
the ancient tree waiting in the yard.

548
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,400
Don't be sad.

549
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:27,240
Because no matter how far the moon is from Earth,

550
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,160
even if it's so far that you can't see it,

551
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:35,480
it won't leave the gravitational field of Earth.

552
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:43,420
Promise me

553
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:46,820
you will be happy.

554
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,350
I promise you.

555
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,560
The bride and the bridegroom, please exchange rings.

556
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,320
Nan Hua!

557
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,320
Nan Hua!

558
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:13,870
Nan Hua!

559
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,120
Nan Hua.

560
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,840
