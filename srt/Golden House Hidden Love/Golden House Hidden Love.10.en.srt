00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,190
In the several thousand years of human history,

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,070
there have been many unsolved mysteries.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,990
Are the stories of Dayu controlling the flood and Nvwa mending the sky myths?

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,600
Why would the advancement of human civilization

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,790
surpass its current situations?

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,830
There are all kinds of speculations.

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,790
But in fact, the truth

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,790
dates back to the ancient times.

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,290
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

11
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,750
the highly developed

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,250
prehistoric civilizations once existed on Earth.

13
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,710
Back then, the ancient people

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,930
mastered the scientific civilization far more advanced than that in modern society.

15
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,190
Their high-level genetic modification technology

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,310
even enabled them to develop

17
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,140
human potential to the greatest extent.

18
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,990
They could absorb the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth

19
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,850
to stay alive and even exert extraordinary energy.

20
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,750
However, a tragic doomsday disaster

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,430
made those human beings almost extinct at that time.

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,750
Countless lives

23
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,950
and brilliant civilizations were destroyed overnight.

24
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,990
Only a small number of ancient people

25
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,590
survived the doomsday

26
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,360
after escaping to the underground in time

27
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,830
and entering into a frozen hibernation state.

28
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,490
After that,

29
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,220
through tens of thousands of years of self-repair,

30
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,510
our Earth conceived new intelligent lives again,

31
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,770
namely, the ancestors of modern people.

32
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,110
And the ancient people sleeping in the underground areas

33
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,510
woke up one after another

34
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,190
and returned to the land.

35
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,910
They saw

36
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,870
the new primitive humans who were still trying to make fire by drilling wood.

37
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:32,950
Out of good intentions,

38
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,070
they taught the younger generations

39
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,070
many technologies, such as farming, metallurgy,

40
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,830
construction, flood control, and precautions against natural disasters.

41
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,759
Many great civilization miracles

42
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:43,150
were the masterpieces made

43
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,880
by our ancestors with the help of ancient people.

44
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,789
At that time, the new human beings

45
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:51,920
[Fuxi Temple]

46
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:51,990
considered the ancient people with extraordinary energy as deities.

47
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,720
They built temples for them and worshipped them.

48
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:58,229
As the official historians of various countries exaggerated the stories about them,

49
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,750
many legendary ancient myths have been passed down till now.

50
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,090
In this way,

51
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,320
most ancient people around the world

52
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,300
fitted into the new world with the identities

53
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,630
of deities.

54
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,790
But there were also some low-profile ancient people

55
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,250
who chose to live in seclusion in deep mountains to escape from the mortal world.

56
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,010
However,

57
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,240
people's worship towards the deities

58
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,320
also gradually generated fear and desires.

59
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,180
The rulers feared that the power of deities

60
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,870
would become a threat to their royal power.

61
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,430
But they were also greedy

62
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,150
for immortality and the extraordinary power.

63
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:31,810
Therefore,

64
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,750
they used various excuses

65
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,750
to start wars

66
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,880
against the deities from time to time.

67
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,870
The ancient people were outnumbered

68
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,350
and were no match for the huge armies in the end.

69
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,950
They almost became extinct.

70
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:45,630
Little did they know

71
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,000
that by imparting the knowledge of weapon forging to the new humans

72
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,200
they unwittingly unleashed a disaster upon themselves.

73
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,870
Although the ancient people who lived in deep mountains

74
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,430
survived this disaster,

75
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,950
they were hunted by the rulers continuously.

76
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,270
They were even slandered

77
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,550
and considered as horrible mountain spirits or ferocious ghosts.

78
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,910
In the blink of an eye,

79
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,790
those who had been regarded as deities became devils that everyone wanted to kill.

80
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,270
As everything keeps changing in the world,

81
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,950
no one knows the existence of the ancient people anymore.

82
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,310
Only those anecdotes and peculiar stories about ghosts and monsters

83
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,390
have been passed down from generation to generation.

84
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,110
And the tiny minority of ancient people who have survived

85
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,790
are still secretly hiding

86
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,660
in those covert corners in the world till now.

87
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,240
It's not necessary to water this tree.

88
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,329
Why?

89
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,579
Because it's different from those ordinary trees.

90
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:41,510
It's a utensil that we ancient people use to collect spiritual energy.

91
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,590
Look at its branches. There are many flowers there.

92
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,460
In fact, it embodies that my spiritual energy is sufficient.

93
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,790
If I have sufficient spiritual energy,

94
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,120
it will be full of vigor.

95
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,630
Otherwise, it will decay and wither.

96
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,300
It has nothing to do with whether you water it and apply fertilizers to it or not.

97
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,260
It's so amazing.

98
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,530
Does every ancient man

99
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,250
have two cherry trees?

100
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,760
It looks as if there were two trees.

101
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,130
Actually, their roots

102
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,280
are entangled together underground.

103
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,510
It's the same tree with twin tree crowns on both sides.

104
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,790
This utensil is really special.

105
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,870
Every ancient man has his own unique utensil.

106
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,970
These utensils are in various forms.

107
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,970
As for what exactly their forms are,

108
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,890
it's our most important secret.

109
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,370
Secret?

110
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,910
Because the utensils are carriers of immortality and extraordinary energy.

111
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,890
Those who can be connected with these utensils

112
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,890
will be able to get all the power of the ancient people.

113
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,150
Well...

114
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,310
You have to protect the utensils well.

115
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,800
Of course.

116
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,520
Don't worry.

117
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,409
I'll never reveal this secret.

118
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,110
Utensils?

119
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,200
Immortality?

120
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,590
What are you doing?

121
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,490
It's the decoration plan?

122
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,400
You've drawn so much.

123
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,560
This is my room?

124
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:34,950
Yes.

125
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,270
See if there's anything you want to modify.

126
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,240
Everything is fine.

127
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,540
Can I add a dream catching net?

128
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,390
When I was a kid, I really wanted this kind of

129
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,930
British-countryside-style dream catching nets

130
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:50,950
and curtains.

131
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,050
But my family didn't have the economic conditions to buy them.

132
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:59,920
I didn't expect that I could finally have the chance to decorate my room with them.

133
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,870
I didn't expect that

134
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,310
I would have the chance to talk with others

135
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,110
about how to design my own house.

136
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,070
Tomorrow, I'll get ready for purchasing materials

137
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,870
and start renovating the house.

138
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,070
Wait.

139
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,860
Will this style's dream catching nets and curtains

140
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,750
be quite different from

141
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,980
the ancient Chinese style decoration you've designed?

142
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,910
I've given up that plan.

143
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,400
I'll make a plan again.

144
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,450
Why?

145
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,750
Don't you want Taiping to look the same

146
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,750
as it used to be in the ancient times?

147
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,500
The purpose was to help you find your way back home.

148
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,150
Since you're back now,

149
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,290
I'll certainly give priority to your ideas.

150
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,670
Let's combine

151
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,800
our aesthetic preferences together.

152
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,270
After all, we will live in the same house for a very long time

153
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,390
in the future.

154
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,220
Don't always make a concession for me.

155
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,520
We won't live together for so long.

156
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,310
When this flowering phase ends,

157
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,490
I will leave.

158
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,550
You'll leave?

159
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,800
Why?

160
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,470
Didn't you say that you couldn't leave this house?

161
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,130
Last time when you were drunk,

162
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:31,040
actually, I already told you about it.

163
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,840
But it seems that you have forgotten it.

164
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,490
I'll tell you again today.

165
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,430
The roots of the ancient cherry tree have completely withered.

166
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:47,170
This is the last time that it has sprouted

167
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,420
and bloomed.

168
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,830
What do you mean?

169
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,570
This is my last flowering phase.

170
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,040
When winter comes,

171
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,990
I will disappear forever.

172
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,930
You'll disappear forever?

173
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,790
What does that mean?

174
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,790
It means

175
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,340
I'll die

176
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:25,960
and turn into ashes.

177
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,679
If the roots have withered, we can save them, and it'll be fine.

178
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,309
We can hire a professional gardener and ask him to check the tree.

179
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,350
This ancient tree is not an ordinary plant.

180
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,100
It's an ancient utensil that has been modified.

181
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,300
It can't be saved through modern means.

182
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,660
Then let's find another one.

183
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,860
There are many utensils like this, right?

184
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,380
One utensil corresponds to one ancient man.

185
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,600
If I take someone else's utensil away,

186
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,940
it's like killing him to extend my life.

187
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,120
Moreover,

188
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,730
I've never seen other members of my clan for several thousand years.

189
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,350
Maybe I'm the last ancient man

190
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,790
in the world.

191
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,180
Is there... Is there any other way?

192
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:54,300
The ancient civilizations were far more advanced than modern civilizations.

193
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,610
Judging from the current technology levels,

194
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,860
I don't think there is any other way.

195
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,490
I'm a bit sleepy.

196
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,690
I'm going to bed first.

197
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,500
Good night.

198
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,790
Good night.

199
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,270
What's all this about?

200
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,550
No wonder he was in a hurry to sell the earrings.

201
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,030
So, does he want to help me pay off

202
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,090
the house loan before he disappears?

203
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,230
Is he an idiot?

204
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,270
You've got up.

205
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,490
I've finished the decoration plan.

206
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,750
We can start renovating the house today.

207
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,530
You need to make a balance between work and rest.

208
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,820
Go take a rest now.

209
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,770
I'm fine. I'm not sleepy.

210
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,780
I've made some breakfast.

211
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,970
I've prepared lunch for you, too.

212
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,350
Don't forget to take it.

213
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,550
Okay.

214
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:11,780
Can we have fish soup tonight?

215
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,830
Anything is fine.

216
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,800
Let's eat whatever you want to eat.

217
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,330
Okay.

218
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,720
I think I should have breakfast in my company.

219
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,870
I'm not hungry now.

220
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,190
You don't like the food?

221
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,940
It's not like that.

222
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:31,770
I'll eat.

223
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,750
Don't worry about me.

224
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,390
I've been trapped here.

225
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,250
Immortality has only brought me loneliness.

226
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,820
Compared with the idea that

227
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,550
I need to go on living alone in this ancient house,

228
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,030
death might be

229
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,310
a good thing for me.

230
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,620
Besides, I've seen you again after my long waiting.

231
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,090
My wish has come true.

232
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,940
I feel satisfied now.

233
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,570
Well,

234
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,880
is there anything else

235
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,370
which you want to do but you haven't done yet?

236
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,710
Just tell me.

237
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,860
I'll do my best to help you.

238
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:33,890
Really?

239
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,390
Of course.

240
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,030
Can you lend me your mobile phone?

241
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,580
Mobile phone?

242
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,180
Ding has said that

243
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,780
we can buy decoration materials online,

244
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,030
and they'll be delivered to our house directly.

245
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,030
It's convenient.

246
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,710
But I don't have a mobile phone or an account.

247
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,170
I can only ask you for them.

248
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,790
Sure.

249
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,610
Thank you.

250
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:05,110
Is there anything else of yours which you still want to do?

251
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,630
I've done everything that I wanted to do

252
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,900
and I could do.

253
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,750
Now,

254
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,430
I just want to help you pay off your house loan

255
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,630
and then finish renovating this house.

256
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,070
I need to leave a contact number.

257
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,680
Can I leave yours?

258
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,910
Just leave Ding's phone number.

259
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,190
I'm going to work.

260
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,560
Okay.

261
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,850
Here you are.

262
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,680
I'm going to work.

263
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,670
Okay.

264
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:21,950
Thank you, sir.

265
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:22,869
You're welcome.

266
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:23,650
Please give me a good comment.

267
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,569
Take care, sir.

268
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:25,079
Okay.

269
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:25,660
Bye.

270
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,750
Ding, put it down.

271
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,750
I can do it myself.

272
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,590
How can I let you

273
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,510
do this kind of heavy work alone?

274
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,730
Jin Xia is really inconsiderate.

275
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,260
If I were her,

276
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,900
I wouldn't have asked you to do this kind of heavy work.

277
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,840
Be careful!

278
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,350
Watch your steps.

279
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:56,750
Bro,

280
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,960
you actually care about me.

281
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,780
It turns out that you're a kind guy.

282
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,790
I alienated you before

283
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,530
because I didn't want to cause trouble for each other.

284
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:09,060
But now I've figured it out.

285
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,660
The social environment is stable now.

286
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,220
It's not like the ancient times when the situations were chaotic and people suffered a lot

287
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,550
as wars often happened.

288
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,970
The worries I had before

289
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,490
seem to be unnecessary concerns now.

290
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,140
Besides,

291
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,680
I'd like to ask you to help me take care of Jin Xia in the future.

292
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,750
Bro, do you mean that

293
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,550
we are friends from now on?

294
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:36,010
We're only neighbors.

295
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,490
Bro, are you going to build the wall by yourself?

296
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,340
Yes.

297
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:56,910
You are not going to do everything by yourself, are you?

298
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,470
Yes. What's wrong?

299
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,590
Shouldn't you ask professional workers to do it?

300
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,710
I'm well acquainted with them in this town.

301
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,030
I can introduce them to you.

302
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:04,750
No need.

303
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,430
I can do all these things myself.

304
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,750
Why should I spend money on hiring others to do them?

305
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,950
Bro, you're so versatile.

306
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,840
You're brilliant indeed.

307
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,700
Let me help you.

308
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,180
Don't bother.

309
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,000
I appreciate your kindness.

310
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,730
But it's not appropriate to trouble the neighbors for such things.

311
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,350
Bro, just don't treat me as your neighbor.

312
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:28,850
Who is it?

313
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:36,970
Please, Mr. Li.

314
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,190
Thank you.

315
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,110
So you mean that

316
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,540
besides the welfare park,

317
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,980
you'll also develop an amusement park, a water park

318
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,080
and a seashore cultural street?

319
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,180
Not only that,

320
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,690
our Qingshi Group

321
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,690
has also decided to fully develop the Wangqi Town.

322
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,350
Our board chairwoman wants to

323
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,540
turn the Wangqi Town

324
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,480
into a top-class tourist attraction in the world.

325
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,550
Is there such a good thing?

326
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,710
Could you please tell me

327
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,310
how your chairwoman was attracted by our town?

328
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,360
She has her own consideration.

329
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,020
This is also a collective decision of our board.

330
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,980
Mr. Li, why did you come to see me today?

331
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:17,110
Mr. Nan Hua once designed

332
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,380
the welfare park for us.

333
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,830
Our chairwoman is very satisfied.

334
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,230
So she wants to ask you

335
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,520
whether you are interested in

336
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,840
designing the buidling of

337
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,070
the service center for us.

338
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,020
Of course.

339
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,060
But I'd like to ask you a question.

340
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,680
You'll pay me for my work this time, right?

341
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:32,930
Of course.

342
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,690
There will be a standard labor contract, right?

343
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,130
If you want to sign a contract with me, I'm afraid...

344
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,130
I'm afraid we can't

345
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,840
sign a standard contract with you. I'm sorry.

346
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,900
Here's the thing.

347
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,200
The Qingshi Group

348
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,600
has its own designers.

349
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,540
But their design levels may be a bit

350
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,930
inferior to yours.

351
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,900
I hope that you won't be angry.

352
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,870
We want you to design the building this time,

353
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:57,850
but we might have to

354
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:58,720
display the name of

355
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,510
our company's designer, instead of yours.

356
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,600
But don't worry.

357
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,760
To compensate you for not displaying your name,

358
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,340
we will pay you more.

359
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,590
Do you think you can accept that?

360
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:08,550
No problem.

361
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,860
That's great.

362
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,830
Please give me your contact number.

363
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,890
It'll be convenient for us to contact each other later.

364
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,590
I'm sorry. I don't use mobile phones.

365
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,010
Then how should I contact you?

366
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,180
I'll give my phone number to you.

367
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,350
I'm my buddy's closest neighbor.

368
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,670
I live next door.

369
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,480
If you need anything,

370
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,810
you can call me anytime.

371
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,900
By the way,

372
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,090
how did you know that I live here?

373
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,980
Your house was mentioned in a trendy topic.

374
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,190
I found you in a video online.

375
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,440
I see.

376
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,050
I have other things to do later.

377
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,610
If there's no problem,

378
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,850
that's all for today.

379
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:55,870
We'll talk about the details later.

380
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,340
Okay. I'll see you off.

381
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,290
No need.

382
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,870
I think you're quite busy with your work here.

383
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,000
No need to see me off.

384
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,360
Take care.

385
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,040
Bye.

386
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:08,750
Bye.

387
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:20,210
Bro.

388
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,270
I just feel that something is wrong.

389
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,270
What's wrong?

390
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:27,900
This man seems strange.

391
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,220
The more I look at him, the more familiar he seems to me.

392
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,880
I just feel that I've seen him somewhere before.

393
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,890
How come everyone looks familiar to you?

394
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:39,620
Bro, for something so lucky and so unexpected like this,

395
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,000
you have to be more vigilant.

396
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,350
You've been out of touch with society for a long time.

397
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,630
You don't know how evil-hearted some people might be.

398
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,470
Nowadays,

399
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,900
there are many scammers.

400
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,700
The ways of fraud keep changing.

401
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,270
Fraud?

402
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,630
But what can they cheat me of?

403
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,670
I have nothing.

404
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,000
You

405
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,900
have charm.

406
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,560
Alright. Let's get back to work.

407
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,710
Why is there such a pitiful man?

408
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,230
He waited for a person

409
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,940
in a house alone for over 2,000 years.

410
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,020
Finally, he saw that person again,

411
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,430
but he'll die soon.

412
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,820
Although he'll die soon,

413
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,900
he still doesn't seize the time to enjoy his life,

414
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,700
and instead, he's busy renovating my house for me.

415
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,030
What if it turns out that

416
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,190
I'm not the person he has been waiting for?

417
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:52,590
It'll be such a great loss for him, won't it?

418
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,870
But at least, he is nice to me

419
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,990
not because he likes me.

420
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,030
That's worse.

421
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,390
Does he

422
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,070
not like me?

423
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,270
Jin Xia.

424
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,850
Have you finished drawing the draft?

425
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:11,870
Jin Xia.

426
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,010
Are you in a trance?

427
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,340
No, Senior.

428
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,460
I'm thinking about the design.

429
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,220
You've finished the draft, haven't you?

430
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,050
I still need to polish it.

431
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,950
Alright. Finish it as soon as possible.

432
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,430
Give it to me before you get off work.

433
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,110
Okay.

434
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,240
This is good.

435
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,630
Bro, aren't you tired?

436
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,170
No.

437
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,060
You've moved several hundred kilograms

438
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,870
of construction materials inside since this morning.

439
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,110
Then you've renovated the house until now.

440
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,270
You must be tired even if you were

441
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,270
a superman.

442
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,400
I feel so sleepy now.

443
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,130
I have spiritual energy.

444
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,170
Of course I'm different from ordinary people.

445
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:30,900
But I've been exceptionally energetic in the past two days indeed.

446
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,110
I haven't slept for two days,

447
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,470
but I'm not sleepy at all.

448
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,110
Bro.

449
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,890
Since when have you had this symptom?

450
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,070
It seems that after Jin Xia moved into this house,

451
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,850
I've felt more and more energetic recently.

452
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:45,900
I also feel hot at night

453
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,470
for no reason.

454
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,070
You feel hot?

455
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,630
Do you and Jin Xia

456
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,450
sleep in the same room?

457
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:02,530
Yes, there's only one room right now.

458
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,320
Has she

459
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,270
stretched her evil hands out to you?

460
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,800
Watch your tongue, please!

461
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,970
Don't tarnish Jin Xia's reputation.

462
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,040
The relationship between Jin Xia and I is quite pure.

463
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:17,200
Bro, you and she are boyfriend and girlfriend now.

464
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,240
Why are you still so cautious?

465
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,160
Actually, Jin Xia and I...

466
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,400
Actually, you two just pretend to be a couple for fun. Right?

467
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,470
I knew it.

468
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,990
You two don't look like a real couple at all.

469
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,490
You're such a good man.

470
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:35,050
Jin Xia doesn't deserve you at all.

471
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,110
Why do you think Jin Xia doesn't deserve me?

472
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:39,020
I'm the one who doesn't deserve Jin Xia.

473
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,510
Bro, have you seen too few women,

474
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,150
so you've been cheated

475
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:44,350
by Jin Xia with the PUA tricks so easily?

476
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,790
Don't talk nonsense.

477
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,860
Then why do you always watch a reality show

478
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,870
about romantic love or an idol drama

479
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:53,870
when I go to your home every time?

480
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,060
Do you feel lonely

481
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:58,970
as you've been single for so long?

482
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,870
No, I...

483
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:06,570
Actually, I've never been in a romantic relationship.

484
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,030
Bro, you're such a pure man.

485
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
I understand now.

486
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,740
This symptom of yours

487
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,060
has nothing to do with Jin Xia.

488
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:19,790
It's just a normal physiological need.

489
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,570
Nonsense!

490
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,510
I don't want to talk to you.

491
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:22,870
Bro.

492
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,230
That's human nature.

493
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,710
I can teach you if you don't understand.

494
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,860
We men

495
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,080
have our own solutions to this problem.

496
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,810
What solutions?

497
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,250
I have some good stuff in my place.

498
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,970
Let me take you to see it.

499
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:43,620
Let's go.

500
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,220
Stop!

501
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,320
Why do you have such an obscene video?

502
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,890
Bro, have you never watched something like this?

503
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,060
Of course I have.

504
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,840
It's just that I've watched

505
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:57,560
those ones which are motionless.

506
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,560
What's that sound?

507
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,460
It seems that Jin Xia is back.

508
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,390
Where's the remote control?

509
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,870
Where's the remote control?

510
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:17,660
Where is it?

511
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:18,750
Where is it?

512
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,910
I have it.

513
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,040
Ding Yanhai!

514
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,910
Jin Xia, behave naturally.

515
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,210
Don't look so sad

516
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:35,560
and distressed about his upcoming death.

517
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,990
Ding, it's time for you to go home.

518
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,070
I want to stay for dinner.

519
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,550
No way.

520
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,710
I didn't cook for you. Go home now.

521
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:47,690
You're back home.

522
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,580
Did everything go well today?

523
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,140
Not bad.

524
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,950
What are you doing?

525
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,240
By the way, I've made dinner.

526
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,730
Let's go inside and eat.

527
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:58,950
Okay.

528
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,190
He...

529
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,070
Go home at once.

530
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:03,940
Bye.

531
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:04,630
Bro.

532
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,230
Bye.

533
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,660
-Bro.
-Go.

534
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:08,510
Bro.

535
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,430
My shoes are still inside.

536
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,110
Bro! Bro!

537
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,950
The fish soup is really good.

538
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,000
It's delicious.

539
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,750
If you like it,

540
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,410
I'll make it for you next time.

541
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:42,950
Okay.

542
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:05,310
What's wrong with you?

543
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,560
It slipped from my hand.

544
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,470
Do you feel that there's an earthquake?

545
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:41,950
No.

546
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,430
Really?

547
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,990
No? Is it an illusion?

548
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,910
Nan Hua, what's wrong with you?

549
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,310
I'm fine.

550
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,270
But just now, the table and the bowl...

551
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,830
I have excessive spiritual energy.

552
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,990
It's excessive?

553
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,370
Why are you blushing?

554
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,150
Are you okay?

555
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,280
Really?

556
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:45,770
I feel a little hot.

557
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:48,570
I'll go take a shower first. Go on with your meal.

558
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,390
Has he started to get weak so soon?

559
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:13,110
If it's not consistent with propriety, don't look at it, think about it, or listen to it.

560
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,590
What's wrong with me?

561
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,860
Why do I keep thinking about those obscene things?

562
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,810
This is so bad.

563
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,750
It must be due to the fact that

564
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,420
Ding showed me something like that.

565
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,350
I shouldn't have watched it.

566
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,350
What's going on?

567
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,920
Am I possessed?

568
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,790
What's going on?

569
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,520
Nan Hua, are you okay?

570
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,030
Nan Hua.

571
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,610
Are you going to finish soon, Nan Hua?

572
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:04,260
Nan Hua.

573
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,710
Has he fainted like he did last time?

574
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,680
Nan Hua! Have you finished?

575
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,070
I'm coming in.

576
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,670
Nan Hua!

577
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,920
Nan Hua! Nan Hua! Nan Hua!

578
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,590
Nan Hua, wake up! Don't sleep!

579
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:31,250
Nan Hua.

580
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,330
Nan Hua!

581
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,520
He's too heavy.

582
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,440
What should I do?

583
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,870
I'm not able to drag him by myself.

584
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,530
I can only ask that guy for help.

585
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,870
Ding Yanhai, your buddy needs you!

586
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,610
I'm coming!

587
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,250
Hurry up.

588
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,190
What's going on?

589
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,220
Bro! Bro.

590
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,900
Are you okay, Bro?

591
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:00,830
Wake up! Bro!

592
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,700
Stop shaking him. He has fainted.

593
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,900
Let's help him up now.

594
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:07,160
Ding Yanhai, calm down.

595
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,030
Jin Xia, let's help him up.

596
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,350
Bro!

597
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:22,590
It's hot.

598
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:24,070
Does he have a fever?

599
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,570
How come his body is so hot?

600
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,429
When he had insufficient spiritual energy before,

601
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:30,429
his body was cold.

602
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,110
This time, why does he...

603
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,880
You're awake.

604
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,020
How are you?

605
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,909
How come your body is so hot?

606
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,960
You used to feel cold for insufficient energy, didn't you?

607
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,620
Do you want me to recharge you?

608
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:49,989
No. I have a fever indeed.

609
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,500
A fever?

610
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,120
Will you disappear?

611
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,270
No.

612
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,610
That's good.

613
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,000
I'll go get you some antipyretics.

614
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,680
Come on. Take the medicine first.

615
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,660
Thank you.

616
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,560
You're welcome.

617
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,070
Take a rest now.

618
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:36,080
Just see if you can recover tomorrow morning.

619
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,590
That's about it.

620
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,570
So you must remember that

621
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,310
you can't let others know Nan Hua's identity.

622
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,910
It turns out that my buddy is not an alien,

623
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,650
but an ancient man.

624
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,580
This is so amazing.

625
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,700
It's not that my buddy doesn't want to make friends with me.

626
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,360
The reason is that he doesn't want me to get hurt.

627
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:25,850
My buddy is the gentlest person in the world indeed.

628
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,210
Unfortunately, your buddy...

629
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,950
What's wrong with him?

630
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,030
Nothing.

631
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,160
Ask him to tell you about it himself.

632
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,710
It's almost time for me to be on duty.

633
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:46,780
Don't worry.

634
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,240
I will take good care of him.

635
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,190
You?

636
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,590
Now you look like

637
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,000
you can't even take good care of yourself.

638
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,930
What do you mean?

639
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:58,440
You don't know why my buddy has a fever.

640
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,840
Can you take good care of him?

641
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,520
I...

642
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:03,160
Do you know the reason?

643
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,160
Of course I know.

644
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,510
Stop bragging.

645
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:25,350
So you mean the reason is that

646
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,120
his desire can't be dissatisfied?

647
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,300
What should I do?

648
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,270
What's all this about?

649
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,110
I thought he was going to disappear.

650
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:07,340
But in the end, it turned out that he had excessive energy.

651
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,800
If I touch him,

652
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,480
will his condition get worse?

Has my buddy woken up?

No.

659
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,510
Why do you sound unhappy?

660
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,920
Has something wrong happened to my buddy?

661
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,310
You make a call to me

662

every 15 minutes.

663
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,550
Who would be happy?

664
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,790
Is it that frequent?

665
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,920
Let me tell you one last time.

666
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,600
I'll call you when your buddy wakes up.

667
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,920
If you call me again,

668
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,080
I'll blacklist you.

669
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,710
I'm just concerned about my buddy.

670
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,030
Why are you so petty-minded?

671
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,760
I'm warning you about the blacklist for the first time.

672
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,620
Alright. I'll stop sayting that.

673
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:58,720
Well, Jin Xia,

674
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:02,030
after I finish my work shift at 9 a.m., I'll go to your home.

675
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,630
Don't come over.

676
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:05,440
You two-faced sycophant!

677
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,100
I'll blacklist you.

678
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,250
No, no.

679
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:17,790
I feel hot.

680
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,590
Both covering him with the quilt and not covering him with the quilt are not okay.

681
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,740
What should I do?

682
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,940
There won't be any problem if I use this method, right?

683
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,640
I hope your fever will be reduced quickly and you'll get well soon.

684
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,640
Otherwise, I might get heatstroke.

685
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,400
It seems that his body is not that hot now.

686
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:54,510
But I can't feel it while wearing these gloves.

687
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,090
The thermometer.

688
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,680
Nan Hua.

689
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:33,680
Can you not disappear?

690
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:39,200
You've said that I'm your power bank, haven't you?

691
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,610
Is it possible that

692
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,770
even though the cherry tree will wither soon,

693
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,280
as long as I'm here,

694
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,840
I can keep recharging you?

695
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:57,130
If you don't mind,

696
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,640
we can give it a try.

697
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:03,790
I can recharge you for a lifetime.

00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,400
60 degrees.

700
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,520
Is it broken?

701
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:34,950
How come his body is so hot?

702
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,610
This ancient brain is going to be burned.

703
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:38,770

00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:51,760
You're awake.

00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,230
How are you feeling?

708
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,000
I've recovered.

Actually, I was not very worried.

00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:01,130

00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:04,390
