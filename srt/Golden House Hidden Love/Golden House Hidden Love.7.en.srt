[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,190
In the several thousand years of human history,

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,070
there have been many unsolved mysteries.

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,990
Are the stories of Dayu controlling the flood and Nvwa mending the sky myths?

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,590
Why would the advancement of human civilization

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,780
surpass its current situations?

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,830
There are all kinds of speculations.

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,790
But in fact, the truth

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,790
dates back to the ancient times.

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,430
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,750
the highly developed

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,390
prehistoric civilizations once existed on Earth.

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,710
Back then, the ancient people

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,110
mastered the scientific civilization far more advanced than that in modern society.

15
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,190
Their high-level genetic modification technology

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,310
even enabled them to develop

17
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,430
human potential to the greatest extent.

18
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,990
They could absorb the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth

19
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,850
to stay alive and even exert extraordinary energy.

20
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,750
However, a tragic doomsday disaster

21
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,430
made those human beings almost extinct at that time.

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,750
Countless lives

23
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,950
and brilliant civilizations were destroyed overnight.

24
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,990
Only a small number of ancient people

25
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,590
survived the doomsday

26
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,360
after escaping to the underground in time

27
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,830
and entering into a frozen hibernation state.

28
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,490
After that,

29
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,220
through tens of thousands of years of self-repair,

30
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,510
our Earth conceived new intelligent lives again,

31
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,770
namely, the ancestors of modern people.

32
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,110
And the ancient people sleeping in the underground areas

33
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,510
woke up one after another

34
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,190
and returned to the land.

35
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,910
They saw

36
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,860
the new primitive humans who were still trying to make fire by drilling wood.

37
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,950
Out of good intentions,

38
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,060
they taught the younger generations

39
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,070
many technologies, such as farming, metallurgy,

40
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,830
construction, flood control, and precautions against natural disasters.

41
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,759
Many great civilization miracles

42
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:43,150
were the masterpieces made

43
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,880
by our ancestors with the help of ancient people.

44
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,789
At that time, the new human beings

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,890
[Fuxi Temple]

46
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,990
considered the ancient people with extraordinary energy as deities.

47
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,720
They built temples for them and worshipped them.

48
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:58,229
As the official historians of various countries exaggerated the stories about them,

49
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,750
many legendary ancient myths have been passed down till now.

50
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,270
In this way,

51
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,470
most ancient people around the world

52
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,390
fitted into the new world with the identities

53
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,550
of deities.

54
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,870
But there were also some low-profile ancient people

55
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,329
who chose to live in seclusion in deep mountains to escape from the mortal world.

56
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,110
However,

57
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,350
people's worship towards the deities

58
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,430
also gradually generated fear and desires.

59
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,230
The rulers feared that the power of deities

60
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,870
would become a threat to their royal power.

61
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,430
But they were also greedy

62
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,150
for immortality and the extraordinary power.

63
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:31,810
Therefore,

64
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,750
they used various excuses

65
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,750
to start wars

66
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,880
against the deities from time to time.

67
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,860
The ancient people were outnumbered

68
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,350
and were no match for the huge armies in the end.

69
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,950
They almost became extinct.

70
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,620
Little did they know

71
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,990
that by imparting the knowledge of weapon forging to the new humans

72
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,190
they unwittingly unleashed a disaster upon themselves.

73
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,870
Although the ancient people who lived in deep mountains

74
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,430
survived this disaster,

75
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,950
they were hunted by the rulers continuously.

76
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,270
They were even slandered

77
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,550
and considered as horrible mountain spirits or ferocious ghosts.

78
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,910
In the blink of an eye,

79
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,780
those who had been regarded as deities became devils that everyone wanted to kill.

80
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,270
As everything keeps changing in the world,

81
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,950
no one knows the existence of the ancient people anymore.

82
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,310
Only those anecdotes and peculiar stories about ghosts and monsters

83
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,400
have been passed down from generation to generation.

84
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,110
And the tiny minority of ancient people who have survived

85
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,790
are still secretly hiding

86
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,670
in those covert corners in the world till now.

87
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,680
Stand up.

88
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,340
Where are we?

89
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,110
We're home.

90
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,390
We're home!

91
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,120
Friends, I'm home.

92
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,230
I won't be able to tell you

93
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,630
what happens next through live streaming.

94
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,430
That's all. Bye.

95
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,280
Nan Hua.

96
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,390
You look like a dwarf now.

97
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:22,910
Alright.

98
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:10,790
Grandma.

99
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,900
Is this the first time

100
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,190
that you've come to see Jin Xia's boyfriend?

101
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,030
Yes, I've never seen him before.

102
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,990
What's going on with you?

103
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,730
Ding Yanhai is here again.

104
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,950
Did you steal the parts of his car

105
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,750
after you repaired it last time?

106
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,870
No.

107
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,030
Did you do something wrong and you forgot it

108
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,990
so you were wanted by the police?

109
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,350
No.

110
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,190
I won't forget things that happened recently.

111
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,920
I had been in sleep for 13 years.

112
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,990
I woke up a year ago.

113
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,230
And I went to Ding Yanhai's house

114
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:43,760
to do repair work a year ago.

115
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,909
Okay.

116
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,790
But why did you

117
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,510
suddenly wake up a year ago?

118
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,790
Didn't you normally sleep for decades at one time?

119
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,190
Because...

120
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,310
Jin Xia.

121
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,770
Do you need my help?

122
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,790
No, thanks. It'll be ready soon.

123
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,190
It is not the right time to talk about this now.

124
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,420
If he asks,

125
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,830
just tell him

126
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,910
that you came back from the US

127
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,170
and you don't have Chinese nationality.

128
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,470
Don't spill the beans.

129
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,270
Keep it in mind.

130
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,270
Okay.

131
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,750
Jin Xia

132
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,810
doesn't remember what I told her that day.

133
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,030
Don't worry.

134
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,300
Before I leave,

135
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,490
I will do my best

136
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,120
to fulfill all your wishes.

137
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,350
Grandma, how are you?

138
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,010
Good, good.

139
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,570
Dinner is ready, Grandma.

140
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,870
The casserole...

141
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,940
It's floating!

142
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,870
How come?

143
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,070
Why is it floating?

144
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,360
Oh no.

145
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,240
I forgot I was still invisible.

146
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,190
He can't see me.

147
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,110
Let me perform a magic trick before we eat.

148
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,630
Up, down.

149
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,870
Up, up, up.

150
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,190
Down, down, down.

151
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:30,920
Here.

152
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:40,830
Sweetie, what were you doing?

153
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,470
I was playing a magic trick, Grandma.

154
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,540
Magic trick?

155
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,750
It's an adult magic trick.

156
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,350
We young people love it.

157
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,190
You don't understand.

158
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,790
Adult magic trick?

159
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,630
It doesn't sound like something good.

160
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,830
Forget about it.

161
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,190
Grandma, let me get the chopsticks.

162
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,690
Show yourself.

163
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,510
Sometimes,

164
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,510
your ability to be invisible to some people

165
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,310
would cause trouble.

166
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,550
Sorry, I was careless.

167
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,480
I guess we managed to fool them just now, right?

168
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,170
I think my acting was good.

169
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,690
Let's go to the table.

170
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:23,250
Okay.

171
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,230
I'm afraid the longer we stay here, the more suspicious they'll be.

172
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,110
That's right.

173
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,810
Let me get the chopsticks.

174
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,789
Grandma, the chopsticks... Oh, they're here.

175
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,430
Ding, let me introduce him to you.

176
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,870
This is my boyfriend.

177
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,270
His name is Nan Hua.

178
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,870
Nan Hua?

179
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,470
Are you

180
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,330
the person I've been looking for?

181
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,030
Why have you been looking for me?

182
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,800
Can't you recognize me?

183
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,790
How come?

184
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,870
Am I mistaking you for him?

185
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,360
Sit down. Let's eat.

186
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,390
The dishes are all here.

187
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,150
Let's eat.

188
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,250
Ding.

189
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,440
Ding, have you been to America?

190
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:52,030
America? No.

191
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,710
My boyfriend is an ABC.

192
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,550
It's the first time that he has come to China.

193
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,010
You must have mistaken him for someone else.

194
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:07,070
Yes, probably.

195
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,230
This dish...

196
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,310
Grandma, this dish is called Buddha Jumps Over the Wall.

197
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,310
You made it?

198
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,590
Yes.

199
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,280
In such a short time,

200
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,210
you managed to cook so many dishes?

201
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,910
Grandma, it's because I practiced a lot.

202
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,750
And cooking these dishes

203
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,670
was not as time-consuming as you thought.

204
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,230
If you are to make Buddha Jumps Over the Wall,

205
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,500
you just need to cut the shark lips

206
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,470
into pieces that are 2.5 cm wide and...

207
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,390
Enough. Stop teaching us how to make it.

208
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,110
Grandma, try this.

209
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,990
It's so delicious.

210
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,310
Good, good.

211
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,630
Try the marinated shrimps made by me.

212
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,120
They're your favorite.

213
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,790
Okay.

214
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,320
Try one.

215
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,550
Try one, Ding.

216
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,250
Thank you, Grandma.

217
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:12,710
How is it?

218
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,260
It's a little too salty.

219
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,550
Too salty?

220
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:17,970
A little too salty.

221
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,650
I think it's very good.

222
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,790
When making marinated food, you should use a lot of salt

223
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,990
to kill the bacteria.

224
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,720
Otherwise, you'll have diarrhea if you eat marinated food that was not salted enough.

225
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,270
Yes.

226
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,830
It's perfect to eat the dish with rice.

227
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,390
I'm glad you like it.

228
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,270
But Big Bro,

229
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,360
isn't this the first time that you've come to China?

230
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,660
How come you know so much about Chinese cuisine?

231
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:47,410
Big Bro?

232
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,320
I'm 21 years old.

233
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,550
Big Bro, you should be older than me.

234
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,790
I'm eight...

235
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,150
He was born in 1989.

236
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,620
Born in 1989?

237
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,190
Nan, you're seven years older than my granddaughter.

238
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,750
You're good-looking.

239
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,310
Thank you, Grandma.

240
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,380
Let's eat.

241
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,510
Big Bro.

242
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,710
You haven't answered my question yet.

243
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,510
How come you're so good at cooking Chinese dishes?

244
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:20,950
Well.

245
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,910
When he was in America,

246
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,510
he learnt it from a chef at a Michelin 3-star restaurant.

247
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,190
His teacher

248
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,750
is an expert in cooking Chinese dishes.

249
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,510
Didn't Nan major in architecture?

250
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,030
Cooking is his hobby.

251
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,430
By learning to make Chinese dishes, he could strengthen his Asian cultural identity.

252
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,150
Grandma.

253
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,310
I'm happy that he still considers

254
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,570
himself a Chinese man.

255
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,750
Nan, will you go back to America?

256
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,710
If you go back,

257
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,330
what should my granddaughter do?

258
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,950
I won't go back to America, Grandma.

259
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,710
But

260
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,710
I'll leave when this flowering phase ends.

261
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,260
When this flowering phase ends?

262
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,710
What is he talking about?

263
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:27,870
He means

264
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,320
he has to renew his visa.

265
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,070
He's holding a tourist visa which only allows him to stay for a short period.

266
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,670
He'll be back here after renewing his visa.

267
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,550
He can't live without me now, right?

268
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,830
Really?

269
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,340
I didn't know you were so in love with each other.

270
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,690
What do you mean?

271
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,330
We love each other very much.

272
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,110
Here.

273
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,830
Darling, try this.

274
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,630
Let's eat.

275
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,190
Big Bro, do you have any...

276
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:11,350
Ding.

277
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,030
Let's not talk about Nan Hua all the time, okay?

278
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,030
Look at you. You're being like an police officer on duty.

279
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,470
We're having dinner together.

280
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,410
Don't act like you're interrogating someone.

281
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,750
Let's have a casual chat.

282
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,590
Right, Grandma?

283
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,190
Let's eat.

284
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,710
I remember there's a great TV drama that's on air.

285
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,910
What is it?

286
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,970
Ding, do you usually watch TV dramas?

287
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,070
I like watching My Love from the Star.

288
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,180
That's an old drama.

289
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,390
I remember there is a plot in that drama

290
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,670
that when Professor Do Minjoon

291
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,270
first came to earth from outer space,

292
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,940
he saved a person on earth

293
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,750
and they agreed to be together.

294
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,710
Later, they were forced to be apart for many reasons.

295
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,950
But after a long time,

296
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,000
fate made them meet again.

297
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:02,940
Big Bro.

298
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,030
If a person's appearance

299
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,710
hasn't changed for more than ten years,

300
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,110
what's the reason behind it?

301
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,730
What is the reason?

302
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,220
It's immortality.

303
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,910
Immortality?

304
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,190
Nan Hua, you shouldn't have played a magic trick just now.

305
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:36,280
We're eating.

306
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,390
You scared us.

307
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,670
Right, I shouldn't have done that.

308
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,430
I'm sorry.

309
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,070
Big Bro.

310
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,110
After we finish dinner,

311
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,870
can you go to the beach with me?

312
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,780
Why?

313
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,270
I have something to tell you alone.

314
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,400
Is it inconvenient for you?

315
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,550
No. I can go.

316
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,110
Good.

317
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,350
My goodness.

318
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,920
What's going on

319
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,750
with Ding Yanhai?

320
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,760
Big Bro, I always feel that

321
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,040
you're like a person in my memory.

322
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,150
But I can't tell

323
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,140
whether it was just a dream or not.

324
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,070
You dreamed about me?

325
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,550
Yes.

326
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,030
Why did I dream about you?

327
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,710
Isn't this the first time you've come to China?

328
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,260
Big Bro.

329
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,260
Do you have any family members who look like you

330
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,200
in China?

331
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,069
I have no family members.

332
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,050
I'm sorry.

333
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,390
I haven't got to know who my parents are since I was born.

334
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,430
Life must be hard for you.

335
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:36,990
It's fine.

336
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,300
I'm used to having no family or friends.

337
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,880
So I don't feel lonely.

338
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,590
Isn't Jin Xia your friend?

339
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,110
Yes, she's my only friend

340
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,040
in the new world.

341
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,830
New world?

342
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,390
I mean...

343
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:07,570
Big Bro, I think it's because your Chinese is not very good, right?

344
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,350
Yes, my Chinese is not good.

345
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,430
Big Bro.

346
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,990
I have a request.

347
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,430
What?

348
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,640
Can I look into your eyes?

349
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,270
Is it you?

350
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,260
Are you the person I've been looking for?

351
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,290
Big Bro, what's wrong?

352
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,110
Are you okay?

353
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,530
I'm fine.

354
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,080
I'm just a little tired.

355
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,830
I've been busy all day.

356
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,100
Sorry.

357
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,880
I didn't know you were busy all day.

358
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,860
I shouldn't have asked you to take a walk with me.

359
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,190
Let me walk you home.

360
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,570
It's all right.

361
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,670
I can go back on my own.

362
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:06,540
Bye.

363
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,710
Why are you following me?

364
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,950
Big Bro, don't you remember

365
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,750
that Jin Xia and I are neighbors?

366
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,200
We should go in the same direction.

367
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,370
Big Bro, where is your hometown?

368
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,070
My ancestral home is Wangqi Town.

369
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,910
When did you meet Jin Xia?

370
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,630
When she moved in.

371
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:43,840
Big Bro.

372
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,310
Can I visit you often?

373
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,190
What are they talking about? It's been so long.

374
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,670
What can they talk about?

375
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,650
They've been talking for an hour.

376
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,770
He and I have never had a talk that lasted an hour.

377
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,870
Grandma, what are these?

378
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,350
These are things related to your childhood.

379
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,220
Look, this is an award certificate.

380
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,380
[Jin Xia is the winner of the Excellent Award in the City Cultural Book Fair.
This certificate is hereby awarded to you as an encouragement.]

381
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,790
I've been keeping them for you.

382
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,370
Take a look at this.

383
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,270
Take a look at this.

384
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,110
It's a toy.

385
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,350
The household register?

386
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,070
Why did you bring them here all of a sudden?

387
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,440
[Household Register]

388
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,310
You have your own house now.

389
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,430
These things

390
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,190
should be kept here.

391
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,280
It's not like I'll never go back.

392
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,590
I'll go back to keep you company on holidays.

393
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,950
There are too many things at home.

394
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,200
There isn't enough space for all of them.

395
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,660
Then just throw them away.

396
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,430
Apart from this household register,

397
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,750
others can all be sold to a recycling center.

398
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,080
How about I sell you to a recycling center?

399
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,830
These are special things that mean a lot.

400
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,580
Look. You can get them cleaned

401
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,590
and use them as decorations.

402
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,370
Then my house will be a recycling center.

403
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,720
Don't say that.

404
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,470
They won't make your house a recycling center.

405
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,470
You cherished

406
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,510
this marble very much when you were a kid.

407
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,270
Really?

408
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,810
I don't remember it at all.

409
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,150
When you were six,

410
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,070
you played with it every day.

411
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,840
It's not fragile at all.

412
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,610
It can't be broken easily.

413
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,020
Nobody keeps a toy they played with when they were six.

414
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,870
I think you should throw it away.

415
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,470
Don't throw away everything.

416
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,550
You have your own house now.

417
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:39,340
Put away your things.

418
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,950
You're a girl.

419
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,270
Don't make your house messy.

420
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:46,390
Okay.

421
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,790
This house is nice and big.

422
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,190
I'm thinking about getting all your things here.

423
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,970
So that your room in the old house can be empty

424
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:58,350
and we can rent that room.

425
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,650
Why do you want to rent my room?

426
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,310
I'm an old lady.

427
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,910
I don't need two rooms.

428
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,110
Besides,

429
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,470
if we rent the room,

430
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,510
you can use the rent paid by the tenant to pay for your mortgage.

431
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,790
No need, Grandma.

432
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,270
I can pay for the mortgage by myself.

433
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,430
Besides, if you rent my room,

434
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,670
where should I live when I go back?

435
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,270
You can live in my room with me.

436
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,330
Or you can live in your childhood friend Xiang's place.

437
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,790
Or

438
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,000
you can live with your aunt.

439
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,390
You won't stay there for long anyway.

440
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,030
What do you mean?

441
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,550
All right.

442
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:37,510
Keep this for me.

443
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,920
This is...

444
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,480
[The People’s Republic of China
Real Property Ownership Certificate]

445
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,030
The property ownership certificate?

446
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,490
Why are you giving it to me?

447
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,400
I'm old.

448
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,310
I often forgot where I had put it.

449
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,910
I'm so forgetful now.

450
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:55,390
You keep it and I can rest assured.

451
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,590
And...

452
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:06,440
Sweetie, I have something else...

453
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,110
Grandma, let's talk about it later.

454
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,370
I think Nan Hua is back.

455
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,290
I'll go take a look.

456
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,660
How is it?

457
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,390
Why did Ding want to talk to you?

458
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,510
I have no idea.

459
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,730
He seemed to be implying something to me.

460
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,070
He didn't say it clearly.

461
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,550
Implying?

462
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,640
He said he had dreamed about me

463
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,550
and asked me if I had any relatives in China.

464
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,640
I don't understand.

465
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,950
He dreamed about you?

466
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:01,830
Is he the one you've been waiting for?

467
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,150
Maybe.

468
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,710
When he was looking at me,

469
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,870
I had a sense of déjà vu.

470
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,710
Alright, don't worry.

471
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,350
You could draw a picture of meteor-chip earrings

472
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,810
and get me charged energy.

473
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,260
You're the one I've been waiting for.

474
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,910
I'm not worried about you.

475
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,550
What's wrong?

476
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,350
I've been out for a day.

477
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,260
I've consumed too much spiritual energy.

478
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,230
I need to take a rest.

479
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,470
Go back now.

480
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,770
Where is your grandma?

481
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:55,230
Is she still suspicious?

482
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,110
No.

483
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,390
She

484
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,550
just asked

485
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,190
some questions about us.

486
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,350
By the way,

487
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,350
I want to talk to you about us.

488
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,970
Do you think we're...

489
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,110
We're all tired today.

490
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,440
Let's take a rest first.

491
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,710
We can talk later.

492
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:19,870
We have much time.

493
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,510
Okay.

494
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,510
I'm sorry I won't be able to keep you and Grandma company now.

495
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,070
Take good care of Grandma.

496
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,920
I'll make breakfast for you tomorrow.

497
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,390
Good night.

498
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:38,770
Good night.

499
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,110
Grandma.

500
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,310
You fell asleep so early.

501
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:09,480
You must be tired from taking the train today.

502
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,110
Good night.

503
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,470
I smell of Nan Hua's sachet.

504
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,170
After staying with him for so long today,

505
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,970
I've got the scent of his sachet.

506
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,630
Is he the one you've been waiting for?

507
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,590
Maybe.

508
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,070
When he was looking at me,

509
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:48,180
I had a sense of déjà vu.

510
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,390
If...If...

511
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,670
If I'm not the person you've been waiting for,

512
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:55,600
what will you do?

513
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,750
Then I will disappear

514
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,360
from your life and never come back.

515
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,510
And we'll never have anything to do with each other.

516
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:06,390
What am I thinking?

517
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,920
It has nothing to do with me.

518
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,040
I've decided to be single forever.

519
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:42,310
[Ding Yanhai]

520
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:42,310
[Refuse] [Answer]

521
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,990
Ding Yanhai.

522
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,230
Why is he calling me now?

523
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,430
Ding, what's up?

524
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,110
Jin Xia, I'm in your doorway.

525
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,350
Please open the door for me.

526
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,270
Morning.

527
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,950
Ding, it's so early. What brings you here?

528
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:38,430
This breakfast is the most popular and the most delicious nearby.

529
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,820
I went across several blocks

530
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,950
and queued up for half an hour to buy it.

531
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:43,040
Big Bro just came back from America.

532
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,280
He must have never tried it.

533
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,740
Give the breakfast to him.

534
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,450
Nothing else?

535
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,980
Why didn't you ring the doorbell?

536
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,760
Big Bro seemed very tired yesterday.

537
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,730
I didn't want to wake him up.

538
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,600
So you woke me up.

539
00:28:59,230 --> 00:28:59,950
Please.

540
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,370
I have to go on duty.

541
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,470
Tell Big Bro

542
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,490
that I'll come to see him after work.

543
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:04,990
I...

544
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:05,830
Thank you.

545
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,740
I also bought you and Grandma breakfast.

546
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,200
Eat it before it gets cold.

547
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,710
By the way,

548
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,230
don't wake Big Bro up.

549
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,380
Let him sleep as long as he likes.

550
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:26,470
It's ridiculous.

551
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,950
Jin Xia, be quiet.

552
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,840
Grandma usually gets up early.

553
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,990
Why is she still asleep now?

554
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,590
Should I go to bed again?

555
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,190
Forget it. It's rare for me to get up early.

556
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:10,790
Let me go to work early today.

557
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,350
Because I was busy with moving,

558
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,410
much of my work hasn't been finished.

559
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:39,570
You've got up.

560
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,160
Are you feeling better?

561
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,500
Yes.

562
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:44,980
Okay.

563
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,480
I'm going to work today.

564
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,790
Please take care of Grandma.

565
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,840
Okay, you may rest assured.

566
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,890
You're not going out today, right?

567
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,070
No, I'm not.

568
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,270
I want to do some yard work today.

569
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:04,950
Okay.

570
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,570
Let me walk you to the door.

571
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,580
By the way,

572
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,510
Ding bought you breakfast.

573
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,910
He asked you to eat it before it gets cold.

574
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,240
He said he would come to see you after work.

575
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,630
Why?

576
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,640
How would I know?

577
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,470
Bye.

578
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,350
Take care.

579
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,110
[Don't be afraid. It's okay. From Yanhai]

580
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,100
This way, please.

581
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,870
Xi Mengsi.

582
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,160
To be honest,

583
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:56,630
if this show isn't successful,

584
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,100
the head office

585
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,310
will stop investing

586
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,910
in your studio.

587
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,910
I understand.

588
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,630
After all, you haven't given us any new works for five years.

589
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,160
Any other investor

590
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,390
won't be okay with it.

591
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,310
I know it sounds cruel.

592
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,910
But I hope the pressure can make you more motivated.

593
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:12,510
Mr. Zhao.

594
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,910
I really attach great importance

595
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,310
to the release of the new product.

596
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,030
Ms. Xi

597
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,310
This way.

598
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,550
Mr. Zhao, Mr. Lin,

599
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,790
That's all for today.

600
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:23,830
Thank you again for coming today.

601
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,230
You're welcome, Xi Mengsi.

602
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,400
We'll get going then.

603
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,180
See you.

604
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:28,790
See you. Take care.

605
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,520
Why are you here so early today?

606
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,870
Ms. Xi, I got up early today.

607
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,390
So I came to the company early

608
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,150
to finish the work I had left behind.

609
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:43,950
That's good.

610
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,910
By the way, I heard from my assistant

611
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:48,270
that your boyfriend had once been photographed here.

612
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,070
My boyfriend?

613
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,830
Yes.

614
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,240
He's a model?

615
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,790
He's not a model.

616
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,910
My best friend happened to know that photographer.

617
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,670
So I recommended him to give it a try

618
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,130
and make some extra money.

619
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,160
I saw his photos.

620
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,110
Not bad.

621
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,650
He'll make a gifted model.

622
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,550
As you know,

623
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,510
the theme of my upcoming wedding outfit show has something to with ancient history.

624
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:11,740
His temperament and appearance made him look like an ancient gentleman.

625
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,910
Next time when I need to photograph models to make a photo album,

626
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,040
you can ask him to come and give it a try.

627
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:19,110
Okay, I'll ask him if he would like to do it.

628
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:20,790
Okay.

629
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,270
Good. Go back to work.

630
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,350
Ms. Xi.

631
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:27,340
No matter what others think of you,

632
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,160
I think your design is the best.

633
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,940
You're the best, come on.

634
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,070
Jin Xia, I've been busy lately.

635
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,260
I haven't checked your homework yet.

636
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:36,950
But

637
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:39,510
you are the most talented among all the students.

638
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,370
I think you have great potential.

639
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,310
You'll have a promising future.

640
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,400
Ms. Xi, I'll keep working hard.

641
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:46,640
You can do it.

642
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,270
Nan.

643
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:19,190
Did you do all the yard work?

644
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,590
Yes, Grandma.

645
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:22,510
What do you think of the yard?

646
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,179
Nowadays,

647
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:27,270
very few young people have the patience needed

648
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,330
to do the yard work.

649
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,909
You're calm and patient.

650
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,810
This is a good quality.

651
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:34,850
It's good and rare.

652
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,250
You're like her grandfather.

653
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,710
I'm flattered, Grandma.

654
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:44,440
Jin Xia said you two hadn't known each other for long.

655
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,630
But it would take

656
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:51,270
one or two weeks

657
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,120
to make the yard look like this.

658
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,590
I guess

659
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:57,870
you must have lived together for a long time.

660
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,350
It's not like that.

661
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,470
Then what is it?

662
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,510
I'm sorry.

663
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,950
I can't tell you everything.

664
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,510
I understand.

665
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,470
I understand.

666
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,150
I'm old now.

667
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,710
I'm not able to keep up with the times.

668
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,460
But

669
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:22,950
I really hope you two can be happy.

670
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,750
It would be better if you two can get married earlier.

671
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,360
Get married?

672
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,870
Jin Xia had a hard life when she was young.

673
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,700
Her parents haven't been with her since she was a kid.

674
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,950
Because of this,

675
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:44,430
she was often bullied by other kids.

676
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,790
So she always acted like

677
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,260
she didn't need parents at all.

678
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:54,070
She thought by doing it, she wouldn't be laughed at.

679
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,830
She's never told me this.

680
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,110
I'm telling you this

681
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:02,750
to tell you

682
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:07,190
that she is always hiding what she really wants from others.

683
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,270
She looks fine.

684
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,030
I can see

685
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,110
that she likes you a lot.

686
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,070
Grandma, I don't want to lie to you.

687
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,200
I promised to practice dating Jin Xia.

688
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:23,710
But at that time,

689
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:25,670
Jin Xia was not sober.

690
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,450
It's unfair to her that I still live here.

691
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:30,790
Besides,

692
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,520
she and I don't have much time left.

693
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:37,570
You don't have much time left?

694
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,330
But Grandma, I promise

695
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,950
as long as I'm with her,

696
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,710
I will do my best to treat her well.

697
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,370
I'll treat her well every day.

698
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,110
I don't quite understand

699
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:54,270
what you said.

700
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:58,500
You young people's ideas are more and more complicated.

701
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:02,070
Although I don't understand,

702
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,070
I respect your choices.

703
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:05,910
That's your life.

704
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,030
Careful.

705
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:08,750
I should go.

706
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,990
But you came yesterday.

707
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,350
Why are you leaving so soon?

708
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,480
I don't want to bother you two any more.

709
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,320
If you two are free,

710
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,750
spend more time with each other.

711
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,230
Maybe you two will change your mind.

712
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,710
I know

713
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,510
I should leave now.

714
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:28,590
Actually...

715
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,350
Besides,

716
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,510
I'm quite busy.

717
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,950
I promised my old friends

718
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,830
that we would shoot TikTok videos tomorrow.

719
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,110
Okay.

720
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,910
Don't you want to say goodbye to her in person?

721
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,590
No need.

722
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,830
She's busy at work.

723
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,230
I don't want to disturb her.

724
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,590
You tell her about it when she comes back.

725
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,430
Okay, take care.

726
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,070
Okay.

727
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:59,670
It is so strange.

728
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:02,100
Why can Grandma see me?

729
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,910
According to the information we've got,

730
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,670
a great Andromeda meteor shower

731
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,430
will occur in our city tonight.

732
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,950
The best observation location

733
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,510
is Wangqi Town in our city.

734
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:24,430
It will be the second meteor shower

735
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,350
to occur in the seaside town

736
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,940
after last week's Lyrids meteor shower.
