2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,150
In the several thousand years of human history,

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,040
there have been many unsolved mysteries.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,950
Are the stories of Dayu controlling the flood and Nvwa mending the sky myths?

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,560
Why would the advancement of human civilization

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,760
surpass its current situations?

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,800
There are all kinds of speculations.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,760
But in fact, the truth

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,760
dates back to the ancient times.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,400
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,720
the highly developed

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,360
prehistoric civilizations once existed on Earth.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,680
Back then, the ancient people

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,080
mastered the scientific civilization far more advanced than that in modern society.

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,160
Their high-level genetic modification technology

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,280
even enabled them to develop

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,390
human potential to the greatest extent.

18
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,960
They could absorb the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,820
to stay alive and even exert extraordinary energy.

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,720
However, a tragic doomsday disaster

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,390
made those human beings almost extinct at that time.

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,710
Countless lives

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,910
and brilliant civilizations were destroyed overnight.

24
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,960
Only a small number of ancient people

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,560
survived the doomsday

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,330
after escaping to the underground in time

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,789
and entering into a frozen hibernation state.

28
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:14,450
After that,

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,190
through tens of thousands of years of self-repair,

30
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,480
our Earth conceived new intelligent lives again,

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,740
namely, the ancestors of modern people.

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,080
And the ancient people sleeping in the underground areas

33
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,480
woke up one after another

34
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,160
and returned to the land.

35
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,870
They saw

36
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,830
the new primitive humans who were still trying to make fire by drilling wood.

37
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,920
Out of good intentions,

38
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,030
they taught the younger generations

39
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,039
many technologies, such as farming, metallurgy,

40
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,800
construction, flood control, and precautions against natural disasters.

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,729
Many great civilization miracles

42
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,120
were the masterpieces made

43
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,850
by our ancestors with the help of ancient people.

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,759
At that time, the new human beings

45
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:51,800
[Fuxi Temple]

46
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,960
considered the ancient people with extraordinary energy as deities.

47
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,690
They built temples for them and worshipped them.

48
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,200
As the official historians of various countries exaggerated the stories about them,

49
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,720
many legendary ancient myths have been passed down till now.

50
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,240
In this way,

51
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,440
most ancient people around the world

52
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,360
fitted into the new world with the identities

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,520
of deities.

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,840
But there were also some low-profile ancient people

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,300
who chose to live in seclusion in deep mountains to escape from the mortal world.

56
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,070
However,

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,320
people's worship towards the deities

58
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,400
also gradually generated fear and desires.

59
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,200
The rulers feared that the power of deities

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,840
would become a threat to their royal power.

61
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,390
But they were also greedy

62
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,120
for immortality and the extraordinary power.

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,780
Therefore,

64
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,720
they used various excuses

65
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
to start wars

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,850
against the deities from time to time.

67
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,829
The ancient people were outnumbered

68
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,320
and were no match for the huge armies in the end.

69
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,920
They almost became extinct.

70
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,600
Little did they know

71
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,960
that by imparting the knowledge of weapon forging to the new humans

72
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,160
they unwittingly unleashed a disaster upon themselves.

73
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,840
Although the ancient people who lived in deep mountains

74
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,400
survived this disaster,

75
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,920
they were hunted by the rulers continuously.

76
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,240
They were even slandered

77
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,510
and considered as horrible mountain spirits or ferocious ghosts.

78
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,880
In the blink of an eye,

79
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,750
those who had been regarded as deities became devils that everyone wanted to kill.

80
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,240
As everything keeps changing in the world,

81
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,920
no one knows the existence of the ancient people anymore.

82
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,270
Only those anecdotes and peculiar stories about ghosts and monsters

83
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,350
have been passed down from generation to generation.

84
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,079
And the tiny minority of ancient people who have survived

85
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,750
are still secretly hiding

86
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,640
in those covert corners in the world till now.

87
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,480
Everything goes well as usual with that pink cherry tree

88
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,540
in the Wangqi Town.

89
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,710
Its vitality is getting stronger and stronger.

90
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,960
That's good.

91
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,260
The plan of Golden House Hidden Love will be finished soon.

92
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,440
But Xi Manling

93
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,600
seems to be plotting something.

94
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:02,910
Do you want me to...

95
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,710
Just let her be like that for now.

96
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,290
We made a mistake on a trivial matter previously.

97
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,350
We can take this chance to use her to make up for the mistake.

98
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,080
Yes.

99
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,800
You're dressed so formally today.

100
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,270
I don't usually wear modern clothes.

101
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:59,720
I was worried that I might look too conspicuous when I went out,

102
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,680
so I asked Yanhai to lend this suit to me.

103
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,360
But I've found that I don't know how to tie a necktie.

104
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,950
It turns out that there's something you don't know how to do.

105
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,790
Leave it to me.

106
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:57,990
It's done.

107
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:02,930
How do I look?

108
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,430
Not very good.

109
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,480
What's not so good about me?

110
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,990
It's just that...

111
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,560
you're too handsome.

112
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,830
You might look a bit more conspicuous in this way.

113
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,500
We've arrived.

114
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,550
Be cautious about everything.

115
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,430
Don't worry.

116
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,000
I'll do everything according to the plan.

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,830
You should find a way to go to the underground parking lot

118
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,480
to check yesterday's surveillance videos.

119
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,760
Then you can come to me to get recharged during lunchtime.

120
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,280
Okay.

121
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,440
I have to go inside.

122
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,480
Just go.

123
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,350
Jin Xia, you're here.

124
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,830
Ms. Xi wants you to go to her office

125
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,690
and talk to her.

126
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,450
Okay. I'll go later.

127
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,530
Okay.

128
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,880
Jin Xia is going to Ms. Xi's office again.

129
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,110
She went there yesterday, too.

130
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,040
She goes there every day recently.

131
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,740
She's going to take part in the big show.

132
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,510
Maybe Ms. Xi wants to give guidance to her privately.

133
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,450
You're right.

134
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,340
She isn't capable enough to handle it well.

135
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,520
How can she not rely on Ms. Xi?

136
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,320
Right.

137
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,700
It's too early.

138
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,800
I didn't have time to make coffee.

139
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,630
Just have some juice.

140
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,360
I'm fine with anything, Ms. Xi.

141
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,520
Nan Hua didn't come here to protect you closely?

142
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,390
He's here.

143
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,480
Is he in the office?

144
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,500
No.

145
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,790
He's watching the surveillance videos in the parking lot.

146
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,790
He'll come later.

147
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,570
Surveillance videos?

148
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,740
Yes, I forgot to tell you.

149
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,560
When I drove home yesterday,

150
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,220
there was something wrong with the brake,

151
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,270
so he came here to investigate it.

152
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,080
Just in case.

153
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,179
Are you okay?

154
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,179
I'm fine. Don't worry, Ms. Xi.

There's not much time left.

158
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,030
This juice is freshly made. It tastes very good.

159
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,670
Okay.

160
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,000
It's so fresh.

161
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,240

Only the video of this hour has been deleted.

165
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,280
I think the car must have been tampered with

166
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,280
during this hour.

167
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,410
I just want to talk to you

168
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,390
about your design for the wedding dress that will be displayed in the big show soon.

169
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,950
Ms. Xi, do you think the shape is okay?

170
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,610
It's very creative.

171
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,150
It's a bit cute in a perfect way.

172
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,480
But it does not deviate from the theme of classical style.

173
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,430
As for the materials of the inner layers, I think...

174
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:57,190
The materials? I want to use gauze.

175
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,890
Jin Xia, are you okay?

176
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,920
I'm fine, Ms. Xi.

187
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,630
She jumped out of the window?

188
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,280
Jin Xia seemed to suddenly become a different person just now.

189
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,720
She pulled a long face and ignored me completely.

190
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,870
Then she...

191
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,520
opened the window and jumped down.

192
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,490
She was manipulated.

193
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,670
[If you want Jin Xia to stay alive, get to Room 57 of the Dihao Hotel in 15 minutes.]

194
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,670
[Remember that you can only come alone. Don't let anyone see you.]

195
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,090
Where is the Dihao Hotel?

196
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,050
What's wrong?

197
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,780
There are only three minutes left. I have to hurry up.

198
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,550
53. 55.

199
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,410
57. It's here.

200
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,110
Is she a member of my clan?

201
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,410
I forgot to switch it to the silent mode. Calm down.

202
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,020
[Now make this foreign woman possessed by you and find the medicine box in the room.]

203
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,020
[Eat all the aspirin capsules inside the box.]

204
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,590
[What on earth do you want to do?]

205
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,040
[This person is a member of your clan. She's allergic to aspirins. If you don't kill her first,]

206
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,040
[she will kill your beloved woman. You have no choice.]

207
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,690
[Who on earth are you? Why do you want to hurt Jin Xia?]

208
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:06,180
[You'll know when you find the medicine box. If you want Jin Xia to stay alive, just listen to me.]

209
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:06,180
[The five-minute countdown starts now.]

210
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,450
[Aspirin Capsule]

211
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,980
[Eat them all.]

212
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,890
[You can go back to the office now. I'll return Jin Xia to you for now.]

213
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,510
[You can go back to the office now. I'll return Jin Xia to you for now.]

214
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,470
What happened to me just now?

215
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,730
[Xi Manling]

216
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,430
Hello? What's the matter?

217
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,210
How come you're still coughing, Mom?

218
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,250
Have you taken the medicine?

219
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,850
What on earth is the matter?

220
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,240
Nothing.

221
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,930
I just want to tell you that

222
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,150
I've changed my mind.

223
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,960
I will never leave David.

224
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:21,710
What?

225
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,050
You... How dare you fool me?

226
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,090
You are just a...

227
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,150
Despicable woman!

228
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,780
You bitch!

229
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,580
How dare you fool me!

230
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,680
Madam, are you alright?

231
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,230
Get out! Get out!

232
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,570
Out! Out!

233
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,760
Yes.

234
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,790
Without my orders,

235
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,520
none of you should come inside.

236
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,040
Jin Xia.

237
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,800
You're back.

238
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,720
Jin Xia. Jin Xia.

239
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,860
What's wrong with her?

240
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,720
I was worried after you left,

241
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,760
so I went downstairs to look for her again.

242
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,040
When I came back,

243
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,820
she was lying on the floor alone.

244
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,060
I couldn't wake her up no matter how hard I tried.

245
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,860
You came back right after I carried her to the sofa.

246
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:22,750
Ms. Xi.

247
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,390
Can I help Jin Xia ask for a leave?

248
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,820
Of course.

249
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,960
Come on. Be careful.

250
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,160
You're awake.

251
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,760
How are you feeling now?

252
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,800
Nan Hua.

253
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,450
How come I'm at home now?

254
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,800
Lie down first.

255
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,930
The effect of the medicine has just stopped.

256
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,460
The effect of the medicine?

257
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,650
Do you still remember what happened during the daytime?

258
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,490
During the daytime...

259
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,940
I remember that I went to the studio,

260
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:24,430
and then Ms. Xi asked me to go to her office.

261
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,970
She asked me about yesterday's accident.

262
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,840
After that...

263
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,610
I don't remember what happened after that.

264
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,880
Was there anything abnormal with Ms. Xi?

265
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,190
Anything abnormal? I don't think so.

266
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,100
The last thing I remember is that I drank a glass of orange juice.

267
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:50,790
Did she give it to you?

268
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,970
Yes. Why?

269
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,720
It was the same as I expected.

270
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,530
I suspect...

271
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,910
Actually, it's not a suspicion now.

272
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,080
I'm sure that

273
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,930
Xi Manling has used me to do something.

274
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,160
Ms. Xi used you?

275
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,350
Why?

276
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,160
Today...

277
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,630
Mom!

278
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,510
Mom!

279
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,460
How come she's like this?

280
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,900
She was fine yesterday.

281
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,110
According to my preliminary judgment,

282
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,790
the patient drank excessive wine

283
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,200
after overdosing on aspirins,

284
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,670
which caused acute liver damage.

285
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,940
She's in a critical condition now.

286
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,310
You need to be mentally prepared.

287
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,010
Let's go.

288
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,990
Do you mean that

289
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,960
the matter that

290
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,040
someone from your clan tried to stop us from being together

291
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,950
is not true,

292
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,160
and it was made up by Ms. Xi,

293
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,050
because she wanted to use you to hurt others?

294
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,260
Right.

295
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,860
Haven't you noticed this?

296
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,390
From the beginning till the end,

297
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,760
this matter was only

298
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,320
described by Xi Manling.

299
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,170
Besides, I lost some of my memories,

300
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,790
so I couldn't make sure whether she told the truth or not.

301
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,650
Then why did Ms. Xi want to hurt others?

302
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,120
I'm probably clear about the reason.

303
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,020
How do you know?

304
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:22,130
When Mrs. Bruno was possessed by me,

305
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,000
I saw her fear.

306
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,440
The person she fears the most is her foster daughter Xi Manling.

307
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,600
When Xi Manling studied abroad,

308
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,860
she lived at Mr. and Mrs. Bruno's home.

309
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,510
But she interfered in the relationship of this family.

310
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,750
In my opinion, Xi Manling didn't know that

311
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,480
I had the ability to sense fear,

312
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,980
so her plan was imperfect.

313
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,640
But

314
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,270
how come Ms. Xi is someone like this?

315
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,850
A person's mind is unpredictable.

316
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,710
It's hard to truly understand it.

317
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,550
I wonder how

318
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,680
Mrs. Bruno is now.

319
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,650
She's a public figure.

320
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,360
If something wrong happens to her,

321
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,660
I think it'll be on the news.

322
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,820
[The wife of the famous fashion designer Bruno died in an accident.]

323
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:29,580
[The wife of the famous fashion designer Bruno died in an accident.]

324
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,240
Mrs. Bruno is dead.

325
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,830
How come she's dead?

326
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,300
Maybe the effect hasn't completely stopped.

327
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,230
Lie down first.

328
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,100
If there's any problem, just handle it after you take a good rest.

329
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,590
Thank you.

330
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,610
Just sleep now.

331
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,490
Go through the procedures later.

332
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,570
My condolences.

333
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,240
Okay. Thank you.

334
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,980
I'm sorry that I've made you suffer.

335
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,370
Lord Zhao wants to invite High Immortal Nan Hua to come out of the mountain.

336
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,410
I advise you to tell us his whereabouts as soon as possible.

337
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,170
The earrings I gave you

338
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,830
actually don't belong to me.

339
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,600
When I get the initial capital,

340
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,750
I will devote myself to saving our country by engaging in industry.

341
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,600
When the situation of our country gets stable,

342
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,800
I'll come back to you.

343
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:31,560
Where is Jin Xia?

344
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,840
She... She jumped out of the window.

345
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,440
She jumped out of the window?

346
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,480
History is strikingly similar.

347
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,290
Nan Hua.

348
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,690
Why haven't you learned your lesson yet?

349
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,180
You should become more evil.

350
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,210
Only in this way can you protect

351
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,480
the only person who truly loves you.

352
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:50,890
[Emergency Department Building]

353
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,330
Ms. Xi.

354
00:23:58,790 --> 00:23:59,590
Nan Hua.

355
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,390
Why are you here?

356
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,640
I specially came here to see you.

357
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,630
Let's talk.

358
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,120
It's not convenient here.

359
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,530
Let's go to my home.

360
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,040
Nan Hua.

361
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,470
I remember that you like drinking tea. Here you are.

362
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,610
No, thanks. I'm not thirsty.

363
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,320
I've made the tea.

364
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,380
In order to save your time, I'll cut to the chase.

365
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,240
Actually, you planned all these things, didn't you?

366
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,730
What plan?

367
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,180
I don't understand.

368
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,130
Last time,

369
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,190
Jin Xia was possessed by me in the company,

370
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,440
so she was able to dodge the coffee.

371
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,310
The situation was urgent,

372
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,650
and I didn't handle it well.

373
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,970
Because of that, you found something fishy about it.

374
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,510
You tricked Jin Xia into telling you the truth

375
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,170
and found out about my secret.

376
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,580
After all,

377
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,050
I'm very interested in your boyfriend.

378
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,470
Your boyfriend disappeared as soon as

379
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,460
the coffee splashed on you.

380
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,800
And you dodged the coffee in an agile way.

381
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:39,290
Then he appeared at the original spot again.

382
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,390
Ms. Xi, under the current circumstances,

383
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,150
I won't hide it from you anymore.

384
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,410
What do you mean?

385
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,700
Are you suspecting that I just used this information

386
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,620
to pretend to be the person whom you had awaited for a thousand years?

387
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,840
Yanhai told me that

388
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,940
when you came to our home last time,

389
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,470
you asked him a lot about my personal affairs.

390
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,380
Ms. Xi,

391
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,640
you are indeed the woman my buddy has been waiting for.

392
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:07,400
Actually, I want to know more about Nan Hua.

393
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,920
No problem. Just ask me.

394
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,820
I did ask him many questions

395
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,130
about you.

396
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,190
But I just wanted to know more about you.

397
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,140
After all, there is such a special

398
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,940
historical origin between us.

399
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,360
Can't I

400
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,060
be a bit curious about you?

401
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,820
You were able to draw those pieces of jewellery.

402
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,190
I temporarily believe that you're not an imposter.

403
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,190
I thought you were just like Jin Xia,

404
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:38,450
and you were different from those previous cheaters.

405
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,830
Not only did you not ask me for anything,

406
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,720
but you also advised me to let go of the past.

407
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:48,810
After you directed this show and acted in it by yourself, things were different.

408
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,650
Jin Xia!

409
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,710
The brake!

410
00:26:59,130 --> 00:26:59,930
What's wrong?

411
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,190
Why isn't the brake working?

412
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:05,120
That's strange. Why would I do this?

413
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,070
Because you wanted to use me to eliminate Mrs. Bruno.

414
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,540
Wasn't her death an accident?

415
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,300
Stop pretending.

416
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,560
You gave me only 15 minutes on purpose

417
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,240
so that I couldn't think carefully

418
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,310
and could only choose to give in

419
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,560
when I tried to save Jin Xia.

420
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,100
But there were many suspicious traces in the entire matter.

421
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,470
You know that, don't you?

422
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,930
What evidence do you have?

423
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,390
You've made yourself completely rid of the suspicion of

424
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,780
Mrs. Bruno's death.

425
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,060
Even if someone suspects you,

426
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,050
apart from the motive,

427
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:44,210
he won't be able to find any solid evidence.

428
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:47,790
If you don't trust me,

429
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,890
there's nothing I can do.

430
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:49,990
I can't prove my innocence

431
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,600
for something I didn't do.

432
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,920
But I'm just an ordinary person.

433
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,580
How would I offend someone like you?

434
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,740
Wouldn't I be afraid of your revenge after it happened?

435
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,600
You're afraid.

436
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,070
But as long as you stay away from me,

437
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,740
as I can't travel far,

438
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,200
I surely won't be able to take revenge on you.

439
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,660
It looks like you've almost finished

440
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,290
the immigration procedure.

441
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:20,350
I knew you would notice it.

442
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,110
But I didn't expect you to notice it so soon.

443
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,830
If you had been cheated many times,

444
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,230
you wouldn't fall into a trap so easily.

445
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,760
Now that you know the truth,

446
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,790
what are you going to do?

447
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,540
Will you manipulate me

448
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,570
and make me go to the police and turn myself in?

449
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,640
What do you think?

450
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,310
What do I think?

451
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,800
I think...

452
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,630
I think it would be good if I had met you earlier.

453
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,760
If that woman had not

454
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,620
only given me the last three days,

455
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,890
I believe I would have done better.

456
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,550
But under the current circumstances,

457
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,380
there's nothing else I can do.

458
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:56,880
Nan Hua.

459
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,540
Why are you lying prone on the bedside all night?

460
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,400
Why didn't you go to your bed to...

461
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,690
My goodness.

462
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,050
Jin Xia, you scared me.

463
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,580
You were the one who scared me. Okay?

464
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,420
Why are you here?

465
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,350
Where is Nan Hua?

466
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,350
He went out.

467
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,410
He went out?

468
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,550
Where did he go?

469
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,600
I don't know.

470
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,960
He suddenly asked me to come here at night.

471
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,080
Then he asked me

472
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,620
about Ms. Xi's matters.

473
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,690
After that, he went out.

474
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,250
Before he left, he specially asked me to

475
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,450
take good care of you.

476
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,960
Ms. Xi? Why did he go to see Ms. Xi?

477
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,480
Besides, it's already past ten o'clock.

478
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,810
He hasn't come back yet?

479
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,140
Not yet.

480
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,760
I'll send him a message and ask him.

481
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:38,330
Ding, I'm a bit thirsty.

482
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,030
Can you get me a glass of water?

483
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,120
Okay.

484
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,250
My feet are numb.

485
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,350
I squatted for too long just now.

486
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,540
Wait a moment.

487
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,590
My buddy is back.

488
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,630
Bro!

489
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,720
This two-faced man!

490
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,940
Help!

491
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,120
Come on. Help me.

492
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,710
Bro! What happened?

493
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,130
Put him over there.

494
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:10,670
What's wrong?

495
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,110
Be careful.

496
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,710
Be careful. Be careful.

497
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,090
Nan Hua! What's wrong with Nan Hua?

498
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,780
It's the same as last time.

499
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,400
Some coffee splashed on him.

500
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,080
Help him get recharged at once.

501
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,270
Get... Get charged?

502
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,370
I... I don't know whether I can help him get recharged now.

503
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:27,140
Just give it a try and you'll know, right?

504
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,140
Just give it a try.

505
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,620
Bro, you're awake.

506
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,210
It's good that he's awake.

507
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,250
Ms. Xi splashed the coffee on you?

508
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,200
You dodged it?

509
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,250
I've suspected her for a long time.

510
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,320
Of course I was particularly wary of her.

511
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,620
But Xiaochuan said some coffee splashed on you.

512
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,620
What was going on?

513
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:58,990
It was me.

514
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,440
I'm sorry.

515
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,500
I didn't mean to...

516
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:18,440
Nan Hua.

517
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,020
Xiaochuan.

518
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,600
This is... coffee?

519
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,710
It was just an accident.

520
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,010
Then why did you go to Ms. Xi's place?

521
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,770
A friend of mine also lives in that building.

522
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:37,370
She asked me to have dinner at her home tonight.

523
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:40,750
Who would have thought that it would be such a coincidence?

524
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:44,960
Xiaochuan,

525
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,130
why did you drink coffee at night?

526
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,450
It's my friend's birthday today.

527
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,280
She suggested that we should stay up all night to celebrate it.

528
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,280
I was afraid that I would get sleepy.

529
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:59,190
Nan Hua, I'm sorry.

530
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,480
It's all right.

531
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:04,810
It was my fault.

532
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,230
I was so focused on thinking about Ms. Xi's conspiracy

533
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,270
that I didn't dodge the coffee in time.

534
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,650
Xiaochuan, never mind.

535
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,750
Fortunately, it was you who did that.

536
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,199
In that case, you could bring him back home.

537
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,530
If it were someone else,

538
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,800
I don't know how this problem could have been solved.

539
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,469
And thanks to Xiaochuan,

540
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,790
now I can confirm that

541
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:31,340
Jin Xia can help me get recharged.

542
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:41,870
What about Xi Manling?

543
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,250
Bro, did you call the police?

544
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,510
Or did you manipulate her so that she would turn herself in?

545
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,150
Why?

546
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,199
When I saw Mrs. Bruno's fear,

547
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,940
I knew that this was a lie,

548
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,810
so I didn't make Mrs. Bruno take the medicine.

549
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,950
I just lied that she took the medicine.

550
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,400
But if that's the case,

551
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,060
how did Mrs. Bruno die?

552
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,250
Actually...

553
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,480
Come on. Please sign here.

554
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,230
Then you can take her body away.

555
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,300
Okay. Thank you.

556

[Death Certificate]

557
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,330
The cause of her death is suffocation?

558
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,000
Isn't it because of

559
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,390
the acute liver failure casued by taking aspirins

560
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,190
after drinking excessive wine?

561
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,670
According to the information provided by the hotel staff at the scene,

562
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,640
we thought so at first,

563
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,000
but this possibility was ruled out soon.

564
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,880
The decedent choked on her own vomit

565
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,280
after drinking excessive wine.

566
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,290
[Death Certificate]

567
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,680
Nan Hua didn't do it. It was an accident.

568
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:44,830
Mrs. Bruno's death

569
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,990
didn't result from Xi Manling's scheme.

570
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,170
Besides, as for what Xi Manling has done,

571
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,010
we can't explain it to the police

572
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,580
in a reasonable way.

573
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,300
So...

574
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,440
It's surprising that she managed to escape.

575
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:12,450
Jin Xia.

576
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,410
Jin Xia.

577
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,150
Are you okay?

578
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:21,510
I'm fine.

579
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:27,060
I'm just a little disappointed in Ms. Xi.

580
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,130
All Right. No need to see me off.

581
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,270
Do you have to leave here in the middle of the night?

582
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,460
Why don't you stay here for one night?

583
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,480
I can't.

584
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,540
I promised my friend to celebrate her birthday with her.

585
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,640
It's already past twelve o'clock.

586
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,970
She has been rushing me.

587
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,560
Let me drive you there.

588
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,350
No.

589
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,110
Nan Hua has just recovered.

590
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,340
Take good care of him first.

591
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,020
I've booked the ride sharing service.

592
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,240
Then let me escort you to the car.

593
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,720
No, it's just a few steps away.

594
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,180
I'll escort her to the car.

595
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:12,420
Jin Xia, go back inside to look after my buddy.

596
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,760
No need. Neither of you need to escort me to the car.

597
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,490
Ding will escort you to the car.

598
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,350
He has nothing else to do.

599
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,160
Xiaochuan, donâ€™t stand on ceremony.

600
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:21,770
Let's go.

601
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:23,910
Bye.

602
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:24,690
Bye.

603
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,910
Xiaochuan.

604
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,970
Is the driver who will pick you up this time

605
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,370
the same one as last time?

606
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,730
It's impossible that

607
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,560
both the ride sharing drivers are the same person.

608
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,020
If that person was a ride sharing driver, what you said is right.

609
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,820
But if he wasn't a ride sharing driver,

610
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,020
what you said is not necessarily right.

611
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,570
What are you talking about?

612
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,720
Xiaochuan,

613
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:52,390
the driver who picked you up last time

614
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,670
is actually the CEO of Qingshi Group,

615
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,980
and he's also Mr. Li, who asked my buddy to design the building

616
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,640
of the service center, right?

617
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,390
Really?

618
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,720
It looks like rich people

619
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,950
have some strange hobbies,

620
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,810
and they like to experience life.

621
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,140
You don't know him?

622
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:08,780
No, I don't know him.

623
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,620
But Chuchen's Livestreaming Studio

624
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,840
is a subsidiary of the Qingshi Group.

625
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,810
You don't even know the big boss of your own company?

626
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:20,040
Or, actually...

627
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,160
you two are in a romantic relationship?

628
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,120
I knew it.

629
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,260
Both of you have

630
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,600
a similar special smell.

631
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,800
You two must be very close to each other.

632
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,580
You found out about our relationship.

633
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,480
So,

634
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:58,680
Mr. Li asked my buddy to design the building of the service center.

635
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,890
He even compromised with him on his schedules in various aspects.

636
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:03,490
You secretly asked him to help my buddy. Right?

637
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,920
Yes.

638
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:07,900
Ding,

639
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,900
I still don't know how to tell Jin Xia about this.

640
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,110
Can you keep it from her for me?

641
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,110
Of course.

642
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:19,300
Xiaochuan, you're just afraid that my buddy and Jin Xia

643
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,830
won't accept the fact you used a connection to help them, right?

644
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,960
That's why you chose to do it secretly.

645
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,710
I really understand you.

646
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,760
Because I'm like that, too.

647
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:32,540
Ding, you're so nice.

648
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,670
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

649
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,520
Really?

650
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,350
That's great.

651
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,840
My car has arrived.

652
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,500
I have to go.

653
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,560
Then I'll say goodbye to you here.

654
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,120
Xiaochuan, be careful on the way.

655
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,800
Bye.

656
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,600
That's weird.

657
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:54,850
She admitted it so easily.

658
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,700
It seemed that she was hiding something.

659
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,200
Something's wrong.

660
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,390
Are you okay?

661
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,240
You've consumed so much spiritual energy.

662
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:22,500
I'm fine.

663
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:27,030
Is the plan going well?

664
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,890
I think it's fine.

665
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:34,820
I think...

666
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:42,050
I think it would be good if I had met you earlier.

667
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,340
If that woman had not

668
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,220
only given me the last three days,

669
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,570
I believe I would have done better.

670
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,530
But under the current circumstances,

671
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,190
there's nothing else I can do.

672
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,400
I'm sorry.

673
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,460
I didn't mean to...

674
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:14,090
Nan Hua.

675
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,960
It's the same as last time.

676
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,440
Some coffee splashed on him.

677
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,960
Help him get recharged at once.

678
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,110
Get... Get charged?

679
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:23,130
I... I don't know whether I can help him get recharged now.

680
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:25,070
Just give it a try and you'll know, right?

681
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,070
Just give it a try.

682
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,810
In this way,

683
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,320
both of them can remove their previous doubts of

684
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,050
being unable to get recharged.

685
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:57,080
The plan of Golden House Hidden Love

686
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,340
is finally back on the right track again.

687
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,990
Help me book a flight ticket to Taiwan.

688
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:05,810
It's Zhou Yinting's turn to show up.

689
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,030
Okay.
