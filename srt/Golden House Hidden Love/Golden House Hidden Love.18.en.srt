00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,160
In the several thousand years of human history,

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,040
there have been many unsolved mysteries.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,960
Are the stories of Dayu controlling the flood and Nvwa mending the sky myths?

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,560
Why would the advancement of human civilization

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,760
surpass its current situations?

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,800
There are all kinds of speculations.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,760
But in fact, the truth

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,760
dates back to the ancient times.

10
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,400
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,720
the highly developed

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,360
prehistoric civilizations once existed on Earth.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,680
Back then, the ancient people

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,080
mastered the scientific civilization far more advanced than that in modern society.

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,160
Their high-level genetic modification technology

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,280
even enabled them to develop

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,390
human potential to the greatest extent.

18
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,960
They could absorb the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,820
to stay alive and even exert extraordinary energy.

20
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,720
However, a tragic doomsday disaster

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,390
made those human beings almost extinct at that time.

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,710
Countless lives

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,910
and brilliant civilizations were destroyed overnight.

24
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,960
Only a small number of ancient people

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,560
survived the doomsday

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,330
after escaping to the underground in time

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,789
and entering into a frozen hibernation state.

28
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:14,450
After that,

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,200
through tens of thousands of years of self-repair,

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,480
our Earth conceived new intelligent lives again,

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,740
namely, the ancestors of modern people.

32
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,080
And the ancient people sleeping in the underground areas

33
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,480
woke up one after another

34
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,160
and returned to the land.

35
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,870
They saw

36
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,830
the new primitive humans who were still trying to make fire by drilling wood.

37
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,920
Out of good intentions,

38
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,030
they taught the younger generations

39
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,030
many technologies, such as farming, metallurgy,

40
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,800
construction, flood control, and precautions against natural disasters.

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,729
Many great civilization miracles

42
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,120
were the masterpieces made

43
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,850
by our ancestors with the help of ancient people.

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,759
At that time, the new human beings

45
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:51,860
[Fuxi Temple]

46
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,960
considered the ancient people with extraordinary energy as deities.

47
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,690
They built temples for them and worshipped them.

48
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,200
As the official historians of various countries exaggerated the stories about them,

49
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,720
many legendary ancient myths have been passed down till now.

50
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,240
In this way,

51
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,440
most ancient people around the world

52
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,360
fitted into the new world with the identities

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,520
of deities.

54
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,840
But there were also some low-profile ancient people

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,300
who chose to live in seclusion in deep mountains to escape from the mortal world.

56
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,070
However,

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,320
people's worship towards the deities

58
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,400
also gradually generated fear and desires.

59
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,200
The rulers feared that the power of deities

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,840
would become a threat to their royal power.

61
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,390
But they were also greedy

62
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,120
for immortality and the extraordinary power.

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,780
Therefore,

64
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,720
they used various excuses

65
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
to start wars

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,850
against the deities from time to time.

67
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,829
The ancient people were outnumbered

68
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,320
and were no match for the huge armies in the end.

69
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,920
They almost became extinct.

70
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,600
Little did they know

71
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,960
that by imparting the knowledge of weapon forging to the new humans,

72
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,160
they unwittingly unleashed a disaster upon themselves.

73
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,829
Although the ancient people who lived in deep mountains

74
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:56,400
survived this disaster,

75
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,920
they were hunted by the rulers continuously.

76
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,240
They were even slandered

77
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,510
and considered as horrible mountain spirits or ferocious ghosts.

78
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,880
In the blink of an eye,

79
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,750
those who had been regarded as deities became devils that everyone wanted to kill.

80
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,230
As everything keeps changing in the world,

81
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,920
no one knows the existence of the ancient people anymore.

82
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,270
Only those anecdotes and peculiar stories about ghosts and monsters

83
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,360
have been passed down from generation to generation.

84
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,079
And the tiny minority of ancient people who have survived

85
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,760
are still secretly hiding

86
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,630
in those covert corners in the world till now.

87
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,880
A long time ago,

88
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,430
a loving couple lived in a distant

89
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,220
ancient country in the east.

90
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,410
The husband was a brave and battlewise general.

91
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:41,000
Every time he went out for wars,

92
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,750
he always missed his wife.

93
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,410
But one day, when the general came back with victory,

94
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,410
he found that his wife was missing.

95
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,440
Being unable to find his wife after looking for her for a long time,

96
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,320
the general stood outside the house every day

97
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,120
to wait for his wife to come back.

98
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,240
He did the same thing day after day, and year after year.

99
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,240
Eventually, he turned into the Wife-awaiting Stone.

100
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,880
I thought it was just a legend.

101
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,080
It was not until I met the ancient man Nan Hua for the first time

102
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,010
that I knew it wasn't just a legend.

103
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,170
I remember that

104
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,840
it was a morning

105
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,950
on August 23, 1941.

106
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,519
Ling, Her Ladyship is asking you to see her.

107
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,320
Okay. I'll be right there.

108
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,330
We're going to Paris tomorrow?

109
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,790
But many people haven't got their visas yet.

110
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,030
Didn't we plan to leave next week?

111
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,560
Why did you change the plan so suddenly?

112
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,960
Then just ask those who can leave to go to Paris first.

113
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,360
Those who haven't got the visas yet

114
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,560
can go to Paris later.

115
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:58,510
Ms. Xi, why are you in such a hurry to go to Paris?

116
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,190
My foster mother passed away.

117
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,550
I'll take her body back to France

118
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,900
by plane early in the morning tomorrow.

119
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,500
I won't come back after that.

120
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,540
So, just pack your luggage today.

121
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,890
Sort out all the things you should take.

122
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,570
Ms. Xi, is there anything else

123
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,210
we should pack in the office?

124
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,570
I'll seize the time to pack them up for you.

125
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,710
Just sort out all the documents

126
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,240
and take them away for me.

127
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,910
Okay.

128
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:29,750
Bai Bing.

129
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,690
Carry this wedding dress away for me.

130
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,080
I don't want it anymore.

131
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,540
Just discard it directly.

132
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,470
Why?

133
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,920
Isn't that the work which you're most satisfied with?

134
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,520
There's no reason.

135
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,680
I just don't want it.

136
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,940
Don't you understand?

137
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,490
I'm sorry. I'll ask someone to carry it away at once.

138
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,150
There's a sudden and urgent notification.

139
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,150
Let's put our current work aside

140
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,710
and pack our things at once.

141
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,440
Those who have got a French visa

142
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,370
should go home and pack the luggage at once.

143
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,240
Those who haven't got a French visa yet should check

144
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,360
what other documents are needed and apply for the visa at once.

145
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,590
The rest of you can take this chance to finish the remaining work.

146
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:12,790
The plan has been changed, and we'll go to Paris tomorrow.

147
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll send you the details about the changes of time in our chat group.

148
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,760
Tomorrow? It's such a hurry.

149
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,470
Right. We haven't packed our luggage yet.

150
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,520
Right, Senior Bai Bing.

151
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,430
Why did you suddenly change the time to tomorrow?

152
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,280
Ms. Xi's foster mother passed away.

153
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,840
She'll send her body back to France tomorrow morning,

154
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,440
so she wants us to go with her.

155
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,340
But it's still such a hurry, Senior Bai Bing.

156
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,930
We haven't packed our luggage yet.

157
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,750
Alright. Just pack your things at once.

158
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,420
The plan was changed so suddenly. I haven't finished my work yet.

159
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,260
Right.

160
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,760
-Right. -What should I do?

161
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,620
Come in.

162
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,800
Ms. Xi.

163
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,120
Nan Hua told me everything.

164
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,920
It's all in the past.

165
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,210
It's meaningless to say anything.

166
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,280
Pack your luggage at once

167
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,540
and go to Paris with me.

168
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,910
You let me continue to work here and go to Paris with you

169
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,170
because of him, right?

170
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,300
So what?

171
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,870
This man by your side

172
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,180
is a big treasure.

173
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
If we used him well

174
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,830
in ancient times,

175
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,760
we might have become kings or queens.

176
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,660
Besides,

177
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,400
besides me,

178
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,430
you are the biggest

179
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,960
beneficiary of Mrs. Bruno's death this time.

180
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,940
If the big show is held successfully,

181
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,230
I'll be the top designer in the wedding dress design circle.

182
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,560
As my chief apprentice,

183
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,750
you will become a rising star in the fashion industry through this show.

184
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,560
But if you choose to give up,

185
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,600
I'm afraid you won't have a chance to join the fashion circle

186
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,860
in Paris all your life.

187
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,280
Ms. Xi, you're right.

188
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,200
I have this big treasure, Nan Hua.

189
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,610
I'm more likely to succeed than you.

190
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,620
I won't go to Paris this time.

191
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,560
Ms. Xi.

192
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,710
Goodbye. I won't see you off.

193
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
No.

194
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,330
I must leave tonight.

195
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,240
You've resigned?

196
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,260
I didn't expect that after just a few months,

197
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,280
I would change from a professional woman

198
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,380
who was determined to remain single till my death

199
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,550
and devoted myself to my career all my life,

200
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,530
to an unemployed young woman.

201
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,120
Xi Manling is quite shrewd and cunning.

202
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
Besides, she's an evil-hearted woman.

203
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,700
You'll be implicated by her sooner or later if you work for her.

204
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,830
Maybe it's good that you've resigned.

205
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,410
Though what you said is right,

206
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,160
I've quit my job,

207
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,110
and I wasn't able to hold the show in the end.

208
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,930
The company also owes a month's salary to me,

209
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,140
and I don't know when I can get it back.

210
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,360
Nan Hua, what should I do for my future life?

211
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,500
I'll support you financially in the future.

212
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,240
No.

213
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,570
That's your money.

214
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,440
I have to be financially independent.

215
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,300
Only in this way can I feel at ease.

216
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,830
You used to be alone.

217
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,680
Now that you have me,

218
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,440
shouldn't you redesign your life plan

219
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,650
and make it more consistent with the current situation?

220
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,750
For example?

221
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,560
You can be a housewife.

222
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,350
A housewife?

223
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,280
Honey, I'm back.

224
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,040
Dear, you're back.

225
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,960
Do you feel tired after a day's work?

226
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,350
No.

227
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,560
In order to make money for my wife,

228
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,840
no matter how tiring it is, I'm still happy.

229
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,300
I love my husband the most.

230
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,070
No, no, no.

231
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,970
I don't want you to talk nonsense like this again.

232
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:23,840
The women of my family

233
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,240
have never given up their careers

234
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,240
for the purpose of doing housework.

235
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,790
I have my own dream.

236
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,880
I'm sorry.

237
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,600
In ancient times,

238
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,960
being a housewife meant being a hostess,

239
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,440
instead of a servant who did housework.

240
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,790
If I've made you angry,

241
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:42,740
I'm sorry.

242
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,800
Alright. It's my fault.

243
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,320
I shouldn't have interpreted it out of context.

244
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,720
Let me put it another way.

245
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,400
You'll be the master of the family,

246
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,240
and be in charge of pursuing your dreams.

247
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,480
I'll earn money to support the family

248
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,830
and do housework as my part-time job. Okay?

249
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,810
Does this

250
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,000
sound like I'm bullying you?

251
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:11,070
I just like being bullied by you.

252
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:14,420
[Ms. Xi]

253
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:14,420
[Reject] [Answer]

254
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,140
There's a phone call.

255
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,110
It's Ms. Xi.

256
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,680
Hello?

257
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,010
Hello, Jin Xia.

258
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,720
I'm on my way to the airport.

259
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,270
I'll ask you one last time.

260
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,690
Are you sure you won't go to Paris with me?

261
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,710
I resigned during the daytime because of impulse.

262
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,760
But now,

263
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,640
I'm very sure of it.

264
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,790
Okay.

265
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,920
To be honest, I quite envy you,

266
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,020
because you met someone like Nan Hua.

267
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,570
Everything I have in my life

268
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,640
has been acquired through my own efforts.

269
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,470
But you are so lucky,

270
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,200
and you have something

271
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,630
which we can't get no matter how hard we try.

272
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,250
Is Nan Hua by your side?

273
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,230
Yes.

274
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,390
Could you please let him talk on the phone?

275
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,120
Sure.

276
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,760
She wants to talk to you.

277
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,300
Hello?

278
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,440
Nan Hua.

279
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,320
I'm sorry.

280
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,540
I took advantage of you selfishly.

281
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,690
But I had no choice.

282
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,240
This world is so cruel and realistic.

283
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,910
You've lived for so long.

284
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,150
I believe you know that better than I do.

285
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,680
If someone with a family background like mine

286
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,630
wants to gain a foothold in this world,

287
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,030
by depending on himself,

288
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,280
no matter how hard he tries,

289
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,540
he'll have no way of achieving that goal.

290
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,910
I don't expect you to understand me.

291
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,640
I just want to say this to you.

292
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:35,810
I'm sorry.

293
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,430
I'm afraid I can't accept your apology.

294
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,190
I've seen human beings' greed and narrowness of mind

295
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,460
many times indeed.

296
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,190
But I've also seen kindness and selflessness.

297
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,060
It's every individual's choice to decide how he lives.

298
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,170
Other reasons are just excuses.

299
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,500
That's all I want to say.

300
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,210
If you just want to apologize on the phone,

301
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,250
I'm hanging up.

302
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,000
Wait.

303
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,260
Making an apology isn't my only purpose.

304
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,620
I want to confess something to you.

305
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,350
Actually...

306
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:25,810
Actually, I'm not the person whom you've been waiting for.

307
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,850
Besides, that pair of earrings and those accessories

308
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,260
were not designed by me originally.

309
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,530
I guessed it.

310
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,800
The design inspiration

311
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,640
came from some old photos of the Republic of China.

312
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,220
I used to work for the owner in those photos

313
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,420
for some time,

314
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,960
so I was lucky to have the chance to see her personal albums.

315
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,530
The design drawings of those accessories

316
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,790
were drafted according to her collections.

317
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,310
Besides, as for your story,

318
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,130
I just learned a little about it from her diary.

319
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:02,930
Zhou Yinting.

320
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,630
Yes.

321
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,360
Maybe she's the one you've been waiting for.

322
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,020
Okay. I got it.

323
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,650
Are you Mr. Nan Hua?

324
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,350
Yes, I am.

325
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,100
A young lady

326
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,930
asked me to give this to you.

327
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:40,760
She said

328
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,550
she was going to die soon,

329
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,240
and she wanted you to save her.

330
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,410
Ms. Zhou asked someone to send a message to me.

331
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,160
She said that she had an accident unluckily,

332
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,290
and was imprisoned.

333
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,320
But when I arrived,

334
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,360
the whole prison was empty.

335
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,430
All the criminals had been executed urgently.

336
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,420
Since then,

337
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,720
I've never seen Ms. Zhou again.

338
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,310
I always thought that

339
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,510
she had died.

340
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,980
Later, I lost my memories,

341
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,000
and I forgot about her, too.

342
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,790
Since Ms. Xi said that

343
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,990
she had worked for Ms. Zhou before,

344
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,360
judging from her age and the time,

345
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,630
I don't think Ms. Zhou died young.

346
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,490
She might have been saved.

347
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,630
Maybe.

348
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,820
Do you want me to search for it online for you?

349
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,590
No need.

350
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:33,470
Why?

351
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,080
If Xi Manling hadn't mentioned it,

352
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,020
I wouldn't have thought of the past initiatively.

353
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,060
Besides, I have you now.

354
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,040
Everything else isn't important now.

355
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,370
Instead of wasting our time on those insignificant people,

356
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,480
we might as well

357
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,010
prepare for our date carefully.

358
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,520
Our date?

359
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,440
That's right.

360
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,840
Aren't couples supposed to have a date?

361
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,880
How come a blockhead like you is suddenly so smart now?

362
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,030
Xiaochuan reminded me last night.

363
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,359
It's my fault as I'm inexperienced.

364
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,599
I didn't think about

365
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
such an important thing in advance.

366
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,880
Having a date is just a form.

367
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,579
I almost forgot if you didn't mention it.

368
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,890
We're together every day anyway.

369
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,180
Even so,

370
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,480
our daily life

371
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,870
cannot be considered as having a formal date after all.

372
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:34,720
Well,

373
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,470
do you have any plans?

374
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,890
Are you free this Saturday?

375
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,240
I'm not sure.

376
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,110
Can you give a whole day to me,

377
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,000
including you?

378
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,310
Alright.

379
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,830
However,

380
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,230
speaking of which, why do you have the mood

381
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,330
to think about these things so soon?

382
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,730
Ms. Xi cheated us in such an outrageous way.

383
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,920
You are not even angry?

384
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,940
If I'm angry, what can I do?

385
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,180
If I get sick because of anger,

386
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,760
it'll be harmful for my own health, won't it?

387
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,740
Ms. Xi even thought that you would take revenge on her,

388
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,250
so she ran away overnight.

389
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:29,560
She just judged a gentleman's heart with her own evil thoughts.

390
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,290
That's a typical mindset of a bad guy.

391
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,000
A typical mindset of a bad guy?

392
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,520
Only a bad guy would think that

393
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,450
everyone wants to take revenge on him.

394
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,780
He is worried and scared every day, being alert all the time.

395
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:44,310
Actually, that's because

396
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:48,070
only a bad guy would think about taking revenge on others,

397
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,240
and he thought, just like him, all good people would

398
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,870
seek revenge for every grievance.

399
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,960
That makes sense.

400
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,040
Let's not talk about these unhappy things.

401
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,060
Let's have a date this Saturday.

402
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:01,770
Okay.

403
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,460
Do you have a plan?

404
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,870
It's a secret.

405
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,330
A secret?

406
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:14,650
Why do you have so many secrets?

407
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,040
Tell me now.

408
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,730
Why do you have so many secrets?

409
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:20,820
Can't I?

410
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,210
No.

411
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,450
You're so cunning.

412
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,190
What should I wear for the date?

413
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,880
So cute.

414
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,690
Is it a bit too short?

415
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,820
This is my favorite dress.

416
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,650
Is this one a bit too revealing?

417
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,040
Many parts of my skin will be exposed.

418
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,300
I'll wear it next time.

419
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,590
This one.

420
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:51,740
Hello.

421
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,660
I love you.

422
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,760
Dear, I love you.

423
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,160
I love you.

424
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:54,390
I still need to put on some accessories and makeup.

425
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,890
Wait a moment.

426
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,170
It's too grandiose.

427
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,760
It's too casual.

428
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,470
They're too small.

429
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,930
They're too big.

430
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,790
They're cute.

431
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,790
I'll wear this pair of earrings.

432
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,610
Where is the new lipstick I've bought?

433
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,630
I left it in the studio.

434
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,750
It's embarrassing.

435
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,950
Will Nan Hua

436
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,880
like this dress

437
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,090
and its texture?

438
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,320
Jin Xia, I have faith in you.

439
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,790
Since when have I had

440
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,160
such a pair of corny boxer shorts?

441
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,350
Is it time for my menstruation now?

442
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,350
That's not right.

443
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,850
It just ended two days ago.

444
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,280
What are you doing so early in the morning?

445
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,070
I'm writing about the schedule for our date tomorrow.

446
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,310
Actually, they're the things I've been wanting

447
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,520
to do with others for the past one thousand years.

448
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,290
For these things you've expected for a thousand years, how can we finish them in just a day?

449
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,310
Just take your time.

450
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,510
We'll have plenty of time in the future.

451
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,120
Okay.

452
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,440
You won't be surprised after you see it.

453
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,790
So mysterious.

454
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,280
Alright. Go on writing it.

455
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,680
I'm going to the company.

456
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,460
You've resigned, haven't you?

457
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,260
Why are you going to the company?

458
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,880
I still have a lot of things to pack.

459
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,110
Do you want me to go with you?

460
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:24,870
No.

461
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:27,130
Just stay at home to plan our date carefully.

462
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,460
I'm looking forward to our date tomorrow.

463
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,770
What's wrong? Do you have a bellyache?

464
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,950
A little.

465
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,990
Is it time for your menstruation now?

466
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:40,800
Then tomorrow...

467
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,600
I'm fine.

468
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,810
My menstruation has just ended. It's very safe.

469
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,880
It's safe?

470
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,400
I mean...

471
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,320
there will be no problem tomorrow.

472
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,450
Nothing can stop us from having a date.

473
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,120
Okay.

474
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,200
I have to go.

475
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,580
Be careful on the way.

476
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,580
Bye.

477
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:58,410
Bye.

478
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,120
Petty-minded guy.

479
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,920
Senior.

480
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,850
Jin Xia, why are you here?

481
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,390
I left in a hurry yesterday.

482
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,040
I still have some things which I haven't packed.

483
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,220
What are you doing?

484
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,050
We're not going to Paris.

485
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,430
You're not going?

486
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,510
Something happened last night.

487
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:53,850
It's about Ms. Xi.

488
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,790
Someone anonymously told the media about

489
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,960
Ms. Xi's plagiarism

490
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,510
and the truth that she interfered in the relationship of the Brunos.

491
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,920
This scandal is spread more and more widely.

492
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,870
The big show has also been cancelled because of it.

493
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:03,840
Jin Xia.

494
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,230
The leaders of our group are very angry.

495
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,890
They've disbanded our studio

496
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,640
and even asked us to move out within one day.

497
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,730
Hurry up and pack up your things.

498
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,190
Otherwise, people of the group will come here to rush us again.

499
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,360
I didn't expect that it would be so serious that

500
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,890
everyone got into trouble.

501
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,380
I didn’t expect that it would end up like this.

502
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,720
Although Ms. Xi deserved it,

503
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,960
all the employees lost their jobs because of this.

504
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,920
They must be very upset.

505
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,110
In that case,

506
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:06,370
whether I've resigned or not, the result would be the same.

507
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,470
All of us are pitiful workers.

508
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,790
However,

509
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,440
I still have Nan Hua.

510
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,200
That's kind of a lucky thing despite all the misfortunes.

511
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,430
I didn't expect that

512
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:24,470
I would be the female lead chosen by Heaven.

513
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,760
Blood!

514
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,370
Blood!

[Outpatient Clinic]

516
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,430
Let me see.

517
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,760
It's quite serious.

518
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,440
Doctor, what's wrong with me?

519
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,050
My psychological resilience is quite strong.

520
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,980
If you want to tell me anything, just say it directly.

521
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:10,270
Have I got an incurable disease?

522
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,120
No. You have actue internal hemorrhoids.

523
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,510
Acute internal hemorrhoids?

524
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,020
It's a type of hemorrhoids.

525
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,560
It's a common disease.

526
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,250
[He looks handsome and can cut hemorrhoids quickly]

527
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,430
Besides, it's easier for girls to have hemorrhoids.

528
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,290
You'll be fine after the surgery.

529
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:33,410
[He looks handsome and can cut hemorrhoids quickly]

530
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,700
I'll have a surgery?

531
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,610
Today?

532
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,250
Yes.

533
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,720
You can go through the hospitalization procedure now.

534
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,750
Don't worry too much.

535
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,730
It's just a minor surgery.

536
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,750
Besides, you'll recover after a few days' rest in hospital.

537
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:49,890
No, doctor.

538
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,310
I have something important to do tomorrow.

539
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,460
Can I come back the day after tomorrow?

540
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,590
I don't suggest you to wait any longer.

541
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,280
Although internal hemorrhoids are not a serious disease,

542
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,150
this disease will still make you suffer a lot.

543
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,350
If the range of your movements is a bit big,

544
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:04,080
it may cause your internal hemorrhoids to burst.

545
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,960
You'll feel quite unwell by that time.

546
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,330
But, doctor...

547
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,630
I suggest you to reconsider it carefully.

[He looks handsome and can cut hemorrhoids quickly]

549
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,120
Can you postpone your plan for a few days?

550
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,110
To be honest,

551
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,680
you basically can't do anything

552
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,740
if you have an attack of this disease.

553
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,280
Doctor, how about

554
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,660
prescribing two boxes of painkillers for me?

555
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,260
I want the most effective kind of painkillers.

556
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:29,610
Alright.

557
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:31,570
Thank you.

558
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:43,980
Darn it.

559
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:50,000
It didn't hurt when I didn't know it.

560
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:51,470
But after I knew it,

561
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:54,390
how come it hurts so much?

562
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,310
You're back.

563
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,890
Where is your stuff?

564
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:01,940
What stuff?

565
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,270
Didn't you go back to the studio to pack your stuff?

566
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:09,550
It seems that I left it in the car.

567
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,040
I'll go...

568
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,440
I'll go get it for you.

569
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,670
Thank you.

570
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,490
What's wrong with you?

571
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,140
Are you feeling unwell?

572
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,680
No.

573
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,020
Then why are you holding the medical record book?

574
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,350
It seems that you even have some medicine.

575
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:29,310
Well,

576
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,420
I went to the hospital to ask the doctor to prescribe it when I had a cold previously.

577
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,360
I left it in the company.

578
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,380
I brought it back with other stuff this time.

579
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,590
It's just some common cold medicine.

580
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,840
But on the medicine box, it says

581
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,310
“Strong Painkillers”.

582
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,600
Your eyesight is good.

583
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:45,760
Well,

584
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,700
sometimes, when I have a bellyache during my menstruation, I'll take some painkillers.

585
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,320
A bellyache during your menstruation?

586
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,450
But it says "anorectal“ on the box.

587
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,380
This is Xiaochuan's.

588
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,400
She left in a hurry after her live stream show last time,

589
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,200
so she left it in my office.

590
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,800
Well, right, it's Xiaochuan's.

591
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,330
It's... It's Xiaochuan's.

592
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,900
What’s wrong with her?

593
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,060
She... You're rude!

594
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,250
Why are you asking so many questions?

595
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,760
Go get my stuff now!

596
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,120
Okay.

597
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,110
What are you thinking about?

598
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,370
Why aren't you eating?

599
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,140
I'm thinking

600
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,510
how's your preparation for our date?

601
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,050
I promise I won't let you down.

602
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,080
You're so confident.

603
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:02,680
I wonder what the weather will be like tomorrow.

604
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,600
I've checked it.

605
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,480
The weather will be fine.

606
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,640
It'll be cloudy with breezes.

607
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,570
The temperature will be pleasant.

608
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,960
Good. Good.

609
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,940
It will cost a lot of money to have a date, right?

610
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,410
Look. I've just lost my job.

611
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,920
[Cheque for Transferring Money]

612
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,400
A cheque?

613
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,030
[Cheque for Transferring Money]

614
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,200
200,000 yuan.

615
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,880
This is the deposit they gave me previously for designing the building.

616
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,790
200,000 yuan isn't a large amount of money.

617
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,860
Look. We have to renovate the house

618
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,860
and pay the house loan.

619
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,520
I'll have more money if I sell the earrings.

620
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,920
Don't worry. I've made a budget carefully.

621
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,680
You don't understand.

622
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:44,440
The money we haven't got can't be considered as our money.

623
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,280
Nowadays, many people tend to give you some false hope.

624
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:50,270
I know.

625
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:53,020
So I've carefully planned our date this time.

626
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:56,280
The most important thing is that it'll be romantic and meaningful

627
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,220
without being extravagant.

628
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,030
Don't worry.

629
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,130
If I make a lot of money in the future,

630
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:02,060
I'll give you a better experience.

631
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,400
But this is a cheque,

632
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,280
not cash.

633
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,150
Why don't we wait a little longer?

634
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,460
After we cash it out, we can...

635
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,960
[100,000 yuan]

636
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,000
have a date by that time.

637
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,920
I've asked Ding to withdraw the money for me.

638
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,420
What should I do, Jin Xia?

639
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,680
Why don't you tell him honestly that

640
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,880
you have internal hemorrhoids?

641
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,000
No.

642
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,100
No, no, no.

643
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,470
Jin Xia.

644
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,960
You must never tell Nan Hua that

645
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,130
you have internal hemorrhoids.

646
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,980
This is not okay. I have to find another excuse.

647
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,850
Nan Hua, I'm sorry.

648
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,880
I have to work overtime suddenly.

649
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,390
My boss has asked me to draft another 800 design drawings.

650
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,050
I can't finish them in one day.

651
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,450
You've just resigned, haven't you?

652
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,860
I'm having a period now.

653
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,150
My legs, back and belly all ache.

654
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,980
But this morning, you said that your menstruation had just ended.

655
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm sorry, Nan Hua.

656
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,070
My relative came to visit me.

657
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,070
He came from a distant place.

658
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,800
He's my cousin whom I haven't seen for a long time.

659
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:05,540
Ma'am, what other relatives do you have?

660
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,770
I'm such a pitiful girl.

661
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,150
No.

662
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,960
I need to find fault with him.

663
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:14,290
Nan Hua.

664
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,739
It'll be our first date tomorrow.

665
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,810
It's an important day.

666
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,040
We must choose an auspicious day.

667
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:30,610
You already know that?

668
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:33,540
What do I know?

669
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:38,130
Tomorrow will be the Auspicious Festival in my home country where I used to live.

670
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:39,590
It'll also be my birthday.

671
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,710
I've asked Ding not to tell you.

672
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,199
He can't hide anything.

673
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:52,290
So please dress up for our date tomorrow.

674
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,120
Of course.

675
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,410
No matter how big my sacrifices will be...

676
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:07,660
I mean,

677
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:10,110
tomorrow, it will be my...

678
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,070
Tomorrow, I'll be...

679
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,660
Tomorrow will be the most

680
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,560
memorable day in my life.

681
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,160
I will try my best.

682
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:45,170
Why does it hurt more than yesterday?

683
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:50,730
Is this painkiller effective?

684
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,880
Who is this?

685
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,550
It hurts.

686
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,420
Don't use any strength.

687
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,050
Take a deep breath.

688
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,640
Calm down.

689
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:52,000
Put on the makeup to look gorgeous.

690
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,300
Make myself look as if I was born with a good complexion.

691
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,760
My skin will look fair with pink cheeks.

692
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,120
In that case, Nan Hua will feel that

693
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:14,200
I'm particularly beautiful today.

694
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:22,120
Today will be the most beautiful day

695
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,800
in his life.

696
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:48,760
This tight dress isn't suitable for me now.

697
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,600
I don't think I can wear

698
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,050
the several sets of clothes I chose yesterday.

699
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,050
It's you.

700
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,600
Good.

701
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,190
This is good.

702
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,300
And this one.

703
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,910
Don't think about wearing it today.

704
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,110
What should I do?

705
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:34,560
Fortunately, I have you.

706
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,400
Are you ready?

707
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,840
Let's go.

708
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,950
Okay.

709
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,150
What's wrong?

710
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,000
Nothing.

711
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,230
It seems that I've forgotten to take something.

712
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:39,770
I'll go get it.

713
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:48,830
Have you taken it with you?

714
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,670
Nan Hua.

715
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:54,680
Can I give you a small suggestion?

716
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:03,360
Can you take smaller steps today?

717
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:05,390
Of course.

718
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:08,640
Did I walk too fast before?

719
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:10,570
No.

720
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:17,150
Your legs are just too long.

721
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,940
I was thoughtless.

722
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:24,130
I'll walk in small steps today.

723
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:04,460
Then our first date will officially begin.

724
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,810
I'm looking forward to it.
