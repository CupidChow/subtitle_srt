[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,190
In the several thousand years of human history,

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,070
there have been many unsolved mysteries.

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,990
Are the stories of Dayu controlling the flood and Nvwa mending the sky myths?

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,600
Why would the advancement of human civilization

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,790
surpass its current situations?

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,830
There are all kinds of speculations.

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,790
But in fact, the truth

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,790
dates back to the ancient times.

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,430
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,750
the highly developed

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,390
prehistoric civilizations once existed on Earth.

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,710
Back then, the ancient people

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,110
mastered the scientific civilization far more advanced than that in modern society.

15
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,190
Their high-level genetic modification technology

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,310
even enabled them to develop

17
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,430
human potential to the greatest extent.

18
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,990
They could absorb the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth

19
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,850
to stay alive and even exert extraordinary energy.

20
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,750
However, a tragic doomsday disaster

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,430
made those human beings almost extinct at that time.

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,750
Countless lives

23
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,950
and brilliant civilizations were destroyed overnight.

24
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,990
Only a small number of ancient people

25
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,590
survived the doomsday

26
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,360
after escaping to the underground in time

27
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,830
and entering into a frozen hibernation state.

28
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,490
After that,

29
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,220
through tens of thousands of years of self-repair,

30
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,510
our Earth conceived new intelligent lives again,

31
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,770
namely, the ancestors of modern people.

32
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,110
And the ancient people sleeping in the underground areas

33
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,510
woke up one after another

34
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,190
and returned to the land.

35
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,910
They saw

36
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,860
the new primitive humans who were still trying to make fire by drilling wood.

37
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,950
Out of good intentions,

38
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,050
they taught the younger generations

39
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,070
many technologies, such as farming, metallurgy,

40
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,830
construction, flood control, and precautions against natural disasters.

41
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,759
Many great civilization miracles

42
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:43,150
were the masterpieces made

43
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,880
by our ancestors with the help of ancient people.

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,750
At that time, the new human beings

45
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,440
[Fuxi Temple]

46
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:51,990
considered the ancient people with extraordinary energy as deities.

47
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,720
They built temples for them and worshipped them.

48
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:58,229
As the official historians of various countries exaggerated the stories about them,

49
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,750
many legendary ancient myths have been passed down till now.

50
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,270
In this way,

51
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,470
most ancient people around the world

52
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,390
fitted into the new world with the identities

53
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,550
of deities.

54
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,870
But there were also some low-profile ancient people

55
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,329
who chose to live in seclusion in deep mountains to escape from the mortal world.

56
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,110
However,

57
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,350
people's worship towards the deities

58
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,430
also gradually generated fear and desires.

59
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,240
The rulers feared that the power of deities

60
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,870
would become a threat to their royal power.

61
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,430
But they were also greedy

62
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,150
for immortality and the extraordinary power.

63
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:31,810
Therefore,

64
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,750
they used various excuses

65
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,750
to start wars

66
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,880
against the deities from time to time.

67
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,870
The ancient people were outnumbered

68
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,350
and were no match for the huge armies in the end.

69
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,950
They almost became extinct.

70
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:45,630
Little did they know

71
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,990
that by imparting the knowledge of weapon forging to the new humans,

72
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,190
they unwittingly unleashed a disaster upon themselves.

73
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,870
Although the ancient people who lived in deep mountains

74
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,430
survived this disaster,

75
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,950
they were hunted by the rulers continuously.

76
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,270
They were even slandered

77
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,550
and considered as horrible mountain spirits or ferocious ghosts.

78
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,910
In the blink of an eye,

79
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,790
those who had been regarded as deities became devils that everyone wanted to kill.

80
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,270
As everything keeps changing in the world,

81
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,950
no one knows the existence of the ancient people anymore.

82
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,310
Only those anecdotes and peculiar stories about ghosts and monsters

83
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,400
have been passed down from generation to generation.

84
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,110
And the tiny minority of ancient people who have survived

85
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,790
are still secretly hiding

86
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,670
in those covert corners in the world till now.

87
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,490
Why didn't you make a wish?

88
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,390
What's wrong?

89
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,150
You said a shooting star is a rare and spectacular sight.

90
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,430
If we see it, we should make a wish. Right?

91
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,690
One shooting star represents a miracle.

92
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,670
But a meteor shower...

93
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,750
represents falling.

94
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,880
An ancient person is about to fall.

95
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,110
What do you mean?

96
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,230
Spiritual energy has an impact on the magnetic field.

97
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,030
When an ancient person dies,

98
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,830
a huge amount of spiritual energy in his body will be given back to Heaven and Earth.

99
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,630
It can even affect the orbits of celestial bodies.

100
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,909
The sudden meteor shower indicates

101
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,170
an ancient person is going to die.

102
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,350
Then... I want to take back my wish I just made.

103
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,720
I want to make a new wish.

104
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,790
I wish

105
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,860
I would never see a meteor shower again.

106
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,070
Grandma, why did you leave so soon?

107
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,870
Why didn't you stay for a few more days?

108
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,630
I just came to see you.

109
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,510
I'm relieved after knowing you are fine.

110
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,150
But you left in a hurry.

111
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,720
Why didn't you spend more time with me?

112
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,190
I'm very busy.

113
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,830
I don't have that much time to accompany you.

114
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,470
Remember. Just be straightforward.

115
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,550
Have a relationship with Nan wholeheartedly.

116
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,670
Right.

117
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,080
I've put your things

118
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,190
on the office desk.

119
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,110
Grandma, I...

120
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,040
I'm warning you.

121
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,630
Don't throw them away.

122
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,070
Keep them well.

123
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,510
When you get old, you'll know

124
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,030
these are very precious memories.

125
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,630
Okay, I know.

126
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,230
Also,

127
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,220
put away your household register and property ownership certificate.

128
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,790
Don't lose them because of your carelessness.

129
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,380
[Household Register]

130
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,350
Okay, I know.

131
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,670
Grandma, I have to go.

132
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,630
I have something to do.

133
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,710
I'll visit you when I'm free, okay?

134
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,310
Okay. Bye.

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,070
Ding Yanhai.

136
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,940
Why is it him again?

137
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,920
Stay invisible. I'm going to send him away.

138
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,230
Jin Xia, good evening.

139
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,990
Ding, what's up?

140
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,530
Is my brother here?

141
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,710
No.

142
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,190
Wait.

143
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,190
I have something very important to tell him.

144
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,230
What is it?

145
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,590
There will be a meteor shower tonight.

146
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,940
I want to ask him to enjoy it with me.

147
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,270
That's it?

148
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,560
So can I go in and wait for him... to come back?

149
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,030
No.

150
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,870
Sister-in-law.

151
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,010
Just let me stay here for a moment.

152
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,310
What did you call me just now?

153
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,830
Sister-in-law.

154
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,430
Just let me stay here for a moment.

155
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,560
If he doesn't come back in half an hour,

156
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,190
I'll go back, okay?

157
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,390
Just half an hour.

158
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,990
No problem, Sister-in-law.

159
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,110
This is called... playing hard to get.

160
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,590
Ding.

161
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,070
Ding, let me get you a cup of tea.

162
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,150
Thank you, Jin Xia.

163
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:07,350
Ding, so... what's going on?

164
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,480
Jin Xia, can I trust you?

165
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,720
You can.

166
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,870
How should I put it?

167
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,400
I've always felt my brother is different from ordinary people.

168
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,150
Different?

169
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,710
Why?

170
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,670
For example, he can make things float suddenly.

171
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,510
And he can suddenly disappear and then appear.

172
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,799
It's like he can go invisible.

173
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,909
How is that possible?

174
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,390
You must have watched too many science fiction movies.

175
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,450
Kids shouldn't watch too many science fiction movies.

176
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,880
Those are all lies.

177
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,140
What's... going on?

178
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,950
I don't... know.

179
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,110
Cats, look.

180
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:16,870
What's this?

181
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,260
It's your favorite marble.

182
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,270
It's fine.

183
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,440
Maybe this house is haunted.

184
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,110
You think it's fine even though this house is haunted?

185
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,230
I said "maybe".

186
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,710
There's no water. I'm going to boil some water.

187
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,540
Wait for me.

188
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,390
Jin Xia.

189
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,510
What's wrong? Are you okay?

190
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,290
Jin Xia.

191
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,030
Jin Xia.

192
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,350
Jin Xia, are you okay?

193
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,860
I thought you hurt your butt.

194
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,860
Why... are you covering your mouth?

195
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:31,610
Jin Xia?

196
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,910
I'm fine. Thank you.

197
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:44,200
Then... just now, this was...

198
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,970
When I was young,

199
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,410
I practiced martial arts.

200
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,670
Then... the lights...

201
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,310
I think it's been 30 minutes.

202
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,240
Why don't you...

203
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,710
It's only been 15 minutes, right?

204
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,900
It's long enough.

205
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,030
-You're so busy. Go back now.
-Butâ€¦

206
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm not busy.

207
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,860
But Aunt Wenying just called you.

208
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,390
But...

209
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:06,950
Stop.

210
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,050
How about this?

211
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,390
When your brother comes back,

212
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,430
I'll send you a WeChat message.

213
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,430
What do you think?

214
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,360
Really?

215
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,070
Really.

216
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,950
Really.

217
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,500
Okay. I'll... go back to take a shower

218
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,480
and wait for him.

219
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,950
Good idea.

220
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,630
You must let me know.

221
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,430
Okay. I will.

222
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,430
Just go.

223
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,600
Bye. Bye.

224
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,470
My butt.

225
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,110
Jin Xia.

226
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,150
Does your butt hurt?

227
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,830
A little.

228
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,180
Let me take a look.

229
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,430
It seems... it doesn't hurt that much.

230
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,200
I... I'm going to get you some medicine.

231
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,750
-Jin Xia, I forgot my cellphone.
-Who is it?

232
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,710
Ding Yanhai.

233
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:03,510
He left his cellphone here.

234
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,750
He's so forgetful.

235
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,280
I'm going to get his cellphone.

236
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,900
I'm going to deliver it to him.

237
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,430
This is the marble she just used.

238
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,450
Ding, your cellphone.

239
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,990
Is he back?

240
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,450
You've left for only two minutes.

241
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,830
Alright, let's talk later.

242
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,990
A meteor shower.

243
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,230
It's really a meteor shower.

244
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,730
It's so beautiful.

245
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,710
Jin Xia, do you believe in miracles?

246
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,510
Miracles?

247
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,670
There are 7.8 billion people in this world.

248
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,500
The probability of two people meeting each other

249
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,190
is one in 7.8 billion.

250
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,030
Do you know

251
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,510
what the probability of them meeting again

252
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,870
in the vast sea of people is

253
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,470
after two people meet?

254
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,030
I don't know.

255
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,360
It's lower than the probability

256
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,350
of being hit by a meteor shower.

257
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:02,310
So... am I the one

258
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,950
he's been waiting for?

259
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,350
A-Again?

260
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,860
Jin Xia, are you okay?

261
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,030
I...

262
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,310
It's you.

263
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,240
It's really you.

264
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,980
It's really you.

265
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,510
Ding... Yanhai.

266
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,150
I remember. You are...

267
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,150
It's me.

268
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,550
Brother, I finally found you.

269
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,430
I've been looking for you. Do you know how hard it has been?

270
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,590
I've travelled

271
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,670
all over the world

272
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,390
and through a few centuries.

273
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,150
I finally found you.

274
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:00,870
So Ding... is the one Nan Hua has been waiting for?

275
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,470
Then I...

276
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,030
You saved me again.

277
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,540
I meet you again.

278
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,380
It's like a miracle.

279
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,829
Jin Xia, are you okay?

280
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,109
I...

281
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,790
Jin Xia is fine.

282
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,510
But you...

283
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,430
Your body...

284
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,070
I'm fine.

285
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,100
I have plenty of spiritual energy these days.

286
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,360
It won't be used up easily like last time.

287
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,630
What does plenty of spiritual energy mean?

288
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,030
Let's talk inside.

289
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:41,950
Okay.

290
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,270
Brother.

291
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,510
Can I... sleep here tonight?

292
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,080
I want to have a long talk with you tonight.

293
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,020
Are you really not going to let him in?

294
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,600
What on earth happened?

295
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,970
He's the descendant of Taiping.

296
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,790
He's also one of the people I promised to protect.

297
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:24,680
Taiping,

298
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,150
I'm sorry.

299
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,100
I promise you.

300
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,390
I will stay here forever

301
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,230
and protect your descendants.

302
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,540
Don't be afraid. It's fine.

303
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:58,910
You are a superman.

304
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,470
Are you really a superman?

305
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,610
Be careful from now on.

306
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,590
I can't protect you all the time.

307
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:10,550
Brother? Brother?

308
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:11,430
Brother?

309
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,600
Brother, where are you?

310
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:14,950
Taiping?

311
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,720
Isn't Taiping the name of this house?

312
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,270
I named this house Taiping

313
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:21,950
to commemorate

314
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:24,680
my friend who sacrificed his life because of me.

315
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,950
So he...

316
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,110
he is not the one you've been waiting for.

317
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:33,980
He's not.

318
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,110
Since he's the descendant of your friend,

319
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,510
why won't you let him in and accept him?

320
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:46,590
I said

321
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,030
I'll protect his descendants.

322
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,290
But I didn't say I'll interact with them.

323
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,470
Have you forgotten what I told you?

324
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,140
I will only wait for the person I should wait for in this life.

325
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:59,630
I won't interact with anyone else.

326
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,670
Well...

327
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,510
The meteor shower is over.

328
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:13,390
Why don't we... just wash up and go to bed for today?

329
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,590
Can you wait a minute?

330
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,110
Is this yours?

331
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,830
This is my childhood toy.

332
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,070
Why is it glowing?

333
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,470
It's not an ordinary marble.

334
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,270
It is actually a voice recording marble

335
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,870
I left for the viscount.

336
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,070
A... voice recording marble?

337
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,510
Yes.

338
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,710
He would take it with him every time he went somewhere.

339
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,830
The communication and transportation in ancient times were not well-developed.

340
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,830
Every separation

341
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,550
could be forever.

342
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:51,950
I was worried about his safety.

343
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,110
So I gave this to him.

344
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,840
If he were in danger,

345
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,590
he could leave me a message and clue with it.

346
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,930
You can consider it...

347
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,480
the black box on a plane.

348
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,950
It's quite advanced.

349
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,430
This is ancient technology.

350
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,030
The information stored in it

351
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,250
will not disappear even for tens of thousands of years.

352
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,310
Then... do you want to hear

353
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,680
if the viscount left you any message now?

354
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,750
Nothing?

355
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,200
There was something in it.

356
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,620
But it has been deleted by someone deliberately.

357
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,430
Deleted?

358
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:38,630
By whom?

359
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:39,920
I don't know.

360
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,000
This is all I could remember

361
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,030
when I see this marble.

362
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,710
But... why do you have it?

363
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,080
I don't remember at all.

364
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,710
If my grandma hadn't brought it to me this time,

365
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,970
I wouldn't have remembered this marble.

366
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,070
But she said

367
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,950
I liked it very much when I was little.

368
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:04,990
I knew it.

369
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:08,450
You're the one I've been waiting for.

370
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:23,150
Don't you think... it's too hasty?

371
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,230
Is it hasty?

372
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,270
First, it was the earring design draft.

373
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,830
Then it's this voice recording marble.

374
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,260
And you can recharge me.

375
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,670
It's a little late today.

376
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:38,880
Tomorrow, I'll ask Grandma

377
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,020
if there is other information

378
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,020
about this voice recording marble. What do you think?

379
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,230
Okay.

380
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,270
I'm sorry. I...

381
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,230
It's okay.

382
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:54,670
I think... I heard something.

383
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:59,750
Be careful.

384
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,030
Are you okay?

385
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,270
I'm fine.

386
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,270
My... house.

387
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:48,870
Brother.

388
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,190
I knew it. Nothing can stop us.

389
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:11,550
Why did it collapse like this?

390
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:20,310
I think it's because of the collision of the meteor shower's aftereffect.

391
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,430
I'll repair it.

392
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,870
Don't be sad.

393
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,870
How can I not be sad?

394
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,190
I bought this house

395
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,790
with a 30-year mortgage.

396
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,590
Brother, you shouldn't do this kind of rough work.

397
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,150
I'll do it.

398
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,100
Don't bother.

399
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,710
I can do it myself.

400
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:59,470
Brother, don't stand on ceremony.

401
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,950
Leave it

402
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,310
to me.

403
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,520
Don't worry.

404
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:08,710
A bug!

405
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,030
I'm the most afraid of bugs.

406
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,170
Help me.

407
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,350
Men...

408
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,060
Ding Yanhai, what are you...

409
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,830
Mom, why are you here?

410
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:30,830
Nan?

411
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,260
What are you doing here at this hour?

412
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,150
I...

413
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,070
He's here to renovate the house.

414
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,630
To renovate the house at this hour?

415
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:44,640
Yes. It's urgent.

416
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,500
It's really quite urgent.

417
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,870
People from a big city are indeed different.

418
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,620
They've only known each other for over a week.

419
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,750
Ms. Chen, it's... not what you think.

420
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,150
It's not what you think.

421
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,730
Don't worry. I know everything.

422
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,380
Ding Yanhai told me.

423
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,890
He let me see your Moments.

424
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,230
That's really...

425
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,850
Mom, it doesn't matter.

426
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:08,890
What matters is

427
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,750
why you all are here.

428
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,830
You made such a big fuss.

429
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,590
I was almost scared to death.

430
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,800
Of course I should come and take a look.

431
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,390
What... What happened?

432
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,550
It's... It's so dangerous.

433
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,010
Should we call the police?

434
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,630
Call... the police?

435
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,270
No need.

436
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,510
I'm an auxiliary officer.

437
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,900
I was here just now.

438
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,070
I saw it clearly.

439
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,990
There was...

440
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,750
a meteor shower.

441
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,270
And one of them...

442
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,630
hit here.

443
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,970
At the critical moment,

444
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,370
Nan Hua

445
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,940
protected me

446
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,770
and... Jin Xia bravely.

447
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,220
It was hit by a shooting star.

448
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,920
That's why it has become like this.

449
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,300
Are you hurt?

450
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,060
Mom, I'm fine.

451
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,790
All of us are okay. We are fine.

452
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,450
A shooting star?

453
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,550
Then... Then where is the shooting star?

454
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,350
That's right.

455
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,100
I've never seen

456
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,560
a shooting star fall on the ground in my life.

457
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,910
It was blown up by Nan Hua

458
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,510
into pieces.

459
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,970
How should I explain this?

460
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,310
The shooting star is...

461
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,440
There!

462
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,990
It's a shooting star?

463
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:27,830
Take a look.

464
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,830
Come on, have a look.

465
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,750
It's nothing special.

466
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,510
This is a shooting star?

467
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,830
You don't understand.

468
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,310
Shooting stars are meteorites.

469
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,430
They are no different from stones.

470
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,990
What matters is

471
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,790
it includes elements from outer space.

472
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,470
It contains infinite mysteries of the vast universe.

473
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,230
Enough.

474
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,990
You study outer space and aliens every day.

475
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,910
It's useless.

476
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:03,150
What Ding said makes sense.

477
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,470
Jin,

478
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:09,270
although the shooting star fell on your house,

479
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,710
it is

480
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,830
Wangqi Town's public property, right?

481
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:13,630
Yes.

482
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,740
As a government official,

483
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,350
I have the responsibility to collect it

484
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,910
on behalf of all the residents.

485
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,830
When scientists come in the future,

486
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,290
they will study it, right?

487
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,590
Are you okay with it?

488
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,670
Of course. No problem.

489
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,160
That's good.

490
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,020
Help yourself.

491
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,790
Let's go.

492
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,370
Let's go.

493
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,470
Goodbye.

494
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,510
Let's go.

495
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,270
Mom, what are you doing?

496
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,230
Come out.

497
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,990
Hurry. Enough.

498
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,110
Mom.

499
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,070
Mom.

500
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,930
My house has collapsed like this.

501
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,880
How am I supposed to sleep here?

502
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,920
Taiping hasn't been repaired for many years.

503
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:18,540
The walls couldn't stand the impact of the meteor's aftereffect.

504
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,940
That's why it collapsed.

505
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,000
Its foundation is stable.

506
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,240
There won't be any risk of continuing to collapse.

507
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,580
But... don't stay in your room for now.

508
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,270
Then... will it cost a lot to repair it?

509
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:37,670
I'm afraid it'll take some time to do the math.

510
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,430
Then I can only sleep in the living room today.

511
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,430
I have to go to work tomorrow.

512
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:50,720
Why don't we... sleep in the guest room together?

513
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,310
Together?

514
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,790
What is he talking about?

515
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:06,100
Indeed, men are all the same.

516
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,950
So... this is what you meant by "together".

517
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,430
What?

518
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,550
Nothing.

519
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,910
I mean...

520
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,630
the floor is too hard.

521
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,690
I'll sleep in the living room.

522
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,760
It's okay. I don't think it's hard.

523
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,360
After all, I slept in the coffin back then.

524
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,190
But if you think it's inappropriate,

525
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,690
I'll sleep in the living room.

526
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:42,710
No, no, no.

527
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,230
You paid the rent.

528
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:45,430
You're a tenant here.

529
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,910
I can't let you sleep in the living room.

530
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:52,670
Oh no.

531
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,370
I don't think I have clean pajamas.

532
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:58,430
Am I going to sleep in this?

533
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,150
If you don't mind,

534
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,510
you can wear mine.

535
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,580
That'll... do.

536
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,300
I'm done.

537
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,810
Then I'm coming in.

538
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,350
Does it fit?

539
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:28,790
Not... really.

540
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,190
It doesn't fit me at all.

541
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:38,710
Looks like it's... too big.

542
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,710
I can do it myself.

543
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:45,990
Let me do it.

544
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,630
Is Nan Hua asleep?

545
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,950
I wonder what they are doing.

546
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:27,400
Since Jin Xia's room collapsed,

547
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,370
would she sleep in Brother's room

548
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,930
and take advantage of him?

549
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:42,710
Your shirt smells so good.

550
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,550
Is it because of the sachet?

551
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,680
I've carried it for a long time.

552
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:52,530
It's not strange that my clothes have its smell.

553
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,430
What's the formula of this sachet?

554
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,750
It makes me...

555
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,670
feel very relieved.

556
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:09,110
The main ingredients are mint, borneol,

557
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,320
storax, and acorus gramineus.

558
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:16,270
It can refresh our minds and connect our internal organs with external organs.

559
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:20,150
The longer you smell it, the more energetic you'll be.

560
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,030
It doesn't affect me

561
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,110
because I'm used to it.

562
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,110
Why don't you wear another shirt?

563
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:23,909
I'm afraid...

564
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,489
you can't fall asleep.

565
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:43,640
Why is my mind filled with these images?

566
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,460
Why am I not sleepy at all?

567
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,790
I feel... hot.

568
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:25,900
I'm sleepy.

569
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,430
I'm sorry.

570
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,830
I can't have a long-term relationship with you.

571
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:10,590
At most...

572
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,780
At most, I can only practice it with you.

573
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,750
Why?

574
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,870
You dislike me?

575
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:19,870
No, I...

576
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,620
I haven't told you this.

577
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,850
Actually, I don't have much time left.

578
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:41,320
The rhizomes of the ancient cherry tree have deteriorated.

579
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,330
The tree will wither soon.

580
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,730
This is its last flowering phase.

581
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,110
When it ends,

582
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,670
my immortality...

583
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,910
will also disappear.

584
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,960
But luckily...

585
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,040
Luckily, you're back.

586
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,960
I've successfully waited for you to come back as promised.

587
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,250
I have no regrets.

588
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,720
Besides...

589
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:31,640
Don't worry.

590
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,070
Before I leave,

591
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,180
I will do my best

592
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,720
to fulfill all your wishes.

593
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,030
De...

594
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:53,950
Delicious.

595
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,660
Chicken drumsticks.

596
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:02,270
Delicious.

597
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,460
No.

598
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,220
There's only one flowering phase left.

599
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,970
I have to hurry.
