00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,190
In the several thousand years of human history,

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,070
there have been many unsolved mysteries.

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,350
Are the stories of Dayu controlling the flood and Nvwa mending the sky myths?

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,390
Why would the advancement of human civilization

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,780
surpass its current situations?

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,830
There are all kinds of speculations.

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,790
But in fact, the truth

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,790
dates back to the ancient times.

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,270
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,750
the highly developed

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,630
prehistoric civilizations once existed on Earth.

13
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,710
Back then, the ancient people

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,510
mastered the scientific civilization far more advanced than that in modern society.

15
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,190
Their high-level genetic modification technology

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,310
even enabled them to develop

17
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,000
human potential to the greatest extent.

18
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,830
They could absorb the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth

19
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,670
to stay alive and even exert extraordinary energy.

20
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,850
However, a tragic doomsday disaster

21
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,530
made those human beings almost extinct at that time.

22
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,650
Countless lives

23
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,310
and brilliant civilizations were destroyed overnight.

24
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,870
Only a small number of ancient people

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,490
survived the doomsday

26
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,870
after escaping to the underground in time

27
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,539
and entering into a frozen hibernation state.

28
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:14,450
After that,

29
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,039
through tens of thousands of years of self-repair,

30
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,140
our Earth conceived new intelligent lives again,

31
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,430
namely, the ancestors of modern people.

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,000
And the ancient people sleeping in the underground areas

33
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,530
woke up one after another

34
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,070
and returned to the land.

35
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,910
They saw

36
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,550
the new primitive humans who were still trying to make fire by drilling wood.

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,770
Out of good intentions,

38
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,910
they taught the younger generations

39
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,940
many technologies, such as farming, metallurgy,

40
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,150
construction, flood control, and precautions against natural disasters.

41
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,560
Many great civilization miracles

42
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,000
were the masterpieces made by

43
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,630
by our ancestors with the help of ancient people.

44
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,720
At that time, the new human beings

45
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,810
[Fuxi Temple]

46
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,710
considered the ancient people with extraordinary energy as deities.

47
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,670
They built temples for them and worshipped them.

48
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,050
As the official historians of various countries exaggerated the stories about them,

49
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,680
many legendary ancient myths have been passed down till now.

50
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,110
In this way,

51
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,350
most ancient people around the world

52
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,290
fitted into the new world with the identities

53
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,699
of deities.

54
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,740
But there were also some low-profile ancient people

55
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,080
who chose to live in seclusion in deep mountains to escape from the mortal world.

56
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,950
However,

57
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,120
people's worship towards the deities

58
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,420
also gradually generated fear and desires.

59
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,040
The rulers feared that the power of deities

60
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,730
would become a threat to their royal power.

61
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,380
But they were also greedy

62
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,579
for immortality and the extraordinary power.

63
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,630
Therefore,

64
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,640
they used various excuses

65
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,660
to start wars

66
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,620
against the deities from time to time.

67
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,750
The ancient people were outnumbered

68
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,880
and were no match for the huge armies in the end.

69
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,190
They almost became extinct.

70
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,300
Little did they know

71
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,440
that by imparting the knowledge of weapon forging to the new humans

72
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,320
they unwittingly unleashed a disaster upon themselves.

73
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,760
Although the ancient people who lived in deep mountains

74
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,350
survived this disaster,

75
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,510
they were hunted by the rulers continuously.

76
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,090
They were even slandered

77
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,910
and considered as horrible mountain spirits or ferocious ghosts.

78
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,020
In the blink of an eye,

79
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,400
those who had been regarded as deities became devils that everyone wanted to kill.

80
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,900
As everything keeps changing in the world,

81
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,310
no one knows the existence of the ancient people anymore.

82
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,180
Only those anecdotes and peculiar stories about ghosts and monsters

83
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,310
have been passed down from generation to generation.

84
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,340
And the tiny minority of ancient people who have survived

85
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,660
are still secretly hiding

86
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,570
in those covert corners in the world till now.

87
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,280
Without you,

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,950
the cherry tree

89
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,910
is not as lively as before.

90
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,770
Excuse me. Are you Lord Li Chuchen?

91
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,210
Chuchen?

92
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,020
That's the name of the person I'm waiting for.

93
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,340
How did you know this name?

94
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,180
Do you recognize this thing?

95
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:56,730
These are...

96
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,950
the viscount's meteor-like gemstone earrings.

97
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,910
Immortal, please help me.

98
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,080
Chuchen's live stream.

99
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,420
Chuchen?

100
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:43,980
What's wrong with you?

101
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,220
I have a headache.

102
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,280
Have you thought of anything?

103
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,590
No.

104
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:57,620
Maiden Jiang, you work here

105
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,990
and you're an anchor?

106
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,500
Sort of.

107
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,200
Sort of?

108
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,420
I used to be an anchor for a late-night program about romantic relationships.

109
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,190
But since last year,

110
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,790
I've started to change my career to sell products through live streaming,

111
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,560
and my work in the radio station has become a side job.

112
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,560
If you have any problems about romantic relationships,

113
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,670
you can consult me.

114
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,750
Okay.

115
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,390
Come on.

116
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,350
Go inside at once.

117
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,130
You're going to be late.

118
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,180
Bye.

119
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,670
Bye.

120
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,200
Maiden Jin.

121
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,990
Wait.

122
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,040
I wanted to say it before.

123
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,590
Why don't you stop calling me Maiden?

124
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,070
It sounds weird.

125
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,950
Just call me Jin Xia.

126
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,030
Okay. Jin Xia.

127
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,960
What do you want to say?

128
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,790
I want to say that

129
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,500
it's rare for me to come out,

130
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,330
so can you come with me

131
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,870
to get some cat food?

132
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,490
Cat food?

133
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,060
So this is the cat food you mentioned?

134
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,040
Yes. It's both environmentally friendly and healthy.

135
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,320
Fishing is so boring.

136
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,310
Really?

137
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,710
It's a hobby for the elderly.

138
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,160
If you think it's boring,

139
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,300
why don't we play a game?

140
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,750
What game is it?

141
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,590
Let's take turns to ask each other questions

142
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,150
so as to learn more about each other.

143
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,470
After all, we'll be roommates from now on.

144
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,060
This is good.

145
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,670
You ask me first.

146
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:36,950
I'll ask you first.

147
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,909
How long have you lived in this ancient house?

148
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,070
I don't remember.

149
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:44,600
In general,

150
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,110
I've lived here for several thousand years.

151
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,560
Alright.

152
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,590
This time span

153
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,500
is beyond the range of my empathy.

154
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,550
But what have you done

155
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,470
during such a long time?

156
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,480
Didn't you feel bored?

157
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,430
It was hard to perceive time in the mountains.

158
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,870
I got used to it as time went by.

159
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,670
In the past one hundred years,

160
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,390
my spiritual energy has become more and more insufficient.

161
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,790
I slept frequently,

162
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,750
so the time passed even faster.

163
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,710
What's this concept of insufficient spiritual energy?

164
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,550
Unlike modern people,

165
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,800
I need to use the ancient cherry tree in the garden

166
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,270
to absorb the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth

167
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,510
so that I can maintain my life.

168
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,110
It sounds like immortal cultivation

169
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,270
and something like absorbing the essence of Heaven and Earth.

170
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,750
Their basic principles are similar.

171
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,830
After all, based on

172
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,750
ancient people like us, the legends of deities

173
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,870
were fabricated.

174
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,350
Alright. Go ahead.

175
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,470
For the past one thousand years,

176
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,710
the ancient cherry tree has been withering.

177
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,390
The spiritual energy absorbed by me has been decreasing, too.

178
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,070
Sometimes,

179
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,310
it can't even support my daily activities.

180
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,710
In recent years, I've lost most of my extraordinary energy, too.

181
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,260
I've even started to lose my memories.

182
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,510
Speaking of which,

183
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,070
when I moved into this house,

184
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,000
the cherry tree in the yard

185
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,510
looked as if it would wither soon.

186
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,030
Thanks to you,

187
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:15,630
I could see it sprouting and blooming again.

188
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,830
My ability and memories are also recovering.

189
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:22,310
Then why can I help you get charged with energy?

190
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,510
I don't know, either.

191
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,270
Maybe I'll be clear about it when I regain more memories.

192
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:32,950
Alright.

193
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:35,110
I still have a big question.

194
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:36,390
Go ahead.

195
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:39,230
Since it's so hard to collect and store spiritual energy,

196
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:41,580
why did you have to

197
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,549
help Ms. Chen renovate her house

198
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:45,550
and renovate that welfare park?

199
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,590
Speaking of which,

200
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,590
I want to apologize to you.

201
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:03,760
I'm sorry.

202
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,820
I interfered in your decoration plan,

203
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,210
and it was all due to my selfish motives.

204
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,080
Why are you suddenly talking about this?

205
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,840
I'm worried that after a long time, and with the change of the seasons,

206
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,990
the person I'm waiting for might not be able to recognize his home.

207
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,140
I thought

208
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,970
if I could keep this place as it used to,

209
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,380
maybe he could find his way back home.

210
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,700
So the design draft you showed me before

211
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,220
was Taiping's look in the ancient times?

212
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,020
Yes.

213
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,260
I renovated Wenying's house

214
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,430
and the welfare park

215
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,090
because of this reason.

216
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:47,770
I'm sorry.

217
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,340
Please forgive my selfishness and reckless actions.

218
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,200
Alright.

219
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,630
Since you're so pitiful,

220
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,550
I'll accept your apology.

221
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,670
Thank you.

222
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,030
However,

223
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,620
normal people can't live more than 100 years,

224
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,410
and you've said there are no ghosts in the world.

225
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,340
Can the person you're waiting for come back?

226
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,390
Is he also an ancient man?

227
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,640
I vaguely remember that he's not an ancient man,

228
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,790
but an ordinary person like you.

229
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,550
And I remember that

230
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,610
he came back several times fitfully.

231
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,560
He came back before?

232
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,060
And then he left?

233
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,790
It was such a long time ago. I don't know, either.

234
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,510
But most recently,

235
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,070
he came back about 70 or 80 years ago.

236
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,120
He asked me to continue to wait for him here.

237
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,470
You said that he had come back before.

238
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,660
But he's not an ancient man.

239
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,400
What kind of monster are you waiting for?

240
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,870
Monster?

241
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,500
You don't look like a monster to me.

242
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:53,790
Have you forgotten this?

243
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,250
You might be the person I've been waiting for.

244
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,830
It was 70 or 80 years ago.

245
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,440
Not to mention me,

246
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,830
even my grandma wasn't born yet.

247
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,710
Besides, if I came back before,

248
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,520
how could I not remember?

249
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,080
Even so,

250
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,310
but...

251
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,710
It's hard to imagine

252
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:23,110
how it feels to wait for a person for up to a thousand years.

253
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,670
Is that person too nice

254
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,770
or are you too nice,

255
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,710
which has made the promise between you two so firm?

256
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,270
He was chosen firmly

257
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,090
and you've waited for him without hesitation.

258
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:39,910
That's so nice.

259
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,200
The fish took the bait.

260
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,350
What should I do?

261
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,880
Calm down and withdraw the lines.

262
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,440
I should withdraw the lines? How?

263
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,540
Is it the way of withdrawing lines?

264
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:05,960
Yes.

265
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,260
Don't be afraid. Use more strength.

266
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,130
Alright. Hold it.

267
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,990
It's such a big fish.

268
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,350
That's great.

269
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,950
Good.

270
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,050
It looks like you have a gift for fishing.

271
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,130
I grew up by the sea,

272
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,530
but I've never fished by the sea.

273
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,360
However, it's quite interesting.

274
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,660
You grew up by the sea?

275
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,510
Yes.

276
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,460
I grew up in a fishing village with my grandma.

277
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:56,620
It was also a beach town.

278
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,640
However, after I started to go to school and work,

279
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,600
I went to the city.

280
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,690
Then why did you buy a house here?

281
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,220
As the house price was too high,

282
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,470
so you chose Wangqi Town?

283
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,270
That was one of the reasons.

284
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,930
But it was not entirely because of that.

285
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,540
The main reason was that...

286
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,040
It's a shop for selling houses.

287
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,850
Stop looking. We can't afford a house.

288
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,400

00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,140
having babies now?

372
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,599
It's not too early.

373
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,849
You'll have difficulties having babies if you don't do it soon.

374
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,510
Ms. Li has told me that

375
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,950
both your parents are gone.

376
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,220
That's fine.

377
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,480
In the future, my son will only need to take care of you.

378
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,450
No, Ma'am.

379
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,070
What do you mean by saying that "it's fine"?

380
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,550
Mom.

381
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,520
I'm sorry.

382
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,880
I'm late, Miss Jin.

383
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,230
How come it's him?

384
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:49,940
It's all my fault.

385
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,090
I just wanted to say yes to Ms. Li perfunctorily.

386
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,090
But I didn't see the information she sent me.

387
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,880
I was so careless.

388
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,830
You finally figured it out?

389
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,230
Didn't I tell you this when we broke up

390
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,420
with each other a year ago?

391
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,050
She and I just had fun together when the occasion arose.

392
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,640
As a man, I had no choice.

393
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,980
I don't want to talk about this today.

394
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,190
How have you been?

395
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,930
Are you still working as an assistant

396
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:18,670
to Xi Manling?

397
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,710
Yes. So what?

398
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,870
It's not that easy to be a designer.

399
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,560
This is a society where connections are essential.

400
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:32,090
Yes, you were very talented in school.

401
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,960
But it's useless if you only have talent.

402
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,170
It's also necessary to have connections.

403
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,970
Otherwise, your efforts will be in vain.

404
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,730
I've never thought about becoming a big shot.

405
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,180
I think my current situation is good.

406
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,430
Alright. Let's not talk about dreams.

407
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,220
Let's talk about the reality.

408
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,400
How much is your monthly salary?

409
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,640
Can you afford a house in the urban area?

410
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,790
No, can you afford the down payment?

411
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,770
Why do I have to buy a house?

412
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,260
I think it's also good to rent a house.

413
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,230
Renting a house?

414
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,800
If you rent a house, can you call it your home?

415
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,540
Well...

416
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,670
Why do you have to put on airs in front of me?

417
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,990
Does your grandma still do part-time jobs so as to

418
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,510
save enough money for your down payment like before?

419
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,440
I'm not blaming you,

420
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,800
but an old lady like her

421
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,880
took pains to bring you up by herself.

422
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,570
Can you stop worrying her?

423
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:35,020
I'll buy a house.

424
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,180
I'm saving money now.

425
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:38,690
Saving money?

426
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,790
Don't blame me for being harsh.

427
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,440
When you have the money to buy a house in the urban area,

428
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,220
she'll pass away by then.

429
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,470
Our family is known for longevity.

430
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,620
It's none of your business.

431
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,670
I advise you to shut up

432
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,780
so that you can accumulate some good luck for the elderly of your family.

433
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,210
Alright. You just don't understand my kindness.

434
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,370
Today,

435
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,800
for the sake of our past friendship,

436
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,530
I wanted to give you some advice.

437
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,810
Otherwise, with your current state,

438
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,540
I wouldn't have wanted to see you.

439
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,400
Previously, I thought there was something wrong with you.

440
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,710
But I didn't expect that you had given up the treatment.

441
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,820
Fine. I won't go on talking to a fool like you.

442
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,560
I have to go. Bye.

443
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,630
What? She left just like that?

444
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,060
Mom, she doesn't like me.

445
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:28,670
She doesn't like you?

446
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,630
I don't even like her.

447
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:32,850
I see.

448
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,770
Is she a fraud related to this restaurant?

449
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,950

Hello, Ms. Li.

461
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,430
Jin, what was wrong with you?

462
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,830
Even though you didn't like him,

463
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,680
you shouldn't have made them pay for such an expensive meal.

Ms. Li, there is something wrong with that man.

You little girl...

468
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,750
Forget it. I won't provoke you.

469
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,990
I was kind enough to arrange a blind date for you.

470

Isn't it 3,000 yuan?

476
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,950
From this month onward, the rent will be higher.

477
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,810
Why?

478
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,910
Go ask around.

479
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,220
The rents of all the surrounding houses have been increased.

480
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,750

520
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,960
For a career like mine, there are few opportunities in my hometown.

521
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,790
So I can only stay here.

522
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,790
I thought it would be the same if I brought

00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,710
they are still healthy.

00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,350
If I have a child in the future,

552
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,020
I won't abandon him.

553
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,420
What am I saying?

554
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,140
I've decided to remain single all my life.

555
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,540
I don't think I'll have a child.

556
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,010
You won't remain single all your life.

557
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,630
You are so nice.

558
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,030
I'm sure someone will cherish you.

559
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,010
I'm so happy.

560
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,990
The kitten is lucky enough to eat the delicious food today.

561
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,560
What a great harvest.

562
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,310
It's this house. She didn't pay a penny.

563
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,330
Just see how I'll teach her a lesson.

564
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,430
Who are they?

565
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,470
The sorceress?

566
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,290
I'll go handle this thing.

567
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:32,710
Wait.

568
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,330
You drived them away yesterday.

569
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,070
It's not good. I'll go.

570
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,700
But there are many people there.

571
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,340
I think it'll be fine.

572
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,660
It's a legal society and it's in broad daylight.

573
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,770
Besides, the police station is next to the house.

574
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,930
At worst, I can call the police.

575
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,550
Be careful then.

576
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,990
Who are you?

577
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,070
Why are you in front of my house?

578
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,060
It's her. She's here.

579
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,520
Are you Jin Xia?

580
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,020
Yes, I am. What's the matter?

581
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,380
What's the matter?

582
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,710
My mom went to your house to do a ritual of exorcism yesterday.

583
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:20,870
You haven't

584
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,590
paid the money yet, have you?

585
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,270
Money?

586
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,380
She ran away in the middle of the ritual

587
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
as she felt so scared.

588
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,910
Besides, there are no ghosts in my house.

589
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,220
She's just a fraud.

590
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,510
Don't talk nonsense if you have no evidence.

591
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,270
My mom went to your house to do a ritual of exorcism,

592
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,390
and she even got injured after falling to the ground.

593
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,590
Let me tell you.

594
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,250
The exorcism fees and medical expenses

595
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:42,690
cost 20,000 yuan.

596
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,740
20,000 yuan? Are you crazy?

597
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,100
She's fine now, isn't she?

598
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,060
It's Jin Ha.

599
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,890
Which part of your body was injured?

600
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,250
-They're arguing with each other? -You're blackmailing me by doing this.

601
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,150
What are you doing?

602
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,920
I'm calling the police so that the police can judge it.

603
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,380
Miss, I'm a reasonable man.

604
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:01,570
What do you want to do?

605
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,710
Why don't we go to your house to sit for a while and have some tea?

606
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,700
Let's talk to each other.

607
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,100
Compensate me for my mother's medical expenses.

608
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:06,800
Then I'll

609
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,390
compensate you for your mobile phone.

610
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,140
Oh no.

611
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,880
Son!

612
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,890
-Big Bro!
-Big Bro!

613
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,450
What's going on?

614
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,680
Relax.

615
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,640
You've been possessed by me.

616
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,130
Now your body is controlled by me.

617
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,380
Is this

618
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,980
the legendary situation of

619
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,010
being possessed by a ghost?

620
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,140
What are you two waiting for?

621
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:39,940
Go beat her!

622
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,960
Stop hitting us.

623
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,180
Son!

624
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:10,140
Stop hitting them.

625
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,870
Heroine, please spare our lives.

626
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,350
Don't make profits or cause trouble with the excuse of exorcism again.

627
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,050
Otherwise, I won't let you off easily.

628
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,800
Get lost!

629
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:26,940
I'm sorry.

630
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,560
I've promised you not to use my extraordinary energy.

631
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,600
But it happened so suddenly, so I...

632
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,860
What was that?

633
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,700
I mean, I did this...

634
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,900
And then...

635
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,670
In the end, they ran away.

636
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,330
This is so cool.

637
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,230
Is this how it feels to be possessed by a ghost?

638
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,760
What is she doing alone?

639
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,310
There are no ghosts in this world.

640
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,710
I could control your body

641
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,920
because my IQ

642
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,230
is much higher than yours.

643
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,350
Plus the reason of my extraordinary energy,

644
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,760
I could infiltrate into your brain

645
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,540
and control your consciousness.

646
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,350
There are scientific theories which can explain this situation.

647
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,050
Why do your scientific theories

648
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,840
sound so annoying?

649
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,210
My mobile phone!

650
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,270
My goodness.

651
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:26,950
This poor family is getting much poorer.

652
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:31,310
How come my mobile phone is like this now?

653
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,650
What's going on?

654
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,450
Do you think it can be repaired?

655
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,680
The door opened automatically?

656
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,990
It's impossible that there's nothing there.

657
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,660
Can't you see him?

658
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:48,160
He's just over there.

659
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,490
Mom, who is this crazy woman?

660
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,390
Her martial arts skills are so good.

661
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,890
Is she a policewomen?

662
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,800
Did we come across a real one this afternoon?

663
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:16,830
What real one?

664
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,200
A real ghost!

665
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,620
Son.

666
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,660
I thought they were playing tricks

667
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,940
and made trouble in our place.

668
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,480
That's why I asked you to come here

669
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,710
to teach them a lesson.

670
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,540
But I saw that woman

671
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,000
hit the three of you just now.

672
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,540
Could it be that...

673
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,660
Stop talking nonsense.

674
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,340
There are no real ghosts in this world.

675
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,990
No, son.

676
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,200
I'd rather believe it than disbelieve it.

677
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,270
Big Bro!

678
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,360
You scared me.

679
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,150
Who is it?

680
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:59,490
Don't come over.

681
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,380
Don't come over!

682
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:05,380
I'm a policeman.

683
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,430
[Ding Yanhai]

684
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,490
I want to ask you about something.

685
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,470
A policeman.

686
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,180
[Ding Yanhai]

687
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,340
I'm going to take a shower.

688
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,560
How did you get in?

689
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,630
Nan Hua, where are you?

690
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,210
I'm in the living room. What's wrong?

691
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,070
Nothing.

692
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,580
Nan Hua, are you still in the living room?

693
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,320
Yes.

694
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,400
I'm going to cook dinner.

695
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,350
What's wrong?

696
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,310
I...

697
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,790
Can you talk to me?

698
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,390
Just talk to me before I finish taking a shower.

699
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,150
Sure.

700
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:24,160
But why do you want to talk with me while taking a shower?

701
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,940
I just feel a little bored,

702
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,350
so I want you to talk to me.

703
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:34,700
Is she worried that...

704
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,510
How about I sing for you?

705
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,630
You'll sing?

706
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,350
Is it convenient?

707
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:44,680
Yes.

708
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:50,990
♫My bride♫

709
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:56,670
♫Please don't cry♫

710
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,300
Have I gone too far?

711
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,949
Actually, he doesn't

712
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:16,949
want to do anything to me.

713
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,710
He sings very well.

714
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,219
Since I met Nan Hua,

715
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,380
and after what happened during these several days,

716
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,429
my life has been like a movie.

717
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,380
A movie?

718
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:55,710
It's a movie about Nan Hua and me.

719
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,070
What? Is it too hot?

720
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,510
I have a toothache.

721
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,160
It's the wisdom teeth.

722
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,060
What is a wisdom tooth?

723
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,260
A wisdom tooth is the third molar of a human being.

724
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,590
It's also the last tooth of a human being.

725
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:16,560
How long has the pain lasted for?

726
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,840
It has lasted for several days.

727
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,880
Then why did you still eat nuts?

728
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,480
Open your mouth and let me see.
