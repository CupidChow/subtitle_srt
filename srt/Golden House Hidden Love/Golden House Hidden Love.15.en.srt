2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,140
In the several thousand years of human history,

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,020
there have been many unsolved mysteries.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,930
Are the stories of Dayu controlling the flood and Nvwa mending the sky myths?

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,540
Why would the advancement of human civilization

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,740
surpass its current situations?

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,780
There are all kinds of speculations.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,730
But in fact, the truth

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,740
dates back to the ancient times.

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,380
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,700
the highly developed

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,340
prehistoric civilizations once existed on Earth.

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,660
Back then, the ancient people

14
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,060
mastered the scientific civilization far more advanced than that in modern society.

15
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,140
Their high-level genetic modification technology

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,260
even enabled them to develop

17
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,370
human potential to the greatest extent.

18
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,930
They could absorb the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth

19
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,790
to stay alive and even exert extraordinary energy.

20
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,700
However, a tragic doomsday disaster

21
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,370
made those human beings almost extinct at that time.

22
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:01,690
Countless lives

23
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,890
and brilliant civilizations were destroyed overnight.

24
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:06,940
Only a small number of ancient people

25
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,530
survived the doomsday

26
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,300
after escaping to the underground in time

27
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,770
and entering into a frozen hibernation state.

28
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,430
After that,

29
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,170
through tens of thousands of years of self-repair,

30
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,460
our Earth conceived new intelligent lives again,

31
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,720
namely, the ancestors of modern people.

32
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,060
And the ancient people sleeping in the underground areas

33
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,460
woke up one after another

34
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,140
and returned to the land.

35
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:28,850
They saw

36
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,810
the new primitive humans who were still trying to make fire by drilling wood.

37
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,890
Out of good intentions,

38
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,009
they taught the younger generations

39
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:37,009
many technologies, such as farming, metallurgy,

40
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,770
construction, flood control, and precautions against natural disasters.

41
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,700
Many great civilization miracles

42
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,100
were the masterpieces made

43
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,830
by our ancestors with the help of ancient people.

44
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,740
At that time, the new human beings

45
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,789
[Fuxi Temple]

46
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,940
considered the ancient people with extraordinary energy as deities.

47
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,670
They built temples for them and worshipped them.

48
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,180
As the official historians of various countries exaggerated the stories about them,

49
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,700
many legendary ancient myths have been passed down till now.

50
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,210
In this way,

51
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,410
most ancient people around the world

52
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,340
fitted into the new world with the identities

53
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,490
of deities.

54
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,820
But there were also some low-profile ancient people

55
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,280
who chose to live in seclusion in deep mountains to escape from the mortal world.

56
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,050
However,

57
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,300
people's worship towards the deities

58
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,380
also gradually generated fear and desires.

59
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,170
The rulers feared that the power of deities

60
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,810
would become a threat to their royal power.

61
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,370
But they were also greedy

62
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,100
for immortality and the extraordinary power.

63
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,760
Therefore,

64
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,690
they used various excuses

65
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,700
to start wars

66
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,829
against the deities from time to time.

67
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,810
The ancient people were outnumbered

68
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,300
and were no match for the huge armies in the end.

69
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,900
They almost became extinct.

70
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,570
Little did they know

71
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,940
that by imparting the knowledge of weapon forging to the new humans

72
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,140
they unwittingly unleashed a disaster upon themselves.

73
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,810
Although the ancient people who lived in deep mountains

74
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,380
survived this disaster,

75
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,900
they were hunted by the rulers continuously.

76
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,220
They were even slandered

77
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,490
and considered as horrible mountain spirits or ferocious ghosts.

78
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,860
In the blink of an eye,

79
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,730
those who had been regarded as deities became devils that everyone wanted to kill.

80
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,210
As everything keeps changing in the world,

81
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,900
no one knows the existence of the ancient people anymore.

82
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,250
Only those anecdotes and peculiar stories about ghosts and monsters

83
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,329
have been passed down from generation to generation.

84
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:20,060
And the tiny minority of ancient people who have survived

85
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,730
are still secretly hiding

86
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,610
in those covert corners in the world till now.

Thank you, Ms. Xi.

191
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,530
How is it going?

192
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,900
You stayed up all night.

193
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,220
You've almost finished designing the attire for the show, right?

194
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,080
No.

195
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:09,210
These days, I've been making up for my unfinished work before.

196
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,940
I haven't even started to design the attire for the show.

197
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,980
I just have some random... ideas.

198
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,420
They are not very mature.

199
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,010
It's okay. Take your time.

200
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,870
It takes time to get inspiration.

201
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,230
I'm wondering...

202
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,850
if all your recent design inspiration

203
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,310
came from your boyfriend.

204
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,590
He's not my boyfriend.

205
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,680
Did you have a quarrel?

206
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,970
Not... really.

207
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,540
Well,

208
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,890
I'm very interested in your boyfriend.

209
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,770
She almost spilt coffee on you

210
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,580
in the company yesterday.

211
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,450
I really think it was a bit weird.

212
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,840
So I checked the surveillance video.

213
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,410
Guess what I saw.

214
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,340
At the very moment the coffee spilt on you,

215
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,290
your boyfriend disappeared.

216
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,330
Ms. Xi, how's that possible?

217
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,690
And you avoided the coffee flexibly.

218
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,620
Then he appeared at the same place.

219
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,340
There must be something wrong with the surveillance video.

220
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,010
Yeah.

221
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,340
I also think it's too unscientific.

222
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,690
Maybe I should

223
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,860
give the surveillance video to the technical department

224
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,260
to analyze it carefully.

225
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,460
If so,

226
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,340
more and more people will know this.

227
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,780
Fine.

228
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,150
It's okay to tell Ms. Xi, right?

229
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,730
After all, Ms. Xi is probably

230
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,060
the most qualified person to know Nan Hua.

231
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,740
Ms. Xi, since you've noticed it,

232
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,020
I'm not gonna hide it from you anymore.

233
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,980
Indeed, Nan Hua... is very special.

234
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,940
He is...

235
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,970
He's a good man.

236
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,650
He is the most trustworthy and responsible person

237
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:52,210
I've ever seen.

238
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,340
You know what?

239
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,970
He made a promise

240
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,060
of waiting for someone in a house.

241
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,580
He has been waiting for that person for over 2,000 years.

242
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,140
Over 2,000 years?

243
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,590
I know it sounds like a peculiar story.

244
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,980
Ms. Xi, maybe you can't believe this

245
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,010
in a short time.

246
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,010
Who exactly has he been waiting for?

247
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,260
Does that person have lived for over 2,000 years too?

248
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,490
I don't know either.

249
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,500
Because Nan Hua has lost his memories.

250
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,570
He doesn't know

251
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,380
what exactly he's been waiting for.

252
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,010
But he just keeps waiting.

253
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,500
He's such a fool.

254
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,260
Also,

255
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:29,340
why did he

256
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,690
react strangely

257
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,570
when he saw my design drafts yesterday?

258
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:33,900
Has he seen them before?

259
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,330
Those accessories...

260
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:40,630
seem to have something to do... with the person he's been waiting for.

261
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,170
Are you saying the accessories I designed

262
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,830
are related to the person he's been waiting for?

263
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,140
I don't know the details.

264
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,970
Ms. Xi, if you want to know more,

265
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,710
why don't you ask Nan Hua yourself?

266
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:58,970
I see.

267
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,130
10 million yuan.

268
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,660
The estimated price of the earrings is 10 million yuan.

269
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,990
Shouldn't you be happy?

270
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,380
It's good.

271
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,010
If I sell them successfully,

272
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,420
I can help Jin Xia pay off the mortgage in a single installment

273
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:27,250
and renovate the house.

274
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,740
Then why are you still... unhappy?

275
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,610
Nothing.

276
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,220
Did you... quarrel with Jin Xia?

277
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,420
No.

278
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,020
It's just that...

279
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,060
there seems to be something wrong with me.

280
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,500
What's wrong?

281
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,500
I think... I found the person I've been waiting for

282
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,860
a few days ago.

283
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,380
Really?

284
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,530
Then you should be happy.

285
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,650
But I'm not only unhappy,

286
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,420
but also worried.

287
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,750
I'm worried that she's the one I've been waiting for.

288
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,740
Why?

289
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:27,760
I don't know.

290
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,940
I can't think straight.

291
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,870
It's like this is the first time I hope...

292
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,990
the person I've been waiting for won't come back.

293
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:46,860
You're worried... Jin Xia will be sad

294
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,140
or you think it's a pity that the one you've been waiting for

295
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,670
is actually not her, right?

296
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,300
My guess is right?

297
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,580
I don't know what's wrong.

298
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,280
Brother, did you make an appointment with someone?

299
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:20,470
The person Nan Hua has been waiting for

300
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,849
is actually Jin Xia's teacher?

301
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,740
Actually, when I first saw Mr. Nan,

302
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,650
I had a special feeling.

303
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,720
I felt familiar.

304
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,370
Senior Bai Bing,

305
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,910
I still don't know how to make the color

306
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,650
Ms. Xi asked me to make last time.

307
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:46,940
I want to seek advice from her again.

308
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,600
Is she here?

309
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,440
She has something to do today. She didn't come here.

310
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,450
She was here this morning.

311
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,060
This morning?

312
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:56,530
Impossible.

313
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,450
I've seen her schedule.

314
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,760
I think...

315
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,750
the mother from her previous host family came today.

316
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,370
She... did come this morning.

317
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,410
Really?

318
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,500
Maybe she left something in the company,

319
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,390
so she came back to get it.

320
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,120
She's definitely not here now.

321
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:14,250
Okay.

322
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,980
I can only talk to her tomorrow.

323
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,490
All right.

324
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,260
It's late.

325
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:20,620
We can get off work

326
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,400
after putting these things in order.

327
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:22,960
Okay.

328
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,010
Jin Xia,

329
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,100
are you still going to work overtime today?

330
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,760
You didn't go back yesterday.

331
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:42,940
Senior,

332
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,650
I haven't done pattern making

333
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,020
for a set of wedding attire.

334
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,750
I want to work overtime tonight

335
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:48,980
to finish it in one go.

336
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,580
Okay. Take care of yourself.

337
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,370
Keep it up.

338
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,570
We're leaving.

339
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:52,970
Okay.

340
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:53,500
Bye.

341
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,260
Senior, bye.

342
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,290
-Bye.
-Bye.

343
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,080
Don't eat food that has been left overnight.

344
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,420
Why are you here?

345
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
Actually, I came here this afternoon.

346
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,770
I just stayed invisible,

347
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,900
and you didn't know.

348
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,450
You used your extraordinary energy outside.

349
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,050
What if someone saw you?

350
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:50,910
Don't worry.

351
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,180
I've confirmed it.

352
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,510
Everyone has got off work.

353
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,320
There are only the two of us here.

354
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:57,930
Besides...

355
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,070
I'm only visible to you now.

356
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,230
No one can see me except you.

357
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,530
What... brings you here?

358
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,610
I have something to tell you.

359
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,130
What is it?

360
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,130
It's not convenient here.

361
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,660
Let's talk somewhere else.

362
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:34,940
No.

363
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,150
I have to work overtime.

364
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,140
Let's talk

365
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:41,780
another day.

366
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,310
But...

367
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,330
Just stop.

368
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,620
I'm busy.

369
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,040
Go back.

370
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,550
Are you really not coming with me?

371
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:58,770
Fine.

372
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,410
I'm sorry.

373
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,550
What are you doing?

374
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,460
Stop!

375
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,620
Stop! What are you doing?

376
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,580
Get out of my body. Nan Hua.

377
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,850
Nan Hua, what are you doing?

378
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,340
Listen.

379
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,580
You're kidnapping me.

380
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,580
You won't come with me.

381
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,770
I have to do this.

382
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,450
Do you have to say it now?

383
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,670
It's very important.

384
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,530
Then... Then say it in the car.

385
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,610
No.

386
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:25,780
Why not?

387
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,300
Because the atmosphere here is not right.

388
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,180
All right.

389
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,090
Just let me stay in your body and don't move.

390
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,150
I'm going to drive.

391
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,850
What... What are you talking about?

392
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,190
What do you mean?

393
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,290
I want to get off.

394
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,050
Sit tight.

395
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,490
Nan Hua,

396
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,020
where are you taking me?

397
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,380
You'll know when we get there.

398
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,700
Can't you tell me now?

399
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,010
Sit tight. We're almost there.

400
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,020
We're here.

401
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,900
What exactly are you going to do?

402
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,400
Why did you bring me here?

403
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,430
What are you doing?

404
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,060
Trust me.

405
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:40,750
Where are we going?

406
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,220
Just come with me.

407
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:24,860
Sit.

408
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,250
Do you feel comfortable?

409
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,970
The tide is changing now.

410
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,700
The sea is at its softest.

411
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,690
Look, the moon is out.

412
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,900
Do you remember the relationship

413
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,880
between the moon and Earth I told you before?

414
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:32,970
No.

415
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,260
Then I'm gonna say it again.

416
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,250
The relationship between Earth and the moon

417
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,650
is like two people who have made a contract.

418
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,200
Once a promise is made,

419
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,690
they will always be bound to each other.

420
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,330
So?

421
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,730
So... are you willing to make

422
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,140
a contract with me like the moon and Earth?

423
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,170
But...

424
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,060
you have found the person

425
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,290
you've been waiting for, right?

426
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,060
The old Nan Hua

427
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,860
has been waiting for the viscount to come back.

428
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,510
He has waited a few lifetimes.

429
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,490
He has waited so long

430
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,950
that he doesn't even know why he should wait.

431
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,140
During the days when he forgot everything,

432
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,370
he met another person

433
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,020
whom he promised to take care of for a lifetime.

434
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,750
This person is very different.

435
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,660
She said if she's lucky enough

436
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,070
to be the viscount he's been waiting for,

437
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,650
maybe she'll tell him...

438
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,530
If I am lucky enough

439
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:04,930
to be the viscount you've been waiting for,

440
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,490
maybe I'll tell you

441
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,420
-not to wait anymore.
-not to wait anymore.

442
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,090
Guess why?

443
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:16,700
Because...

444
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,710
I don't want you to live in the past

445
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,590
or in a world that only has me in it.

446
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,460
Instead of living for me,

447
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:31,420
I'd rather you live for yourself.

448
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,410
Moon, you are free.

449
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,650
I've never heard

450
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,190
such beautiful and gentle words.

451
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,950
In the past few thousand years I've been waiting,

452
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:07,100
everyone asked me to wait in the ancient house.

453
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,170
I thought that was a bond.

454
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,100
I think I understand now.

455
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,610
It seems it was because

456
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,130
I was useful to them.

457
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:23,820
Nan Hua.

458
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,870
I will not break my promise.

459
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:33,580
My promise of waiting for the viscount still counts.

460
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:40,940
But I don't think I can wait for him to come back.

461
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:45,010
The dead can't come back to life.

462
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,670
Actually, the viscount has never come back.

463
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,420
Those who came back were liars.

464
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,770
Thank you.

465
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:00,810
For what?

466
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:02,810
I didn't do anything.

467
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,310
No matter who you are

468
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,260
and whether you are the person I've been waiting for,

469
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,460
I don't care anymore.

470
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,050
To me,

471
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,610
the only important thing now

472
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,380
is to fulfill my promise to you.

473
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:27,820
In the future,

474
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,340
I will accompany you to work,

475
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,300
pursue dreams together,

476
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,310
and experience every important first together.

477
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,060
When you're in a predicament,

478
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,550
I'll come forward and face it with you.

479
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,220
Even if we'll be mocked.

480
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,180
I will also take care of your health

481
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,970
and be by your side all the time.

482
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,180
If you pass out while you are taking a shower,

483
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,500
I'll carry you out of the shower room immediately.

484
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,500
What?

485
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,090
I'm not as weak as you,

486
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,350
who could pass out while taking a shower.

487
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,190
Anyway, you can't run away now.

488
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,250
Because you've been haunted by a ghost.

489
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,740
A very clingy ghost.

490
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,460
You can't drive him away no matter how hard you try.

491
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,460
Really?

492
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,010
I like being haunted by a ghost.

493
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,180
So... Jin Xia,

494
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,540
are you ready...

495
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,580
to mate with me officially?

496
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,380
M-Mate?

497
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,660
Here?

498
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,420
D-Date.

499
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,420
I'm sorry.

500
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,900
I've never used this word before. I...

501
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,130
Gosh.

502
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,300
Not bad, Nan Hua.

503
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:58,530
Impressive.

504
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,260
It feels so unreal.

505
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:45,700
Why?

506
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,050
Yesterday, I saw you

507
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:50,310
find the person you've been waiting for.

508
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:53,770
I thought you were gonna leave me.

509
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,820
I didn't expect...

510
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,790
we are suddenly together today.

511
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,020
It's like a dream.

512
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,660
Don't worry.

513
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,060
I even sold the viscount's earrings.

514
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:06,860
You sold them already? So soon?

515
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,600
You knew I was going to sell the earrings?

516
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,530
One day...

517
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,310
I heard your conversation with Ding.

518
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:18,850
I'm sorry.

519
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,540
It's okay.

520
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:24,490
I've never planned to hide this from you.

521
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,130
You don't have to sell them in such a hurry.

522
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,060
You can keep them as a souvenir.

523
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,220
I thought you don't have much time left before.

524
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:35,740
But now it looks like

525
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,100
you have plenty of time left.

526
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,560
You can make money slowly.

527
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,460
I've sold them.

528
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,380
They are inanimate things.

529
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,260
They are not as important as you.

530
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:48,740
Okay.

531
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:52,370
So... how much did they sell for?

532
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,820
Ten million yuan.

533
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,010
T-Ten million yuan?

534
00:31:59,210 --> 00:31:59,860
Yes.

535
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,070
I asked Yanhai to take them to an auction house for an appraisal.

536
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,500
I didn't expect them to attract

537
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,160
an antiquer from Taiwan soon.

538
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,140
The buyer offered a fixed price.

539
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,420
But... the remittance may not be so quick.

540
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,300
We need to wait.

541
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,910
Gosh.

542
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,330
What's wrong?

543
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,010
I think...

544
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,030
even though you can let go of Ms. Xi,

545
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,530
maybe Ms. Xi can't let go of you.

546
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:29,930
Actually, it was Ms. Xi who encouraged me

547
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,660
to confess my love to you today.

548
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,620
Ms. Xi?

549
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,660
The person Nan Hua has been waiting for

550
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,900
is actually Jin Xia's teacher?

551
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,090
Actually, when I first saw Mr. Nan,

552
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,080
I had a special feeling.

553
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,750
I felt familiar.

554
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,700
But I didn't say it back then.

555
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,000
After all, you're Xia's boyfriend.

556
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,090
I didn't want to cause

557
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,850
unnecessary misunderstandings.

558
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,850
Later, this feeling became stronger

559
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,180
and kept attracting me.

560
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,940
I wanted to figure it out.

561
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,860
Coincidentally,

562
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:10,820
your image echoes the styles of my new works perfectly.

563
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,080
So I wanted to seize the opportunity to know more about you.

564
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,420
So you came all the way here

565
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:20,950
just to see my brother?

566
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:21,970
No.

567
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,220
I didn't know Mr. Nan lives here.

568
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,290
Maybe... you'll think what I'm going to say is incredible.

569
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,170
I often...

570
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,720
dreamed of this house before.

571
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:36,490
It's just that my feeling has got stronger lately.

572
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,690
The dreams have become more realistic.

573
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,210
After...

574
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,820
After I saw you in the company yesterday,

575
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:46,280
I wanted to muster up my courage to come here.

576
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,360
I really didn't expect

577
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,180
you are really here.

578
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,970
Now... I kind of believe

579
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,770
we do have some connections.

580
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,130
Ms. Xi,

581
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,020
maybe you really have something to do

582
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,580
with the person I've been waiting for. But...

583
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,730
But Mr. Nan,

584
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,370
I hope you can let go of the past.

585
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,570
I don't know

586
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,350
what happened to us in the past.

587
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:18,380
But now,

588
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,940
both of us have a new life.

589
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:22,170
Let bygones...

590
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,570
be bygones.

591
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:26,250
But I made a promise to the viscount.

592
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:29,710
Do you mean the person you've been waiting for for 2,000 years?

593
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:34,659
I don't know

594
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:36,130
what you promised him,

595
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,670
but I don't need you to fulfill it to me.

596
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,090
I have my own life.

597
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,370
I will try my best to live my life well.

598
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,489
I sincerely hope

599
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:45,730
you can let go of your obsession

600
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,860
and cherish the person in front of you.

601
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:50,260
You mean...

602
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,020
If it's possible,

603
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,820
go check on Xia.

604
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:56,780
After you left,

605
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,640
she cried all night.

606
00:34:58,690 --> 00:34:59,910
She is really sad.

607
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,750
When I saw her in the company this morning,

608
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,150
she looked very haggard.

609
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,180
Her eyes were swollen.

610
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,020
She cried?

611
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:07,720
Nan Hua,

612
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:11,240
if I'm really the person you've been waiting for,

613
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,500
I also

614
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,820
have a say in terms of our past.

615
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,580
It's not up to you alone.

616
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,420
Now please,

617
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,100
don't drive away

618
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,010
the girl you like so much suddenly.

619
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,380
This is really cruel.

620
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,160
She slept in the company in the past few days.

621
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,180
She couldn't eat or sleep well.

622
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:35,260
She really needs your care.

623
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,410
Most importantly,

624
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,040
she just lost her grandma.

625
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:47,770
Do you

626
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,050
want her to lose you now?

627
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,540
Ms. Xi,

628
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,570
you are the most generous woman

629
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:08,500
I've ever seen.

630
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,340
Thank you, Ms. Xi.

631
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:18,540
I'm not thanking you

632
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,300
for helping me understand my feelings.

633
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,490
Because I've already had an answer in my heart.

634
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:24,690
I'm thanking you for helping me confirm

635
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,510
Jin Xia cares about me too.

636
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:29,740
Excuse me.

637
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:37,310
This is what happened.

638
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,420
Ms. Xi really cares about you.

639
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,780
She seems...

640
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,380
not interested in me.

641
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:46,340
Did Ms. Xi... really say that?

642
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:47,480
Yes.

643
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,610
But...

644
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,450
Alright, stop saying but.

645
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,810
I know you don't want to leave me.

646
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:58,850
That's... That's not true.

647
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,050
She said someone

648
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,530
cried all night because of me, right?

649
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:08,140
Well... Ms. Xi was mistaken.

650
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,050
My eyes were swollen because I stayed up too late.

651
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,280
Have you forgotten

652
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,770
I can feel people's fear

653
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,700
when I'm in their bodies?

654
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,780
When I was in your body,

655
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:26,710
you were very worried that I would leave you.

656
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,170
And last night...

657
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:30,770
Alright.

658
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,460
Stop talking.

659
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,530
Don't chase me.

660
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,050
Stop chasing me.

661
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,610
You're so vigilant.

662
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:04,370
I've been waiting for you all night.

663
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,180
Sorry.

664
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,410
I was delayed by some work.

665
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:11,340
Work?

666
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,620
If you don't solve the problem

667
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,130
between you and me first,

668
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,510
I'm afraid your whole life's work

669
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,670
will be delayed.

670
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,530
Did you drink wine again?

671
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:25,780
Do you know

672
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,110
your husband wants to divorce you

673
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,420
just because you always drink wine?

674
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:32,820
Even without me,

675
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,770
he would still leave you.

676
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,690
It's between me and him.

677
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:38,220
It's none of your business.

678
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:39,890
I gave you two options.

679
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,350
Have you made up your mind?

680
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,780
Do you choose to leave my husband?

681
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,730
If so, I'll let bygones be bygones.

682
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:47,930
Or do you choose

683
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:51,110
to let me disclose your scandal in front of the media

684
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,710
and ban you in the fashion industry?

685
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,150
Please give me three more days.

686
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,850
You've been procrastinating for too long.

687
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:04,840
Believe me.

688
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,360
Stay here for three more days.

689
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:07,980
I'll give you a satisfactory answer

690
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,570
in three days.

691
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:11,060
Just three days.

692
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:19,650
Mom, please.

693
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,140
[Ding Yanhai]

694
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,140
[Reject] [Answer]

695
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,240
Hello, Ding.

696
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:52,120
Jin Xia, are you back?

697
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,420
We're on our way. We'll be there soon.

698
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,350
My mom wants to see you and Brother.

699
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:58,630
We'll be waiting for you at your door.

700
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:02,850
Why does Ms. Chen want to see us?

701
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,010
Ms. Chen,

702
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:11,580
what's... the matter?

703
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:12,850
Jin,

704
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,050
Nan is also here today.

705
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,400
I'm gonna get straight to the point.

706
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,840
This brat

707
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,710
skipped work again today.

708
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,940
He's been skipping work for you lately.

709
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,370
His company issued an announcement to criticize him.

710
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:27,810
He's gonna lose his job.

711
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:30,140
Ms. Chen, are you saying...

712
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,390
Ding skipped work for me?

713
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:33,330
Yes.

714
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:34,970
I told him

715
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,850
Jin has a boyfriend

716
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,690
and her boyfriend

717
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:40,300
is much better than him.

718
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,140
Who is he to compete with him?

719
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:43,090
That's right.

720
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,370
Jin, don't blame me for being nosy.

721
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:49,860
You should cherish

722
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,930
your love.

723
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,850
You shouldn't have an ambiguous relationship with another man.

724
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,170
You're right.

725
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,450
Ms. Chen, it's not what you think.

726
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,180
Ding and I are just friends.

727
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:10,940
If it's not what I think,

728
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:12,330
what is it?

729
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:15,550
Why did he come to you every night?

730
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:18,740
He came to me...

731
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,220
No, Ms. Chen,

732
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:23,540
he came here for Nan Hua.

733
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:26,690
Don't try to fool me.

734
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:29,580
He came here every day.

735
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:33,060
It's impossible that Nan came to you every day, right?

736
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:36,860
That's right.

737
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:39,910
Ms. Chen doesn't know that Nan Hua lives here.

738
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:41,770
Anyway,

739
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:43,170
no matter what happened before,

740
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:45,370
promise me

741
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,240
you will not see my son again.

742
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,620
You take the initiative to say it today

743
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,740
to make him give up.

744
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,940
Tell him to stop pestering you.

745
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:55,820
You brat,

746
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,050
make a promise

747
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,370
in front of her boyfriend.

748
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,500
From today onwards,

749
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,130
you will never see Xia again

750
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:03,740
and you will draw a boundary with her.

751
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:04,540
Do you hear me?

752
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,530
No problem, Mom.

753
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:07,660
I promise

754
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:09,990
I won't even look at her in the future.

755
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:12,770
Why don't we call it a day?

756
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,040
Let's go home, Mom.

757
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:14,620
Let's go.

758
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:17,380
Wenying,

759
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:19,670
you really misunderstood.

760
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:22,860
Actually, Yanhai came here frequently because of me.

761
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:28,340
Every time he came, he came for me.

762
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:30,390
This...

763
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,320
Your explanation

764
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,560
will cause another misunderstanding.

765
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:41,140
He...

766
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:44,740
He came to me...

767
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,610
because I asked him to do some work for me.

768
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,960
I asked him to help me.

769
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:51,260
Work?

770
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:54,830
Yes, I'm not a local resident.

771
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:56,640
It's inevitable that I encounter some problems

772
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,420
when I do design and decoration work.

773
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:01,010
Such as where to hire workers

774
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:03,700
and where to buy high-quality building materials.

775
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,900
Yanhai grew up here, right?

776
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:07,810
He knows a lot.

777
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:09,010
He has helped me a lot.

778
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,330
I see.

779
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:15,260
And... I paid him.

780
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:19,690
You paid him?

781
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:21,940
How much?

782
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,460
20,000 yuan... a month.

783
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:28,100
20,000 yuan?

784
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:29,990
This is what Yanhai deserves.

785
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:31,060
No matter what,

786
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,010
Wenying, I sincerely

787
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:33,770
apologize to you here.

788
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:35,600
I was thoughtless.

789
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:37,020
I delayed his work

790
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:38,340
because I asked him to help me do some urgent work.

791
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,400
It was all my fault.

792
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,650
From now on, I'll ask him for help in his spare time.

793
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:42,980
Please don't blame him.

794
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:45,020
I see.

795
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,940
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

796
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:49,490
You brat.

797
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,220
Good for you.

798
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,360
Why didn't you tell me about this?

799
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:55,620
From now on, you'll pay

800
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:57,850
half of the household expenses.

801
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,090
Since you've explained everything,

802
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:09,380
I'm relieved.

803
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:10,530
If there is nothing else,

804
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:11,730
Son, let's go back.

805
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:15,540
Mom, I need to talk to my brother

806
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,500
about work.

807
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,390
Why don't you go back first?

808
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:22,020
Sure, you can stay here for as long as you want.

809
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,690
I'm going back now.

810
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:24,750
Goodbye, Wenying.

811
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:25,860
Ms. Chen, let me walk you out.

812
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,920
No need. You young people have a talk.

813
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:33,970
Mr. Ding Yanhai.

814
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:39,890
Make yourself worthy of the pay of 20,000 yuan.

815
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:42,170
No problem, Mom.

816
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:44,490
I'm going back.

817
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,220
Bye, Wenying.

818
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,450
Goodbye, Ms. Chen.

819
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:55,460
Brother,

820
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:59,180
we have handled my mom.

821
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,920
But there's a new problem.

822
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:03,500
Where can I get so much money

823
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,230
to give it to my mom every month?

824
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:06,340
Don't worry.

825
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:08,250
I'm serious

826
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,420
about paying you.

827
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:14,100
You helped me sell the earrings, right?

828
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:16,770
I plan to give you a 10% commission.

829
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:18,260
You've helped me a lot.

830
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,720
Consider it a token of my gratitude for that.

831
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,570
10% of 10 million yuan...

832
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,640
That's 1 million yuan!

833
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:27,770
1 million yuan?

834
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,950
Brother, you're so great.

835
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,260
I'll listen to whatever you say, okay?

836
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,570
Even a flatterer can earn so much money nowadays?

837
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:36,130
1...

838
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:42,460
1 million yuan. That's too much.

839
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,180
It's okay.

840
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:47,560
Yanhai is the descendent of Taiping.

841
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,290
It's my duty to take care of him.

842
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,130
Fine.

843
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:55,690
Why do I feel like

844
00:47:55,690 --> 00:48:00,090
my money has been stolen by an angelic bitch?
