2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,160
In the several thousand years of human history,

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,040
there have been many unsolved mysteries.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,960
Are the stories of Dayu controlling the flood and Nvwa mending the sky myths?

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,560
Why would the advancement of human civilization

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,760
surpass its current situations?

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,800
There are all kinds of speculations.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,760
But in fact, the truth

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,760
dates back to the ancient times.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,400
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,720
the highly developed

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,360
prehistoric civilizations once existed on Earth.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,680
Back then, the ancient people

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,080
mastered the scientific civilization far more advanced than that in modern society.

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,160
Their high-level genetic modification technology

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,280
even enabled them to develop

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,390
human potential to the greatest extent.

18
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,960
They could absorb the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,820
to stay alive and even exert extraordinary energy.

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,720
However, a tragic doomsday disaster

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,400
made those human beings almost extinct at that time.

22
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:01,720
Countless lives

23
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,920
and brilliant civilizations were destroyed overnight.

24
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,960
Only a small number of ancient people

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,560
survived the doomsday

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,330
after escaping to the underground in time

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,789
and entering into a frozen hibernation state.

28
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:14,450
After that,

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,190
through tens of thousands of years of self-repair,

30
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,480
our Earth conceived new intelligent lives again,

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,740
namely, the ancestors of modern people.

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,080
And the ancient people sleeping in the underground areas

33
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,480
woke up one after another

34
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,160
and returned to the land.

35
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,870
They saw

36
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,830
the new primitive humans who were still trying to make fire by drilling wood.

37
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,920
Out of good intentions,

38
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,030
they taught the younger generations

39
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,039
many technologies, such as farming, metallurgy,

40
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,800
construction, flood control, and precautions against natural disasters.

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,729
Many great civilization miracles

42
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,120
were the masterpieces made

43
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,850
by our ancestors with the help of ancient people.

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,759
At that time, the new human beings

[Fuxi Temple]

46
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,960
considered the ancient people with extraordinary energy as deities.

47
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,690
They built temples for them and worshipped them.

48
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,200
As the official historians of various countries exaggerated the stories about them,

49
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,720
many legendary ancient myths have been passed down till now.

50
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,240
In this way,

51
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,440
most ancient people around the world

52
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,360
fitted into the new world with the identities

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,520
of deities.

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,840
But there were also some low-profile ancient people

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,300
who chose to live in seclusion in deep mountains to escape from the mortal world.

56
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,070
However,

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,320
people's worship towards the deities

58
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,400
also gradually generated fear and desires.

59
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,190
The rulers feared that the power of deities

60
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,829
would become a threat to their royal power.

61
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:29,390
But they were also greedy

62
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,120
for immortality and the extraordinary power.

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,780
Therefore,

64
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,720
they used various excuses

65
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
to start wars

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,850
against the deities from time to time.

67
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,829
The ancient people were outnumbered

68
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,320
and were no match for the huge armies in the end.

69
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,920
They almost became extinct.

70
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,600
Little did they know

71
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,960
that by imparting the knowledge of weapon forging to the new humans,

72
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,160
they unwittingly unleashed a disaster upon themselves.

73
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,840
Although the ancient people who lived in deep mountains

74
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,400
survived this disaster,

75
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,920
they were hunted by the rulers continuously.

76
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,240
They were even slandered

77
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,510
and considered as horrible mountain spirits or ferocious ghosts.

78
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,880
In the blink of an eye,

79
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,750
those who had been regarded as deities became devils that everyone wanted to kill.

80
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,240
As everything keeps changing in the world,

81
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,920
no one knows the existence of the ancient people anymore.

82
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,270
Only those anecdotes and peculiar stories about ghosts and monsters

83
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,350
have been passed down from generation to generation.

84
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,079
And the tiny minority of ancient people who have survived

85
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,750
are still secretly hiding

86

00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,440
Yeah.

378
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:44,870
Sure, come on.

379
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:45,680
No.

380
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,160
I can't let everyone's last memory

381
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,040
be coming to the hospital to see me having a rupture of internal hemorrhoids.

382
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,430
I mean,

383
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,160
how can such an important memory

384
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,110
be fixed in the hospital?

385
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,710
It's inauspicious.

386
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,950
How about

387
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,130
we go on a group trip one last time?

388
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,870
A group trip?

389
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,400
Jin Xia,

390
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,360
we're all unemployed.

391
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:12,110
I'm afraid we don't have enough money…

392
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,990
We don't have to go to expensive places.

393
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,290
Just go to the place where I live.

394
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:15,990
Where you live?

395
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,460
You know Wangqi Town?

396
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,010
It has an extraordinary coastline scenery.

397
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:20,920
Plus, it is off-season now,

398
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,880
so there are not many tourists

399
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,050
and the cost is not very high.

400
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,800
If you don't mind,

401
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,810
you can stay in my house.

402
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,920
That way, we can save the accommodation fee, too.

403
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,430
Sounds good.

404
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,280
Really?

405
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,410
What do you think?

406
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,160
Sure.

407
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,360
Nan Hua, do you mind?

408
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,520
Of course not.

409
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,880
You're welcome anytime.

410
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,890
I can take care of your three meals.

411
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,940
Yes.

412
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,730
Nan Hua cooks super delicious food.

413
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,690
It's a deal then.

414
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,520
Can we have a seafood barbecue?

415
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,630
Yes, a seafood barbecue.

416
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,900
What date should we go?

417
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,840
Let's talk about it.

418
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,850
Sure.

419
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,440
I'm so smart.

420
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,590
Done.

421
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,200
Yinting.

422
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,030
It's your turn to come on the stage.

423
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,180
We're finally home.

424
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,180
You've had a hard time these days.

425
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:00,900
These days?

426
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,480
What happened these days?

427
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,010
I can't remember a bit of it.

428
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,180
You'd better forget it, too.

429
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,080
Okay?

430
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:09,720
Okay.

431
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:19,960
Who is that?

432
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,300
Mr. Lin.

433
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,530
He sold the house to me.

434
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,910
Mr. Lin, why are you here?

435
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,020
You want to buy the house back?

436
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:38,550
Yes.

437
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,070
I wanted to buy it from the agent,

438
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,830
but then the agent said you didn't want to sell it.

439
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,230
That's why I came to visit you.

440
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,280
So you were the buyer the agent mentioned?

441
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,570
Yes.

442
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,650
This house is very important to me.

443
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,990
I have to buy it back.

444
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,990
But if it's important,

445
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,730
why did you sell it back then?

446
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm ashamed.

447
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:10,460
This house belonged to my mother.

448
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,220
She moved to Taiwan

449
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,970
for some reason

450
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,130
and never came back.

451
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,610
Last year.

452
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:22,550
I wanted to clear the assets in the mainland of China.

453
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:25,490
I saw the house was empty.

454
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,710
I thought it was empty for nothing,

455
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,960
so I sold it.

456
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,830
I didn't expect that my mother would be so furious

457
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:33,850
after knowing it.

458
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,800
She asked me to buy this house back at all costs.

459
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,030
But Mr. Lin,

460
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:42,980
I'm used to living in this house.

461
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,730
I have no plans to sell it.

462
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,020
Miss Jin,

463
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,820
if you like this kind of house,

464
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,400
there are many houses like this in this town.

465
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:58,000
I'm willing to offer 30% more than its market price.

466
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,890
Consider it the moving fee.

467
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,710
It's not about money.

468
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,630
Then what's the problem?

469
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,430
Please help me.

470
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,470
This house means a lot to my mother.

471
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,570
My mother had a poor family when she was young.

472
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,040
She had a rough life

473
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,350
and suffered a lot.

474
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,830
Luckily, she met her first love.

475
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,320
That man was very nice to her.

476
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,940
My mother always said

477
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,020
if it weren't for him,

478
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:44,020
she wouldn't end up so nicely today.

479
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,130
This house was given to her by that man.

480
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,670
Unfortunately, they lost contact because of the war.

481
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,170
She searched for him for years but failed,

482
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,770
hence the end of this love.

483
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,540
My mother often said

484
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:03,310
this house is the only place where she can place her feelings.

485
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,990
She asked me to buy it back

486
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,880
on this trip.

487
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,440
I hope you can be kind

488
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:14,690
and grant my old mother's wish.

489
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,270
But...

490
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,260
May I know your mother's name?

491
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,880
My mother's surname is Zhou.

492
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,140
Zhou Yinting.

493
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,350
You know my mother?

494
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:36,330
Yes.

495
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,270
It was a long time ago.

496
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,200
Did… Did you meet in Taiwan?

497
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,710
No.

498
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,810
Where did you meet then?

499
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,420
Here.

500
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,600
Here?

501
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,790
Impossible.

502
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,150
My mother hasn't come back here for 70 years.

503
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,140
And at your age…

504
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,620
I am…

505
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,670
the grandson of an old friend of hers.

506
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,520
My grandfather told me about her.

507
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,470
Grandfather?

508
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:23,860
Yes.

509
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,010
Sorry, Mr. Lin.

510
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,100
We won't sell this house.

511
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:38,190
We need it more than your mother.

512
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,610
Young man, what's your name?

513
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,270
Nan Hua.

514
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:50,320
What's your grandfather's name?

515
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,550
It's Nan Hua, too.

516
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,900
Mr. Nan Hua, is your grandpa still alive?

517
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,240
He's dead.

518
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,050
Mr. Lin, please tell your mother

519
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,990
this house is not for sale.

520
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,170
Just tell her Nan Hua said this.

521
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,130
I believe she will understand.

522
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,630
Zhou Yinting,

523
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:52,980
a wealthy Taiwan businesswoman, an antique collector…

524
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,400
She's already 100 years old!

525
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,140
This must be her.

526
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:07,000
She was such a beauty when she was young.

527
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,790
Nan Hua's first love?

528
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,850
Yes.

529
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,710
That's what Mr. Lin said.

530
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,320
So what?

531
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,780
It was more than a hundred years ago.

532
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,790
You aren't so petty, are you?

533
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,310
Not really.

534
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,960
I just feel

535
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,480
after meeting Nan Hua,

536
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,410
the suspected reincarnation of the viscount

537
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,300
appeared one after another.

538
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,880
I'm a little tired.

539
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,220
Then hurry up

540
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,720
and take Nan Hua.

541
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,190
Make your relationship as husband and wife a fait accompli.

542
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,060
That way, you don't need to worry.

543
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,520
It's not that simple.

544
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:57,860
What? Is it not going well?

545
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,360
Not really.

546
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,760
I just feel

547
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,870
we haven't made any substantial progress

548
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,160
since we started dating.

549
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,350
Don't tell me

550
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:16,400
you are still

551
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,980
dating like high school students

552
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,400
and all the intimate contact is limited to holding hands and kissing?

553
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,440
How is that possible?

554
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:28,960
We only hold hands and hug each other.

555
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,670
What's wrong with you two?

556
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:34,050
Nan Hua is conservative.

557
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,270
He has the concept of the ancient people,

558
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,370
like restraining your affection within the limits of the proprieties.

559
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,880
Nan Hua is an ancient man.

560
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,970
It's okay for him to be conservative.

561
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,480
But you're a woman from the new era!

562
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,000
Can't you take the initiative and teach him?

563
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,030
I'm Fairy Baby.

564
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,980
I don't know how to do that.

565
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,870
It seems that you still have a long way to go

566
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,270
before becoming Mrs. Li.

567
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,590
Mrs. Li?

568
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,150
It was a slip of the tongue.

569
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,260
I mean Mrs. Nan.

570
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:06,540
So… Shall I force myself to take the initiative for once?

571
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,330
Come in.

572
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,100
Nan Hua.

573
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,710
Are you free now?

574
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,030
Yes.

575
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,790
Then I'm coming in.

576
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:06,330
What's the matter?

577
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,780
Nothing special.

578
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,070
It's a long night. I don't want to sleep.

579
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,600
Let's have a chat.

580
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,560
What?

581
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,720
Just a casual chat.

582
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,350
Your room seems a little hot.

583
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,670
Nan Hua, you don't have a problem, do you?

584
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,190
What problem?

585
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,720
Shouldn't a normal man

586
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,840
have a racing heart

587
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:19,040
when seeing his girlfriend dressed like this?

588
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:43,850
I swear

589
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,920
I want you more than anyone else.

590
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:54,020
But I want to wait until we're married.

591
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,420
Married?

592
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,730
If you agree to marry me, that is.

593
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,860
You make me

594
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,990
look like a bully

595
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,080
who wants to deflower you.

596
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,150
I'm sorry.

597
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,639
I just want to keep that principle.

598
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,310
I know I'm old-fashioned,

599
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,719
but I came from an era like that.

600
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:32,889
Jin Xia.

601
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,110
If I met you

602
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,580
a thousand years ago,

603
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:44,340
I think we would drink tea, listen to music,

604
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:48,870
admire flowers, go to temple fairs, and travel around together.

605
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:51,639
We would take an oath of love under the moon.

606
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,320
I would definitely

607
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,900
want to kiss you secretly when you were asleep.

608
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,200
But I'd hold myself back.

609
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,010
I'd write the proposal letter,

610
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,970
prepare generous betrothal gifts,

611
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:15,390
and ask my parents to get your parents' permission for you to marry me.

612
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,940
After your parents agreed,

613
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,400
I'd pick an auspicious day.

614
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,520
With a sedan chair carried by eight people, the bells chiming, and the drumbeats rumbling,

615
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,010
I'd marry you.

616
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:34,040
And we'd live happily ever after.

617
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,740
Jin Xia.

618
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,500
I… I love you.

619
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,510
Every minute and every second.

620
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,950
I'm sorry.

621
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,760
I always act on my own wishes and habits

622
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,610
but ignored your feelings.

623
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,790
I'm happy

624
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,160
that you cherish me so much.

625
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,390
But don't feel too burdened.

626
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,970
Regardless of the era difference,

627
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,010
actually, as long as we treat each other sincerely,

628
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,010
it'll be good if things

629
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:09,580
can happen naturally between us.

630
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,130
It's getting late.

631
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,950
Let's go to bed early.

632
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,850
Can I sleep in your room tonight?

633
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:29,210
No.

634
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,640
Why not?

635
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:35,080
With this atmosphere,

636
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,340
if you sleep next to me…

637
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,590
I'm not a saint.

638
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,450
We'd better sleep separately.

639
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,210
Good night.

640
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:53,850
Good night.

641
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,830
Bro.

642
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:28,460
Come on in.

643
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,230
[Management From Zero]

644
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,570
Bro, I've brought the books you asked for.

645
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,150
Thank you.

646
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,260
But, Bro,

647
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,440
why do you suddenly want to read

648
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,890
books about administration and management?

649
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:43,450
Stop talking nonsense.

650
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,240
Women from our family

651
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,010
never had the convention of giving up her career

652
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:48,480
and doing housework.

653
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,990
I'm very ambitious.

654
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,610
So, Bro, you want to open

655
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,280
a studio for Jin Xia?

656
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,210
Yes.

657
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,770
To run a studio well,

658
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,870
the ability of the designer put aside,

659
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,800
it also needs someone to manage it.

660
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,930
Jin Xia loves designing so much.

661
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,570
I hope she can focus on her creation in the future.

662
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,170
As for running the business,

663
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,560
I'll handle it.

664
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,640
Then you'll be the boss.

665
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,010
So handsome.

666
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,310
But there are so many books.

667
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,910
Can you finish them tonight?

668
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,760
Are you going to stay up all night?

669
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,430
I can accompany you.

670
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:36,940
It's okay.

671
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,410
You can rest first.

672
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,360
I'm not sleepy.

673
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:42,170
Besides,

674
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,040
I want to learn something, too.

675
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,270
I can help you in the future.

676
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:48,780
Help me?

677
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:50,930
Yes.

678
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:52,530
In the future,

679
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,370
I can be your personal assistant.

680
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:58,870
Whatever.

681
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,380
By the way, Yanhai,

682
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,000
I have a favor to ask you.

683
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,100
No problem.

684
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:05,250
Just let me know.

685
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,660
Who is it? It's so early.

686
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,780
It's already eleven o'clock.

687
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,400
I really don't have a time concept if I don't go to work.

688
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,350
[Senior Bai Bing]

689
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,140
Senior?

690
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,320
Hello, Senior?

691
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,950
Jin Xia, open the door.

692
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,320
We're in front of your house.

693
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,850
You're in front of my house?

694
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:49,870
Yes.

695
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,060
We are here to have a reunion today: Xiaoman and I and the others.

696
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,920
You haven't forgotten, have you?

697
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,990
No, I didn't.

698
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,330
Wait a minute. I'll be right there.

699
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,560
Oh no, I forgot.

700
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:11,430
So, the bedrooms and living room

701
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,740
were all decorated by Nan Hua alone?

702
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,880
Now, only the foundation and pipes

703
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:18,170
need to be reinforced.

704
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,520
I thought

705
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,830
we all studied design.

706
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,600
If you needed help with the decoration,

707
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,150
we should be able to give you a hand.

708
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,790
But you're dealing with the foundation.

709
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,670
That's beyond our reach.

710
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:30,980
Nan Hua doesn't need our help.

711
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:33,920
He's a big architect.

712
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,350
Nan Hua is an architect?

713
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:39,210
Okay, we're the ones who overthought it.

714
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,790
Jin Xia, your boyfriend is perfect.

715
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,370
He's handsome,

716
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:45,790
he has a figure like a model,

717
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,720
and now he's even working as an architect!

718
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,100
He's both handsome and talented.

719
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,120
He's okay.

720
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,560
I don't know where he went this morning.

721
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:07,160
Nan Hua.

722
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,140
Where did you go?

723
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,470
My colleagues are here.

724
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:13,640
I've been in Yanhai's place.

725
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,130
Yanhai's place?

726
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:16,830
Sorry.

727
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:19,900
Forget it. Let's entertain the guests first.

728
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,680
Nan Hua, you're back.

729
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,200
Hello.

730
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,260
Have you eaten?

731
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,860
You think about cooking the minute you come back.

732
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,270
What a model boyfriend!

733
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,410
We grabbed a bite

734
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:31,310
on our way here.

735
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:32,410
Didn't we agree

736
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,910
to go to the beach to have a seafood barbecue?

737
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,520
I've prepared the barbecue sauce for you.

738
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,300
The Nan Hua style barbecue sauce.

739
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,650
I can't wait.

740
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:41,960
Let's allocate the rooms

741
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,740
and start our beach party quickly!

742
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,200
Jin Xia, how should we allocate the rooms?

743
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,390
Yeah, let me think about it.

744
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,880
How about this?

745
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,840
You girls share a room.

746
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:54,640
I'll sleep on the floor in the living room.

747
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,640
Jin Xia and Nan Hua must be sharing a room.

748
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,160
Is that okay?

749
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,430
Yes.

750
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,320
Well,

751
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,510
I'll crash on the floor in your room.

752
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:13,080
They can sleep in my room.

753
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:17,010
You're already together.

754
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:18,710
Why do you have to crash on the floor?

755
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:20,510
Why don't you just share one bed?

756
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,580
It's not appropriate.

757
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:30,370
Sleeping in the same room itself is crossing the line.

758
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:19,110
Jin Xia.

759
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:21,320
Are you and Nan Hua all right?

760
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:22,650
Yes.

761
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,780
Why do you ask?

762
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,880
Didn't he say he'd sleep on the floor today?

763
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,940
Did you two fight?

764
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:28,580
No.

765
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,420
Nan Hua

766
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:33,000
is just old-fashioned.

767
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,520
Really?

768
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,450
I didn't know there's such kind of person now.

769
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,520
By the way,

770
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,240
have you found a new job yet?

771
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,520
Not yet.

772
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:43,270
I've actually found

773
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:44,320
a job in a pretty good studio.

774
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,580
I can recommend you for an interview.

775
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:46,380
Do you want to try?

776
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,050
Really?

777
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,220
Thank you, Senior.

778
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,150
You're welcome.

779
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,470
It smells so good.

780
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,340
I'll go check on him.

781
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:57,700
Nan Hua, is the meat ready?

782
00:44:57,490 --> 00:44:58,080
[Administration]

783
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,040
What are you hiding?

784
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:02,690
Nothing.

785
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:05,160
You are.

786
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,510
It's burnt!

787
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:12,440
Business administration.

788
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:13,930
Why are you reading this?

789
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,060
I'm interested in it.

790
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,060
But there's no need to hide it.

791
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:25,850
Because I don't understand it much,

792
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,540
I'm afraid you'll laugh at me.

793
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,190
Why would I?

794
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:36,670
Well, Nan Hua.

795
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:41,310
Can we act more intimate

796
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,800
in front of my friends?

797
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,670
Why?

798
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,150
Everyone is watching.

799
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,960
What should I do?

800
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:15,540
Hot, hot, hot!

801
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:19,030
PDA!

802
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:37,680
It's an open beach.

803
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,300
Let's play the game of Taking off Hats.

804
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:39,890
Sure.

805
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:41,540
What is the game of Taking off Hats?

806
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,000
You play it in teams of two.

807
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,750
One carries the other on his back.

808
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:46,270
The people on the back try to take off other people's hats.

809
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:48,270
If your hat is taken off, you're out.

810
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:49,880
Sounds good.

811
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:52,130
I'll team up with Jin Xia.

812
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:55,590
You're too tall. You have such a great advantage.

813
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:57,750
But he's carrying me, so we won't have any advantage that way.

814
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,680
You're quite self-depreciative.

815
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:00,560
Of course.

816
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,990
Come on, I'll be the referee.

817
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:03,380
How will you be punished if you lose?

818
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:04,670
50 push-ups.

819
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:07,470
Good for you.

820
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:10,130
Just wait. You'll cry for it.

821
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:14,720
It's boring to do push-ups all the time.

822
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,320
Yeah, let's change the punishment.

823
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,240
Yes, let's change it.

824
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,400
Truth or Dare.

825
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,260
You choose one.

826
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:25,760
We choose Dare.

827
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,740
Don't blame us for making it difficult for you.

828
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,140
Let's have a simple one.

829
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,450
Just a kiss.

830
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:38,820
I don't think it's appropriate.

831
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,540
You're going out already.

832
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:41,700
Don't be shy.

833
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,600
A bet is a bet.

834
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:44,870
I didn't miss a push-up just now.

835
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:57,150
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

836
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:13,960
What is that?

837
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,040
It doesn't count.

838
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,120
How can kissing the forehead count?

839
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:16,840
Right.

840
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:22,790
Sorry.

841
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:23,720
We're not used to

842
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,280
public displays of affection.

843
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,680
Sorry to disappoint you.

844
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:27,840
You guys continue.

845
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:30,360
I'm going to the bathroom.

846
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:37,280
Did we go too far?

847
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,040
Jin Xia.

848
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:52,390
Why are you here?

849
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:54,840
I'm here to accompany you.

850
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,320
I'm fine.

851
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:58,190
Go on playing.

852
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,800
Are you angry?

853
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,090
No.

854
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:06,990
I'm sorry.

855
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:09,850
Why are you apologizing?

856
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:15,600
I embarrassed you in front of your friends.

857
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:18,610
So you knew it, too?

858
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:20,630
Jin Xia.

859
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:27,270
Nan Hua, I know you're a conservative person.

860
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:29,660
I know all about your feelings.

861
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,560
But they don't.

862
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:34,000
My friends thought we had a fight

863
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:35,960
or something happened between us.

864
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,120
I don't know how to explain it to them.

865
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:39,920
I also want to show my friends

866
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,320
how good my boyfriend is.

867
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:42,890
But now?

868
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:45,190
Nan Hua.

869
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,760
I'm a modern person.

870
00:50:47,950 --> 00:50:49,810
You also live in the modern times.

871
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,210
We should behave like a modern couple,

872
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:52,990
right?

873
00:50:55,870 --> 00:50:56,680
I'm sorry.

874
00:50:56,710 --> 00:50:58,170
I just want to respect you.

875
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,370
Also,

876
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:02,890
since we are together, it'll be our first

877
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,170
kiss.

878
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,800
I don't want it to be so hasty.

879
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:09,790
If not,

880
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,300
should we do it ceremoniously instead?

881
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:14,140
Can I?

882
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:17,710
Yes.

883
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:19,850
But not too long.

884
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,400
Are you free now?

885
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,300
Isn't it too hasty

886
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:31,870
to do it here?

887
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,450
No, I don't mean here.

888
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:36,940
Jin Xia.

889
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,230
I have a surprise for you.

890
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:43,030
Come with me.
