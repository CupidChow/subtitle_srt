00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,140
In the several thousand years of human history,

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,020
there have been many unsolved mysteries.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,930
Are the stories of Dayu controlling the flood and Nvwa mending the sky myths?

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,540
Why would the advancement of human civilization

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,740
surpass its current situations?

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,780
There are all kinds of speculations.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,720
But in fact, the truth

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,740
dates back to the ancient times.

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,380
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,700
the highly developed

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,340
prehistoric civilizations once existed on Earth.

13
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,660
Back then, the ancient people

14
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,060
mastered the scientific civilization far more advanced than that in modern society.

15
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,140
Their high-level genetic modification technology

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,260
even enabled them to develop

17
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,370
human potential to the greatest extent.

18
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,930
They could absorb the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth

19
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,790
to stay alive and even exert extraordinary energy.

20
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,700
However, a tragic doomsday disaster

21
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,370
made those human beings almost extinct at that time.

22
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,690
Countless lives

23
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,890
and brilliant civilizations were destroyed overnight.

24
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:06,940
Only a small number of ancient people

25
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,520
survived the doomsday

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,289
after escaping to the underground in time

27
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,770
and entering into a frozen hibernation state.

28
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,430
After that,

29
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,170
through tens of thousands of years of self-repair,

30
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,460
our Earth conceived new intelligent lives again,

31
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,720
namely, the ancestors of modern people.

32
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,060
And the ancient people sleeping in the underground areas

33
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,460
woke up one after another

34
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,140
and returned to the land.

35
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:28,850
They saw

36
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,810
the new primitive humans who were still trying to make fire by drilling wood.

37
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,900
Out of good intentions,

38
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,009
they taught the younger generations

39
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:37,009
many technologies, such as farming, metallurgy,

40
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,770
construction, flood control, and precautions against natural disasters.

41
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,700
Many great civilization miracles

42
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,100
were the masterpieces made

43
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,830
by our ancestors with the help of ancient people.

44
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,740
At that time, the new human beings

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,880
[Fuxi Temple]

46
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,940
considered the ancient people with extraordinary energy as deities.

47
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,670
They built temples for them and worshipped them.

48
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,180
As the official historians of various countries exaggerated the stories about them,

49
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,700
many legendary ancient myths have been passed down till now.

50
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,210
In this way,

51
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,410
most ancient people around the world

52
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,340
fitted into the new world with the identities

53
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,490
of deities.

54
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,820
But there were also some low-profile ancient people

55
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,280
who chose to live in seclusion in deep mountains to escape from the mortal world.

56
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,050
However,

57
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,300
people's worship towards the deities

58
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,370
also gradually generated fear and desires.

59
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,180
The rulers feared that the power of deities

60
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,820
would become a threat to their royal power.

61
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,370
But they were also greedy

62
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,100
for immortality and the extraordinary power.

63
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,760
Therefore,

64
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,690
they used various excuses

65
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,700
to start wars

66
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,829
against the deities from time to time.

67
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,810
The ancient people were outnumbered

68
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,300
and were no match for the huge armies in the end.

69
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,900
They almost became extinct.

70
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,570
Little did they know

71
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,930
that by imparting the knowledge of weapon forging to the new humans

72
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,130
they unwittingly unleashed a disaster upon themselves.

73
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,810
Although the ancient people who lived in deep mountains

74
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,380
survived this disaster,

75
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,900
they were hunted by the rulers continuously.

76
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,220
They were even slandered

77
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,490
and considered as horrible mountain spirits or ferocious ghosts.

78
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,860
In the blink of an eye,

79
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,730
those who had been regarded as deities became devils that everyone wanted to kill.

80
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,210
As everything keeps changing in the world,

81
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,900
no one knows the existence of the ancient people anymore.

82
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,250
Only those anecdotes and peculiar stories about ghosts and monsters

83
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,329
have been passed down from generation to generation.

84
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:20,060
And the tiny minority of ancient people who have survived

85
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,730
are still secretly hiding

86
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,610
in those covert corners in the world till now.

87
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,060
Nan Hua, I've taken a shower.

88
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,970
I need to go to work tomorrow

89
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,600
so I'll go to bed now.

90
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,620
Jin Xia.

91
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,440
What?

92
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,100
Today is the first day of us being a real couple.

93
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,130
So?

94
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,120
I have a gift for you.

95
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,730
Gift?

96
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,959
What gift?

97
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,390
Can you close your eyes first?

98
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,820
Close my eyes?

99
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:35,300
Okay.

100
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,100
Follow me.

101
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,490
Don't open your eyes.

102
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,260
Be careful. We're in the room now.

103
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,670
You can open your eyes now.

104
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,300
[Jin Xia]

105
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,540
How is it?

106
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,980
Is it different from what you expected?

107
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,420
When did you...

108
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,940
This is the certificate of award that I won

109
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,890
[Jin Xia is the winner of the Excellent Award of the City Cultural Fair. This certificate of award is hereby awarded to you as an encouragement.]

110
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,740
at my first design competition.

111
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,510
It's the sachet I designed.

112
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,620
And these...

113
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,409
Didn't I throw them away?

114
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,760
You brought them back?

115
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,630
I left some things behind.

116
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,490
Let me get them.

117
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,050
Hurry.

118
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,710
I'll be right back.

119
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,010
So these are the things

120
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,490
you left behind that day?

121
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,490
Why did you bring them back?

122
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,980
They're rubbish now.

123
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,850
They're not.

124
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,580
You may think

125
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,550
these things are useless now.

126
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,180
But I believe they can remind you of those beautiful days in the past

127
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,240
and those days when I was not with you.

128
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,020
How did you

129
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,700
get these photos?

130
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,360
[Jin Xia is the winner of the Excellent Award of the City Cultural Fair. This certificate of award is hereby awarded to you as an encouragement.]

131
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,560
Sorry.

132
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:52,770
I

133
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,390
checked your WeChat Moments and Weibo posts.

134
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,680
Why did you do that?

135
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:01,490
I just

136
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,260
wanted to know everything about you.

137
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,530
So now you know

138
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,290
all my embarrassing moments in the past?

139
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,350
There were no embarrassing moments.

140
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,980
You look lovely in these photos.

141
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,810
I'm sorry. I just couldn't help it.

142
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,230
Couldn't help what?

143
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,620
I couldn't help looking for your photos,

144
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,490
searching your name and...

145
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,490
And what?

146
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,490
And caressing your hair.

147
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,460
I even wanted to kiss you secretly.

148
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,700
Will you get angry for it?

149
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,220
You fool, why would I be angry?

150
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,420
I'm always worried

151
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,180
that I don't have enough respect for your personal boundaries

152
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,580
and it'll make you upset.

153
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,300
You're not making me upset.

154
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,460
You

155
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,570
can come closer.

156
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:15,170
You can do everything you want to do in the future.

157
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,330
Nan Hua.

158
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,850
Can you promise me

159
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,780
that you'll not only live for others

160
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,660
but also live for yourself?

161
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,900
Please do what you like to do

162
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,070
and pursue a life you really want.

163
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,500
Be free.

164
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,100
A life I really want?

165
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:42,450
Yes.

166
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:44,620
Is there anything

167
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,990
you want to do very much?

168
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,540
I had a plan a long time ago.

169
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:01,660
But now I don't think it can happen.

170
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,610
What plan?

171
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,810
The plan of settling down.

172
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,670
Settling down?

173
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,140
Is there anything I can do to help?

174
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,730
Of course.

175
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,300
You can help me a lot

176
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,770
if you'd like to help.

177
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,780
Then let's go to your room tonight.

178
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,580
We can talk about it in bed.

179
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,130
Hasn't your room been repaired?

180
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,180
Why do you need to stay in my room?

181
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,900
It's late tonight.

182
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,570
It takes much time to prepare the bedding.

183
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,170
I have to go to work tomorrow.

184
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,860
Let's just sleep

185
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,940
in your room.

186
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,410
It's okay.

187
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,900
It won't take much time to prepare the bedding.

188
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,740
I've washed your new bedding.

189
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,010
Give me five minutes.

190
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:51,810
But

191
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,410
don't we need to talk about your plan?

192
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,580
You need to go to work tomorrow.

193
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,930
We'll talk about it some other day.

194
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,390
Let me get you the bedding.

195
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,260
You fool.

196
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,660
Why do I feel empty?

197
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,450
It's not that empty.

198
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,340
Good night.

199
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,500
Good night.

200
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,120
I should go to work now.

201
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,180
Take care.

202
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,810
Go.

203
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,510
You'll be late for work if you don't go now.

204
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:17,970
Okay.

205
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,490
I'm going.

206
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,690
All right.

207
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:26,890
Go.

208
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:27,970
I'm going.

209
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:28,940
Go.

210
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,240
If you don't go now,

211
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,700
my spiritual energy will be excessive.

212
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,220
I can get you charged again now?

213
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,780
It doesn't feel the same as before.

214
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,540
But recently,

215
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:02,090
my spiritual energy has been enough for me.

216
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,760
Does it have anything to do with me?

217
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,730
Since this ancient tree rooted,

218
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,860
it has been growing better and better.

219
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,140
I have no idea.

220
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,110
Since it rooted,

221
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,660
it has been growing

222
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,260
much faster than I expected.

223
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,280
So it really has nothing to do with me.

224
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,290
It's growing so fast

225
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,450
probably because of you.

226
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,180
Really?

227
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,650
The utensil is closely related to me.

228
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,310
Everything changes by following some pattern.

229
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,900
The tree is growing so fast.

230
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,570
It's probably responding to our love.

231
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:46,950
Think about it.

232
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:52,690
Whenever we were intimate,

233
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,570
and I got excited,

234
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,650
the spiritual energy would naturally come into my body.

235
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,970
Now we're in love.

236
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,550
Maybe that's why the ancient tree...

237
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,740
I'm going to be late for work.

238
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,390
We'll talk about it after I come back.

239
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,460
Okay.

240
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,220
Well.

241
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,740
After I come back,

242
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,020
let's try it again.

243
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,540
Try what?

244
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:26,560
Try...

245
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,700
Try getting you charged.

246
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,060
Okay.

247
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,100
See you tonight.

248
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,540
See you tonight.

249
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:43,620
Bye.

250
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,530
Bye. Bye.

251
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,330
Big Bro.

252
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,450
Morning.

253
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,380
Morning.

254
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,420
Has Jin Xia gone to work?

255
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,890
You're on duty so early today.

256
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,060
Have you had breakfast?

257
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,970
If you haven't, go into my house and have some.

258
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:31,960
There's some left.

259
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,090
I've had breakfast.

260
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,460
That's good.

261
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,770
I think you're more like a human

262
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,010
than before.

263
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,440
I wasn't like a human before?

264
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,780
You used to be too polite

265
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,130
and you looked distant.

266
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,530
I don't know why

267
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,210
you're more like a human now.

268
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,140
Really?

269
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,220
I think

270
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,080
it's because of me and Jin Xia.

271
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,500
I don't know why.

272
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,910
Whenever I think of Jin Xia,

273
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,460
I have a feeling of great joy and my heart beats faster.

274
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,329
I've never experienced it before.

275
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:13,660
For thousands of years,

276
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,880
no one has ever made you feel that way?

277
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,510
In the past thousands of years,

278
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,609
among those who tried to get to know me,

279
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:23,690
many of them wanted to gain

280
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,460
fame and fortune from me.

281
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,650
Apart from Jin Xia,

282
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,290
no one else has ever wanted to do me good.

283
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,770
It seems you have remembered a lot.

284
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,850
About 80% or 90% of my memories have come back.

285
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:43,220
But I still can't remember

286
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,030
what had happened before the viscount left.

287
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,660
I only remember that I have to keep waiting.

288
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,020
But I can't remember the reason for it.

289
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,960
I guess my spiritual energy is still not enough.

290
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,900
Big Bro, your spiritual energy was so excessive in the past few days

291
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,030
that you had a fever.

292
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,800
Don't overindulge yourself.

293
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,370
What are you talking about?

294
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:07,330
Go to work.

295
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,640
Or you'll be late again.

296
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,100
I don't want to work today.

297
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,810
I just want to help you repair your house.

298
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,580
Go to work now.

299
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,860
If you don't, you'll make Wenying angry.

300
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,860
I have an appointment this morning.

301
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,940
With whom? Do I know the person?

302
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,020
Yes.

303
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,690
Mr. Nan.

304
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,110
Mr. Li, you're here.

305
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,970
Hello, Mr. Li.

306
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,760
I should leave now. You do what you should do.

307
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,970
Mr. Li, please come in.

308
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,390
I've got an initial plan

309
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,210
for the building.

310
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,570
Xiaochuan.

311
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,160
It’s him.

312
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:05,770
Mr. Li.

313
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,380
The last time I came,

314
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,910
the tree didn't blossom.

315
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,440
It grows well now.

316
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,730
The vitality of plants

317
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,270
can always be surprising.

318
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,410
Okay, okay.

319
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,030
Let's get down to business.

320
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,690
Please come in.

321
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:46,900
Ms. Xi.

322
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,230
Jin Xia, what brings you here?

323
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,890
Nothing very important.

324
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:54,630
Have a seat.

325
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,100
Thank you.

326
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,450
I'm here to thank you.

327
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,990
You two have made up?

328
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,970
That's great. I'm happy for you two.

329
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,430
Without you,

330
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,520
Nan Hua and I would still be in an awkward situation.

331
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,940
In a relationship, everyone can be unsure.

332
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,140
I'm glad

333
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,540
that I could help you two.

334
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,460
Ms. Xi.

335
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,020
You're the best person I've ever known.

336
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,580
I will try my best to learn from you.

337
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,240
I'll learn how you work and how you treat others.

338
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:26,380
Ms. Xi, you don't look well.

339
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,130
Are you okay?

340
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,810
I'm fine.

341
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,900
I've always wanted to ask you a question.

342
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,650
Since you and Nan Hua fell in love with each other,

343
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:38,620
has anything strange happened to you?

344
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,820
Or have you ever met any strange person?

345
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,170
Strange person?

346
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,180
No.

347
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,660
What's wrong?

348
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,170
It's a long story.

349
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,480
Actually, since my childhood, I've been having dreams

350
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,170
in which people tried to kill me.

351
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,030
And in those dreams, I was killed in different ways.

352
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,490
After I got to know Nan Hua recently,

353
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,340
these dreams became more and more vivid.

354
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,250
Yesterday,

355
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,810
when I got home after talking with Nan Hua,

356
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,860
I suddenly realized that all the events in my dreams were connected.

357
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,390
It's really unbelievable.

358
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,000
The events in those dreams

359
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,460
seemed to be what had happened in my previous lifetimes.

360
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,540
And in every previous lifetime of mine,

361
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,470
I was killed by the ancient people.

362
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:21,940
What do you mean?

363
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:26,980
Do you know

364
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,210
that the ancestors of modern people were so greedy

365
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:32,380
that they almost killed all the ancient people?

366
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,380
After that,

367
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,380
the ancient people made it a rule that they had to forbid themselves

368
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,930
from having anything to do with ordinary people

369
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,390
in case the same tragedy would happen again.

370
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,250
Killed them all?

371
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,330
Nan Hua once told me

372
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,370
that a long time ago,

373
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,050
there were wars between ancient people and ordinary people.

374
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,460
But he didn't mention

375
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,610
that rule.

376
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,500
What would happen

377
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,900
if an ancient person and an ordinary person

378
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:58,030
have something to do with each other?

379
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,610
If so, that ordinary person

380
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,420
will be killed by other ancient people.

381
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,220
Just like what happened in my previous lifetimes.

382
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,820
Didn't Nan Hua tell you about it?

383
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,980
He's never told me about it.

384
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:17,330
Nan Hua lost most of his memories.

385
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,060
He could remember something once in a while,

386
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,170
but those memories weren't very clear.

387
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,170
That makes sense.

388
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:23,860
What?

389
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,620
As a punishment,

390
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:26,860
Nan Hua's memories related to ordinary people

391
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,420
were all erased.

392
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,060
Most of his extraordinary energy would also be taken away

393
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,730
and then his body would be very weak and become transparent.

394
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,730
In the end, he would be forced to sleep for a very long time.

395
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:35,930
Become transparent?

396
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,030
It has never happened before.

397
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,940
Nan Hua said

398
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:42,940
he had never

399
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,580
met other ancient people before.

400
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,610
He even thought

401
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,270
he might be the last ancient person in the world.

402
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,620
Maybe you should talk with Nan Hua about this.

403
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,620
It may help him remember something.

404
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,020
But...

405
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,220
How about this?

406
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,340
Let me call him.

407
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,130
Ms. Xi, don't do that.

408
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,380
Thank you for telling me all these things.

409
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,410
But Nan Hua and I have just started to date.

410
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:05,970
I don't want him

411
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,780
to worry about something

412
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,180
that might never happen.

413
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,300
I don't want him to be too worried.

414
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,250
It is not easy

415
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:12,890
for him

416
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,500
to live a peaceful life.

417
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,340
Jin Xia, this is a serious thing.

418
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:19,770
Your safety comes first.

419
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,450
I'll think about how to tell him about it.

420
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,170
Don't worry, Ms. Xi.

421
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,410
If there's something bad that might happen,

422
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,740
I won't hide it from him.

423
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:32,860
Alright.

424
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,750
I respect your choice.

425
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:35,940
Go back to work.

426
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,400
I'll go downstairs later.

427
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,580
Thank you, Ms. Xi.

428
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,300
Go.

429
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,010
The timing is not right yet.

430
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,010
Okay.

431
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,500
Mr. Nan, you're indeed a genius in the field of architectural design.

432
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,630
I'm glad you like it.

433
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,530
Tell me if you have any ideas.

434
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,900
It's impeccable.

435
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,450
Mr. Li, to be honest,

436
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,540
I didn't expect

437
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,200
you to be so satisfied with it.

438
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,650
I thought my design

439
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,050
had too many traditional Chinese elements,

440
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,850
and was not in line with your company's style.

441
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,100
So I prepared a Plan B.

442
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,700
We can put aside my company's style first.

443
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:32,090
The unity between your design and the tone of Wangqi Town

444
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,410
is the most important thing.

445
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,780
I'll take your draft design back and discuss it with my colleagues.

446
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,700
Then I'll tell you our decision.

447
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,220
Okay.

448
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,370
If you need,

449
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:39,690
I can go with you

450
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,860
and explain my ideas to you and your colleagues.

451
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,300
There's no need for that.

452
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,020
I just want to know their opinions.

453
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,260
Your design has basically been approved.

454
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,390
It's been approved?

455
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,110
This is the deposit on the project.

456
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,670
[Cheque for Transfer]

457
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,590
200,000?

458
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,080
That's too much.

459
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,420
Your signature won't be printed on the document for the design project.

460
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,260
So it's some sort of compensation for it.

461
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,260
Please continue.

462
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,940
The balance payment will be made on time.

463
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,610
Thank you.

464
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,460
Mr. Nan, I have something else to do.

465
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,810
I should go now.

466
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,930
Okay, take care.

467
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,380
This is...

468
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,730
See you, Mr. Nan.

469
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,250
See you.

470
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,660
This is a petal of white cherry blossom.

471
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,730
Is it from him?

472
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,790
Zhang, proofread the design.

473
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,490
Okay.

474
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,160
Jin Xia, get me the stitched sleeves.

475
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:40,610
Jin Xia.

476
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,090
Ms. Xi.

477
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,330
You need to focus on your work.

478
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,740
If you can't,

479
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,600
you'd better put your work aside.

480
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,090
Sorry, Ms. Xi.

481
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,060
Thank you for your hard work, everyone.

482
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,740
Let's go eat first.

483
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,650
Take a break.

484
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,060
Okay.

485
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,970
You didn't sleep well, did you?

486
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,660
I'm sorry.

487
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,560
Jin Xia, get me my handbag.

488
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,560
It's on the table.

489
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:09,250
Okay.

490
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,880
Jin Xia.

491
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,330
Are you okay?

492
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:20,530
Jin Xia, are you okay?

493
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,130
Bai Bing.

494
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,330
Get me the medical box.

495
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:22,970
Okay.

496
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,710
Come on.

497
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,370
Let me see.

498
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,250
Are you okay?

499
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,620
I'm fine. I just bumped into it.

500
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,300
Reinforce its base.

501
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,500
You were too careless.

502
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,140
Okay.

503
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,730
When she dodged the spilled coffee the other day,

504
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,690
she was so quick.

505
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,540
Why is she so clumsy this time?

506
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,180
Yeah. Didn’t she use to practice gymnastics?

507
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:43,770
Yes.

508
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:46,570
Yes. She managed to dodge the coffee last time.

509
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,380
Jin Xia.

510
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:58,690
Are you sure you're okay?

511
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,050
I'm fine. Don't worry.

512
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:06,300
Nan Hua.

513
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,330
You came so fast. How did you do it?

514
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,380
I called you just 10 minutes ago.

515
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,050
I was too anxious.

516
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,550
So I used a special method.

517
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,130
Jin Xia, I'm sorry

518
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,970
for using extraordinary energy again

519
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:22,030
without asking for your permission.

520
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,100
It’s okay.

521
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:32,650
By the way, Ms. Xi.

522
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,580
You said on the phone that

523
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,410
someone was trying to hurt Jin Xia.

524
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,340
What's going on?

525
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,530
Jin Xia, you tell him about it.

526
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,100
That's it.

527
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:49,970
Nan Hua.

528
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,890
You don't remember those things at all?

529
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,490
You don't remember anything about the viscount

530
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:57,570
or how I died in my first lifetime?

531
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,580
I really don't remember

532
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,310
anything about the viscount.

533
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,800
But I do remember that a friend of mine

534
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,680
lost his or her life because of me.

535
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,560
Could it be a coincidence?

536
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,970
After all, dreams

537
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,340
can be interpreted scientifically.

538
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,730
Ms. Xi, your dreams

539
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:22,590
are not necessarily about what happened in your previous lifetimes.

540
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:24,690
It is better to believe something is real or true than to believe it is nonexistent or false.

541
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,950
I think we should take some precautions.

542
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,010
I'm fine.

543
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,330
Don't be too worried.

544
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,890
It hasn't happened yet.

545
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,970
When your body becomes transparent,

546
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,030
we'll begin to do something about it.

547
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,120
I'm sorry, Jin Xia.

548
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,580
I didn't tell you about it

549
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:53,570
because I didn't want you to be too worried.

550
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,860
Are you still mad at me?

551
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,820
No.

552
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:17,410
I'm just starting to be a little worried.

553
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,620
This morning,

554
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,420
when Ms. Xi mentioned it to me,

555
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,320
I thought those bad things wouldn't happen.

556
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,020
But now...

557
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,940
To be honest, I don't remember any of those things.

558
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,900
It's probably because not all of memories have come back.

559
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,290
I'm not sure.

560
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,610
But Ms. Xi has no reason to lie to us.

561
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,380
It won't do her any good.

562
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:44,890
You're right.

563
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:47,970
Nan Hua.

564
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,740
Can you promise me one thing?

565
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,450
What is it?

566
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,330
Promise me

567
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,090
no matter what happens in the future,

568
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,780
and no matter what you remember,

569
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,250
you'll tell me everything

570
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,980
and never hide anything from me.

571
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,850
I'm your girlfriend now.

572
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,710
As your girlfriend,

573
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,850
I think I need to

574
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,850
face all the difficulties with you.

575
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:18,090
If I am always the last one to know everything,

576
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,020
I'll be more flustered.

577
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,490
Okay, my girlfriend.

578
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,760
So what's the whole thing about you being transparent?

579
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,740
I think it happened last time because I was too far away from home

580
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,800
and I exhausted my spiritual energy.

581
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,400
I want to know the consequences,

582
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,340
not the reason.

583
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,490
If you can't get home in time

584
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,090
to absorb spiritual energy,

585
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,480
what will happen?

586
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,570
Maybe I will

587
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,700
disappear completely.

588
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,700
You mean your body will just vanish?

589
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,490
I'm not a ghost.

590
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,700
But

591
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,600
that's pretty much it.

592
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:16,700
The brake!

593
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,380
What's wrong?

594
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,500
The brake is not working.

595
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,490
Nan Hua, what should we do?

596
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:29,650
Nan Hua.

597
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:43,710
Fortunately, I watched My Love from the Star recently.

598
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,300
What's wrong?

599
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,610
Someone cut the brake line.

600
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,420
Someone cut it? How?

601
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,380
You're hurt.

602
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,380
Did I hurt you?

603
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,610
No, it's just a little cold.

604
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,940
Listen to me.

605
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,220
Don't get too busy in the following days.

606
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,900
Take care of your wound, okay?

607
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,690
Okay.

608
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,300
Also,

609
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,170
lie flat when you sleep.

610
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:49,790
Don't press your hand.

611
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:17,710
Speaking of sleeping,

612
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,560
I have a request.

613
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:21,780
What is it?

614
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,010
Can I sleep in your room tonight?

615
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,330
My room?

616
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,050
After I come back tonight,

617
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,699
let's try it again.

618
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,860
Try what?

619
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,900
Try getting you charged.

620
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:48,980
Why are you still in the mood to think about that thing?

621
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,909
It's inconvenient for you?

622
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,699
Not really.

623
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,730
It's a sudden request.

624
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,380
I need to get ready for it.

625
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,300
Get ready?

626
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,410
How?

627
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,490
I've prepared the bedding.

628
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:10,350
I can just carry it into your room.

629
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,980
So there will be two quilts?

630
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,930
Yes.

631
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,130
Is it that cold?

632
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,320
Are you going to sleep on the floor in my room?

633
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,540
Now

634
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,130
I can protect you 24-7.

635
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,260
What are you talking about?

636
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:41,730
Let's sleep.

637
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,690
We have to go to work together tomorrow.

638
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,380
Go to work together?

639
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,610
Yes.

640
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,420
The situation is quite special now.

641
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,570
I have to follow you closely.

642
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,770
But I'll be working.

643
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,390
If you are following me all the time,

644
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,450
how am I going to explain it to others?

645
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:06,100
Then I'll be invisible all the time.

646
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,370
You mean you'll be invisible for all day?

647
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:10,780
Our house is several dozen kilometers from the studio.

648
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,210
You'll exhaust your spiritual energy again.

649
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,930
Let's give it a try and see

650
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,340
if you can get me charged.

651
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,150
We can try it at home.

652
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,460
You'll be in danger if we try it somewhere else.

653
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,760
Now I'm at home and I have enough spiritual energy all the time.

654
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:37,170
I don't want to experience the pain caused by excessive spiritual energy.

655
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,380
I'd rather take a long walk

656
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,110
and use some spiritual energy.

657
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:41,600
But...

658
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,620
Let's give it a try tomorrow.

659
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,970
Okay, just tomorrow.

660
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,830
You work at the company tomorrow.

661
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,370
I'll go around and investigate

662
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,810
today's accident.

663
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,380
If it was done by other ancient people,

664
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,140
there must be some clues.

665
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:13,020
After all...

666
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,810
What?

667
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:18,310
There're many suspicious things about the accident.

668
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,490
Mom, cheers.

669
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,060
I had this caviar

670
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,260
brought back from Russia.

671
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,530
It's authentic.

672
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:45,410
Try it.

673
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,820
You seem to be in a good mood.

674
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:55,240
If you have time to these meaningless things,

675
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,410
why not think about

676
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:00,540
what you should do next?

677
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,660
I gave you three days and tomorrow is the last day.

678
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,490
Mom, this is the last time

679
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:09,220
that I am having a meal with you.

680
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,600
I’ve decided

681
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,760
not to see David ever again.

682
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,600
And I'll never contact him.

683
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,890
I'll disappear from your lives.

684
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,580
Really?

685
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,460
Yeah.

686
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,900
You've been boarding at my home since you were 19.

687
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,460
I've known you for so many years.

688
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,850
I know how smart you are.

689
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,450
But I also want you to know

690
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,580
that this is the last time

691
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,010
that I'm negotiating with you peacefully.

692
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,780
If you want to have a battle with me,

693
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,650
You have no chance of winning.

694
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:49,860
I know that very well.

695
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:51,460
So don't worry.

696
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,900
I'm being honest.

697
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:59,430
Have you really given up the idea of marrying David?

698
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,400
You are so good at weighing up the pros and cons.

699
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,430
You must know very well

700
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,910
the benefits you'll get from marrying him.

701
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:10,010
But don't worry.

702
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,490
I'd rather destroy him

703
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,390
than watch you two get married.

704
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,700
Yes.

705
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,300
I know very well

706
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,850
what kind of person you are.

707
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,880
Now I just want to solve the problem.

708
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,170
I don't want to make us both losers.

709
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,160
Okay.

710
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:28,700
If you can really do

711
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,900
what you've promised

712
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,380
and leave David and never see him again,

713
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,700
I’ll tell the fund company

714
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,080
not to make things difficult for you.

715
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,210
I appreciate that.

716
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,250
You've been coughing for days.

717
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,910
Did you not take the medicine?

718
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,130
None of your business.

719
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,010
You'd rather keep drinking

720
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,300
than take your medicine.

721
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,700
It's bad for your health.

722
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,600
Mom, you'd better take the medicine.

723
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,830
Your health is very important.

724
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:47,110
The right timing, the right place, and the right people

725
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,820
are all here.
