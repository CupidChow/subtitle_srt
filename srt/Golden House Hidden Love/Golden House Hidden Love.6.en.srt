[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,080
In the several thousand years of human history,

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,960
there have been many unsolved mysteries.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,880
Are the stories of Dayu controlling the flood and Nvwa mending the sky myths?

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,480
Why would the advancement of human civilization

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,680
surpass its current situations?

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,720
There are all kinds of speculations.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,680
But in fact, the truth

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,680
dates back to the ancient times.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,320
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,640
the highly developed

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,280
prehistoric civilizations once existed on Earth.

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,600
Back then, the ancient people

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,000
mastered the scientific civilization far more advanced than that in modern society.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,080
Their high-level genetic modification technology

16
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,200
even enabled them to develop

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,320
human potential to the greatest extent.

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,880
They could absorb the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth

19
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,740
to stay alive and even exert extraordinary energy.

20
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,640
However, a tragic doomsday disaster

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,320
made those human beings almost extinct at that time.

22
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:01,640
Countless lives

23
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,840
and brilliant civilizations were destroyed overnight.

24
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,880
Only a small number of ancient people

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,480
survived the doomsday

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,250
after escaping to the underground in time

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,720
and entering into a frozen hibernation state.

28
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,380
After that,

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,110
through tens of thousands of years of self-repair,

30
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,400
our Earth conceived new intelligent lives again,

31
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,660
namely, the ancestors of modern people.

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And the ancient people sleeping in the underground areas

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,400
woke up one after another

34
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,080
and returned to the land.

35
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,800
They saw

36
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,750
the new primitive humans who were still trying to make fire by drilling wood.

37
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:32,830
Out of good intentions,

38
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:33,950
they taught the younger generations

39
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,960
many technologies, such as farming, metallurgy,

40
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,720
construction, flood control, and precautions against natural disasters.

41
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,650
Many great civilization miracles

42
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,030
were the masterpieces made

43
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,759
by our ancestors with the help of ancient people.

44
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,680
At that time, the new human beings

45
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,680
[Fuxi Temple]

46
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,880
considered the ancient people with extraordinary energy as deities.

47
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,610
They built temples for them and worshipped them.

48
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,120
As the official historians of various countries exaggerated the stories about them,

49
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,640
many legendary ancient myths have been passed down till now.

50
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,160
In this way,

51
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,360
most ancient people around the world

52
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,280
fitted into the new world with the identities

53
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,440
of deities.

54
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,760
But there were also some low-profile ancient people

55
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,280
who chose to live in seclusion in deep mountains to escape from the mortal world.mortal world.

56
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,000
However,

57
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,240
people's worship towards the deities

58
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,320
also gradually generated fear and desires.

59
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,130
The rulers feared that the power of deities

60
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,760
would become a threat to their royal power.

61
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,310
But they were also greedy

62
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,040
for immortality and the extraordinary power.

63
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,700
Therefore,

64
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,640
they used various excuses

65
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,640
to start wars

66
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,770
against the deities from time to time.

67
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,750
The ancient people were outnumbered

68
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,240
and were no match for the huge armies in the end.

69
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,840
They almost became extinct.

70
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,520
Little did they know

71
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,880
that by imparting the knowledge of weapon forging to the new humans,

72
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,079
they unwittingly unleashed a disaster upon themselves.

73
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,760
Although the ancient people who lived in deep mountains

74
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,320
survived this disaster,

75
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,840
they were hunted by the rulers continuously.

76
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,160
They were even slandered

77
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,440
and considered as horrible mountain spirits or ferocious ghosts.

78
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,800
In the blink of an eye,

79
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,680
those who had been regarded as deities became devils that everyone wanted to kill.

80
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,160
As everything keeps changing in the world,

81
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,840
no one knows the existence of the ancient people anymore.

82
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,200
Only those anecdotes and peculiar stories about ghosts and monsters

83
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,290
have been passed down from generation to generation.

84
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,000
And the tiny minority of ancient people who have survived

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,680
are still secretly hiding

86
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,560
in those covert corners in the world till now.

87
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,960
Nan Hua, if you don't agree to be…

88
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,920
Gosh, this is so juicy.

89
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,930
I really didn't know Jin Xia was such a person.

90
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,200
What is it?

91
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,280
Is that Jin Xia?

92
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,010
Yes.

93
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,570
What are you looking at?

94
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,589
[12 missed calls from Jiang Xiaochuan]

95
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,560
I feel so dizzy.

96
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,920
What's wrong with that tree?

97
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,240
Why did it suddenly bloom?

98
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,720
I feel bad.

99
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,040
About last night,

100
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,050
I don't remember anything.

101
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,940
I can't remember anything whenever I drink.

102
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,320
I didn't do anything inappropriate last night, did I?

103
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,360
Impossible.

104
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,960
I'm so dignified.

105
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,540
I wouldn't have done anything weird.

106
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,720
Morning.

107
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,610
Morning.

108
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,880
You're watching old idol dramas so early in the morning?

109
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,920
Weren't you watching the family ethics dramas yesterday?

110
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,480
I just wanted to learn

111
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,680
how to get along with you modern people.

112
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,400
That's how you learn?

113
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,650
There's nothing else I can learn from.

114
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,590
Thank you for making breakfast for me again.

115
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,280
Thanks.

116
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,130
My pleasure.

117
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,200
This sachet is specially made by me.

118
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,490
It has been with me for many years.

119
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,840
It is refreshing

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,400
and stimulating to help get my memory back.

121
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,480
I don't want to die alone.

122
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,480
I want to get married, too.

123
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,200
Do you know how high the divorce rate is now?

124
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,800
And the rate of cheating?

125
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,080
I don't want my future kid to be like me:

126
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,200
having no parents,

127
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,040
being bullied,

128
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,240
and being laughed at.

129
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,080
Careful.

130
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,530
Thank goodness.

131
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
I just poured out my grievances.

132
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,200
It's not really ill-mannered.

133
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,240
Not really.

134
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,760
I didn't do anything else, did I?

135
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,520
Some people have been waiting for for thousands of years.

136
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,880
What about me?

137
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,800
I don't allow you to leave me.

138
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,640
Let's go back.

139
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,480
If we stay outside for too long,

140
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,400
I'll run out of the spiritual energy.

141
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,660
What are you afraid of?

142
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,440
I have the solution.

143
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,760
Jin Xia, what are you doing?

144
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,520
I'm recharging you.

145
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,600
How was it?

146
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,880
Did you feel it?

147
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920
No?

148
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,920
Then let's do it more.

149
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,560
Jin Xia, calm down.

150
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,740
There are so many people outside.

151
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,430
I'm very calm.

152
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,800
Do you ancient people

153
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,120
have a different dating culture

154
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,320
with modern people?

155
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,159
I guess not.

156
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,520
Really?

157
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,080
What is that?

158
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,590
It's too scary.

159
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,400
Do you remember everything?

160
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,600
Well,

161
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,960
I'm full.

162
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,300
Thank you for the food.

163
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,760
I'm going back to my room.

164
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,320
Okay, darling.

165
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,960
Darling…

166
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,920
What did you just call me?

167
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,160
Darling.

168
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,560
Darling?

169
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,360
Don't you remember everything?

170
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,920
Or is it just a part of it?

171
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,560
Are you telling me it was just a part?

172
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,320
I agreed to your pursuit yesterday.

173
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,080
Pursuit?

174
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,760
Don't talk nonsense.

175
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Don't spread rumors about me.

176
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,200
Show me the evidence.

177
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,840
Haven't you checked your Moments yet?

178
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,670
[Jin Xia]

179
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:58,850
[Jin Xia]

180
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,430
Nan Hua,

181
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,120
if you don't agree to be my boyfriend,

182
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,000
I'll jump into the sea.

183
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,080
I agree.

184
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,210
Don't be impulsive.

185
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:08,840
Really?

186
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,800
Guys, I have a boyfriend.

187
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,200
This is my boyfriend.

188
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,760
What do you think? Isn't he handsome?

189
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,440
Call me darling from now on.

190
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,880
D-Darling.

191
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,480
You don't like it?

192
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,840
You can also call me "Naughty Little Kiss"

193
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,440
or Fairy Baby.

194
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,200
Darling is better.

195
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,720
I, Jin Xia,

196
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,640
have a boyfriend from now on.

197
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,960
You are all still single!

198
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,570
[Jin Xia]

199
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,830
[Jin Xia]

200
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,240
Nan Hua.

201
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,600
Where are we?

202
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,360
We're home.

203
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,640
We're home.

204
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,120
Guys,

205
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,960
we're home.

206
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,600
I can't

207
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,430
livestream what is going to happen next.

208
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,610
My shoes got caught on you.

209
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,080
That's it. Bye.

210
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,780
[Jin Xia]

211
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,760
I'm dreaming, right?

212
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,120
No, no.

213
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,720
You said

214
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,560
the light would flash when you were emotional.

215
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,620
It's not flashing.

216
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,880
You forged it?

217
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,960
No, I've fixed the circuit.

218
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,620
That's why it's not flashing.

219
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,080
Why did you fix the circuit?

220
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,480
Because you were afraid of the flashing lights.

221
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,140
I don't want you to dislike me.

222
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,920
And I hope you will like me more.

223
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,200
Who wants to like you?

224
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,580
[Jin Xia]

225
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,560
Mom.

226
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,280
Is this man from our town?

227
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,600
Isn't that Nan?

228
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,520
The architect.

229
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,110
He's not from our town.

230
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,400
He's going out with Jin?

231
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,640
They've only known each other for a few days!

232
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,520
Mom, do you know him?

233
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,120
Of course I do.

234
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,920
He renovated our house.

235
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,000
I told you when you were in the school.

236
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,130
Have you forgotten?

237
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,720
[Jin Xia]

238
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,690
Why did she delete them?

239
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,640
I deleted them.

240
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,320
But I guess it's too late.

241
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:29,960
I'm sorry.

242
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,040
I drank too much yesterday.

243
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,080
Anyway, a gentleman should keep his promise.

244
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,920
Since I promised you yesterday,

245
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,600
today is

246
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,930
our first day of practicing to be a couple.

247
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,760
I don't have much experience,

248
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,820
but I'll do my best.

249
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,730
What are you talking about?

250
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,590
[Grandma]

251
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,590
[Reject] [Answer]

252
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,000
Grandma.

253
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,360
Hello, Grandma.

254
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,580
You sassy girl!

255
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,800
Why didn't you tell me

256
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,200
that you're in love?

257
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,560
How did you know?

258
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,820
Your childhood friend Xiang told me.

259
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,720
She also showed me the video on your Moments.

260
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,120
Grandma, it's not what you think.

261
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,390
I was drunk.

262
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,280
That was just my drunken gibberish.

263
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,810
That brat doesn't admit it?

264
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,720
Not really.

265
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,400
He's quite a man of his word.

266
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,510
That's it then.

267
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,480
Hurry up.

268
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,800
Bring him back and let me see him.

269
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,600
Grandma, I've been super busy lately.

270
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,370
I don't have time at all.

271
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,670
He's also super busy.

272
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,800
He doesn't have time at all, either.

273
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,360
Tell me quickly

274
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,280
what he does for a living,

275
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,480
how old he is,

276
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,970
what's his personality like,

277
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,120
and where he's from.

278
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,490
Grandma. Hello?

279
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,880
Grandma, the signal is bad.

280
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,750
The signal is bad, Grandma.

281
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,320
Hello?

282
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,640
Bring him back when you're free.

283
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,030
What?

284
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,520
Let's talk next time.

285
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,520
That's it. Bye.

286
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,320
I'm doomed.

287
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,640
What should I do?

288
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,280
Don't you want to introduce me to your grandma?

289
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,400
How can you take

290
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,680
the drunk talk seriously?

291
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,240
Who is it?

292
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,200
It's Ding.

293
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,390
Be invisible.

294
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,040
Coming.

295
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,400
Ding.

296
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,480
What is it?

297
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,640
Jin Xia.

298
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,090
I just want to ask you

299
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,360
who the man

300
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,620
in the videos that you posted on your Moments yesterday is?

301
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,910
What videos? What man?

302
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,970
The ones you posted last night.

303
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,320
That...

304
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,240
Naughty Little Kiss. Fairy Baby.

305
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,150
Ding, you're an auxiliary officer.

306
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,090
You need evidence before you talk.

307
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,440
I saw it.

308
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,890
My mom told me

309
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,640
Mr. Nan

310
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,360
renovated my house before.

311
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,200
He should be helping you renovate your house now.

312
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,880
Oh, him?

313
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,360
We don't know each other well.

314
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,200
No?

315
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,500
If you don't, will you…

316
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,560
Ding, let's get to the point.

317
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,160
What is it?

318
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:36,360
Actually,

319
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,480
he looks a lot like someone I've been looking for.

320
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,340
Someone you've been looking for?

321
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,320
Did he do something wrong?

322
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,200
No, no.

323
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,240
It's my personal matter.

324
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,840
Do you have his contact information?

325
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,300
I want to see him in person.

326
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,000
Contact information?

327
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,440
He's an artist.

328
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,750
He doesn't usually use a phone.

329
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,890
We always meet at the scheduled time.

330
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,040
Just like my mom said.

331
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,920
Did he tell you

332
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,520
when he would come next time?

333
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:06,800
Yes.

334
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,040
Next time…

335
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,240
Saturday!

336
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,000
What time?

337
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,800
What time?

338
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,319
2 p.m.

339
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,640
Okay, I got it.

340
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,560
Thank you, Jin Xia.

341
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,690
I'll leave you to it.

342
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,800
I'll come back next Saturday.

343
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,160
Okay.

344
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,480
Bye.

345
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:25,599
Bye.

346
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,920
Bye. Bye. Bye.

347
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,000
Nan Hua.

348
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,480
What's wrong?

349
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,920
Do you remember the young auxiliary officer

350
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,920
who came the day I called the police?

351
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,670
Do you know him?

352
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,240
He said you look a lot like someone he's been looking for.

353
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,370
Did you do anything wrong?

354
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,320
No.

355
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,640
I've been keeping a low profile.

356
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,200
Then why?

357
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,880
Could it be...

358
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,320
Could it be...

359
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,670
You've regained a lot of memories recently, right?

360
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,320
Are there any clues

361
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,040
about the person you're waiting for?

362
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,320
For example, what did that person look like?

363
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,800
Did he have any characteristics?

364
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,960
I remember

365
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,080
he should be this tall.

366
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,920
He should be 185 cm.

367
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,160
So tall?

368
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,680
Then I...

369
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,000
People change.

370
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:38,520
Fine.

371
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,150
Did he have any other characteristics

372
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,410
other than gigantism?

373
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,840
I remember he was a viscount.

374
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,880
A viscount?

375
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,290
Has there ever been a female viscount in history?

376
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,120
I don't know.

377
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,640
I think I know some

378
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,970
inconceivable secret.

379
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,200
Actually,

380
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,480
I don't remember whether it is a man or a woman.

381
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,680
But judging by the earrings she gave me,

382
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,840
I think it should be a woman.

383
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,280
Did she leave you any other items

384
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,360
other than earrings?

385
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,590
Who can it be at this hour?

386
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,890
Could it be that auxiliary officer again?

387
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,000
Be invisible.

388
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,800
Coming.

389
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,840
Surprise!

390
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,080
Xiaochuan, why are you here?

391
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,370
I'm here to celebrate for you.

392
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,400
Excuse me.

393
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,480
Wait for me.

394
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,720
Wine

395
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,960
is a really good thing sometimes, right?

396
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,680
How many times have I told you?

397
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,740
It was an accident.

398
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,000
Nan Hua said

399
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,470
he'd take responsibility.

400
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,880
Nan Hua is a man of his word.

401
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,460
There's no water. I'll get some water.

402
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,290
Thank you.

403
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,880
It's my pleasure.

404
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,520
Jiang Xiaochuan,

405
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,610
please stop messing around. Okay?

406
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,970
I'm not messing around.

407
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,160
This is such a good opportunity.

408
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,630
Grab the chance and date.

409
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,640
But I don't want to date.

410
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,360
Don't all the women in your family live a long life?

411
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,430
Your friends, like us,

412
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,880
might die any day.

413
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,800
By then…

414
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,560
A 100-year-old woman died tragically at home

415
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,360
and was not found for three whole months.

416
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,360
What do you think of this news title?

417
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,560
Not good.

418
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,920
Let's say I'll live a long life.

419
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,640
My husband will surely die before me, right?

420
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,760
When he suffers from incontinence,

421
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,520
I'll have to take care of him.

422
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,380
Think about it.

423
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,760
I can tell

424
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,320
Nan Hua will surely live longer than you.

425
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,050
You will be the one who suffer from incontinence.

426
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,520
But I don't want to date anyone.

427
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,910
Think about it.

428
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,640
I've bought a house.

429
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,200
It's good for me to die alone.

430
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,630
Everything has cracks.

431
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,040
The sun will shine into them.

432
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,880
No, it won't.

433
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,260
We're just roommates.

434
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,800
Then you have to call me darling from now on.

435
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,880
If you don't agree,

436
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,320
I'll jump down right now.

437
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,760
I was drunk.

438
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,760
Please let me off.

439
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,000
Okay.

440
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,160
Let me interview Ms. Jin Xia.

441
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,480
In the past, no matter how much you drank,

442
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,960
you've never made a fool of yourself.

443
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,600
Why?

444
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,520
Because you knew no matter how drunk you were,

445
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,680
no one would care.

446
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,040
So, no matter how much you drank,

447
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,720
you'd hold on subconsciously until you went home

448
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,270
and until the moment your door was closed.

449
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,070
But you lost control yesterday.

450
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,360
Why was that?

451
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,200
Why?

452
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,160
Because your defensive line is broken through.

453
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,520
My defensive line is broken through?

454
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,250
Impossible.

455
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,760
My defensive line is impossible to break through.

456
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:09,360
You've been quite idle lately.

457
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,560
Not me.

458
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,200
It's Nan Hua.

459
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:13,880
Nan Hua?

460
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,800
He's been watching TV lately.

461
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,720
He said he wanted to learn how modern people communicate.

462
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,760
I see.

463
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,960
He watches dramas

464
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,720
to learn how to date you.

465
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,560
He's so thoughtful.

466
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,800
What?

467
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,520
Jiang Xiaochuan!

468
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,840
What?

469
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,880
We'll know if we ask.

470
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,480
Nan Hua, Jin Xia wants me to ask you this.

471
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,400
Do you watch TV…

472
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,080
And waste too much time?

473
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,760
Why don't you go to work if you're free?

474
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:46,760
Yeah.

475
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,250
Work?

476
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:51,960
Right.

477
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,420
How can you pay rent if you don't work?

478
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,360
Actually, I've been thinking about work,

479
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,520
but I don't have your modern ID card.

480
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,450
It's a hassle to find a regular job.

481
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,580
I can only work part-time in town.

482
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,760
There's no rush.

483
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,780
Take your time.

484
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,440
Do you want to be a model?

485
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,760
Model?

486
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,360
Nan Hua?

487
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,200
Yes.

488
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,840
I have a photographer ex-boyfriend.

489
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,330
Ex-boyfriend.

490
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,640
He's doing well these two years.

491
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,320
He's mainly shooting luxury commercials.

492
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,770
Recently, he opened a studio.

493
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,160
He's looking for a model.

494
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,440
The only requirement is that the model has to be innocent.

495
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,970
I think you meet that requirement perfectly.

496
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,680
No.

497
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,640
Aren't top photographers all taking photos of superstars?

498
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,240
Is Nan Hua possible?

499
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,330
How do you know if it works without trying?

500
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,320
It's like love.

501
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,200
How do you know if it's Mr. Right if you don't try?

502
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,600
Let me take some photos and send them to him.

503
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,000
But…

504
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,630
is it too much for Nan Hua?

505
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,880
He has no ID card.

506
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,080
Nor can he leave home.

507
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,760
There's not much room to choose.

508
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,800
Don't be picky.

509
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Can he do it?

510
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,160
I'd like to try.

511
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,390
Arranged.

512
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,680
OK. One more.

513
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,690
Costume artist.

514
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,880
I didn't expect he was really chosen.

515
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,720
Let's say

516
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,320
your style is quite unique.

517
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,120
Jiang Xiaochuan,

518
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,200
you didn't tell me

519
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,400
the shooting location was in my studio.

520
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,370
Everyone here has seen my Moments.

521
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,800
Relax. It's not that serious.

522
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,760
Do you want some coffee,

523
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,390
Naughty Little Kiss?

524
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,160
No, thanks.

525
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,000
See?

526
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,230
I have to explain.

527
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,240
I was just drunk.

528
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,240
I was just drunk.

529
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,440
You were like that in the videos.

530
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,960
Everyone knows you were drunk.

531
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,020
No need to explain.

532
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,240
Besides...

533
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,040
Besides what?

534
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,280
Besides, Nan Hua is so handsome.

535
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,000
Everyone is envious.

536
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,370
You really don't feel that you're enjoying it at all?

537
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,120
But we're not really together.

538
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,080
Nan Hua has agreed

539
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,040
to be with you.

540
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,040
He's a man of his word.

541
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,930
What's there to hesitate over?

542
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,050
A couple should be together

543
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,560
because of love.

544
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,520
How can it be because I was drunk?

545
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,980
You're just too stubborn to admit it.

546
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,760
Well,

547
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,800
Fairy Baby.

548
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,080
Yes.

549
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,130
Go and help your boyfriend get changed.

550
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,400
Go.

551
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:16,890
Jiang Xiaochuan!

552
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,360
Hello, Ma'am.

553
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,490
I'm here to help the model get changed.

554
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,350
Wear this for the next scene. Thanks.

555
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,640
Just this?

556
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,250
Yes, is there a problem?

557
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,160
No, thank you.

558
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,680
Nan Hua.

559
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,120
Jin Xia, why are you here?

560
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,000
They asked me to help.

561
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,920
Oh, right, this is your next outfit.

562
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,050
Only this?

563
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,850
Isn't there a shirt?

564
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,290
But our first rule is

565
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,880
that I can't simply show my naked upper body.

566
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,640
There are so many girls here.

567
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,600
It's rude.

568
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,680
Right.

569
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,440
Then...

570
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,800
I'm sorry. I can't accept it now.

571
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,480
Okay, I'll talk to them for you.

572
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,630
Excuse me. Thank you.

573
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,740
Mr. Photographer.

574
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,320
Well,

575
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,120
isn't this the first time that Nan Hua works as a model?

576
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,560
He can't accept only wearing this pair of trunks.

577
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,960
Is it possible to add a shirt

578
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,720
or a vest?

579
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,090
How can you wear a shirt while shooting a swimming trunks scene?

580
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:03,200
There are too many girls watching.

581
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,360
He's shy.

582
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,560
Oh, the girlfriend is jealous.

583
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,560
You don't want so many people to watch your boyfriend?

584
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,090
I have no objections.

585
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,250
It's mainly his reason...

586
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,000
Okay.

587
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,840
All the girls, please go out.

588
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,970
The model needs to shoot for swimwear.

589
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:20,920
Let's go.

590
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,840
Thank you.

591
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,440
Jin Xia.

592
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,080
You have to stay.

593
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,400
Why?

594
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,040
Aren't you the model's girlfriend?

595
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,440
We need someone to keep an eye on the makeup.

596
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,120
He's really handsome.

597
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,680
I'm leaving. Bye.

598
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,400
Bye.

599
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,640
Jin Xia.

600
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,850
You're done?

601
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,080
Where is Xiaochuan?

602
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,610
She has a livestream tonight. She had to leave early.

603
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,080
Here.

604
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,050
The repayment and rent for next month.

605
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,040
So much?

606
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,560
Yeah, I was also a little surprised.

607
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,840
The photographer said Xiaochuan introduced me here,

608
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,330
so he can't treat his acquaintances shabbily.

609
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:05,080
But we still have a long way to pay off the loan.

610
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,810
There's no rush.

611
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,800
We have plenty of time ahead.

612
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,520
Actually, there is a rush.

613
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,650
He submits the money as soon as he gets it.

614
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,840
I'm so jealous.

615
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,600
Yes.

616
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,560
Bye.

617
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,200
Bye.

618
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,480
Let's go back home, too.

619
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,410
What do you think about your job as a model?

620
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,080
Pretty good.

621
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,840
The photographer said he'll find me again.

622
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,610
I heard that your photos

623
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:56,210
will be used as the cover of a fashion magazine.

624
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,840
I'm a little worried.

625
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,840
About what?

626
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,860
I'm worried that your identity will be exposed.

627
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,130
After all, your  appearance is quite eye-catching.

628
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,920
You have no identity.

629
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,840
How would you explain

630
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,320
if your identity is exposed?

631
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,930
Don't get caught for research.

632
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,530
I'm not worried about that.

633
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:23,860
The most important thing is to earn money to help you repay the loan.

634
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,200
It's okay for you.

635
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,000
If others find out

636
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,160
there is an ancient man in my house,

637
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,080
the price of Taiping will plunge.

638
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,840
You're right.

639
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,520
Well,

640
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,890
I'll take one last shot.

641
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,720
Okay?

642
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,560
You wanna do it again?

643
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,250
Did you promise the photographer?

644
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:51,520
No.

645
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,490
The day I sent you the design draft,

646
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,640
I heard your teacher say

647
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,500
she would choose the best student

648
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,520
to design a whole set of wedding clothes

649
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,050
and display them on the international show.

650
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,200
Are you...

651
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,800
I think

652
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,400
if I must terminate my job as a model,

653
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,400
I hope I can finish it by wearing the clothes you designed.

654
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,360
You said it. She will choose the best student.

655
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,720
You overestimate me.

656
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,710
I'm sure you'll be selected.

657
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,780
You are the one who designed the meteor-chip earrings.

658
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,000
Okay.

659
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,760
I'll think about it

660
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,160
and see if I'll give you this chance.

661
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,530
We're home. Be invisible now

662
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,360
so that you won't get caught by the CCTV.

663
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:45,960
Okay.

664
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,880
I'm done.

665
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,800
I can still see you.

666
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,040
I chose to let you see me.

667
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,200
Have you forgotten?

668
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,610
The night you just moved in,

669
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,440
it was also like this.

670
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,080
The two police officers couldn't see me,

671
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,000
but you could.

672
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,080
Right.

673
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,360
So you can not only be invisible,

674
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,490
but you can also choose who can see you.

675
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,880
Is this the truth of the so-called yin-yang eyes?

676
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,160
Maybe.

677
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,200
I can see you now.

678
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,200
Can I feel you?

679
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:21,910
Before, my hand

680
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,360
went right through your body.

681
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,400
It was scary.

682
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,280
I can decide it, too.

683
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,280
Really?

684
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,800
Really!

685
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,280
Sweetie!

686
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,680
Grandma?

687
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,680
Grandma!

688
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:41,760
Come here.

689
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,360
Grandma.

690
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,230
Grandma, why are you here?

691
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,480
You said you were too busy to leave,

692
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,880
so I came to see you.

693
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,720
Grandma, did you come by car?

694
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,480
Are you tired?

695
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,680
I came by car. I didn't need to walk.

696
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:56,960
I'm not tired.

697
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,450
Look what I brought you.

698
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,880
It's all your favorite food.

699
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:05,290
Grandma, isn't it hard for you

700
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:06,550
to bring so much stuff?

701
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,639
I can do it.

702
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,280
Hurry up. Go with your boyfriend.

703
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,050
Let's go in and have a taste.

704
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,239
What boyfriend?

705
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,320
Isn't that your boyfriend?

706
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,840
You can see him?

707
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,360
He's such a tall man, standing there.

708
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,320
How can I not see him?

709
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,080
My eyes are fine.

710
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,000
Indeed.

711
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,250
Hello, Grandma.

712
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,360
Hello.

713
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:32,960
Give it to me.

714
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,280
Grandma, let's go inside.

715
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:35,719
Okay.

716
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,400
Let me do it.

717
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,400
Grandma.

718
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,280
How is it? Do you like it?

719
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,139
Not bad, right?

720
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,560
This is the living room.

721
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,730
That is my room.

722
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,960
We just passed

723
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,040
the tea room.

724
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:54,830
There's also a guest room.

725
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:55,719
Over there?

726
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:56,889
Yes, there.

727
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,520
Grandma, take a rest here.

728
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,240
Nan Hua and I will make you a cup of tea.

729
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,400
Just make it casual.

730
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,960
Grandma is not that fussy.

731
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,600
Okay.

732
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,560
Wait a minute.

733
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,160
Okay.

734
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,610
Didn't you say that you're only visible to me?

735
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,300
Why can my grandma see you?

736
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,770
I'm not sure why.

737
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,200
But sometimes,

738
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,000
my invisibility does not work on a specific group.

739
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,000
Sometimes...

740
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,640
babies, children, the elders,

741
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,920
and some intelligent animals

742
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,080
can see me.

743
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,130
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

744
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,840
Because I didn't want you to be scared.

745
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,480
Everyone would be scared.

746
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,200
What's the difference between you and a ghost?

747
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,520
Young man, what's your name?

748
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,330
My name is Nan Hua, Grandma.

749
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,600
Nan.

750
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,560
Are you two living together?

751
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,840
No, Grandma.

752
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,340
Nan Hua is here to help me renovate the house.

753
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,290
It's a temporary thing.

754
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,960
He lives in the guest room.

755
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,090
Renovate the house…

756
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,480
Are you an interior decoration designer?

757
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,480
No, I'm an architect.

758
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,800
An architect. It's good.

759
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,910
Speaking of houses,

760
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:24,880
Sweetie,

761
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,360
you're too impulsive.

762
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,360
How long will it take you

763
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,950
to repay the house loan?

764
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,900
It's such a heavy burden that it'll crumble you.

765
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,120
Grandma,

766
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,640
I'm not that easy to crumble.

767
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,000
Let me help you.

768
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,040
Although my ability is limited,

769
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,590
at least I can share some of your burden.

770
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,160
No need. I can do it myself.

771
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,160
Right, Nan Hua?

772
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,650
Don't worry, Grandma.

773
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,510
I'll help Jin Xia pay off the loan.

774
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,620
Grandma, it's not what you think.

775
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,700
Then whose name is on the Property Ownership Certificate?

776
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,720
Jin Xia's.

777
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,030
Well,

778
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,370
Grandma hasn't eaten yet.

779
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:12,040
Nan Hua, would you please cook dinner?

780
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,800
No problem.

781
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,760
Thank you.

782
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,760
Does he always cook?

783
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,000
Who does the housework?

784
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,910
He does more housework than me.

785
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,100
That's great.

786
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,070
I'm relieved.

787
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,960
You're not pregnant, are you?

788
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,040
No, Grandma.

789
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,580
We haven't known each other for long.

790
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,200
Don't be nervous.

791
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,080
It doesn't matter, even if you are.

792
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,590
Times have changed.

793
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,040
I understand.

794
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,110
No, Grandma.

795
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,890
You've watched too many dramas.

796
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:58,360
I...

797
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,000
Who is it? Let me open the door.

798
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,880
Well...

799
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,560
Ding, why are you here?

800
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,350
I saw you coming back.

801
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,200
My mom cooked a lot of ribs today.

802
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,120
She asked me to bring you some.

803
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,810
Thank you.

804
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,920
I'll send it back after we finish eating.

805
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,190
It's hot. Let me do it.

806
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:21,770
It's not hot.

807
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:22,600
Ding is here.

808
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:23,670
Grandma.

809
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,280
Grandma, do you know Ding?

810
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,640
Of course I do.

811
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,120
When I'm waiting for you,

812
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,990
Ding kept me company and chatted with me.

813
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:33,250
He even told me all about your boyfriend.

814
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,520
Oh, right, her boyfriend is cooking.

815
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,290
Let's eat together.

816
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,800
Jin Xia.

817
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,480
Didn't you say your boyfriend

818
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,210
wouldn't come until next week?

819
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,720
I got it wrong.

820
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,560
I often stay up late.

821
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,840
I do have a bad memory.

822
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,880
Sweetie.

823
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,440
Why are you so rude?

824
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,600
He's here to deliver the ribs.

825
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,120
Let him in.

826
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,120
Grandma, Ding is usually very busy.

827
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,200
Let's not stop the public servant from working.

828
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,560
I'm on leave today.

829
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,280
My house is a mess.

830
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,400
I can help you clean.

831
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,600
No, my grandma...

832
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,520
Sweetie, go away.

833
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:06,680
Sweetie.

834
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,240
I really like young people.

835
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,680
Ding, come in.

836
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,730
Here, Ding.

837
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,400
Grandma.

838
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,160
Be careful.

839
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:13,760
Okay.

840
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:14,910
Don't get burned.

841
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,400
I...

842
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,710
Oh no.
