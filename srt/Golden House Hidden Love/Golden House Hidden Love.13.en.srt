[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,140
In the several thousand years of human history,

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,030
there have been many unsolved mysteries.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,940
Are the stories of Dayu controlling the flood and Nvwa mending the sky myths?

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,550
Why would the advancement of human civilization

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,750
surpass its current situations?

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,790
There are all kinds of speculations.

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,750
But in fact, the truth

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,750
dates back to the ancient times.

10
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,380
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,710
the highly developed

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,350
prehistoric civilizations once existed on Earth.

13
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,670
Back then, the ancient people

14
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,070
mastered the scientific civilization far more advanced than that in modern society.

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,150
Their high-level genetic modification technology

16
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,270
even enabled them to develop

17
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,380
human potential to the greatest extent.

18
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,940
They could absorb the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth

19
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,800
to stay alive and even exert extraordinary energy.

20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,710
However, a tragic doomsday disaster

21
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,380
made those human beings almost extinct at that time.

22
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:01,700
Countless lives

23
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,900
and brilliant civilizations were destroyed overnight.

24
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,950
Only a small number of ancient people

25
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,550
survived the doomsday

26
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,320
after escaping to the underground in time

27
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,789
and entering into a frozen hibernation state.

28
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:14,450
After that,

29
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,190
through tens of thousands of years of self-repair,

30
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,470
our Earth conceived new intelligent lives again,

31
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,730
namely, the ancestors of modern people.

32
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,070
And the ancient people sleeping in the underground areas

33
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,470
woke up one after another

34
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,150
and returned to the land.

35
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:28,860
They saw

36
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,820
the new primitive humans who were still trying to make fire by drilling wood.

37
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,910
Out of good intentions,

38
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,020
they taught the younger generations

39
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,020
many technologies, such as farming, metallurgy,

40
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,780
construction, flood control, and precautions against natural disasters.

41
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,710
Many great civilization miracles

42
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,110
were the masterpieces made

43
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,840
by our ancestors with the help of ancient people.

44
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:48,750
At that time, the new human beings

45
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,870
[Fuxi Temple]

46
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,950
considered the ancient people with extraordinary energy as deities.

47
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,680
They built temples for them and worshipped them.

48
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,190
As the official historians of various countries exaggerated the stories about them,

49
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,710
many legendary ancient myths have been passed down till now.

50
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,220
In this way,

51
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,420
most ancient people around the world

52
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,350
fitted into the new world with the identities

53
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,500
of deities.

54
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:11,830
But there were also some low-profile ancient people

55
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:16,290
who chose to live in seclusion in deep mountains to escape from the mortal world.

56
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,060
However,

57
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,310
people's worship towards the deities

58
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,390
also gradually generated fear and desires.

59
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,190
The rulers feared that the power of deities

60
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,820
would become a threat to their royal power.

61
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,380
But they were also greedy

62
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,110
for immortality and the extraordinary power.

63
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,770
Therefore,

64
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,700
they used various excuses

65
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,710
to start wars

66
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,840
against the deities from time to time.

67
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,829
The ancient people were outnumbered

68
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,310
and were no match for the huge armies in the end.

69
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,910
They almost became extinct.

70
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,579
Little did they know

71
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:48,950
that by imparting the knowledge of weapon forging to the new humans,

72
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,150
they unwittingly unleashed a disaster upon themselves.

73
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,820
Although the ancient people who lived in deep mountains

74
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,390
survived this disaster,

75
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,900
they were hunted by the rulers continuously.

76
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,220
They were even slandered

77
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,500
and considered as horrible mountain spirits or ferocious ghosts.

78
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,870
In the blink of an eye,

79
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,740
those who had been regarded as deities became devils that everyone wanted to kill.

80
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,220
As everything keeps changing in the world,

81
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,910
no one knows the existence of the ancient people anymore.

82
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,260
Only those anecdotes and peculiar stories about ghosts and monsters

83
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,350
have been passed down from generation to generation.

84
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,070
And the tiny minority of ancient people who have survived

85
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,750
are still secretly hiding

86
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,620
in those covert corners in the world till now.

87
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,820
I'm here today

88
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,280
to tell you something.

89
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,870
The earrings I gave you

90
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,210
are not mine.

91
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,660
Back then, someone gave me this pair of earrings

92
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,329
and told me

93
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,620
with them as the token, I can get help from an immortal

94
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,940
to enjoy a lifetime of wealth and honor.

95
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,760
That person guided me here to look for you.

96
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,510
Who was it?

97
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,230
A young lady.

98
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,440
What did she look like?

99
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,630
She has a high nose bridge and phoenix eyes,

100
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,010
showing an elegant and noble style.

101
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,960
It's obvious that she's not an ordinary woman.

102
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,040
All these years,

103
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:19,870
I've been paying attention to noble relatives and their family members.

104
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,400
But I have never found out where she came from.

105
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,550
Her hairpin was very eye-catching.

106
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,750
It was a withe

107
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,550
with five or six snow-white cherry blossoms.

108
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,470
Is she... your old friend?

109
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,270
She told you there was an immortal in the mountain.

110
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,200
So you just came?

111
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,010
I didn't believe her at first.

112
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,430
But His Majesty was in trouble.

113
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,990
So I came here to try my luck.

114
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,990
I didn't expect you

115
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,650
to take me as the reincarnation of the viscount.

116
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,000
Why didn't you tell me directly back then?

117
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,310
I was worried

118
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,030
maybe you wouldn't help me

119
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,950
if you knew

120
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,670
I'm not the one you've been waiting for.

121
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,140
Leave.

122
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,350
We don't need to see each other anymore.

123
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,510
I made a decision when I came.

124
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,270
I won't bother you again.

125
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,070
However,

126
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,270
all these years,

127
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,159
I've been looking for the viscount for you.

128
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,909
I want to make it up to you.

129
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,310
Do you remember this?

130
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,430
I left this for the viscount.

131
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,390
Where did you find this?

132
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,000
The place where the viscount finally appeared

133
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,160
is not far from here.

134
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,560
There's a map marked with the direction in the silk bag.

135
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,890
You can go there to take a look personally.

136
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,620
Nan Hua,

137
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,570
there is no reincarnation in this world.

138
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:44,190
I advise you not to wait any longer.

139
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,610
With the help of the silk bag, I found the viscount's tomb.

140
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,940
It turned out the location of your hometown, Globefish Town,

141
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,690
is the location of the viscount's hometown,

142
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,690
the capital of the ancient country.

143
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,580
Later, I found out due to the court struggle,

144
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,550
the viscount was framed by his younger sister

145
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,590
and was put in prison.

146
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,480
The dead can't be brought back to life.

147
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,080
There was nothing I could do.

148
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,870
I could only build an ancestral hall for him to mourn him.

149
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,250
[Memorial Tablet of Li Chuchen]

150
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,550
[Memorial Tablet of Li Chuchen]

151
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,230
In the past 1,000 years,

152
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,350
every once in a while, I would be there to mourn him

153
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,480
and do some renovation work by the way.

154
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,760
Due to the growing shortage of spiritual energy,

155
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,560
I began to intermittently enter a state of sleep.

156
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,750
The ancestral hall was destroyed during my sleep.

157
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,870
After that,

158
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,480
I lost my memories.

159
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,990
So I forgot these things.

160
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,150
Wait.

161
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,350
You said you built this ancestral hall

162
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,549
2,000 years ago.

163
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,220
Does this mean...

164
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,539
Yes.

165
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,910
The viscount passed away over 2,000 years ago.

166
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,350
So... it's his reincarnation you've been waiting for?

167
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,240
Scientifically speaking,

168
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,440
there is no reincarnation in the world.

169
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,790
Then why have you been waiting?

170
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,280
Or is it the same as Yanhai's situation?

171
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,550
The person you've been waiting for is actually his descendant?

172
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,750
I'm not sure.

173
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,190
After all, there are still a lot of things I haven't remembered.

174
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,190
What a pity.

175
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,870
What?

176
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,020
It's a pity that the message in the voice recording marble has been deleted.

177
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,160
The ancestral hall was demolished too.

178
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,760
All the clues have been lost.

179
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,080
Speaking of this,

180
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,650
can the message in the voice recording marble

181
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,780
be recovered

182
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,790
like that in a formatted hard disk?

183
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,580
Looks like you ancient people's technology

184
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,780
is not that advanced.

185
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,670
The message wasn't just deleted.

186
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,000
I destroyed it myself.

187
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,470
What do you mean?

188
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,990
I destroyed the message myself.

189
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,470
As for the reason...

190
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,170
You still don't remember?

191
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,010
No.

192
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,520
It's okay.

193
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,520
You still have a lot of time.

194
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,440
You'll remember everything... eventually.

195
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,960
Let's pack up and go home.

196
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,660
It's already at this hour.

197
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,120
The taxi I booked online should be here soon.

198
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,540
Okay.

199
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,910
Are you taking these... with you?

200
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,320
These?

201
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,360
[Jin Xia]

202
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,360
[You presented an outstanding work in the City Cultural Book Exhibition. This award is presented to you as encouragement]

203
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,030
They are unwanted.

204
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,370
Let me help you then.

205
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,780
What are these?

206
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,430
They look useful.

207
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,630
Why are you throwing them away?

208
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,330
They are all from my childhood.

209
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,430
They are useless.

210
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,420
It's just...

211
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,690
my grandma was reluctant to throw them away.

212
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,230
What about this picture album?

213
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,720
Did you make the cover?

214
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,430
It's very cute.

215
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,030
Cute?

216
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,150
It's so ugly.

217
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,950
[Jin Xia]

218
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,720
I think I drew this when I was five or six.

219
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,030
I didn't even know how to hold the paintbrush at that time.

220
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,270
These are daylilies

221
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,500
my grandma planted in the yard when I was little.

222
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,870
They attracted

223
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,930
a lot of little butterflies and bees.

224
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,540
Then, the neighbor's dog dug them out.

225
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,910
And I dug them with the dog like a fool.

226
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,230
My grandma was so angry

227
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,520
that she chased after the dog in the yard.

228
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,680
I think this picture depicts me falling down.

229
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,620
Why was I crying so hard?

230
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,070
This is me and Grandma enjoying the moon

231
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,600
on the Mid-Autumn Festival when I was little.

232
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,570
It was my first time eating a mooncake with the lotus seed paste with yolk stuffing.

233
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,830
It was very expensive.

234
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,700
Grandma... only bought one.

235
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,360
I ate all of it.

236
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,100
I didn't leave any for her.

237
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,510
I planned

238
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,150
to take Grandma to my new house

239
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,880
to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival this year.

240
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:56,630
Jin Xia,

241
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,480
do you know the difference between the moon in ancient times

242
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,080
and the moon in modern times?

243
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,000
Does the moon change?

244
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:09,150
Life goes on endlessly generation after generation,

245
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,910
but the moon above the river looks the same year after year. Right?

246
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,370
The distance will change.

247
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,010
Since the birth of the solar system,

248
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,430
the moon has been orbiting Earth

249
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,990
for 4.6 billion years.

250
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,120
Actually, every year,

251
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,170
the moon drifts away from Earth

252
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,720
at a rate of 3.8cm.

253
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,690
The length looks short.

254
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,890
But time is the cruellest.

255
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,370
One day,

256
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,180
the moon will be far away from Earth.

257
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,310
If that's the case,

258
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,200
people in the future can't see the moon anymore, right?

259
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,130
That's not true.

260
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,830
Although the moon

261
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,700
will look very small by that time,

262
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,590
it won't escape Earth's gravitational field.

263
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,950
The relationship between the moon and Earth

264
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,720
is like a contract.

265
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,540
Once a promise is made,

266
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,740
they will always be bound to each other.

267
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,120
In the long river of time,

268
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:12,120
they may gradually drift away

269
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,160
for many reasons,

270
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,730
but they can never abandon each other.

271
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,300
Just like... you and the viscount.

272
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,870
Yes.

273
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,190
Since I promised to wait,

274
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,630
I won't break my promise.

275
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,610
If...

276
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,030
If I am lucky enough

277
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,240
to be the viscount you've been waiting for,

278
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,120
maybe I'll tell you

279
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,610
not to wait for me anymore.

280
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:42,950
Why?

281
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,810
I don't want you to live in the past

282
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,710
or in a world that only has me in it.

283
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,730
The world is so vast.

284
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,810
But for me,

285
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,520
you've stayed at the same place for 1,000 years.

286
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,610
This is so cruel.

287
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,140
Instead of living for me,

288
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,010
I'd rather you live for yourself.

289
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,990
Moon, you're free.

290
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,370
Jin Xia.

291
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,070
I hope all of us can welcome a new life.

292
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,580
The taxi I booked online is here.

293
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,310
I was so absorbed in chatting with you that I forgot about it.

294
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,040
Hurry. Let's pack up and leave.

295
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,570
Okay.

296
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,770
Why are you standing there? Let's go.

297
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:48,860
Let's go.

298
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,080
Let's go home.

299
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,300
Who's singing?

300
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,060
My brother is back.

301
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,750
I didn't expect him to be a man of his word.

302
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:32,510

303
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,990

304
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,230
I'm done.

305
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,760
Okay, it's my turn.

306
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:43,310
Nan Hua.

307
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,420
Well...

308
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,510
from now on, you don't need to sing

309
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,110
while I'm taking a shower.

310
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,630
Why? Did it sound bad?

311
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,700
No, it sounded nice.

312
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,070
I mean

313
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,960
you don't need to do it specially while I'm taking a shower.

314
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,910
Aren't you worried that I'll...

315
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,150
Anyway...

316
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,110
while I'm taking a shower in the future,

317
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,150
you can do whatever you want.

318
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,210
Wait.

319
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,070
Where do you want to go at this hour?

320
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,750
You need to go to work tomorrow morning.

321
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:06,550
Mom,

322
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,230
I'm going to Jin Xia's place.

323
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,300
I'll be back soon.

324
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,690
It won't affect my work tomorrow.

325
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:11,850
Come on.

326
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,160
I've been keeping an eye on you.

327
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,210
You asked for a few days of leave without telling me.

328
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,150
Your leader has already told me.

329
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,130
Do you still want this job or not?

330
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,640
This internship opportunity is quite rare.

331
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,290
Don't mess it up.

332
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,860
Mom, I have something important to do.

333
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,870
Jin Xia's grandmother passed away.

334
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,070
I need to help.

335
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,420
Her grandma passed away. What does it have to do with you?

336
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,240
She has a boyfriend to help her.

337
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,550
Tell me honestly.

338
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,470
Do you like Jin?

339
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,770
How is that possible?

340
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,090
No.

341
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,400
No?

342
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,330
Then why do you go to her frequently?

343
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,390
That's because...

344
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:57,380
How should I explain this to you?

345
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,630
Ding Yanhai,

346
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,560
I'm warning you.

347
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,590
Don't do anything stupid

348
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,990
like stealing someone else's girlfriend.

349
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,380
Mom, I've never thought about this.

350
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,590
Since you've never thought about this,

351
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,850
don't go to her place so frequently.

352
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,510
Anyway, you are not allowed to go out tonight.

353
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,170
Go back to your room and sleep.

354
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,670
Go.

355
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,680
Go back to sleep. Go.

356
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,600
It's all Jin Xia's fault.

357
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,350
What is this?

358
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,870
Xiaochuan's access card.

359
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,980
[Chuchen's Livestreaming Studio]

360
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,840
Xiaochuan, take a rest first.

361
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,500
I'm going to get you some food.

362
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,080
Chuchen's Livestreaming Studio?

363
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,370
Not just that.

364
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,600
Qingshi Group has decided

365
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,230
to fully develop Wangqi Town.

366
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,640
Our president wants

367
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,110
to build Wangqi Town

368
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,490
into a world-class tourist attraction.

369
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,470
Jin Xia,

370
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,420
it's time to brace yourself up

371
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,680
and focus on your work.

372
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,920
This must be destined.

373
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,900
Have a good dream.

374
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:23,870
Good night.

375
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,340
Grandma, don't worry.

376
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,120
I will be happy.

377
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,730
May I ask if you are Mr. Nan Hua?

378
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,280
A young lady asked me to give this to you.

379
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,620
She said she's going to die soon.

380
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,140
Please save her.

381
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:17,900
Could it be...

382
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,010
Please come in.

383
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:46,920
Ms. Xi.

384
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,590
Jin Xia, you are back.

385
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,720
Yes, I'm back to work.

386
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,540
I want to apologize to you.

387
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,340
Sit.

388
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,110
I'm sorry, Ms. Xi.

389
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,710
I asked for over a week of leave

390
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,250
because of what happened to my Grandma.

391
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,830
And I asked for a leave when the show was about to open

392
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,360
and everyone was very busy.

393
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,030
I will do my best.

394
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:13,750
I will work overtime

395
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,680
to make up for the unfinished work.

396
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,290
You have a good attitude.

397
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,210
Your grandma died. I understand.

398
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,570
Everyone has a family.

399
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,680
Just make up for the unfinished work.

400
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,560
Thank you. I'm going back to work.

401
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,240
Right. Jin Xia.

402
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,420
Anything else, Ms. Xi?

403
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,020
I've seen the accessory design drafts

404
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,970
you submitted to me.

405
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,030
They are very good.

406
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,470
Where did you get the inspiration?

407
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,370
I got the inspiration...

408
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,550
from my room...

409
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,380
my boyfriend.

410
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,120
The model last time?

411
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,730
He gave me a lot of advice.

412
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:47,610
Good.

413
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,830
You got the opportunity.

414
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:50,120
And you have a boyfriend to give you inspiration.

415
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,780
Now you just need my approval.

416
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,670
What do you mean?

417
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,630
Nothing. You'll know later.

418
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,590
Get back to work.

419
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,590
Okay.

420
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,930
Is everyone here?

421
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,820
Yes.

422
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,710
Come here.

423
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,140
I've seen the accessory design drafts

424
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,370
I asked you to submit.

425
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,990
The best one in my heart

426
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,070
has been decided.

427
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,310
I'm going to announce the winner today.

428
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,350
Yes, I promised you before.

429
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:51,310
The winner will design a set of wedding attire independently.

430
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:54,190
And it will be unveiled with my new works at the show.

431
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:57,790
But

432
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,280
before I announce the winner,

433
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,550
I want to criticize someone.

434
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,690
That person plagiarized someone else's design

435
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,520
in one of her design drafts.

436
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,650
Plagiarized?

437
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:10,190
Plagiarized?

438
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,350
-Who?
-Plagiarized?

439
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:15,390
Jin Xia.

440
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,060
Explain why you plagiarized.

441
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,530
I... I didn't, Ms. Xi.

442
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,250
Ms. Xi, which one are you talking about?

443
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:26,980
This one.

444
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,550
Ms. Xi showed us

445
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,070
the earrings before, right?

446
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,710
Yes, they are exactly the same.

447
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,300
That's right.

448
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,230
What do you mean?

449
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,840
Ms. Xi showed you?

450
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,790
Yes.

451
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,910
I designed this pair of earrings.

452
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,030
How could it be?

453
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:45,770
Jin Xia, you saw them too.

454
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,270
I saw them?

455
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:48,730
When?

456
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,920
That day.

457
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,230
That day, Ms. Xi came back from her hometown

458
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,510
and invited us to dinner.

459
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:56,110
She brought us her hometown's specialty, wine-brewed rice balls.

460
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,480
You got drunk after eating them.

461
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,610
Have you forgotten?

462
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,280
Wine-brewed rice balls?

463
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,130
Everyone, take a closer look

464
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,310
at these two design drafts.

465
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,060
Have a look.

466
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,140
Take them as the reference for this time's design style.

467
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:07,910
Okay.

468
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,670
Jin Xia.

469
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,160
Look.

470
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,630
Bai Bing, what's wrong... with her?

471
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,500
Ms. Xi, Jin Xia is really not good at drinking wine.

472
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,420
She was also like this

473
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,480
when we had a get-together.

474
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,610
She got drunk with just one sip.

475
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:39,120
But... who would have thought

476
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:42,020
she got drunk too after eating a wine-brewed rice ball?

477
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:45,980
So... I got dead drunk

478
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,200
after eating wine-brewed rice balls

479
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,930
and didn't remember anything?

480
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,540
This sachet was specially made by me.

481
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,880
I've carried it with me for many years.

482
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,430
It can refresh your mind

483
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,090
and stimulate your memory.

484
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,560
So... I saw Ms. Xi's design drafts

485
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,980
when I was drunk.

486
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,390
But I didn't remember as I experienced a blackout.

487
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,470
Then I smelled Nan Hua's sachet that can stimulate memory

488
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,540
and I remembered.

489
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,580
-But I thought it was my inspiration.
-Jin Xia.

490
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,930
Jin Xia.

491
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,390
Ms. Xi, I'm sorry.

492
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,980
I didn't do it on purpose.

493
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,050
That day, I was so drunk that I experienced a blackout.

494
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,850
When I remembered the earrings,

495
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,160
I thought it was my design inspiration.

496
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:32,630
Anyway,

497
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,880
I did plagiarize your design.

498
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,210
I won't make any excuse.

499
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,590
I know

500
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,640
what I did

501
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,660
is very unethical in our industry.

502
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,070
I'm sorry, Ms. Xi.

503
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,890
I let you down.

504
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:50,540
Maybe Jin Xia did it unintentionally.

505
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,210
Her plagiarism is too obvious.

506
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,770
Yes, it must be an accident.

507
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,510
Enough.

508
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,490
Jin Xia is not this kind of person.

509
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:57,750
I have my own judgment.

510
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:58,860
Jin Xia.

511
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,560
I trust your explanation.

512
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,710
Thank you, Ms. Xi.

513
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,680
Thank you, everyone.

514
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,320
Don't make the same mistake again.

515
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,370
Alright.

516
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,530
Let's not talk about this.

517
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:20,590
Next, I'm going to announce the winner.

518
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:23,920
I think you're more interested in knowing who the winner is.

519
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:24,960
Okay.

520
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,230
The winner of this accessory design competition is...

521
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:37,970
Jin Xia too.

522
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:47,930
Focus on designing and cherish this opportunity.

523
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,050
But...

524
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:49,890
But Ms. Xi,

525
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,070
she plagiarized your work.

526
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,370
-That's right.
-That's right.

527
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,590
Except the earrings,

528
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,800
I'm very satisfied with Jin Xia's other designs.

529
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,860
And they are the best among all of you.

530
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:01,660
Her designs show a classical and fashionable style

531
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,210
and don't pursue fashion blindly.

532
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,390
They are unconventional

533
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,230
and very vivid.

534
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,140
As for the rest of you,

535
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,390
your designs are either too old-fashioned due to the lack of creativity

536
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,750
or too modern.

537
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,890
They have deviated from the theme.

538
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,420
So they are not very satisfactory.

539
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,760
Are her designs that good?

540
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,820
I also want to know.

541
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,860
Could it be that she got drunk again

542
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,280
and plagiarized someone else's designs?

543
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,430
Enough.

544
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,250
What matters to me is your designs,

545
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,670
not your words.

546
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,760
Bai Bing,

547
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,810
give them Jin Xia's design drafts

548
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,010
to have a look.

549
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,230
Okay.

550
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,550
Let me take a look.

551
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,280
Indeed, it is good.

552
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,430
-Is it that good?
-It's not very special.

553
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,390
-Just so-so.
-Nothing special.

554
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:56,670
So the meteor-chip earrings

555
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,750
have nothing to do with me.

556
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,030
It was designed by Ms. Xi.

557
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,030
Then...

558
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:11,510
Jin Xia.

559
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:15,350
Jin Xia?

560
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,890
Ms. Xi.

561
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,760
Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

562
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:20,670
What's wrong?

563
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:23,160
Are you still upset about the plagiarism?

564
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:25,710
To me,

565
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,300
I let bygones be bygones.

566
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,230
I really didn't expect you

567
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,260
to be like that after you got drunk.

568
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,710
But I saw

569
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,040
the video you uploaded onto your Moments.

570
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,550
Fairy... Baby.

571
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,200
Ms. Xi, thank you for believing me.

572
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,670
But I did make a mistake.

573
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,360
But... I'm not upset

574
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,790
about this.

575
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,890
Then you are sad... because of your grandma.

576
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,140
I know

577
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,650
you grew up with your grandma.

578
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,330
Me too.

579
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,220
You too?

580
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,219
My parents have been working somewhere else since my childhood.

581
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:10,350
I could only see them

582
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,730
once or twice throughout the whole year.

583
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:15,650
Sometimes, I could only see them once within two or three years.

584
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,920
I was raised

585
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,460
by my grandma.

586
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,870
Later, I went to a boarding high school.

587
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,360
She suddenly passed away.

588
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,150
I didn't even get to say goodbye to her.

589
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:27,639
Ms. Xi.

590
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,270
Children want to take care of their parents, only to realize that they're long gone.

591
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,389
I was as sorrowful

592
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:37,040
as you back then.

593
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,300
But then I figured it out.

594
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,739
I couldn't keep being low-spirited.

595
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:42,719
Because if my grandma

596
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,110
knew it,

597
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,610
she would be even sadder.

598
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,520
I see.

599
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,639
Thank you, Ms. Xi.

600
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,250
I'll do my best to stabilize my emotions.

601
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,050
Promise me.

602
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:52,830
From now on,

603
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,850
don't work with negative emotions.

604
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,250
Opportunities are rare.

605
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,120
If you don't do your best,

606
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,140
you'll regret it.

607
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,150
Besides,

608
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,600
your work will be unveiled with mine.

609
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,940
If you screw it up,

610
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,740
I'm the one who will be humiliated.

611
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,780
Don't worry, Ms. Xi.

612
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,730
I'll work hard.

613
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,230
I won't let you down.

614
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,260
Stabilize your emotions

615
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,390
and get back to work.

616
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,270
Ms. Xi.

617
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,150
Anything else?

618
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:21,490
Well, when you showed them the design drafts,

619
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,630
there were other design drafts

620
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,230
except the design draft of the earrings, right?

621
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,030
I want to take a good look at them,

622
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,740
so that I won't make the same plagiarism mistake

623
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,090
like a fool again.

624
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:35,340
I left the design drafts at home. I'll give them to you next time.

625
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:35,950
Okay.

626
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:58,360
Why did the ancient cherry tree suddenly come back to life?

627
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,680
Was it really because of Jin Xia?

628
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,320
Or...

629
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,560
someone else?

630
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,190
Why is this cherry blossom...

631
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,060
white?

632
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,750
Her hairpin was very eye-catching.

633
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:29,780
It's a withe

634
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,630
with five or six snow-white cherry blossoms.

635
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,650
White cherry blossoms?

636
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,970
Looks like someone has been here.

637
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:51,670
Xiaochuan?

638
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,180
Xiaochuan.

639
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,520
This is for you.

640
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:01,230
Thank you.

641
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:06,870
Jin Xia.

642
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:08,630
I'm sorry.

643
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,800
What's wrong?

644
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,580
I was too busy.

645
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,840
The company held an inventory clearance event.

646
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,080
Everyone was very busy.

647
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,480
I really couldn't leave.

648
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,740
Grandma died.

649
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,630
I wasn't with you

650
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,870
when you were sad.

651
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,100
I'm sorry.

652
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:28,030
It's okay.

653
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,750
I'm also a corporate slave. We're the same.

654
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:31,990
I understand.

655
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,190
And... everything went well.

656
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,590
Nan Hua helped me.

657
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,620
He handled everything well.

658
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,900
Great.

659
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,750
I forgot you have

660
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,950
a handsome and powerful guy to help you.

661
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,950
Speaking of Nan Hua,

662
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,600
I haven't seen him for a long time.

663
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,400
I really want to eat his cooking.

664
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,100
Let's go.

665
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,200
I'll go to your place tonight

666
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,300
and have some delicious food.

667
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,220
Then... I'll live there.

668
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,340
We can chat all night

669
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,080
to catch up on each other. Let's go.

670
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,040
Why don't we...

671
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,160
eat outside tonight

672
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,460
and stay at your place?

673
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,110
It's not convenient at your place?

674
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,180
It's a long story.

675
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,610
I'll tell you later.

676
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:12,660
Let's go.

677
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,000
Okay.

678
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,150
Slow down.

679
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:18,920
My shoes.

680
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,940
Okay.

681
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,740
I'll tell my brother.

682
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:32,310
Bye.

683
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,260
Brother.

684
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,550
Jin Xia said

685
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,080
she's not coming back for dinner tonight.

686
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,750
She is having dinner with Xiaochuan outside.

687
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,430
There is too much unfinished work.

688
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,060
She has to work overtime in the company.

689
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,720
So tonight, she won't come back to sleep either.

690
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:52,670
Okay.

691
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,980
What a pity. I made so many dishes.

692
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:59,740
It's okay.

693
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,750
I'll eat them all.

694
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,760
Why didn't Jin Xia... call me directly?

695
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,110
I think maybe it was because

696
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,600
you just got your phone.

697
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,560
Jin Xia isn't used to it yet.

698
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,350
So

699
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,680
she asked me to tell you.

700
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,420
Brother, eat more.

701
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,110
Here.

702
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:24,440
Maybe.

703
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:35,230
So just because you drew the earrings

704
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:38,020
designed by your teacher according to your memory,

705
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,680
you think Ms. Xi is the reincarnation

706
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,120
of the person Nan Hua has been waiting for.

707
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,130
You're a bit hasty.

708
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,100
Not just the earrings.

709
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,620
When Nan Hua fainted

710
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,780
in front of our studio,

711
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,290
Ms. Xi was there too.

712
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,580
At that time...

713
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:01,630
What happened?

714
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,020
It's a little cold.

715
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,510
At that time, I thought the recharging was delayed.

716
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,290
Now that I think about it,

717
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,310
maybe Ms. Xi recharged him.

718
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,600
Maybe it was just a coincidence.

719
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,250
You also recharged him before, right?

720
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,840
But when we were in my grandma's house later,

721
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,240
I failed to recharge him.

722
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:28,260
Could it be that we misunderstood?

723
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:31,120
Actually, it was someone else who recharged him.

724
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,680
Are you going to tell Nan Hua these thoughts?

725
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,820
If I'm not the person he's been waiting for,

726
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,220
I can't lie to him.

727
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,890
This is not lying.

728
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,700
You never said

729
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:45,870
you are that person.

730
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,270
It's what Nan Hua thinks.

731
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:48,960
Even if you are not,

732
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,750
what matters most is if you two can get along well.

733
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:52,050
But he said

734
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:54,270
except the person he's been waiting for,

735
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:56,800
he would never make contact with anyone else.

736
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:59,570
He also said he will take care of you forever.

737
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,670
This is different.

738
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,880
Why?

739
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:04,870
We have...

740
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:09,510
Ms. Xi between us.

741
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,350
How can it be the same?

742
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:15,990
Jin Xia,

743
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:22,070
do you want to have Nan Hua to yourself?

744
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,550
A little.

745
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,790
Then you can only compete with her fairly.

746
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:35,750
Ms. Xi and me?

747
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:41,070
Do I stand a chance?

748
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,040
If your rival is Xi Manling,

749
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,390
it'll be a little difficult.

750
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,480
What should I do then?

751
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:54,430
Then you can only find some other ways.

752
00:41:58,870 --> 00:41:59,800
What should I do?

753
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,350
For example...

754
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:04,030
you can sleep with Nan Hua

755
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,430
at night,

756
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,420
leaving him no choice.

757
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,390
No.

758
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:32,070
Fairy Baby can't do this.

759
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,460
Then...

760
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,820
I'm gonna call the police.

761
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,640
Do you have a better idea?

762
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,350
No. What should I do?

763
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,950
[Ms. Xi]

764
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,950
[Reject] [Answer]

765
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,500
Hello, Ms. Xi.

766
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,800
Hello, Jin Xia.

767
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,590
I forgot to ask you something in the daytime.

768
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:19,830
What is it?

769
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,310
I told you

770
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:24,990
I've seen your boyfriend's model shots, right?

771
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:27,620
I have feelings for him.

772
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,820
Feelings?

773
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:33,190
I mean

774
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,210
his temperament

775
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,200
echoes the theme of the new works.

776
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,730
I happen

777
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,690
to want to use new models this time.

778
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,890
We have a few samples now.

779
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,810
I asked you to ask him if he's interested.

780
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:44,870
Have you asked him?

781
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:49,490
He... He doesn't plan to be a model anymore.

782
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:53,670
But... the previous photos were good.

783
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:54,760
Why did he quit?

784
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:59,170
Maybe he thinks the clothes were too revealing.

785
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,060
He's a stick-in-the-mud.

786
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:02,990
Our design is very conservative this time.

787
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:03,870
Don't worry.

788
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:06,380
I won't even let him show his ankles.

789
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,530
Anything else?

790
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:15,030
No.

791
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:18,530
I'll tell him to think about it.

792
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,520
Goodbye, Ms. Xi.

793
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:22,230
Okay, bye.

794
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,160
So?

795
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,740
They seem to have telepathy.

796
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,480
They are attracted to each other.

797
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,540
They're going to meet soon.

798
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:39,570
Why do I think the situation is so familiar?

799
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,600
The drama's plot has reached a turning point.
