In the several thousand years of human history,

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,020
there have been many unsolved mysteries.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,930
Are the stories of Dayu controlling the flood and Nvwa mending the sky myths?

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,540
Why would the advancement of human civilization

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,740
surpass its current situations?

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,780
There are all kinds of speculations.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,730
But in fact, the truth

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,740
dates back to the ancient times.

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,380
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,700

Back then, the ancient people

14
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,060
mastered the scientific civilization far more advanced than that in modern society.

15
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,140
Their high-level genetic modification technology

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,260
even enabled them to develop

17
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,370
human potential to the greatest extent.

18
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,930
They could absorb the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth

19
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,790
to stay alive and even exert extraordinary energy.

20
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,700
However, a tragic doomsday disaster

21
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,370
made those human beings almost extinct at that time.

22
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,690
Countless lives

23
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:04,890
and brilliant civilizations were destroyed overnight.

24
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:06,940
Only a small number of ancient people

25
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,530
survived the doomsday

26
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,300
after escaping to the underground in time

27
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,770
and entering into a frozen hibernation state.

28
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,430
After that,

29
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,170
through tens of thousands of years of self-repair,

30
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,450
our Earth conceived new intelligent lives again,

31
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,710
namely, the ancestors of modern people.

32
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,060
And the ancient people sleeping in the underground areas

33
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,460
woke up one after another

34
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,130
and returned to the land.

35
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:28,850
They saw

36
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,810
the new primitive humans who were still trying to make fire by drilling wood.

37
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,900
Out of good intentions,

38
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,009
they taught the younger generations

39
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:37,000
many technologies, such as farming, metallurgy,

40
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,770
construction, flood control, and precautions against natural disasters.

41
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,700
Many great civilization miracles

42
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,100
were the masterpieces made

43
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,830

44
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,740

considered the ancient people with extraordinary energy as deities.

47
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,670
They built temples for them and worshipped them.

48
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,170
As the official historians of various countries exaggerated the stories about them,

49
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,700
many legendary ancient myths have been passed down till now.

50
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:03,210
In this way,

51
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,410

52

of deities.

54
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,820
But there were also some low-profile ancient people

55
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,280
who chose to live in seclusion in deep mountains to escape from the mortal world.

56
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,050
However,

57
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,300
people's worship towards the deities

58
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,380
also gradually generated fear and desires.

59
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,180
The rulers feared that the power of deities

60
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,820
would become a threat to their royal power.

61
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,370
But they were also greedy

62
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,100
for immortality and the extraordinary power.

63
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,760
Therefore,

64
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,690
they used various excuses

65
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,690
to start wars

66
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,820
against the deities from time to time.

67
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,810
The ancient people were outnumbered

68
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,300
and were no match for the huge armies in the end.

69
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,900
They almost became extinct.

70
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,570
Little did they know

71
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,940
that by imparting the knowledge of weapon forging to the new humans

72
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,140
they unwittingly unleashed a disaster upon themselves.

73
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,810
Although the ancient people who lived in deep mountains

74
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,380
survived this disaster,

75
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,890
they were hunted by the rulers continuously.

76
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,210
They were even slandered

77
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,490
and considered as horrible mountain spirits or ferocious ghosts.

78
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,860
In the blink of an eye,

79
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,730
those who had been regarded as deities became devils that everyone wanted to kill.

80
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,210
As everything keeps changing in the world,

81
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,900
no one knows the existence of the ancient people anymore.

82

00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,740
Grandma,

376
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,090
what... grandson-in-law?

377
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,150
You're not young anymore.

378
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,910
Isn't it good to get married early?

379
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,990
Nan Hua...

380
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,390
Grandma,

381
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,680
now is not the time to think about this.

382
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,050
The most important thing is you need to get well soon.

383
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,390
Otherwise... I'll never get married.

384
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,900
Look at you.

385
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,910
Alright.

386
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,780
Marriage is a matter between two people.

387
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,470
It's not up to me alone.

388
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,330
But, Grandma,

389
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,550
if this is your wish,

390
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,760
I'll think about it carefully.

391
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,070
Besides this,

392
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,800
do you have any other wish?

393
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,400
Look, I haven't accompanied you like this

394
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,540
for a long time.

395
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,610
Is there anything

396
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,810
you want to do with me?

397
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,430
Draw a portrait for me.

398
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,990
A portrait?

399
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,190
Okay.

400
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,190
Grandma, why are you suddenly interested in this?

401
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,710
In our lives,

402
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,640
there are two occasions

403
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,590
where we should invite all our relatives, friends,

404
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,100
and the people we know.

405
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,790
The wedding

406
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,960
and

407
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,200
the funeral.

408
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,040
On my funeral,

409
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,640
I want...

410
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,040
Grandma, don't say that.

411
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,920
On the day of my funeral,

412
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,840
hang this portrait on the mourning hall

413
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,360
as my memorial portrait.

414
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,710
When all my relatives and friends are there,

415
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,400
they can see

416
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,520
the portrait drawn by my granddaughter.

417
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,760
It's a good painting.

418
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,720
She will become a great designer in the future.

419
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,320
Grandma, I can draw a portrait for you.

420
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,560
I promise you

421
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,100
I will work hard to become a great designer

422
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,040
to make your friends envy you.

423
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,280
But now, stop talking nonsense.

424
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,120
You should listen to the doctor.

425
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,250
Take medicine on time and eat more.

426
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,720
The medical technology is so advanced now.

427
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,320
You will be discharged soon.

428
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,560
Don't forget

429
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,440
the women in our family will live long lives.

430
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,530
Have you finished drawing?

431
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,480
I need more time, Grandma.

432
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,480
It's only been less than half an hour.

433
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,320
Besides,

434
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,500
you kept moving when you were eating.

435
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,160
It's a turtle that barely moves, okay?

436
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,800
Continue.

437
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,180
I'm gonna chat with Nan.

438
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,000
Grandma.

439
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,660
Focus on what you are doing.

440
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,680
Nan,

441
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:44,090
I want to propose marriage to you on behalf of my granddaughter.

442
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,960
Will you marry her?

443
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,560
Grandma.

444
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,560
Why are you shouting? I can hear you.

445
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,200
Don't talk about this with him.

446
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:57,760
Nan hasn't responded yet.

447
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,600
Why are you overreacting?

448
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,040
Grandma.

449
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,440
It's okay. I...

450
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,480
I'm sorry.

451
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,120
I can't promise you this.

452
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:24,940
That's right, Grandma.

453
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,420
It's a serious matter.

454
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,760
Even though you mentioned it to him,

455
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,360
he can't promise you easily.

456
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,680
Just focus on drawing.

457
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:37,810
Actually, when I chatted with Nan back then,

458
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,600
he also said

459
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,720
there are still many things remaining uncertain.

460
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,200
Nan,

461
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,800
don't blame me for overstepping the boundary.

462
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,480
I'm really worried I can't make it till that day

463
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,000
because of this illness.

464
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,840
Grandma, didn't you promise me

465
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,040
not to think too much?

466
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,010
Nan,

467
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,520
you are a trustworthy man.

468
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,840
I like you from the bottom of my heart.

469
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,640
If you two really can't become a couple in the future,

470
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,480
promise me

471
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,720
to take care of her.

472
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,040
Don't worry, Grandma.

473
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,840
I promise you.

474
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,160
As long as I'm by her side,

475
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,960
even just for a day,

476
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,490
I will take good care of her.

477
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,440
Grandma.

478
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,440
Even if I'm alone,

479
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,480
I can definitely

480
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,880
take good care of myself.

481
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,960
Don't worry.

482
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,960
Let's not talk about this. Let's change the topic.

483
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,500
Right. Nan Hua,

484
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,130
where's the voice-recording marble?

485
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,910
Grandma, do you remember this marble?

486
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,440
This...

487
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,890
This is my toy marble.

488
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,680
You brought it to me when you came to see me last time.

489
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,800
You said I liked it very much when I was little.

490
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,930
I carried it with me.

491
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,080
This marble is mine, not yours.

492
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,960
I found it in an ancestral hall.

493
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,190
Then you took it

494
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,250
from my jewelry box

495
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,050
and never returned it to me.

496
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,560
Grandma, it's... yours?

497
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,800
Then what was the ancestral hall like?

498
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,430
I lived in the old village back then.

499
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,970
There was an ancestral hall in the back mountain.

500
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,800
It seems an ancient prince

501
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,960
was worshiped there.

502
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,120
I went there when I was young.

503
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:58,480
Then the ancestral hall was gone.

504
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,850
Gone?

505
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,200
What does that mean, Grandma?

506
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,280
It was demolished.

507
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,240
They were building expressways

508
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,640
for urban construction.

509
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,000
Many old buildings were demolished,

510
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,440
including the ancestral hall.

511
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,640
Demolished? How could it be?

512
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,570
Grandma,

513
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,770
do you know the ancestral hall's specific location?

514
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,600
Let me think.

515
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,300
Urban construction has developed too fast.

516
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,080
The ancestral hall seems to be...

517
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,090
in Jian'an District or... Yonghe West District.

518
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,290
I'm not sure.

519
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:58,130
[Health Education Bulletin]

520
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,200
Grandma is still having a physical examination.

521
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,860
We'd better ask about the ancestral hall later.

522
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:08,430
It's okay. Grandma's health is more important.

523
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,520
Besides, I have enough information now.

524
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,510
If there really was

525
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,240
an ancient ancestral hall here,

526
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,440
there must be a trace.

527
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,750
I can go to the museum and the library first.

528
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,000
There must be relevant records.

529
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,270
You're right.

530
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,560
But Grandma said the ancestral hall might...

531
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,280
All right.

532
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,920
Now is not the time to worry about this for me.

533
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,180
You should spend more time with Grandma.

534
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,120
What Grandma said just now...

535
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,120
It's fine.

536
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,350
Don't take it to heart.

537
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,680
Don't worry about the ancestral hall matter.

538
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,410
I'll go investigate it myself.

539
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,770
I'll go with you.

540
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,320
Don't you need to go back to work?

541
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,420
I asked for a leave.

542
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,450
And I just want to keep him company.

543
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,720
But... there are only two caregiver beds here.

544
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,240
Where will you sleep?

545
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,000
It's fine.

546
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,040
I can share a bed with my brother.

547
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,240
I'm going with him to find a hotel nearby.

548
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,320
Stay with Grandma.

549
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,520
Okay.

550
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,280
I didn't expect you

551
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,480
to be an ancient man.

552
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,960
This is unbelievable.

553
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,400
But since you

554
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,660
have told me the truth,

555
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,480
it means you've taken me

556
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,810
as your best friend and confidant, right?

557
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,600
Don't think too much.

558
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,640
You helped me.

559
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,240
I should return the favor.

560
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,460
So I let you know something you're interested in.

561
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,400
