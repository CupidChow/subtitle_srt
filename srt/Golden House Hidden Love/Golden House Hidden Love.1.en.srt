1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,220
Your Highness.

3
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,160
Do you really not need me to go with you this time?

4
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,460
No, there's no need.

5
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,380
Your spiritual energy dispersed last time, and you haven't gathered it again yet.

6
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,110
You should take a good rest now.

7
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,420
Besides, this trip

8
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,860
is just a routine patrol.

9
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:09,770
Don't worry.

10
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,730
I'll be back in two months.

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,840
Even so,

12
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:15,750
those people with evil intentions

13
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:16,950
won't give up easily.

14
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,480
You must be careful.

15
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,600
Your Highness,

16
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,030
everything is ready.

17
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,910
His Highness can set off

18
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,360
after saying goodbye to the High Immortal.

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,870
They have been talking for a while.

20
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:33,430
Do you need me to remind His Highness

21
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:35,530
not to delay the departure time?

22
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,160
No.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,080
Let them say goodbye properly.

24
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,130
After all,

25
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:45,020
this is their last meeting.

26
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,210
Yes.

27
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,350
In the next two months,

28
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,190
I will try my best to accumulate the spiritual energy.

29
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,110
Next time, no matter how far away or how long you go,

30
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,479
I will go with you.

31
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,700
There's no next time.

32
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,020
The injustice in the world has been persisting for a long time.

33
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,130
And my life only lasts a few decades.

34
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,110
Instead of wasting my life on fighting and deceiving

35
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,570
day and night to get power,

36
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,820
I'd rather live my life in seclusion from now on.

37
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,660
When this tree is laiden with cherries,

38
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:18,670
I will come back.

39
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,350
By then,

40
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,430
I will never leave again.

41
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,470
On March 22, Beijing time,

42
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,750
which is tonight,

43
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,270
we will have

44
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,130
a splendid Lyrids meteor shower.

45
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,440
The experts predicted

46
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,640
that it will be the most spectacular

47
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,930
during over 300 years.

48
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,630
The Lyrids meteor shower

49
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,750
is one of the most aesthetically appealing meteor showers.

50
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,170
Unfortunately, we have to

51
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,100
[Xiaojiu Logistics]

52
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,830
wait until two in the morning to observe it.

53
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,440
I'm afraid many audiences can't make it.

54
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,620
Sir, carry this box with care.

55
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,320
There's a coffee machine inside. It's fragile.

56
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:17,920
Okay.

57
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,579
Thank you.

58
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,780
The tree is so withered

59
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,420
that it's a real eyesore.

60
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,570
I'll have to find a way to move it away.

61
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,660
Young lady.

62
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,860
Are you moving in here?

63
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,950
Hello, Ma'am.

64
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:44,530
Hello.

65
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,640
I live right next door.

66
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,829
We'll be neighbors from now on.

67
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,470
Just call me Ms. Chen.

68
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,310
Hello, Ms. Chen. My name is Jin Xia.

69
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,990
Please take good care of me.

70
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,790
Let's take care of each other.

71
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:57,480
Come to my house for tea when you're free.

72
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,320
Sure.

73
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,090
Are you moving alone?

74
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,130
Doesn't your boyfriend help you?

75
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,860
Ma'am, I'm single.

76
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,630
I can move myself.

77
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,150
It's such a big house.

78
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,019
You live alone?

79
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:16,870
Yes.

80
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,910
I might find a roommate later.

81
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,880
That's hard to find.

82
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,830
There are not many strangers

83
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,670
in this town.

84
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,860
Besides,

85
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,380
your house...

86
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,710
What's wrong with my house?

87
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,960
No one has lived here for decades.

88
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,990
The agent should have told you that, right?

89
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,630
Yes.

90
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,840
They said no one has lived in it after 1949

91
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,990
and it's an old house.

92
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,390
It needs to be renovated.

93
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,020
This house has been renovating itself all the time.

94
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,220
Renovating itself?

95
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,740
To be honest,

96
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,400
the house is not clean.

97
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,800
And I'm not the only one who said it.

98
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,570
Everyone in the town knows it.

99
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,870
What do you mean by "not clean?"

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,420
This place is haunted.

101
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,310
Ma'am, I'm materialistic.

102
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,190
There are no ghosts in this world.

103
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,980
Young lady, don't sniff at mysteries.

104
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,780
It might cause trouble.

105
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,400
Okay.

106
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,690
I'll check the drains.

107
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,430
Watch out!

108
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,770
Are you okay?

109
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,360
Yes, I'm fine.

110
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,850
This is the spiritual energy?

111
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,830
Have we met before?

112
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,700
I think…

113
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,100
not.

114
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:27,790
Sorry

115
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,170
to offend you, Miss.

116
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,810
No, no. Thank you.

117
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,240
Where did this handsome guy come from?

118
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,770
Is he a neighbor, too?

119
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,810
Hello, Miss.

120
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,140
My humble name is...

121
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,430
I am Nan Hua.

122
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,090
Is it you who bought this house?

123
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,400
Yes.

124
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,970
Miss, may I have your name, please?

125
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,650
Sure.

126
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,530
You can call me Jin Xia.

127
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,460
Miss Jin.

128
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,090
Is this handsome guy hitting on me?

129
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,870
So, did you buy this house

130
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,910
for investment

131
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,150
or to live here?

132
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,180
I'll live here.

133
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:13,990
Oh, I see.

134
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,670
The townsfolks are so straightforward.

135
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,100
May I have the honor

136
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,890
to renovate this house for you?

137
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,300
Renovate?

138
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,150
Yes.

139
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,120
Look at its lines and structure.

140
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,860
They are full of the aesthetics and wisdom of the ancient people.

141
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,190
It turns out he's here to promote himself.

142
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,440
But as long as you reno…

143
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,230
renovate it,

144
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,790
it will deserve

145
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,190
its outstanding owner.

146
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:51,980
Outstanding?

147
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,270
Me?

148
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,950
Are all the salesmen nowadays so handsome

149
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,310
and such sweet talkers?

150
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,590
Luckily, I'm tough-minded.

151
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,550
This house is not an ordinary house,

152
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,990
so please show every concern for it

153
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,660
and take meticulous care of it.

154
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,340
That's a bit too much, isn't it?

155
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,070
It's like he's acting in a play.

156
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,460
Long time no see, Nan.

157
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,550
It's been a while, Wenying.

158
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,550
Young lady...

159
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,320
Nan is a famous designer from the city.

160
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,530
So they're on the same side.

161
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,290
This house is indeed old.

162
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,570
Awesome.

163
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,480
This young man

164
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,049
is very warm-hearted.

165
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,309
No matter what,

166
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:36,669
I won't fall for it.

167
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,679
He renovated my house last year.

168
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,010
He didn't even charge me for the design fee.

169
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:41,929
Really?

170
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:42,860
Yes.

171
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:45,160
Designing the buildings I like

172
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,810
is enjoyment in itself.

173
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,500
So, Miss,

174
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,040
I was wondering if you'd give me a chance

175
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,730
to be in the same room with you.

176
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,030
Same…

177
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,940
I mean, to take a look

178
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,080
at the inside of the house.

179
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,920
That's what you mean.

180
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,960
Young people nowadays

181
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,190
can flirt so skillfully.

182
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,070
Am I really so lucky

183
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,200
that pennies are falling from heaven?

184
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,800
I have something to do. Bye-bye.

185
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,800
Come in, please.

186
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,470
Here's your tea.

187
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,750
Thank you.

188
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,410
It's a little hot. Be careful.

189
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,030
Miss Jin.

190
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,700
It's such a large house.

191
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,940
How many people do you plan to live with in the future?

192
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,110
I'll live alone.

193
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,950
You'll live in

194
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,610
such a luxurious house alone?

195
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,490
Come to think of it,

196
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,510
it's quiet here.

197
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,130
It's enough to have a beauty.

198
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,310
Why does he speak in such an elegant manner?

199
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,370
Did he watch too many costume dramas?

200
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,300
It's just temporary.

201
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,270
I'll find a roommate eventually.

202
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,780
"Luxury house…"

203
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,320
You're exaggerating.

204
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,480
This house is quite cheap.

205
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,510
Cheap?

206
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,190
May I ask

207
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,040
which industry you are in?

208
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,060
I design wedding dresses.

209
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,020
You must be a famous designer.

210
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,110
My teacher is quite famous, all right.

211
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:43,220
I'm just her assistant.

212
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,920
I'm an ordinary employee.

213
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,430
And even so,

214
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,360
I took out a loan for 30 years.

215
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,710
In that case,

216
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,980
I think you'll treat this house well.

217
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,670
If you don't mind,

218
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,720
would it be possible to leave me to renovate Taiping?

219
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,170
Taiping?

220
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,320
Sorry.

221
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:08,780
I'm used to naming my favorite buildings.

222
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,370
Okay.

223
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,410
As I said,

224
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,740
I'm a bit short of money now.

225
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,720
Then… Just like Wenying's house next door,

226
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,720
I'll design it for you for free.

227
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,630
You just need to bear

228
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,630
the cost of the labor and materials.

229
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,280
For free?

230
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,050
Oh, I'd be too ashamed to let you do that.

231
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,130
This is my own will.

232
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,580
Is it okay for me to see

233
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,080
your budget and plan?

234
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,270
No problem.

235
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,900
I'll visit you again next week at the same time

236
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,670
and give you the designs and quoted price.

237
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,600
Thank you.

238
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,670
No, no, no.

239
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,160
I should thank you.

240
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,750
Don't worry.

241
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,250
I will do my best.

242
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,470
Thank you.

243
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,100
How about we exchange phone numbers

244
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:08,940
or WeChat?

245
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,940
Sorry, I don't use the phone usually.

246
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,230
But don't worry.

247
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,360
I'll come at the agreed time.

248
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,170
Oh! Artist.

249
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,900
I also studied art.

250
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,620
I understand.

251
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,870
Then I'll take my leave now.

252
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:29,910
Let me see you off.

253
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,530
Miss, please stay.

254
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:40,980
Take care.

255
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,860
He's handsome but weird.

256
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,190
Baby,

257
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,550
you only have five days of annual leave a year.

258
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,310
And they're all used for moving house.

259
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,550
It's so hard for you.

260
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,990
Won't it be better if you get a boyfriend?

261
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,220
You can have a helper when things like this happen.

262
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,030
And you'll have someone to share the burden of the house loan.

263
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,590
I can rent out a room

264
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,320
to share the burden of the loan.

265
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,580
It's not safe for you to live alone.

266
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,670
Don't worry, Grandma.

267
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,870
The police station is right on the next street.

268
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,430
Aren't the police more reliable

269
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,290
than a boyfriend when I'm in need?

270
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,670
Don't…

271
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,350
Where are the scissors?

272
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,230
Didn't I see them just now?

273
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:45,230
Well... Even so…

274
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,670
Grandma. Grandma.

275
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,630
Why is there a noise?

276
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,120
What happened?

277
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,190
I can hear you now.

281
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:07,790
Well...

282
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:11,790
Go ahead.

283
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,720
I was just saying

284
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,360
it's easy if you meet something for which you can call the police.

285
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,340
What if you get sick?

286
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:21,550
I saw a piece of news a few days ago

287
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,270
that a woman who lived alone

288
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,780
died at home, and nobody even knew about it!

289
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,390
When the body was found,

290
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,630
the cat had...

291
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,710
Grandma,

292
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,590
don't you know about our genes?

293
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,380
Look at you

294
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,630
and your sisters.

295
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,710
I promise

296
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,550
I can live until 99 without any illnesses.

297
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,080
Let's say you can live long.

298
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,620
You should find a boyfriend even more.

299
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,620
Otherwise, who will keep you company when you're old?

300
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,630
Why can you relate everything to finding a boyfriend?

301
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,390
Don't... You…

302
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,750
Grandma. Grandma.

303
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,520
What's going on?

304
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,590
Why does she have to

305
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,110
mention finding a boyfriend in whichever subject?

306
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,030
I'm fully capable of moving house

307
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,790
on my own.

308
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,680
I'll unpack the rest tomorrow.

309
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,350
I've worked hard today.

310
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,010
That's it. I'll take a shower.

311

♫An excellent person like me♫

312
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,620
♫Should live a lonely life♫

00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:50,470
♫But for the last twenty years♫

314
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,690
♫Why hasn't there been a man who deserved me?♫

315
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,240
What's that smell?

316
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,360
So this is the smell of home.

317
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,010
It's fragrant. It's enchanting.

318
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,870
I'm so happy.

319
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:31,750
I'm inspired.

320
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,450
This is the spiritual energy.

321
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,170
It's the same as what happened earlier today.

322
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:55,080
Why can she recharge me of the spiritual energy?

323
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,000
Don't go.

324
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,270
Inspiration, don't go.

325
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,240
Inspiration, don't go. Don't go.

326
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:27,950
This is...

327
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,210
Is it you? Are you back?

328
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:30,940
Who?

329
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,190
Miss Jin, let me explain.

330
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,020
I'm sorry I offended you just now.

331
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,150
But I'm not a villain.

332
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,190
I live here, too.

333
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,710
Shut up, you pervert!

334
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,570
When did you break into my house?

335
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,720
It's not what you think.

336
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,850
Actually, I've never left this place.

337
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,980
Can you come out and listen to my explanation first?

338
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,390
You want to trick me out?

339
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,390
Do you think I'm stupid?

340
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,000
I thought I was lucky.

341
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,400
I didn't know you were a perverted stalker.

342
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,910
I've already called the police.

343
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,430
You can talk to them.

344
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,550
Miss Jin, let me explain.

345
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,270
No!

346
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,790
How did you get in?

347
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,250
My extraordinary energy has recovered?

348
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,450
Is it because she recharged me just now?

349
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,230
Miss Jin, let me explain.

350
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:13,870
Don't come over.

351
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:14,430
I...

352
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,470
Don't come over!

353
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,800
I've called the police!

354
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,660
Help! Help!

355
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,830
Help! Help!

356
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,230
Forget it. I'm being intrusive.

357
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,390
Help! Help!

358
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,310
Where is he?

359
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,030
Is anyone home? Police!

360
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,320
Police!

361
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,790
The police are here.

362
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,630
Listen.

363
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,830
Just wait to go to jail.

364
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,840
Officer, help!

365
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,770
Hello, are you Ms. Jin Xia?

366
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,980
Yes, it's me.

367
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:56,970
Did you call the police saying that there was a peeper in the house?

368
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,270
He should be hiding now.

369
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,820
Let's go inside.

370
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,070
How dare you still sit here?

371
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,230
Officer, it's him.

372
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,190
Get him!

373
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,630
Where is he?

374
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,000
Right over there.

375
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,950
By the tea table.

376
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:20,640
But there's nothing there.

377
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,070
Nothing?

378
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,150
How could it be?

379
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,120
He's right over there.

380
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,130
Can't you see him?

381
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,430
He's over there.

382
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,510
What's going on?

383
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,750
This…

384
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,950
This place is haunted.

385
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,960
Is he the ghost

386
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,180
Ms. Chen referred to?

387
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,120
Ghost!

388
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,450
Ms. Jin, calm down.

389
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,210
There's nothing here.

390
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,540
Oh no!

391
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,630
A ghost!

392
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,790
019, 019, do you read me? Come in.

393
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,980
Copy that. Go ahead.

394
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,980
There's a drunken brawl at the food stall on South Street.

395
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,010
Please deal with it now.

396
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,740
Copy that. I'll be right there.

397
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,710
Ms. Jin,

398
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,530
there are no ghosts in this world.

399
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,160
We are materialists.

400
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,020
Are you not used to living in such a big house

401
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,830
because you just moved in?

402
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,350
He's right…

403
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,870
If you're really afraid,

404
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,470
why don't you stay with your friend for now?

405
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,870
Officer, my friends all live far away.

406
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,790
Don't leave me alone.

407
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,190
Then what about staying at a hotel tonight?

408
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,310
We have other cases to deal with.

409
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:50,990
Okay?

410
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,630
Could you take me with you?

411
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:54,650
That won't do.

412
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,300
How about

413
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,470
calling an ambulance for her?

414
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,550
No, sir.

415
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,430
Call an ambulance?

416
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,760
Am I seeing an eye doctor or a brain doctor?

417
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,950
He's leafing through the pictures there.

418
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,030
He's even looking at me now!

419
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,630
019, 019, have you set off?

420
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:12,490
I'm still working on this case. I'll be right there.

421
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,790
Ms. Jin, how about this?

422
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,670
There is a temple on the street corner.

423
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,130
You can stay there for now.

424
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,780
We'll help you after we're done with the other case.

425
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,390
Officer.

426
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,910
Officer, take me there.

427
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,590
Officer, I'm so scared.

428
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,150
-Calm down.
-I'm scared.

429
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,790
Ding, we have to hurry.

430
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,390
Ms. Jin, calm down.

431
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,250
There are no ghosts in this world.

432
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,910
Ms. Jin! Ms. Jin!

433
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,270
We have to go this way.

434
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,550
You go this way,

435
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,590
turn right,

436
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,710
and there's a hotel.

437
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,030
There are also 24-hour convenience stores

438
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,160
and Internet cafes.

439
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,550
The temple is at the end.

440
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,420
If you run into any more trouble,

441
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:56,350
you can call the police for help.

442
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,350
Okay.

443
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,400
It's lively over there at this hour.

444
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,070
Don't be afraid.

445
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,420
Thank you, officers.

446
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:03,450
Take your time.

447
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,060
You're welcome.

448
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,470
We can't take our time.

449
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,470
Hurry up.

450
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,190
Okay.

451
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,790
Anyway, leave that place first.

452
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,230
It's so dark.

453
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,510
It's flickering.

454
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,310
There's nothing to be afraid of, Jin Xia.

455
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,440
The street lamp is broken. That's all.

456
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,300
Good luck.

457
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,470
Hello.

458
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,110
Hello.

459
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,260
Why am I back again?

460
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:44,980
Is this so-called "going in circles because you're set up by a ghost?"

461
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:46,370
No.

462
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,640
There are no ghosts.

463
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,420
There are no ghosts.

464
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,270
There are no ghosts.

465
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,120
No, no.

466
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,340
My slipper!

467
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,670
Ghost!

468
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,100
Miss.

469
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,110
You can't get out anyway.

470
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,990
Why don't we have a good chat?

471
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:30,910
No, thanks.

472
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,080
I'm really sorry.

473
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,510
I didn't mean to scare you.

474
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,100
It was absolutely not my intention.

475
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,510
I wanted to take the opportunity that I'm doing the renovation for you

476
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,840
to get familiar with you

477
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,100
and tell you the truth slowly.

478
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,310
What truth?

479
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,920
You died because you had been wronged?

480
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,960
Do you need my help to do anything?

481
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,320
You misunderstood. I'm not a ghost.

482
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:17,870
If you're not a ghost,

483
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,530
why aren't you afraid of salt?

484
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,400
Movies are full of lies.

485
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,220
I'm really not a ghost.

486
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,600
And there are no ghosts in this world.

487
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,710
What kind of monster are you?

488
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:33,600
Actually,

489
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,180
I don't remember either.

490
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,730
I've been living here for thousands of years.

491
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,620
Maybe it's because it's been too long.

492
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:48,650
Maybe there's another reason.

493
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,890
I forgot who I was.

494
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:53,890
I only remember

495
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,920
that I have to wait for someone here.

496
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,070
Who?

497
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,440
I forgot who I should be waiting for.

498
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,580
I don't know why I have to wait, either.

499
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,000
But...

500
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,550
Wait.

501
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:14,060
You said you've waited here for thousands of years.

502
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:17,470
Even a tortoise would be dead.

503
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,510
I'm sorry.

504
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,670
Sorry. No.

505
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,870
I mean

506
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,870
we can leave our contact information.

507
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,300
If the person you're waiting for comes back,

508
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,900
I'll contact you right away.

509
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,670
I'm sorry.

510
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,230
It seems that I can't leave this house.

511
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,310
Why not?

512
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:44,390
Are you an Earthbound Spirit?

513
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,870
I told you, I'm not a ghost.

514
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,120
There's another reason

515
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,810
why I can't leave the house.

516
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,270
But I forgot

517
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,390
the reason.

518
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,830
Again?

519
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:06,740
I'm so unlucky.

520
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,390
I finally bought a house.

521
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,470
Yet there's a ghost inside.

522
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:18,910
Sir,

523
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:23,310
can't you let go of your obsession and reincarnate?

524
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,870
I really am not…

525
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,700
Forget it.

526
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,990
Miss Jin, you seem very tired today.

527
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,210
Why don't you take a rest first?

528
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,410
We'll talk tomorrow.

529
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,670
How can I sleep?

530
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,070
If you can't sleep,

531
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,710
I have some ideas.

532
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:42,170
No need.

533
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,660
I can sleep.

534
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,090
Good night.

535
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,160
Where are my slippers?

536
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,730
Good night.

537
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:15,990
Even if I've never seen a real ghost before,

538
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,630
I've at least watched ghost movies.

539
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,350
No, I have to get out of here.

540
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,590
What is that?

541
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:19,370
Get down!

542
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:42,730
Oh no!

543
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,680
My extraordinary energy has just been restored.

544
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,210
I'm afraid I can't block it.

545
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,300
I was right.

546
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,310
She can recharge me.

547
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,350
Are you okay?

548
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,990
It's you.

549
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,150
Finally, you're here.

550
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:33,400
I...
