00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,100
In the several thousand years of human history,

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,990
there have been many unsolved mysteries.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,900
Are the stories of Dayu controlling the flood and Nvwa mending the sky myths?

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,510
Why would the advancement of human civilization

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,710
surpass its current situations?

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,740
There are all kinds of speculations.

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,700
But in fact, the truth

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,710
dates back to the ancient times.

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,350
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

11
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,670
the highly developed

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,310
prehistoric civilizations once existed on Earth.

13
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,630
Back then, the ancient people

14
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,020
mastered the scientific civilization far more advanced than that in modern society.

15
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,100
Their high-level genetic modification technology

16
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,230
even enabled them to develop

17
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,340
human potential to the greatest extent.

18
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,900
They could absorb the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth

19
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,760
to stay alive and even exert extraordinary energy.

20
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,670
However, a tragic doomsday disaster

21
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,340
made those human beings almost extinct at that time.

22
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:01,660
Countless lives

23
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,860
and brilliant civilizations were destroyed overnight.

24
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,910
Only a small number of ancient people

25
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,500
survived the doomsday

26
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,270
after escaping to the underground in time

27
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,740
and entering into a frozen hibernation state.

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,400
After that,

29
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,150
through tens of thousands of years of self-repair,

30
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,420
our Earth conceived new intelligent lives again,

31
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,680
namely, the ancestors of modern people.

32
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,020
And the ancient people sleeping in the underground areas

33
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,420
woke up one after another

34
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,100
and returned to the land.

35
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:28,820
They saw

36
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,780
the new primitive humans who were still trying to make fire by drilling wood.

37
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,870
Out of good intentions,

38
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,979
they taught the younger generations

39
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:36,970
many technologies, such as farming, metallurgy,

40
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,740
construction, flood control, and precautions against natural disasters.

41
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,670
Many great civilization miracles

42
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,060
were the masterpieces made

43
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,789
by our ancestors with the help of ancient people.

44
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,710
At that time, the new human beings

45
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,810
[Fuxi Temple]

46
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,910
considered the ancient people with extraordinary energy as deities.

47
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,640
They built temples for them and worshipped them.

48
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,140
As the official historians of various countries exaggerated the stories about them,

49
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,660
many legendary ancient myths have been passed down till now.

50
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,180
In this way,

51
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,370
most ancient people around the world

52
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,310
fitted into the new world with the identities

53
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,460
of deities.

54
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,780
But there were also some low-profile ancient people

55
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,240
who chose to live in seclusion in deep mountains to escape from the mortal world.

56
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,020
However,

57
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,260
people's worship towards the deities

58
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,340
also gradually generated fear and desires.

59
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,150
The rulers feared that the power of deities

60
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,790
would become a threat to their royal power.

61
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,340
But they were also greedy

62
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,060
for immortality and the extraordinary power.

63
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,720
Therefore,

64
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,660
they used various excuses

65
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,660
to start wars

66
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,790
against the deities from time to time.

67
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,780
The ancient people were outnumbered

68
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,260
and were no match for the huge armies in the end.

69
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,860
They almost became extinct.

70
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,540
Little did they know

71
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,900
that by imparting the knowledge of weapon forging to the new humans,

72
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,100
they unwittingly unleashed a disaster upon themselves.

73
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,780
Although the ancient people who lived in deep mountains

74
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,340
survived this disaster,

75
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,860
they were hunted by the rulers continuously.

76
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,180
They were even slandered

77
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,460
and considered as horrible mountain spirits or ferocious ghosts.

78
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,810
In the blink of an eye,

79
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,700
those who had been regarded as deities became devils that everyone wanted to kill.

80
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,170
As everything keeps changing in the world,

81
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,860
no one knows the existence of the ancient people anymore.

82
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,220
Only those anecdotes and peculiar stories about ghosts and monsters

83
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,300
have been passed down from generation to generation.

84
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,020
And the tiny minority of ancient people who have survived

85
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,710
are still secretly hiding

86
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,579
in those covert corners in the world till now.

87
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,740
What a feast.

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,870
Can I eat now?

89
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,870
Wait. There is one more dish.

90
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,550
Okay.

91
00:03:59,150 --> 00:03:59,990
This is...

92
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,110
Try it.

93
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,710
Try the marinated shrimps I made.

94
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,990
This is your favorite.

95
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,870
Okay.

96
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:27,830
Here.

97
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,870
So salty.

98
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,110
Impossible.

99
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,350
My brother's cooking must be...

100
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,909
It's indeed a bit salty.

101
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,090
So my brother makes mistakes too.

102
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,310
But it's okay.

103
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,310
No one is perfect.

104
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,350
The Venus de Milo

105
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,110
is the most beautiful, right?

106
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,420
Thank you, Nan Hua.

107
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,270
I thought

108
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,540
I could never eat Grandma's cooking again.

109
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,600
In the future, I'll cook for you often.

110
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,790
Thank you.

111
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,340
Thank you.

112
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,150
Brother.

113
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:56,740
I've washed the dishes.

114
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,610
But why does the light in the kitchen keep flickering?

115
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,490
It's creepy.

116
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,630
Maybe something is wrong with it.

117
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,960
I'll check it out later.

118
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,110
Were you taking pictures of Jin Xia secretly?

119
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,990
No.

120
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,380
I just got a phone.

121
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,990
I was studying its functions.

122
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,390
Let's take a selfie then.

123
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,750
I think I'll pass.

124
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,080
I'm not doing this for myself.

125
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,590
I just want to teach you

126
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,350
how to use the front camera.

127
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:24,630
Okay.

128
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:31,850
Done.

129
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,480
Well... I closed my eyes.

130
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,540
Let's take another photo.

131
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,590
I think it's good.

132
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,470
I...

133
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,110
No. Let's do it again.

134
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,350
Please. Please.

135
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,270
It's good this time, right?

136
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,270
No, Brother.

137
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,909
The photo was not taken.

138
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,040
You need to tap this.

139
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,870
Let me do it.

140
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,080
This one is good.

141
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,200
Send it to me.

142
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,630
H-How?

143
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,430
Let me teach you.

144
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,630
Brother, I didn't expect

145
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,030
that you've taken so many photos of Jin Xia.

146
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,070
Yanhai,

147
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,340
go... take a shower.

148
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,310
I've had a tiring day.

149
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,470
I stink due to my sweat.

150
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,930
I'm going to take a shower.

151
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,470
Jin Xia, may I use your shower room?

152
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,659
Help yourself.

153
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,670
Nan Hua.

154
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,710
Go ahead.

155
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,660
I'm gonna massage your shoulders.

156
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:37,299
Jin Xia,

157
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,299
actually, I have something to tell you.

158
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,470
What is it?

159
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,620
When I had a fever that day,

160
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,190
I heard what you said.

161
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,550
Nan Hua,

162
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,640
can you not disappear?

163
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,050
I'm your power bank, right?

164
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,430
Is it possible

165
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,620
that even if the ancient cherry tree withers,

166
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,510
I can still keep recharging you

167
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,550
as long as I'm with you?

168
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,310
You... heard it?

169
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,630
Yes.

170
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,660
So I'm here to confirm it again with you.

171
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,740
If you were not joking,

172
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,970
are you willing to replace the ancient cherry tree

173
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,170
to recharge me for the rest of your life?

174
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,160
I was not joking.

175
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,520
I was serious.

176
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,680
That's good.

177
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,030
In this way,

178
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,430
I can live with you

179
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,490
and die with you.

180
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,750
During the days we have left,

181
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,010
I will be with you and protect you

182
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,740
every year, every month,

183
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,200
every day, every hour,

184
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,260
and every second.

185
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,660
Thank you.

186
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,510
Actually, there is one more thing

187
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,840
I want to explain to you.

188
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,030
Grandma asked me if I could marry you.

189
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,050
I didn't agree immediately.

190
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,190
It's fine.

191
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,730
It's an important matter.

192
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,980
Of course you shouldn't agree easily.

193
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,760
I understand.

194
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,030
Actually, it was because...

195
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,490
I've forgotten many things.

196
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,140
Although I tried my best to remember,

197
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,870
they are just fragments.

198
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,110
So...

199
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,010
I'm worried I married someone before.

200
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,740
In this era, it will be considered bigamy, right?

201
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,150
If that is the case,

202
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,550
I'll let Grandma down and hurt you.

203
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,190
So...

204
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,950
you've remembered everything?

205
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,070
I tried my best to recall my past.

206
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,960
At least, I...

207
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,670
didn't sleep with anyone.

208
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,120
So I don't think I married anyone.

209
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,870
What?

210
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,440
So give me some time.

211
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,190
I'll think about it carefully.

212
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,020
Of course, your willingness is the top priority.

213
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,770
If you are not willing,

214
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,680
I'm sorry for being rude. Don't be angry.

215
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,110
I'm not angry.

216
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,160
I just think it's a pity.

217
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,470
If Grandma could hear what you said,

218
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,550
she would be so happy.

219
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,540
I'm sorry for being late.

220
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,890
It took me 1,000 years to find you.

221
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,380
Brother, I'm done.

222
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,470
What are you...

223
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,040
Nothing.

224
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,130
I'm going to take a shower.

225
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,690
Rest early. Good night.

226
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,430
I'm going back to my room.

227
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,330
Brother, are you taking photos of me secretly?

228
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,180
No.

229
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,930
Then why did you ignore me?

230
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,130
What were you looking at?

231
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,460
I didn't ignore you.

232
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,980
I've answered all your questions, right?

233
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,800
But I want to know more.

234
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,410
I want to know everything about you over the past few thousand years.

235
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,320
I've told you almost everything I remember.

236
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,580
I've forgotten the rest.

237
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,580
Then when can you remember all of it?

238
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,120
I don't know.

239
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,430
But my memories have been recovered more quickly recently.

240
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,430
Thanks to Jin Xia.

241
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,720
Brother, do you really think

242
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,390
Jin Xia is the person you've been waiting for?

243
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,390
Of course.

244
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,710
What if

245
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,870
Jin Xia is not the one you've been waiting for?

246
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,130
Have you ever thought what you should do?

247
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,120
You got me here.

248
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,730
I don't know.

249
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,230
But...

250
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,310
I believe

251
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,530
she is definitely the one I've been waiting for.

252
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:30,980
Brother,

253
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,410
have you really fallen in love with Jin Xia?

254
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:41,360
Yanhai.

255
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:46,040
What is it like to like someone?

256
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,590
How should I put it?

257
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,410
Maybe I'm an example.

258
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,610
I want to know everything about you.

259
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,960
Everything.

260
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:08,060
[Jin Xiaxiaxia]

261
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,680
Brother.

262
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,560
Brother, what's wrong?

263
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,840
Brother!

264
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,530
Brother, what's wrong? Brother!

265
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,650
Jin Xia. Jin Xia.

266
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,620
Jin Xia.

267
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,360
What's wrong?

268
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:42,910
Nan Hua.

269
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,780
I don't know why

270
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,270
his body suddenly became so cold.

271
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,150
What happened?

272
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,650
His body is really cold.

273
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,000
Be careful.

274
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,260
What happened?

275
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,520
Why is his body so cold?

276
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,430
I'm sorry.

277
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,070
I promised not to be your burden.

278
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,740
Maybe I've consumed too much spiritual energy, so...

279
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,200
You've consumed too much spiritual energy.

280
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,100
Recharge. Let me recharge you.

281
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,530
How are you feeling? Are you feeling better?

282
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,350
It's delayed again?

283
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,960
Jin Xia, really?

284
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,020
You're thinking about taking advantage of my brother now?

285
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,620
Take him to the hospital now.

286
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,470
You don't understand.

287
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:38,060
It won't help even if we take him to the hospital.

288
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,070
Then I'm going to boil some water.

289
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:39,710
Okay.

290
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,150
It still doesn't work?

291
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,210
I'm sorry.

292
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:48,970
Whatever.

293
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,349
It... works now, right?

294
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,720
No?

295
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,089
What should we do then?

296
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,060
Maybe I'm too far from home.

297
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:22,250
I'm going to take you home.

298
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,040
You...

299
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,710
stay here

300
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:28,060
to take care of Grandma's funeral.

301
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,780
Let Yanhai take me home.

302
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,550
But you...

303
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,700
The ancient tree hasn't withered yet.

304
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,660
Everything will be fine as long as I go back.

305
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,550
Don't worry.

306
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,390
Okay.

307
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,440
Ding, come and help.

308
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,410
Get him in the car.

309
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,210
Coming.

310
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:05,920
We...

311
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,800
We are gonna drive your car.

312
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,100
Is it okay?

313
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,590
Will it be inconvenient for you to go out?

314
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,550
You still care about this

315
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,550
at this moment?

316
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:14,840
Don't worry.

317
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,070
The town is small.

318
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,090
The places are only a few steps away.

319
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:18,990
Besides,

320
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,730
I need to sort out Grandma's belongings these days.

321
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,930
I won't go out often.

322
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,720
Okay.

323
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,240
I'll be back when I recover.

324
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,590
Stop talking. Go now.

325
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,770
Ding, be careful.

326
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,350
Goodbye, Jin Xia.

327
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:48,100
Why... did I fail to recharge him?

328
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,740
Brother, what happened to your hand?

329
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,150
I've consumed too much spiritual energy.

330
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:21,940
It's okay.

331
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,600
Luckily, there won't be a traffic jam at this hour.

332
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,960
What on earth happened?

333
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,240
Why did I fail to recharge him?

334
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,990
Was it because...

335
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,080
he's too far away from home?

336
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:40,110
Last time when he fainted outside the company,

337
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,870
although it was delayed,

338
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,910
it worked in the end.

339
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,840
Could it be that... it's no longer effective?

340
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,680
What if the cherry tree withers?

341
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,870
Could it be that... I can't make Nan Hua stay at all?

342
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,030
No, no.

343
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,050
How could this happen?

344
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,310
I'm gonna ask Jin Xia.

345
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:15,900
No.

346
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,110
Don't tell her.

347
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,710
They are almost there.

348
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,270
He will be fine.

349
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,090
He'll be fine after he goes home.

350
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,580
Isn't this...

351
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,050
I'm here today

352
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,040
to tell you something.

353
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,630
Do you remember this?

354
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,140
I left this for the viscount.

355
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:16,280
The place where he finally appeared is not far from here.

356
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:45,790
An ancient ancestral hall was destroyed in a mountain.

357
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,000
50 years ago,

358
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,910
in a mountain near Globefish Town,

359
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:52,530
there was

360
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,940
an ancient ancestral hall.

361
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,350
According to historians,

362
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,240
the ancestral hall was built in the Han dynasty,

363
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,610
with a history of over 2,000 years up to now.

364
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,990
It's hard to verify who was worshiped in it.

365
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,430
It was a precious historic site.

366
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,020
Unfortunately,

367
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,460
this ancient ancestral hall was demolished

368
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,990
by the local residents of Globefish Town

369
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:18,510
due to urban development and construction 50 years ago.

370
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,150
The leader of the people who demolished the ancestral hall

371
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,440
was a young woman at that time.

372
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,840
Grandma?

373
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,230
Brother, be careful.

374
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,300
Hello, Ding. How is he?

375
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,490
Have you arrived?

376
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,710
Jin Xia,

377
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,070
I've put my brother in the coffin.

378
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,040
Don't worry.

379
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:08,780
That's good.

380
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,670
Is he feeling better?

381
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,510
I think he will be fine.

382
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,000
I think his body temperature has started to rise.

383
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,360
That's good. That's good.

384
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,220
Thank you.

385
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,700
I may have to trouble you these days.

386
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,040
I can't do anything to help here.

387
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,530
Don't worry.

388
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,350
I'll tell you if anything happens to him.

389
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,150
Thank you.

390
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,060
No need.

391
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,830
He saved me before.

392
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,970
Now it's my turn to save him.

393
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,030
It's not a big deal.

394
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,140
I have to go.

395
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,510
I'm going to take care of him.

396
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,880
Okay, bye.

397
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,310
Rest early. Bye.

398
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:55,120
I'm glad he's okay.

Okay.

410
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,220

He was in good condition yesterday.

416
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,560
I'm going to check on him again now.

417
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,350
If he wakes up,

418
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,750
I'll tell you right away.

419
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,430
I hope everything will go smoothly at the funeral.

00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,230
[Okay]

422
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,380
Xia.

423
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,950
Xiang, you're here.

424
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,060
Brother!

425
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,520
Thank you

426
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,200
for attending my grandma's funeral.

427
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,400
I don't have parents.

428
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:58,790
Grandma brought me up.

429
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,690
Everyone in this town should know that.

430
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,730
I always thought I still had a lot of time to be with my grandma.

431
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,990
But I never thought

432
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,170
she passed away suddenly.

433
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,780
I didn't realize

434
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:31,050
she seemed... to have never played another role,

435
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:33,580
except the role of Jin Xia's grandma,

436
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,510
until she passed away.

437
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,450
She had many wishes.

438
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:43,900
She wanted me to eat well

439
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,510
and grow taller.

440
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,600
She wanted me to be patient

441
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,980
and didn't want me to be bullied.

442
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,640
She wanted me to have a good job,

443
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,000
find a good husband,

444
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,740
and have my own house.

445
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,350
But I don't know...

446
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,200
which wish was about herself.

447
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,190
I won't have a chance...

448
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,370
to know her.

449
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,560
I won't have a chance...

450
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,130
to tell her

451
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,700
that Grandma,

452
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,970
I'll make your wishes come true.

453
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,230
I'll make up...

454
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,640
for your regrets.

455
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,340
Grandma.

456
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:02,020
What should I do after you're gone?

457
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,670
I'm alone.

458
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,650
You're not alone.

459
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,790
Brother, where did you go?

460
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:30,719
I was so worried.

461
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:32,560
And you didn't answer my calls.

462
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,460
I thought... you turned into ashes.

463
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,230
Sorry.

464
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,389
I left in a hurry and forgot to tell you.

465
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:38,949
Brother,

466
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:41,250
then why didn't you call me?

467
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,719
I was helping Jin Xia with the funeral.

468
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,710
The schedule was very tight.

469
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,440
So I wanted to call you back after it's over.

470
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,739
What about Jin Xia?

471
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,070
Why didn't she answer my calls either?

472
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,130
Her cellphone is dead because of you.

473
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:55,469
You don't care about my feelings anyway.

474
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,730
I'm sorry.

475
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:58,930
I was thoughtless this time.

476
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:01,350
How about this?

477
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,630
After I go back, I'll cook for you for a week

478
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,550
as an apology. Okay?

479
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,240
R-Really?

480
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:08,600
It's a deal then.

481
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:10,290
Brother, bye.

482
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,500
Bye.

483
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:22,000
Why are you... looking at me like this?

484
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:23,950
Nothing.

485
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,940
How are you... feeling?

486
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,550
I'm feeling great. Don't worry.

487
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,080
I have plenty of spiritual energy.

488
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:36,840
That's good.

489
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,440
Actually, you didn't have to come to keep me company.

490
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,950
If...

491
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,820
If what?

492
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,390
If what happened to you last time happens to you again, what should I do?

493
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:55,180
I might not recharge you successfully.

494
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,630
I promised

495
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,410
to recharge you for the rest of my life.

496
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,740
But I failed to recharge you immediately.

497
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,720
Will it... never work again?

498
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,490
What does it matter?

499
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:11,160
It matters a lot.

500
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,360
If it will never work,

501
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:16,580
after the ancient cherry tree withers, what should I...

502
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,750
what should you do?

503
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,210
I forgot to tell you good news just now.

504
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:31,860
Looks like the ancient cherry tree won't wither.

505
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:36,800
What do you mean?

506
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,390
When I woke up today,

507
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,340
I felt I've recovered.

508
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,860
So I wanted to come to you immediately.

509
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,990
When I passed through the yard,

510
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:57,180
I saw the ancient cherry tree vibrant

511
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,680
and covered in blossoms.

512
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,150
I was surprised.

513
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:23,410
The vessel is closely related to my condition.

514
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,290
I almost lost my life,

515
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,870
but it didn't wither at all.

516
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,050
I checked it.

517
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,310
In the end, I found

518
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,690
it has sprouted new rhizomes.

519
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,510
New rhizomes?

520
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,550
Yes.

521
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:53,030
The ancient cherry tree is coming back to life itself.

522
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,470
Does that mean...

523
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,880
you won't disappear?

524
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,210
Yes.

525
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,390
That's great.

526
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:09,790
But... why?

527
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,710
Didn't you say

528
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:12,760
the withering of the ancient tree

529
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,520
can't be undone or fixed?

530
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,270
I'm curious too.

531
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:21,430
Maybe... it's also because of you.

532
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:22,650
Me?

533
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,220
I'm curious about this too.

534
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,600
I'll figure it out after we go back.

535
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,220
Then let's pack the things now.

536
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,500
I'm gonna book a hitch ride service online.

537
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,960
Why are you in such a hurry?

538
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,030
I've asked for too many days of leave.

539
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,830
I left too much work unfinished.

540
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,310
If I still don't go back to the company,

541
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,960
I might be fired.

542
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:53,040
And... I don't want to see you

543
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,670
get sick again.

544
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:57,710
Go back to the tree early,

545
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,020
and I can rest assured.

546
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:00,670
Okay.

547
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:05,190
If... that's the case,

548
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,110
does that mean you don't

549
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,720
need me anymore?

550
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:14,730
The ancient cherry tree has just begun to sprout rhizomes.

551
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,390
I'm afraid it will take over 100 years

552
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,950
for it to provide abundant spiritual energy

553
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,070
like before.

554
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,220
Really?

555
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,990
Why are you laughing?

556
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,030
Nothing.

557
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,610
I'll leave the living room to you.

558
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,060
I'm going to pack the things in the room.

559
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,890
Okay.

560
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:39,730
But...

561
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,660
this is indeed strange.

562
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,580
I must investigate it thoroughly.

563
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,480
Xiaochuan.

564
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,150
Thank you, Ding.

565
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,110
So, Xiaochuan,

566
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,070
you haven't eaten for too long

567
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,430
because you've been on a diet.

568
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,380
That's why you passed out from hunger.

569
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:20,940
Yes.

570
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,300
I'm starving. I don't want to lose weight anymore.

571
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,350
But no one is at their home today.

572
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:27,900
How did you get in?

573
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,860
Jin Xia gave me a spare key.

574
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,630
Then... you are here to...

575
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:38,060
I came to see Nan Hua.

576
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,080
But he's not here.

577
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:40,190
Where did he go?

578
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,360
Has he recovered?

579
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,050
He has almost recovered.

580
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:43,780
Then...

581
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,800
he went to Jin Xia.

582
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,310
So my trip is in vain.

583
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:50,420
Fine. Just pretend I never came.

584
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:52,950
Ding,

585
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:56,290
can you not tell them

586
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,150
that I passed out today?

587
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,780
Jin Xia is strongly against me being on a diet.

588
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:04,350
If she knows, she'll keep complaining.

589
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,680
No problem. I'll keep it a secret for you.

590
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,510
Ding, you're so nice.

591
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:10,740
I'm so full.

592
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:11,650
I'm alive.

593
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,140
Where's the bathroom?

594
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,280
Over there. To the right.

595
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:20,130
I need to use the bathroom. May I?

596
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,430
Nan Hua,

597
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,110
how should I tell you this?

598
00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:00,770
Actually, it was Grandma who demolished the ancestral hall of the viscount.

599
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,430
Jin Xia, I've packed the things outside.

600
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:07,840
Let me... help you.

601
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,860
Sorry, I scared you.

602
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:17,500
No.

603
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:20,180
I got too absorbed in my thoughts just now.

604
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:22,560
What did you say?

605
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,100
Let me help you.

606
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,880
Okay, thank you.

607
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:43,570
Jin Xia, do you still want this sketchbook?

608
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,480
Jin Xia.

609
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,660
Do you still want this sketchbook?

610
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:03,710
[Jin Xia]

611
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:03,530
This?

612
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:06,390
I don't... want this.

613
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,880
Why are you absent-minded?

614
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:11,680
Am I?

615
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:12,990
Yes.

616
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:17,020
Are you thinking about Grandma?

617
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:20,910
I... I...

618
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:21,910
It's all my fault.

619
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,260
I left you at your most difficult time

620
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,670
and let you face everything alone.

621
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:26,520
No.

622
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,640
Nan Hua, I can't lie to you.

623
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,550
I think...

624
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,470
I know

625
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:44,930
how Grandma got the voice recording marble.

626
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:48,940
It's okay.

627
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:53,440
Actually, I already knew long ago.

628
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:57,880
You knew?

629
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,740
How did you know?

630
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:08,370
Actually, when I control others,

631
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:10,720
I can see their inner fear.

632
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:18,740
When I was in Grandma's body

633
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,440
to say goodbye to you that day,

634
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,350
I saw her fear too.

635
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,980
You said

636
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:30,260
Grandma would never go to temples or ancestral halls.

637
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,320
She would even make a detour when she saw one, right?

638
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:38,110
When I was in her body,

639
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:40,360
I saw that when she was young,

640
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,430
she demolished some old buildings like temples and ancestral halls

641
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:44,000
for the urban construction of Globefish Town.

642
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,180
Some of them were precious relics.

643
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,400
Since that, she had felt regretful and guilty.

644
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:51,130
But she felt embarrassed to tell anyone.

645
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:53,180
So it became a burden in her heart.

646
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,060
So you mean

647
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:58,910
the reason why Grandma wouldn't enter temples

648
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,570
is not that she didn't believe in ghosts or gods.

649
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:04,870
It's... because of the burden in her heart. Right?

650
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:07,440
Yes.

651
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,890
Well... since you know

652
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,780
she demolished the ancestral hall of the viscount,

653
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:15,460
aren't you angry?

654
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,170
I've seen too many ups and downs.

655
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:23,740
What was new

656
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:25,820
gradually became a history.

657
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,600
What your grandma experienced was the tide of the times.

658
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,030
It was not her personal preference.

659
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:32,430
She shouldn't be blamed.

660
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:37,480
Besides, what's more important is people,

661
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,160
not objects.

662
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:40,910
I have you.

663
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:43,620
Why would I be obsessed with an ancestral hall?

664
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,360
Nan Hua,

665
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:48,410
you're so nice.

666
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,500
Actually, after I came to this town,

667
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,430
I gradually remembered something

668
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:57,760
when I saw those things.

669
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,440
I didn't expect you

670
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,730
to still keep the earrings.

671
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:33,550
They belonged to the viscount.

672
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:35,470
Of course I'll keep them well.

673
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,680
The viscount?

674
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:41,060
It's been 30 years.

675
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,950
When I just got married to His Majesty back then,

676
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:46,560
I was ignorant.

677
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,590
If it weren't for your help,

678
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:52,500
I wouldn't have become the empress.

679
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:55,140
I did help you

680
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:56,790
to get what you have now.

681
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:58,720
But you helped yourself the most.

682
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:01,620
All these years, the world has been in peace,

683
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:02,990
the country has been prosperous, and the people have been strong.

684
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:03,920
Even without me,

685
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,920
you still did a great job. Right?

686
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:07,510
Nan Hua,

687
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:10,620
are you blaming me

688
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,230
for not visiting you for so many years?

689
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:15,510
I don't care.

690
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,150
There are many restrictions for people in the imperial palace.

691
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:21,350
Besides, I'm trapped in this mountain.

692
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:22,800
It's a long journey.

693
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,130
There is nothing you can do.

694
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:25,060
That's not true.

695
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,540
It was not because I didn't want to come.

696
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,360
It was because I dare not come.

697
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:33,850
You dare not?

698
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,020
I'm here today

699
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,590
to tell you something.

700
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:42,280
The earrings I gave you

701
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:45,320
are not mine.

702
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:50,900
Back then, someone gave me this pair of earrings

703
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,660
and told me

704
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:56,030
with them as the token, I can get help from an immortal

705
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:58,250
to enjoy a lifetime of wealth and honor.

706
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:01,080
That person guided me here to look for you.

707
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:04,610
Who was it?

708
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,630
A young lady.
