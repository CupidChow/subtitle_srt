00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,160
In the several thousand years of human history,

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,040
there have been many unsolved mysteries.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,960
Are the stories of Dayu controlling the flood and Nvwa mending the sky myths?

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,560
Why would the advancement of human civilization

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,760
surpass its current situations?

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,800
There are all kinds of speculations.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,760
But in fact, the truth

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,760
dates back to the ancient times.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,400
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,720
the highly developed

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,360
prehistoric civilizations once existed on Earth.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,680
Back then, the ancient people

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,080
mastered the scientific civilization far more advanced than that in modern society.

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,160
Their high-level genetic modification technology

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,280
even enabled them to develop

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,390
human potential to the greatest extent.

18
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,960
They could absorb the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,820
to stay alive and even exert extraordinary energy.

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,720
However, a tragic doomsday disaster

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,400
made those human beings almost extinct at that time.

22
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:01,720
Countless lives

23
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,920
and brilliant civilizations were destroyed overnight.

24
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,960
Only a small number of ancient people

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,560
survived the doomsday

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,330
after escaping to the underground in time

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,789
and entering into a frozen hibernation state.

28
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:14,450
After that,

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,190
through tens of thousands of years of self-repair,

30
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,480
our Earth conceived new intelligent lives again,

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,740
namely, the ancestors of modern people.

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,080
And the ancient people sleeping in the underground areas

33
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,480
woke up one after another

34
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,160
and returned to the land.

35
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,870
They saw

36
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,820
the new primitive humans who were still trying to make fire by drilling wood.

37
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,920
Out of good intentions,

38
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,030
they taught the younger generations

39
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,039
many technologies, such as farming, metallurgy,

40
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,800
construction, flood control, and precautions against natural disasters.

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,729
Many great civilization miracles

42
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,120
were the masterpieces made

43
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,850
by our ancestors with the help of ancient people.

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,759
At that time, the new human beings

45
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,890
[Fuxi Temple]

46
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,960
considered the ancient people with extraordinary energy as deities.

47
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,690
They built temples for them and worshipped them.

48
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,200
As the official historians of various countries exaggerated the stories about them,

49
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,720
many legendary ancient myths have been passed down till now.

50
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,240
In this way,

51
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,440
most ancient people around the world

52
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,360
fitted into the new world with the identities

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,520
of deities.

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,840
But there were also some low-profile ancient people

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,300
who chose to live in seclusion in deep mountains to escape from the mortal world.

56
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,070
However,

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,320
people's worship towards the deities

58
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,400
also gradually generated fear and desires.

59
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,190
The rulers feared that the power of deities

60
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,829
would become a threat to their royal power.

61
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:29,390
But they were also greedy

62
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,120
for immortality and the extraordinary power.

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,780
Therefore,

64
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,720
they used various excuses

65
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
to start wars

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,850
against the deities from time to time.

67
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,829
The ancient people were outnumbered

68
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,320
and were no match for the huge armies in the end.

69
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,920
They almost became extinct.

70
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,600
Little did they know

71
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,950
that by imparting the knowledge of weapon forging to the new humans

72
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,150
they unwittingly unleashed a disaster upon themselves.

73
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,840
Although the ancient people who lived in deep mountains

74
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,400
survived this disaster,

75
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,920
they were hunted by the rulers continuously.

76
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,240
They were even slandered

77
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,510
and considered as horrible mountain spirits or ferocious ghosts.

78
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,880
In the blink of an eye,

79
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,750
those who had been regarded as deities became devils that everyone wanted to kill.

80
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,240
As everything keeps changing in the world,

81
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,920
no one knows the existence of the ancient people anymore.

82
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,270
Only those anecdotes and peculiar stories about ghosts and monsters

83
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,350
have been passed down from generation to generation.

84
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,070
And the tiny minority of ancient people who have survived

85
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,750
are still secretly hiding

86
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,640
in those covert corners in the world till now.

87
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,590
Not bad.

88
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,770
You're back.

89
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,370
Are you okay?

90
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,790
Don't fight because of us.

91
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,780
Don't get us wrong.

92
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,310
We're very close.

93
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,040
We need to do something urgent.

94
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,600
We need to find a place to be alone.

95
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,440
We have to leave early.

96
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,390
Got it.

97
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,450
What are you talking about?

98
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,650
Public display of affection.

99
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,390
Sorry, everyone.

100
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,970
Sometimes, Jin Xia

101
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,740
is indeed irresistible to me,

102
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,950
so we can't accompany you.

103
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,700
I'm sorry.

104
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,080
It's over.

105
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,200
What did you hear?

106
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,680
Nan Hua, I didn't know.

107
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,750
Respect!

108
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,680
Senior Bai Bing.

109
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,470
This is the key to our house.

110
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,430
Why are you giving me the key?

111
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,240
It might take a long time, so...

112
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,600
What are you talking about?

113
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,829
Let's go.

114
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,790
Have fun!

115
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,780
Did you prepare all these?

116
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,170
Yes.

117
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,310
When did you

118
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,000
prepare these behind my back?

119
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:57,680
I stayed up the whole night with Yanhai.

120
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,980
You stayed up all night to do this?

121
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,350
I wanted to take my time,

122
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,720
but you were indeed

123
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,440
too irresistible last night.

124
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,730
I didn't want to suffer like that every night.

125
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,320
So, I decided

126
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,920
to advance our Settling Plan.

127
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,710
Stop it.

128
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,080
However,

129
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,360
where did you get the key to the studio?

130
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,580
I've rented this studio.

131
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,800
In the future,

132
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,090
you can just focus on your design career.

133
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,320
Leave the rest to me.

134
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,110
Let's work hard

135
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,080
to run this studio

136
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,560
and

137
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,100
run our future life together.

138
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,120
Are you willing?

139
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:11,000
This studio is small

140
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,050
and there's not much space,

141
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,230
but I believe,

142
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,540
before long,

143
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,750
this room will be full of

144
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,920
the most beautiful clothes in the world

145
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,760
you designed.

146
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,160
Then we have to work hard together.

147
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,800
Will you…

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,230
marry me

149
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,660
and be the mistress of the Nan family?

150
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,590
I...

151
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,630
I do.

152
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,640
Nan Hua.

153
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,770
You've done so much for me.

154
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,280
I think I should do something to repay you.

155
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,770
What do you mean?

156
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,150
To get married,

157
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,970
having a house and a dream are not enough.

158
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,920
You still need a wedding suit.

159
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,510
Can I measure

160
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,910
my model for the suit now?

161
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,040
Is Mr. Model  available tonight?

162
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,910
Of course.

163
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,430
News from our correspondence:

164
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,000
at 10:30 last night,

165
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,560
the circuit of our city broke down,

166
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,590
which caused a major blackout in the whole city area.

167
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,430
This is the first time

168
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,360
we had a citywide blackout accident.

169
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,290
Extraordinary.

170
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,030
A citywide blackout.

171
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,230
It's so rare that it's like something in a movie.

172
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,060
Jin Xia,

173
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,550
why do you think that happened?

174
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,840
I...

175
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,700
How would I know why?

176
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,940
I'll get you some snacks.

177
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,070
…to cooperate proactively.

178
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,260
The power failure is still unsolved.

179
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,800
Jin Xia.

180
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,800
Nan Hua, you...

181
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,110
Nan Hua?

182
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,440
Last night…

183
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,120
How could I faint?

184
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,320
Jin Xia must think I'm the worst.

185
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,560
Let's go out together

186
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,120
after she comes back.

187
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,680
Sure.

188
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,150
Okay.

189
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:03,780
Why do you girls

190
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,520
like shopping everywhere?

191
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,870
Come on.

192
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,310
This kind of town is actually very special.

193
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,510
It's worth visiting.

194
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,440
What do you know?

195
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,150
Yes, I want to go around, too.

196
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,250
Then let's go. I'll go with you.

197
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,670
So cheesy.

198
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,560
Nan Hua is awake.

199
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
Is Nan Hua awake?

200
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,600
I think so.

201
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
Let me take a look.

202
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,600
Could it be…

203
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,680
I suddenly remembered

204
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,030
Nan Hua said he was going fishing this morning.

205
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,110
He went fishing.

206
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,720
No, I think I just saw him.

207
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,480
You saw it wrong.

208
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,800
But I think I saw him too.

209
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,660
I've checked the room.

210
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,670
No one is here.

211
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,220
You must've made a mistake.

212
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,710
By the way,

213
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,470
it's getting late.

214
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,120
Didn't you say you wanted to go to the market?

215
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,540
The good stuff will be all gone if we're late.

216
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,080
Let's go.

217
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,360
Yes, let's go now.

218
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,920
Let's go.

219
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,120
Guys,

220
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,000
I am a little tired out from yesterday.

221
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,400
I won't go with you.

222
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,760
We understand.

223
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,670
We understand.

224
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,160
Then go back and rest.

225
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,480
-Have a good rest.
-Okay.

226
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,400
Have fun.

227
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,950
Bye. Have fun.

228
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,040
Bye. Bye.

229
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,240
Let's go.

230
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,870
That guy!

231
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,800
Is he too embarrassed to see me,

232
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,260
so he fled from the window?

233
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,920
Nan Hua.

234
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,280
Are you here, Nan Hua?

235
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,200
No?

236
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,310
I knew you were here.

237
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,960
How could you see me?

238
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,880
Come on.

239
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,990
The bell was ringing by itself.

240
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,640
Who else could it be?

241
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,870
I forgot that. I'm sorry.

242
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,390
You should be sorry.

243
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,520
Do you know

244
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,520
that I didn't know how to explain to them?

245
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,170
I almost got caught lying.

246
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,720
I meant yesterday.

247
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,150
Yesterday?

248
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,840
It was great yesterday.

249
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:03,990
Well...

250
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,210
It was indeed awful.

251
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,190
You were cute.

252
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,550
Cute how?

253
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,440
It's the first time for a one-thousand-year-old virgin.

254
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,120
Alright, don't be mad.

255
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,350
You cherished our first time

256
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,960
so much.

257
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,560
I'm more than happy.

258
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,240
Why would I feel bad?

259
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,360
Nan Hua.

260
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,400
No one in this world

261
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,480
treats me better than you, except my late Grandma.

262
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,940
Don't mind these trifles.

263
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,030
This gentle and innocent you

264
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,240
is the one I like the most.

265
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,560
Really?

266
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,680
Yes.

267
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,030
I like you very, very, very much!

268
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,430
Leave the rest

269
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:04,360
to me, who's from the modern times.

270
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,440
Don't worry.

271
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,320
I promise I'll do very well next time.

272
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,910
Well...

273
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,720
You don't need to make a promise on this kind of thing.

274
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,390
I mean it.

275
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,530
Can you give me another chance?

276
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,200
Well...

277
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:44,880
Big Bro.

278
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,460
What are you doing?

279
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,000
Enjoying the sea breeze.

280
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,190
What do you want?

281
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,060
I have something serious.

282
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:02,830
Bro,

283
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,830
the antique collector who bought your earrings

284
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:05,880
wants to see you.

285
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,960
See me?

286
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,260
I don't know where he got the news,

287
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,200
but he knew I was not the real seller,

288
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,360
so he asked to meet you.

289
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,040
He's willing to pay only after meeting you.

290
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,600
When?

291
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,970
This afternoon.

292
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,470
All of a sudden?

293
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,440
Yes.

294
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,120
That's why I called him right away.

295
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,320
But he didn't pick up.

296
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,400
I went to your house to look for you,

297
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,180
and you weren't there.

298
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,630
I ended up coming here.

299
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,880
[Party A: Nan Hua] [Party B: Lin Jiarui]

300
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,510
My guess was right.

301
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,080
You're the sellers behind Ding.

302
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,120
Look.

303
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,440
These earrings

304
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,230
belonged to my mother when she was young.

305
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,430
She gave them to someone.

306
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,020
I guess it must have been Mr. Nan Hua's grandfather.

307
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,210
These were not presents she regifted.

308
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,480
They belonged to me…

309
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,570
my grandpa in the first place.

310
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,580
Don't get me wrong.

311
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,370
I don't mean anything else.

312
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,950
I'll still sign the contract.

313
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,200
The price will not change.

314
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,200
It's just… if you can sell this pair of earrings,

315
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,070
will you consider selling the house, too?

316
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,000
Sorry, Mr. Lin.

317
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,470
We won't sell

318
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,520
this house no matter what.

319
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,840
It's indeed the same as my mother said.

320
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,760
What?

321
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,590
My mother said

322
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,280
Mr. Nan Hua won't sell this house.

323
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,360
So she doesn't plan

324
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,240
to buy this house back anymore.

325
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,390
She also asked me to tell you

326
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,910
that she hopes you can live

327
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,960
happily and healthily in this house.

328
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,320
Then thank her for me.

329
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,670
She also asked me

330
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,000
if you are facing any financial difficulties,

331
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,760
now that you had auctioned off the earrings?

332
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:33,550
No.

333
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,730
I just don't want to keep them anymore.

334
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,560
Is that so?

335
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,760
We've met you.

336
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,840
Can we start

337
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,170
on the payment already?

338
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,720
Can I add another suggestion?

339
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,200
What is it?

340
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,840
Mr. Nan Hua, I hope

341
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,960
you can go to Taiwan

342
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,200
and meet my mother.

343
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,900
I'm afraid it has nothing to do with our deal.

344
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,040
This is just a private request.

345
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,760
My mother wanted to come here herself,

346
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,120
but she's old

347
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,910
and in bad health.

348
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,160
The doctor didn't allow her to take the plane anymore.

349
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,720
But she insists

350
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,600
on seeing you one last time.

351
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:29,200
Otherwise, she said, she wouldn't rest in peace.

352
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,120
My mother always does what she says.

353
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,560
If she gets her way,

354
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:39,160
I'm afraid something would happen to her.

355
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,230
So I hope

356
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,120
you can fly to Taiwan, Mr. Nan Hua.

357
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,670
But it's not convenient for me to go on a long trip.

358
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,830
Are there any difficulties?

359
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,310
You can tell me.

360
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,440
I'll try my best to help you.

361
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,910
Mr. Nan,

362
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,840
my mother is

363
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,510
in a really terrible condition.

364
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,710
She's been bedridden for almost a year.

365
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,160
She hasn't been able to eat since last month.

366
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,360
We have to give her nutritional shots to keep her alive.

367
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,700
I don't know why,

368
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,400
but seeing you one last time is her last wish.

369
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
I hope

370
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,000
you can understand my feelings as a son.

371
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,080
Mr. Lin, don't do this.

372
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,160
Nan Hua.

373
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,560
Please.

374
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,120
I beg you.

375
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,310
I'm sorry.

376
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,650
I've made up my mind.

377
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,210
I'm not going to see her.

378
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:31,840
Nan Hua.

379
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,080
It's a pity that you're not a chef.

380
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,040
Yeah.

381
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,160
We only bought ordinary vegetables

382
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,560
from an ordinary market.

383
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,920
How could you whip up such sumptuous delicacies?

384
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,680
It tastes so good.

385
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,120
I'm so full.

386
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,730
I've never been this full in my life. I swear.

387
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,530
It's worth it.

388
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:47,200
Nan Hua.

389
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,040
I really like the Fish Stewed with Soy Milk.

390
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,640
Can you teach me?

391
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,440
Of course.

392
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,990
I think everyone is almost done eating.

393
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,120
I'll tidy it up then.

394
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:02,240
You've already cooked for us.

395
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,120
How can we let you clean up, too?

396
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:04,980
Let us do it.

397
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:05,760
Yes.

398
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,520
We'll do it.

399
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:12,950
Jin Xia.

400
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:16,790
Jin Xia!

401
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,980
What are you thinking?

402
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,440
Nothing.

403
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,120
You didn't eat much today.

404
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,770
Is it not to your liking?

405
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,080
No, it's good.

406
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,290
Especially Fish Steamed with Chili.

407
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,530
It's Fish Stewed with Soy Milk.

408
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,100
Yeah, Fish Stewed with Soy Milk. It is delicious.

409
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,500
I had a slip of the tongue.

410
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,270
You must be tired

411
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,150
after a long day.

412
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,280
Why don't we go to bed early tonight?

413
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,310
We're not tired.

414
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,840
We just went to the market.

415
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,160
It was not tiring.

416
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,630
Really, the girls

417
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:58,880
never know what being tired is like.

418
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,680
It's not even eight o'clock yet.

419
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,040
My grandma doesn't even sleep this early.

420
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,600
Yes.

421
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,600
And on our way back,

422
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,600
we agreed we'd watch a horror movie together tonight.

423
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,520
Watching a horror movie together

424
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,510
in an old house in an ancient town far from the city…

425
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,790
The ambiance will be top!

426
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,310
Jin Xia, Nan Hua, join us.

427
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,750
Sure.

428
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,360
No problem.

429
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,840
What are you watching?

430
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,550
A horror movie.

431
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,660
A horror movie?

432
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,800
I don't think it's appropriate.

433
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,770
It's okay, Jin Xia.

434
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,030
If you're scared,

435
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,540
you can hide in my arms.

436
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,840
Go on. Go on.

437
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,720
It's okay.

438
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,280
Go on.

439
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,280
It's okay.

440
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,320
Ghost! Look behind you!

441
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,430
You're the ghost, aren't you?

442
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,390
You coward.

443
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,240
Nan Hua.

444
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,560
Are you scared?

445
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:25,890
Scared of what?

446
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,320
Ghosts.

447
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,300
Ghosts are just a scam

448
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,040
the schemers designed to frame the ancient people.

449
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,310
What's there to be afraid of?

450
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,510
Right, there are no ghosts in the world.

451
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,230
Then why are you shaking?

452
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,600
I... I'm cold.

453
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,280
Cold?

454
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,400
I'm scared.

455
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,160
Can I sleep under your quilt, too?

456
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,810
Isn't it inappropriate?

457
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,160
No?

458
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,320
Fine.

459
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,640
It's not impossible.

460
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,480
We've already betrothed.

461
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,960
It'll be fine as long as we don't cross the line.

462
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,620
Betrothed?

463
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,000
Is something bothering you?

464
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,000
You seemed distracted

465
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,080
at dinner tonight.

466
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,700
Is it because of Zhou Yinting?

467
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,570
How do you know?

468
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,510
Actually, I was also a little distracted

469
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,560
because of her.

470
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,040
What's wrong?

471
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,990
I remembered some past things with her.

472
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,320
I also figured out one thing.

473
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,870
What is it?

474
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,390
Today, Miss Zhou's son

475
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,000
said I was her mother's first love.

476
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,930
Do you remember?

477
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,670
Did he?

478
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,520
I don't remember.

479
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,360
Forget it, then.

480
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,400
No. Go on.

481
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,160
Actually,

482
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,380
Ms. Zhou did confess her love to me back then.

483
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,760
She wanted to marry me.

484
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,510
and live in the house with me,

485
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,800
but I refused.

486
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:31,880
Refused? Why?

487
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,810
Isn't she the person you're waiting for?

488
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,630
Maybe.

489
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
But what does it have to do with love?

490
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,670
Didn't I just say

491
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,070
I figured something out?

492
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,540
Yes.

493
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,070
What is it?

494
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,380
I fell in love with you.

495
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,950
I want to marry you.

496
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,580
It has nothing to do with whether you are the person I've been waiting for.

497
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,280
I like you

498
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,440
just because you are you.

499
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,580
If it weren't for you,

500
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,200
I wouldn't agree to it

501
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,050
even if it's the person I've been waiting for.

502
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:29,800
Nan Hua.

503
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,440
Let's meet Grandma Zhou for the last time.

504
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,550
Why?

505
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,280
If she is indeed the person you've been waiting for,

506
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,840
say goodbye to her properly.

507
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,590
I don't want you to have regrets.

508
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,550
Besides,

509
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,360
you said

510
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,800
she can't beat me.

511
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,320
Fine.

512
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,680
If it can make you feel more at ease

513
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,480
and have more sense of security,

514
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,200
I'm willing to meet her

515
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,220
and say goodbye for the last time.

516
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,430
I've always felt secure.

517
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,430
After all, I'm so beautiful.

518
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,510
But Ms. Zhou doesn't have much time left.

519
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,500
I'm afraid we'll have to go to Taiwan.

520
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,880
Yeah, what should we do?

521
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,020
You can't stay too far away from home.

522
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:40,160
Maybe I can go back and forth in a short time.

523
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,110
Then, we need to plan well

524
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:46,630
and come back soon.

525
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,000
Jin Xia, Nan Hua.

526
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,590
We've been bothering you so much lately.

527
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,469
Don't mention it.

528
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:09,440
Let me walk you out.

529
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,320
No need.

530
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,989
The car is right at the gate.

531
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:12,920
Let's stop here.

532
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,679
Keep in touch.

533
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,800
Keep in touch.

534
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,199
Don't forget me.

535
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,900
Don't be so sad.

536
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,790
Your place is so nice.

537
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,719
We might want to come here every now and then.

538
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,800
Don't hate us for being so annoying by then.

539
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,730
It's okay. You're always welcome.

540
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,320
I'm going to Milan soon.

541
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,080
I don't know when we'll meet again.

542
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,429
I'm sorry, Jin Xia.

543
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,480
Why are you suddenly apologizing?

544
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,280
The coffee was almost splashed on you.

545
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,860
Actually, it was me...

546
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,830
I'm sorry.

547
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,860
This is for you.

548
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:51,080
I made it myself.

549
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,639
Take it as an apology.

550
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,429
It's okay.

551
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,900
I wasn't hurt that day.

552
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,840
Besides,

553
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,870
it was a long time ago.

554
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,760
We are going to go our separate ways soon.

555
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,790
I don't want to hold any grudges.

556
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,360
I want to apologize to you, too.

557
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,440
Jin Xia, I'm sorry.

558
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,800
I spoke ill of you behind your back.

559
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,400
And me.

560
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,320
Jin Xia, I'm sorry.

561
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:19,870
You...

562
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,560
I didn't expect that I was so unpopular before.

563
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,670
We were just jealous of you.

564
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,370
Look. You're so talented.

565
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,720
The wedding clothes you designed

566
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,480
could've taken part in the big show.

567
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,120
And the model is your boyfriend.

568
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,900
He's not only tall and handsome,

569
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,000
but also talented.

570
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,840
Actually, I also spoke ill of you sometimes.

571
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,000
We're even.

572
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,070
We're even.

573
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,980
Alright, the driver is urging us.

574
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,430
We're leaving.

575
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,300
By the way, Jin Xia,

576
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,760
think about the interview.

577
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,360
Oh, Senior,

578
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,440
I forgot to tell you.

579
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,280
Sorry.

580
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,280
I don't think I need this interview.

581
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,750
Do you have a new plan?

582
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,150
I plan to start my own business with Nan Hua.

583
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,080
It'll be hard.

584
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,570
It's for our dreams.

585
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,400
Isn't every one of you working hard

586
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,460
for your own dream?

587
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:17,950
Anyway,

588
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,560
it's definitely not the last time we'll meet.

589
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,350
Anyway, I'm waiting

590
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,760
to attend your wedding.

591
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:25,830
Yes.

592
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,150
Remember to invite us.

593
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:27,870
And me.

594
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,800
I will.

595
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,390
Okay, we're really leaving now.

596
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:33,440
Take care.

597
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,110
Take care.

598
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,000
Take care. Be safe.

599
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,560
Bye.

600
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,520
Bye.

601
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:44,960
Bye.

602
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,830
All right. All good things must come to an end.

603
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:42,570
People have to learn to say goodbye sooner or later.

604
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,780
Nan Hua, you've lived for so long.

605
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,820
Have you experienced a lot of partings?

606
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,420
Yes, so many that I can't even remember.

607
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,320
Poor you.

608
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,550
Did everything have to come to an end?

609
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,840
If I get old first,

610
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:21,120
will we part?

611
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:20,480
Please come in.

612
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,830
My mother is inside.

613
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,000
Please come in.

614
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:43,680
Nan Hua, I won't go inside.

615
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,550
I think Grandma Zhou must have a lot

616
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,610
that she wants to tell you in private.

617
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,150
I'm…

618
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,410
I'll wait for you here.

619
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,800
I'm not going anywhere.

620
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:54,840
Okay.

621
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,560
The decoration style here

622
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:18,350
is similar to the design drafts previously drawn by Nan Hua.

623
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,520
Grandma Zhou must like Nan Hua very much.

624
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,630
This is the third time

625
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,520
and the last time.

626
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,300
It's enough to support this overseas trip.

627
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,280
Mom. Mom.

628
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,700
The descendant of Mr. Nan Hua is here.

629
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,920
His name is Nan Hua, too.

630
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,670
I'm…

631
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,540
I'm sorry.

632
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:43,200
I'm old.

633
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:46,760
I'm dying.

634
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,060
I can't make up for anything.

635
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,200
How was it?

636
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:13,080
Is she the person you've been waiting for?

637
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:16,310
She's a fraud.

638
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,440
Fraud?

639
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,400
You acted so happy just now.

640
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:22,200
I was scared.

641
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:26,140
Because I know

642
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,230
these people are all here to trick me.

643
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,960
You're the one I'm waiting for.

644
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:41,910
Except you,

645
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,680
I won't let anyone fool me again.

646
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,980
I won't fool you.

647
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,320
I know.

648
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:03,720
Jin Xia.

649
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,830
We'll be together forever, right?

650
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,320
What's wrong?

651
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:27,280
Nan Hua, I...

652
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,350
I can't fool you.

653
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,080
I can't promise you

654
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:39,990
eternity.

655
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:54,440
I will grow old one day,

656
00:44:57,910 --> 00:44:59,320
just like Grandma Zhou

657
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,910
and the other people you know.

658
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,390
I'll get wrinkles

659
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:10,320
and unable to even walk one day.

660
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,630
At that time,

661
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,960
I don't know how to face you.

662
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,640
It's okay.

663
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,950
No matter what you become,

664
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,580
I will always love you.

665
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,160
Even if you say that,

666
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:42,640
I'm still scared.

667
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,160
What if

668
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,390
others take you as my grandson?

669
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,920
I'll help you find a way to stay young forever.

670
00:45:58,360 --> 00:45:59,400
You liar.

671
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:01,840
There is no way to stay young forever.

672
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,270
Of course there is.

673
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:04,000
Look at me.

674
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:05,690
I am an example.

675
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,420
I haven't aged after living for such a long time.

676
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:13,110
That's because you're an ancient man.

677
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:20,990
Trust me.

678
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,480
Trust me.

679
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,610
Even if I have to give my life to you,

680
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,440
I will…

681
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,760
I'll give my life to you.

682
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:34,310
Nan Hua.

683
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,260
What's wrong, Nan Hua?

684
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,680
Even if I have to give my life to you…

685
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:43,750
I'll give my life to you.

686
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:44,720
Nan Hua.

687
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:47,320
I really want to see

688
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:49,890
what the world will be like

689
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,480
after thousands of years.

690
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:59,440
Can slaves be free?

691
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:01,440
Will women

692
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:07,060
not have to compromise all the time?

693
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:10,260
Will we not be treated as alien monsters?

694
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,080
I want to see it with my own eyes.

695
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:20,470
What a pity. I can't see it anymore.

696
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,100
What are you doing?

697
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,040
I'm making a wish to the meteors.

698
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,100
What are you doing?

699
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,580
Making a wish to the meteors.

700
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,430
This tree doesn't need to be watered.

701
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:34,490
This tree doesn't need to be watered.

702
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:35,400
Chuchen,

703
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,010
thank you.

704
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,500
Chuchen, thank you.

705
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:43,360
No, you can see it.

706
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:47,430
I'll give my life to you.

707
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:13,960
Nan Hua, what's wrong?

708
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,450
What happened?

709
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,030
I am not Nan Hua.

710
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:24,240
I'm the viscount,

711
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:29,520
Li Chuchen.
