00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,160
In the several thousand years of human history,

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,040
there have been many unsolved mysteries.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,960
Are the stories of Dayu controlling the flood and Nvwa mending the sky myths?

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,560
Why would the advancement of human civilization

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,760
surpass its current situations?

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,800
There are all kinds of speculations.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,760
But in fact, the truth

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,750
dates back to the ancient times.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,400
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,720
the highly developed

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,360
prehistoric civilizations once existed on Earth.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,680
Back then, the ancient people

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,080
mastered the scientific civilization far more advanced than that in modern society.

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,160
Their high-level genetic modification technology

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,280
even enabled them to develop

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,390
human potential to the greatest extent.

18
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,960
They could absorb the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,820
to stay alive and even exert extraordinary energy.

20
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,720
However, a tragic doomsday disaster

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,390
made those human beings almost extinct at that time.

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,710
Countless lives

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,910
and brilliant civilizations were destroyed overnight.

24
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,960
Only a small number of ancient people

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,560
survived the doomsday

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,330
after escaping to the underground in time

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,800
and entering into a frozen hibernation state.

28
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,460
After that,

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,200
through tens of thousands of years of self-repair,

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,480
our Earth conceived new intelligent lives again,

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,740
namely, the ancestors of modern people.

32
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,080
And the ancient people sleeping in the underground areas

33
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,480
woke up one after another

34
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,160
and returned to the land.

35
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,870
They saw

36
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,830
the new primitive humans who were still trying to make fire by drilling wood.

37
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,920
Out of good intentions,

38
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,030
they taught the younger generations

39
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,030
many technologies, such as farming, metallurgy,

40
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,800
construction, flood control, and precautions against natural disasters.

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,729
Many great civilization miracles

42
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,120
were the masterpieces made

43
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,850
by our ancestors with the help of ancient people.

44
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,729
At that time, the new human beings

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,880
[Fuxi Temple]

46
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,960
considered the ancient people with extraordinary energy as deities.

47
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,690
They built temples for them and worshipped them.

48
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,200
As the official historians of various countries exaggerated the stories about them,

49
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,720
many legendary ancient myths have been passed down till now.

50
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,240
In this way,

51
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,440
most ancient people around the world

52
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,360
fitted into the new world with the identities

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,520
of deities.

54
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,840
But there were also some low-profile ancient people

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,300
who chose to live in seclusion in deep mountains to escape from the mortal world.

56
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,070
However,

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,320
people's worship towards the deities

58
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,400
also gradually generated fear and desires.

59
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,200
The rulers feared that the power of deities

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,840
would become a threat to their royal power.

61
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,390
But they were also greedy

62
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,120
for immortality and the extraordinary power.

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,780
Therefore,

64
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,720
they used various excuses

65
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
to start wars

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,850
against the deities from time to time.

67
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,840
The ancient people were outnumbered

68
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,320
and were no match for the huge armies in the end.

69
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,920
They almost became extinct.

70
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,590
Little did they know

71
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,960
that by imparting the knowledge of weapon forging to the new humans

72
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,160
they unwittingly unleashed a disaster upon themselves.

73
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,829
Although the ancient people who lived in deep mountains

74
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:56,400
survived this disaster,

75
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,920
they were hunted by the rulers continuously.

76
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,240
They were even slandered

77
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,510
and considered as horrible mountain spirits or ferocious ghosts.

78
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,880
In the blink of an eye,

79
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,750
those who had been regarded as deities became devils that everyone wanted to kill.

80
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,230
As everything keeps changing in the world,

81
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,920
no one knows the existence of the ancient people anymore.

82
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,270
Only those anecdotes and peculiar stories about ghosts and monsters

83
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,360
have been passed down from generation to generation.

84
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,079
And the tiny minority of ancient people who have survived

85
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,760
are still secretly hiding

86
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,630
in those covert corners in the world till now.

87
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,400
I knew it. I knew it!

88
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,940
You want to

89
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,280
give all your legacies to your illegitimate grandson?

90
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,910
No way!

91
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
Nan Hua said

92
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,960
his life was connected with that cherry tree.

93
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,360
If the tree is in blossom, he'll be healthy.

94
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,890
If there're only withered leaves on the tree, he'll sicken.

95
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,270
Why are we here?

96
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,190
Aren't we going to the viscount's ancestral hall?

97
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,290
This is where the ancestral hall was.

98
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:44,960
Follow me.

99
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,160
The viscount's ancestral hall was beside the sea.

100
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,140
As time went by,

101
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,330
this place has been developed into a seaside resort.

102
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,200
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

103
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,480
I prepared a lot of things this morning.

104
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,120
What have you brought?

105
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,720
This morning,

106
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,990
I saw you preparing them meticulously.

107
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,510
Sorry

108
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,130
for making you feel disappointed.

109
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,610
Let me hold the bag for you.

110
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,400
Well,

111
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,430
I feel embarrassed.

112
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,830
Nothing to be embarrassed about.

113
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,690
I'm glad you did all these things.

114
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:59,790
This place is now a resort.

115
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,740
How should we pay our respect to the real Nan Hua?

116
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,280
It's okay. Let's do this as planned.

117
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,070
Is it appropriate?

118
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,960
There are so many people.

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,200
Let's close our eyes.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,160
Let's feel the real Nan Hua's spirit with all of our heart and soul.

121
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,690
Although this place has completely changed,

122
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,630
I can still feel

123
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,090
the real Nan Hua's spirit.

124
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,800
I feel

125
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,210
a little bit silly.

126
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,720
Not silly at all.

127
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,980
Let's close your eyes.

128
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,380
Nan Hua.

129
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,680
I'm not used to

130
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,880
calling you by this name now.

131
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,550
Since you left,

132
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,980
over two thousand years have passed.

133
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,260
The world has really changed.

134
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,360
Women now have the right to pursue their dreams.

135
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,490
They don't have to stay at home all day.

136
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,420
Men have the right to pay more attention to their families.

137
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,840
And they won't be laughed at

138
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,730
or seen as abnormal people because of it.

139
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,080
People who do different jobs are equally respected.

140
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,200
Everyone is respected.

141
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,680
The biggest thing for me

142
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,720
is that I have met

143
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,710
the most important person

144
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,270
for me.

145
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,600
Thank you for giving me an immortal life

146
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,800
so that I could meet her.

147
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,280
Thank you.

148
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,910
Nan Hua, you...

149
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,080
Jin Xia, will you marry me?

150
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,400
Didn't you propose to me before?

151
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,539
You said that proposal was too old-fashioned.

152
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,669
Last time, I made a traditional proposal.

153
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,230
This time, let me do it in a modern way.

154
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,400
So, will you marry me?

155
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,550
Of course, you fool.

156
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,940
The design of the ring is so special.

157
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,000
So beautiful.

158
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,390
I made it

159
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,390
with the stems of the ancient cherry tree.

160
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,010
It represents the new me.

161
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,170
A new me reborn for you.

162
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,960
When did you make it?

163
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,790
Just a few days ago.

164
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,360
Actually, I came back to Globefish Town this time

165
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,510
not only to say goodbye to the real Nan Hua

166
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:40,230
but also to invite her soul in heaven

167
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,000
to be the witness of our love.

168
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,920
What?

169
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,200
Thank you.

170
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,420
Congratulations, Jin Xia.

171
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,560
Chuan.

172
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,420
I'm getting married.

173
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,050
Congratulations.

174
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,800
Can you be my bridesmaid?

175
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,250
Of course.

176
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,480
Congratulations.

177
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,530
Ding, will you be my best man?

178
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
Do I

179
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,880
have a choice now?

180
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,090
[Moon Bay]

181
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,240
I'm hungry.

182
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,130
I'll go buy hot dogs.

183
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,930
I'll go with you.

184
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,110
No need.

185
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:00,960
It's not far.

186
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,490
Are you afraid I'll get lost or I'll fall over?

187
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,190
Fine.

188
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,510
I want a hot dog of the original flavor.

189
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,370
What about you?

190
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,470
I want a super spicy one.

191
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,730
Thank you, Xiaochuan.

192
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,440
What about you?

193
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,590
No, thanks.

194
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,760
Okay.

195
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,360
Original flavor, super spicy, and no need.

196
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,560
Okay, good.

197
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,160
Be careful.

198
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,830
Bye.

199
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:20,800
Bye.

200
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,680
Hello, what would you like?

201
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,590
I'd like...

202
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,320
What should I buy?

203
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,590
This is how he has lived for a thousand years.

204
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,400
Jin Xia, Jin Xia.

205
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,040
What do we want?

206
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,760
Chuan, what's wrong?

207
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,350
Nothing.

208
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,550
I just forgot what I needed to buy.

209
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,300
Jin Xia, Jiang Xiaochuan.

210
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,630
What a coincidence. Why are you here?

211
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,590
Why are you here?

212
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,880
I've been doing business here recently.

213
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
Why are you back now?

214
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,720
Do I know him?

215
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,910
I have something to do here.

216
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,760
Who is he?

217
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,280
Did you lose your job?

218
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,750
I watched the news.

219
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,330
Ms. Xi is in great trouble.

220
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,940
What does it have to do with you?

221
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,740
We broke up but it doesn't mean we have to be enemies.

222
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,870
Don't be so hostile.

223
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,550
He's Jin Xia's ex-boyfriend.

224
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,750
Jin Xia, let's leave.

225
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,840
Are you still blaming me?

226
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,310
No.

227
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,320
You really hate me so much?

228
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,760
You dumped me.

229
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,360
We broke up long ago.

230
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,880
This is the first time we've met again since we broke up.

231
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,540
Why are you in a hurry to leave?

232
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,730
I don't need to talk to you.

233
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,030
I know

234
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,380
you had a hard time a while ago.

235
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,040
I wasn't with you those days.

236
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,500
Your grandma passed away.

237
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,030
I wanted to go to the funeral,

238
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,920
but I didn't have the time.

239
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,680
You can talk to me.

240
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,830
But don't touch me.

241
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,880
You're still so stubborn.

242
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,330
You still have feelings for me, right?

243
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,320
Last time on the blind date,

244
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,240
I made myself very clear.

245
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,070
Wait.

246
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,400
Did you really go on a blind date with me?

247
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,840
Are you pretending that you don't remember that?

248
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,300
Go to the hospital if there's something wrong with your brain.

249
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,640
Does your grandma still do part-time jobs like before

250
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,060
to earn money for the down payment on your house?

251
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,840
Do you really remember that we had a blind date?

252
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,600
Wasn't that my dream?

253
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,760
Was what my mom said all true?

254
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,470
We did have that date.

255
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,720
You're being weird.

256
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,550
Impossible.

257
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,240
Jin Xia.

258
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,840
Nan Hua, thank God you came.

259
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,680
He...

260
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,560
We really went on a date that day?

261
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,790
Wasn't it a dream?

262
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,570
He's Jin Xia's ex-boyfriend.

263
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,620
Where is he?

264
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,350
Jin Xia, I'm sorry.

265
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,600
I was so bad that I should have killed myself.

266
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,680
I'm a shameless jerk.

267
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,950
What are you doing?

268
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,960
He said he was a jerk.

269
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,790
Look.

270
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,960
Why is he kneeling down?

271
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,420
He is possessed by Nan Hua.

272
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,200
Then tell me

273
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,590
why you think you're a jerk.

274
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,990
I lived off you and wasn't nice to you at all.

275
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,640
I used your credit card without your permission.

276
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,310
I also cheated on you.

277
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:46,320
In my childhood, I pretended to be a girl,

278
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,430
sneaked into the women's bathroom,

279
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,400
and peeped at bathing women.

280
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,600
I'm such a despicable jerk.

281
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,430
A jerk like you doesn't deserve to be forgiven.

282
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,870
-How shameless he is!
-Let everyone know he's a jerk.

283
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,640
What a jerk.

284
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,369
I can't believe there is a such a jerk in the world.

285
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,280
Who is he?

286
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,079
He is so handsome.

287
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm having this kind of feeling again.

288
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,609
I was possessed.

289
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,680
I was possessed by a ghost again.

290
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,790
Help! Help!

291
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,550
Security! Take this lunatic away!

292
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,079
-What are you doing?
-Help!

293
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,480
Let go of me! Help!

294
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,360
There's a ghost! Help!

295
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,350
Let me go! Help!

296
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:37,280
Behave!

297
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:38,870
Wait.

298
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,720
I'm so happy!

299
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,520
I finally got my revenge.

300
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,510
Thank you, Nan Hua.

301
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,670
It's my pleasure

302
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,060
to have backed my wife.

303
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,160
Big Bro, did you notice that?

304
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,000
That guy repeated

305
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,530
that he was having that feeling again,

306
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,530
and he had been possessed by a ghost.

307
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:03,790
Ding.

308
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,020
Don't spoil our mood.

309
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,150
Big Bro, did you possess him before?

310
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,430
No.

311
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,660
This is the first time I have met him.

312
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,600
So it means that jerk

313
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,570
met other ancient people before.

314
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,880
He was being very weird just now.

315
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,400
He kept asking me

316
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,600
if I really had gone on a blind date with him.

317
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
He looked as if

318
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,300
today were the first time he had seen me since he and I broke up.

319
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,180
Well.

320
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,350
If he hadn't pissed me off that day,

321
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,290
I wouldn't have decided to buy a house.

322
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,020
Jin Xia.

323
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,340
What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?

324
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,790
I'm feeling a little dizzy.

325
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,030
Let’s go home.

326
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,600
Xiaochuan, rest early.

327
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,300
Stop playing with your phone.

328
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:24,680
Are you hungry?

329
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,220
Let me make you some snacks.

330
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,320
Big Bro, I'm not eating.

331
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,520
I'm sleepy. I want to go to bed early.

332
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:30,200
Okay.

333
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,840
Good night.

334
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,430
Good night.

335
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,090
Good night.

336
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,490
Are you sleepy?

337
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,110
Let's go out of the room

338
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,290
and watch the moon.

339
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,770
I want to discuss with you how to prepare for the wedding.

340
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,480
Okay.

341
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,380
The destiny brought us miracles.

342
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Sometimes, I feel you're not a real person

343
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,630
and I'm in a dream.

344
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,960
Do you think that there'll be one day when I wake up and realize

345
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,820
that everything is just my dream,

346
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,120
and that you have never existed?

347
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,390
I promise

348
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,140
this is not a dream.

349
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,450
I will never disappear.

350
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,590
Xiaochuan, I know you are not asleep.

351
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,540
They're outside.

352
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,390
Let’s have a talk.

353
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,960
Xiaochuan, you must also be an ancient person, right?

354
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,560
You are not only an ancient person,

355
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,940
but also the real president of Qingshi Group.

356
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:56,970
I found

357
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,200
an old photo that was taken decades ago.

358
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,510
The woman in the picture must have been you.

359
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,650
Are you kidding me?

360
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,480
The woman doesn't look like me.

361
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,940
Xiaochuan.

362
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,110
You may feel

363
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,110
I mess around a lot when I am working.

364
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,270
But I study at a real police academy.

365
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,150
Even if you had plastic surgeries,

366
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,150
I can guess

367
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,480
what you used to look like

368
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,370
based on the shape of your head.

369
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,820
You can't hide it from me.

370
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,840
Don't scare me.

371
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,320
The woman in the picture really wasn't me.

372
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,720
No matter what you say, she was still not me.

373
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Really?

374
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,800
Then I can only

375
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,720
show this photo to Big Bro.

376
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,140
Maybe the photo will remind him of something

377
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,260
when he sees it.

378
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,030
What do you want?

379
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,040
I want to know the truth.

380
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,870
I'm not sleepy anyway.

381
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,880
Tell me what you've discovered.

382
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,800
When you left Jin Xia's house that day,

383
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,400
I saw you

384
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,030
get in a super luxurious car.

385
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,630
That was the first time I had found you weird.

386
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,700
Later I found

387
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,070
that the driver of that car

388
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,280
was the CEO of Qingshi Group.

389
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,900
I came up with a possible reason why you two had got in the same car

390
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,030
so I asked if you and Mr. Li were dating.

391
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,580
After I asked you,

392
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,750
you admitted it immediately,

393
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,420
and you even looked relieved.

394
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,440
Xiaochuan.

395
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,170
Is the driver who picked you up last time

396
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,440
the CEO of Qingshi Group?

397
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,670
He is also the Mr. Li

398
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:13,200
who paid Big Bro to design the building for the service center, right?

399
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,120
Really?

400
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,370
You two are dating, right?

401
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,650
Yes, you guessed right.

402
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,740
I knew

403
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,470
the thing was not as simple as it seemed.

404
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,280
So I investigated

405
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,280
Qingshi Group.

406
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,310
Finally, I found this photo

407
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,840
which had been taken in the 1980s.

You won't grow old just like Big Bro.

410
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,380
Big Bro always lives in seclusion

411
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,150
while you always live like an ordinary person in the society.

412
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,600

414
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,490
so that in the age of information,

415
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,200
people won't notice that you'll never grow old.

416
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,710
You're one of the ancient people.

417
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,120
So I think you also need spiritual energy

418
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:47,640
to sustain your life.

419
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,330
Xiaochuan.

420
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,920
You sneaked into the ancient house

421
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,320
when no one else was there

422
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,950
to absorb the energy of the ancient cherry tree.

423
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,040
Don't you know how to do pulse diagnosis?

424
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,180
Because of a lack of spiritual energy,

425
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,710
you started to feel unwell.

426
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,720
You told us the lie that you are pregnant so that no one would really know why you are unwell.

427
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,060
That is why you didn't dare to let Big Bro feel your pulse.

428
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,480
But I can't figure out

429
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,150
why you always

430
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,980
follow Big Bro and Jin Xia.

431
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,960
Are you trying to help them or not?

432
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:18,430
Why are you pretending to be someone else

433
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,370
instead of telling Big Bro who you really are?

434
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,290
You're the real High Immortal Nan Hua.

435
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,880

437

You're afraid I'll tell everything to them so you want to kill me?

438
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,470
Yes.

439
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,050
But considering that many generations of your family

440
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,720
helped Chuchen a lot

441
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,730
and that I still need to use you in the future,

442
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,530
I won't kill you.

443
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,370
What you said is only half right.

444
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,640
I can tell you the other half of the truth.

445
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,160
But if you dare to tell any of it

446
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,420
to Chuchen and Jin Xia,

447
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:14,070
I'll really kill you.

448
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:21,510
Do you still want to know the truth?

449
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:23,760
I do.

450
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,500
Because I want to protect Big Bro

451
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,690
and I won't let him get hurt anymore.

452
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:33,040
No matter how strong the person is, I won't let the person hurt him.

00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,870
Okay.

454
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,370
I hope you can remember what you said just now.

455
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,390
I will.

456

Please tell me the truth.

457
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,740
There's one thing you're wrong about.

458
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,120
I sneaked into the old mansion

459
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,920
not to absorb spiritual energy,

460
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,860
but to get the utensil recharged.

461
00:26:58,770 --> 00:26:59,840
That's why

462
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,740
my body got weak and I collapsed.

463
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:29,230
Why can I use my spiritual energy now?

464
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,760
Chuchen

465
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,440
has always been charged by me,

466
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,340
not Jin Xia.

467
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,080
Nan Hua, how are you?

468
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,340
You mean

469
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,800
Jin Xia can't get Big Bro charged at all?

470
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,360
She never could.

471
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,050
So Jin Xia

472
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,110
is not the person who's destined to be with Big Bro.

473
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,510
Since Chuchen is not the real Nan Hua,

474
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,400
there's no such a person who's destined to be with him.

475
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,890
The promise that he should wait

476
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,000
is just his imagination.

477
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,430
So Jin Xia is...

478
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,040
Everything is my plan.

479
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,350
I spent many years and much money

480
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,940
looking for the right person and got many people to help me.

481
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:03,240
Among so many people, I found Jin Xia.

482
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,590
Then I made friends with her as planned.

483
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,000
But I still don't understand

484
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,950
why you did these things.

485
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,060
Because only by doing those things,

486
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,800
Chuchen and Jin Xia would believe

487
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,660
they are destined to be a couple.

488
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,670
That's not the answer to the question I want to ask.

489
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,530
I want to ask you

490
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,800
why you did everything without telling them.

491
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,000
Why haven't you told Big Bro who you are?

492
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,470
Why did you need to find someone else

493
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,360
to be with him?

494
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,910
I can't tell him who I am

495
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,480
because

496
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,540
Chuchen only knew half of the truth back then.

497
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,580
If he knows the other half,

498
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,590
it'll be too cruel for him and he will be extremely miserable.

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,180
my body can't keep the spiritual energy you give me.

560
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,180
Why not?

561
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:04,960
Then...

562
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,550
How long can the spiritual energy you have now

563
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,760
sustain your life?

564
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,280
One year.

565
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,270
Half a year?

566
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:33,520
About a week.

567
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,480
Big Bro.

568
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,670
My colleagues in the police station checked the video filmed by the surveillance camera.

569
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,620
You won't believe who burned the tree.

570
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,220
Those jerks who had blackmailed Jin Xia did it.

571
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:18,960
Jin Xia.

572
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:43,650
Boss.

573
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,520
Boss, we're in trouble.

574
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,140
What's wrong?

575
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,130
That girl is coming.

576
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,260
Which girl? Tell me.

577
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,740
-Stop there.
-Stop! Don't run.

578
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,430
Madam.

579
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,200
We didn't do anything bad to you recently.

580
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,230
What are you going to do in broad daylight?

581
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,940
What are you doing in broad daylight?

582
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,760
I know

583
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,230
you're trying to steal something.

584
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,040
Behave.

585
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,910
Or I'll take you to the police station.

586
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,680
He's bluffing.

587
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,660
I dropped a burning cigarette butt

588
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,650
and just burnt down a tree.

589
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,780
Just burnt down a tree?

590
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,560
That's not an ordinary tree.

591
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,280
How can you say you just burnt down a tree?

592
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,920
I...

593
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,750
Who asked you to do it?

594
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,080
Who?

595
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,030
No one.

596
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:33,450
No one.

597
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,700
It was an accident.

598
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,130
It's just a tree.

599
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,000
I'll compensate you.

600
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,080
Compensate?

601
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,010
How will you compensate for a loss of life?

602
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:26,400
Xiaochuan, we’ll be in trouble if this fight continues.

603
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,760
Stop! Stop!

604
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:34,820
It's just a tree.

605
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,740
Don't hit me.

606
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,200
-You always...
-Shut up!

607
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,410
You know nothing.

608
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,710
It's not a just a tree. It's connected with someone's life.

609
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,260
I confess. I confess.

610
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,500
An old man asked me to do it.

611
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,530
Who is the old man? Tell me.

612
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:48,110
Jin Xia.

613
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,950
It is an old man with a strong Taiwanese accent.

614
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,060
Mr. Lin.

615
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,930
The three villains have told me everything.

616
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:11,190
Lin Jiarui also admitted it on the phone.

617
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,770
When will he be arrested?

618
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,000
Lin Jiarui is in Taiwan.

619
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,000
It's difficult to arrest him.

620
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,250
He said he had done it

621
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:21,070
because you were not willing to sell the house back to him

622
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,490
and his mother had blamed him.

623
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:24,820
He was so angry that he asked those villains

624
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,560
to burn the tree to vent his anger.

625
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,800
He admitted his mistake

626
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,720
and is willing to compensate for all the losses.

627
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,930
Even if we sue him,

628
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,650
it'll just be a civil lawsuit.

629
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:34,210
Vent his anger?

630
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,110
He did it to get Grandma Zhou's legacies.

631
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,350
He didn't just get a tree burned.

632
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,510
He was killing Nan Hua.

633
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:40,720
Jin Xia, calm down.

634
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,010
I'm angry too.

635
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,300
But it'll be impossible for us

636
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,830
to explain everything to the authorities and convince them.

637
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,200
They won't believe us.

638
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,000
Ding, Xiaochuan.

639
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,110
Please take care of Nan Hua for a while.

640
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:00,010
I want to take a walk alone.

641
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,310
Let me go with you.

642
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,720
I want to be alone.

643
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,910
Mr. Lin, may I have a word with you?

644
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,430
Doctor.

645
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,560
How is my mother?

646
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,610
To be honest, she's in a critical condition.

647
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,370
I can only keep using medicine

648
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,590
to keep her alive.

649
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,400
Actually,

650
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,030
when she was conscious,

651
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,240
she told me

652
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,660
that she hoped that we could stop the treatment.

653
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,230
No. You must continue to treat her.

654
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,870
I understand how you feel.

655
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,810
But now

656
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,050
she is only suffering.

657
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,550
Even if I don't stop the treatment...

658
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,280
Doctor.

659
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,190
My mother is the most important person

660
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,790
to me in the world.

661
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:24,880
As his son,

662
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,520
I cannot let you stop the treatment.

663
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,640
Anyway,

664
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:33,830
please try your best to keep my mother alive.

665
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,890
Okay, we'll do our best.

666
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:44,070
You can't die before he does.
