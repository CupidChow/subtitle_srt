[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,190
In the several thousand years of human history,

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,070
there have been many unsolved mysteries.

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,990
Are the stories of Dayu controlling the flood and Nvwa mending the sky myths?

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,590
Why would the advancement of human civilization

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,780
surpass its current situations?

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,830
There are all kinds of speculations.

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,790
But in fact, the truth

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,790
dates back to the ancient times.

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,430
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

11
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,750
the highly developed

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,390
prehistoric civilizations once existed on Earth.

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,710
Back then, the ancient people

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,110
mastered the scientific civilization far more advanced than that in modern society.

15
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,190
Their high-level genetic modification technology

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,310
even enabled them to develop

17
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,430
human potential to the greatest extent.

18
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,990
They could absorb the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth

19
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,850
to stay alive and even exert extraordinary energy.

20
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,750
However, a tragic doomsday disaster

21
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,430
made those human beings almost extinct at that time.

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,750
Countless lives

23
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,950
and brilliant civilizations were destroyed overnight.

24
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,990
Only a small number of ancient people

25
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,580
survived the doomsday

26
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,350
after escaping to the underground in time

27
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,830
and entering into a frozen hibernation state.

28
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,490
After that,

29
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,220
through tens of thousands of years of self-repair,

30
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,510
our Earth conceived new intelligent lives again,

31
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,770
namely, the ancestors of modern people.

32
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,110
And the ancient people sleeping in the underground areas

33
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,510
woke up one after another

34
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,190
and returned to the land.

35
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,910
They saw

36
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,860
the new primitive humans who were still trying to make fire by drilling wood.

37
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,950
Out of good intentions,

38
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,060
they taught the younger generations

39
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,070
many technologies, such as farming, metallurgy,

40
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,830
construction, flood control, and precautions against natural disasters.

41
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,759
Many great civilization miracles

42
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:43,150
were the masterpieces made

43
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,880
by our ancestors with the help of ancient people.

44
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,789
At that time, the new human beings

45
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,190
[Fuxi Temple]

46
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:51,990
considered the ancient people with extraordinary energy as deities.

47
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,720
They built temples for them and worshipped them.

48
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:58,229
As the official historians of various countries exaggerated the stories about them,

49
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,750
many legendary ancient myths have been passed down till now.

50
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,270
In this way,

51
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,470
most ancient people around the world

52
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,390
fitted into the new world with the identities

53
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,550
of deities.

54
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,870
But there were also some low-profile ancient people

55
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,329
who chose to live in seclusion in deep mountains to escape from the mortal world.

56
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,110
However,

57
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,350
people's worship towards the deities

58
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,430
also gradually generated fear and desires.

59
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,240
The rulers feared that the power of deities

60
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,870
would become a threat to their royal power.

61
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,430
But they were also greedy

62
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,150
for immortality and the extraordinary power.

63
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:31,810
Therefore,

64
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,750
they used various excuses

65
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,750
to start wars

66
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,880
against the deities from time to time.

67
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,860
The ancient people were outnumbered

68
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,340
and were no match for the huge armies in the end.

69
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,940
They almost became extinct.

70
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,630
Little did they know

71
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,990
that by imparting the knowledge of weapon forging to the new humans

72
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,190
they unwittingly unleashed a disaster upon themselves.

73
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,870
Although the ancient people who lived in deep mountains

74
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,430
survived this disaster,

75
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,950
they were hunted by the rulers continuously.

76
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,270
They were even slandered

77
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,550
and considered as horrible mountain spirits or ferocious ghosts.

78
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,910
In the blink of an eye,

79
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,780
those who had been regarded as deities became devils that everyone wanted to kill.

80
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,270
As everything keeps changing in the world,

81
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,950
no one knows the existence of the ancient people anymore.

82
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,310
Only those anecdotes and peculiar stories about ghosts and monsters

83
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,400
have been passed down from generation to generation.

84
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,110
And the tiny minority of ancient people who have survived

85
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,790
are still secretly hiding

86
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,670
in those covert corners in the world till now.

87
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,350
Did you stay up all night?

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,710
Yes.

89
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,510
I feel vigorous and energetic now.

90
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,710
I'm not sleepy at all.

91
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,700
But you shouldn't have stayed up all night.

92
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,730
Why don't you go get some sleep?

93
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,980
I'm fine.

94
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,700
I want to finish the renovation plan as soon as possible.

95
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,870
We can't just let this house be like that all the time, right?

96
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,470
Well, have you calculated how much it'll cost?

97
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:21,899
Yes.

98
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,820
It'll cost at least 30,000 yuan to fix the parts that have collapsed.

99
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,950
It doesn't include the money for repairing the foundations and decorating the house.

100
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,950
30,000 yuan. It'll cost that much?

101
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,580
Do you still have money?

102
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,700
Why do I feel that you're different from those guys in idol dramas,

103
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,250
who have lived for hundreds of or thousands of years

104
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,240
and are extremely wealthy?

105
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,990
Idol dramas are all lies indeed.

106
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,430
Actually, before the period of the Republic of China,

107
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,310
I had some savings.

108
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,920
But after some accidents,

109
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,680
I became impoverished.

110
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,420
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,800
Why are you apologizing to me?

112
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,870
Those were your savings, not mine.

113
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,390
It's okay. I'm here.

114
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,550
When I get my salary this month,

115
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,710
I think it'll be enough if we try to pool the money.

116
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,030
But next month,

117
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,190
both of us will have little money to buy food.

118
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,830
We'll have little money to buy food?

119
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,510
No. Actually, I should pay for the renovation costs.

120
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,400
Besides, how can I make you have little money to buy food?

121
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,460
I know you are a very responsible man.

122
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,750
But we should adapt to new situations when it's urgent.

123
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,810
We can calculate it gradually later.

124
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:38,870
But...

125
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,670
No buts.

126
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,790
Just take my advice.

127
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,670
Besides,

128
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,270
you've helped me a lot.

129
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,190
I can't always take advantage of you.

130
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,590
I've been waiting for you for a thousand years.

131
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:51,520
I'm willing to do anything for you.

132
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,190
It's not like you're 100% sure about it.

133
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,910
By the way, I need to make a call.

134
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,190
You need to make a call?

135
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:03,990
To whom?

136
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:04,990
To my grandma.

137
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,030
Yesterday, didn't I say that I would help you

138
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,230
ask about that voice recording marble?

139
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,790
Why isn't she answering the phone?

140
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,070
Is she still sleeping?

141
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,920
I don't think so.

142
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,260
Normally, she has woken up at this hour.

143
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,720
Maybe she went home late last night,

144
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,070
so she went to bed late.

145
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,600
Call her when you have time.

146
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,890
That's all I can do.

147
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,990
Alright. I'm going to work.

148
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,250
I need to work hard.

149
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,670
Okay. Be careful on the way.

150
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,680
I'm going to work. I have to work hard.

151
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,470
I'm going to work. I have to work hard.

152
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,070
What time is it now?

153
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,670
You're already selecting the food for your lunch.

154
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,270
We'll get our salaries today, won't we?

155
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,600
I need to reward myself.

156
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,430
Besides, because of the big show,

157
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,090
I've lost weight from hunger.

158
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,910
Let's not order takeout food.

159
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,870
There's a new restaurant for private home cuisine downstairs.

160
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,830
The comments about it are very good.

161
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:22,790
Let's have lunch in the restaurant directly.

162
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,590
Yes, that restaurant, right?

163
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,280
That restaurant, right?

164
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:24,790
Yes.

165
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,470
Let's go there later.

166
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,270
Good morning.

167
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,530
Good morning, Jin Xia.

168
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,760
Jin Xia, do you want to have lunch with us in a restaurant?

169
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,470
I won't go with you.

170
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,230
You guys go.

171
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,580
Why are you not going? Are you on a diet?

172
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,820
I need to pay the house loan,

173
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,080
so I have to be thrifty.

174
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,110
You're different now after you got a boyfriend.

175
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,909
You've learned to be thrifty in managing your household.

176
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:45,750
-Right.
-Not really.

177
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,750
You guys always tease me.

178
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,760
She's still different.

179
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,110
Everyone, put aside your current work first.

180
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,430
Let me tell you something.

181
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,620
The big show is coming.

182
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,420
The company has invested all the funds in the show.

183
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,790
I believe you all know that

184
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,750

00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,310
Isn't that his most important keepsake?

370
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,190
Why does he want to sell that pair of earrings?

371
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,350
Is he doing this for me?

372
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,500
No, no, no.

373
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,320
I'm sure it's just for renovating Taiping.

374
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,510
But it won't cost that much to renovate that house.

375
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,110
Does he have to sell his precious keepsake?

376
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,920
Is it because of the house loan?

377
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,950
All in all, he's actually doing this for me.

378
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,150
Look at this man.

379
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,230
I've told him there's no rush.

380
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,640
It's so late now.

381
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,930
I have to go back before Nan Hua gets home.

382
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,640
This part was hit by the meteor.

383
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,500
Follow me to look at this area.

384
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,880
It flew from that direction.

385
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,010
Can you all see that?

386
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,310
Nan Hua came back first?

387
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,530
Really? So soon?

388
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:28,630
Who are you?

389
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,780
How did you get into my house?

390
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,790
Someone is coming.

391
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,750
Hurry up.

392
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,030
Miss, what's your name?

393
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,270
Can we interview you?

394
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,510
What do you want to do?

395
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,640
Babies,

396
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,010
this is the ancient house which was hit by that meteor.

397
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,320
This part was ruined by that meteorite.

398
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,540
It's the legendary Romantic Ancient House.

399
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,940
Romantic Ancient House?

400
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
No. What are you talking about?

401
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,220
Dear, your house is mentioned in the trending topic.

402
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,960
You don't know that?

403
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,390
It's mentioned in the trending topic?

404
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,510
Did your house get hit by a meteor last night?

405
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,710
How did you know that?

406
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:53,880
That's right.

407
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,710
Babies,

408
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,380
I'm from this Wangqi Town.

409
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,200
There is a sad and beautiful legend

410
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,830
of romantic love in our Wangqi Town.

411
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,630
Legend has it that there was a general in our Wangqi Town.

412
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,790
He waited for his wife to come back every day.

413
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,540
As time passed, he became a Wife-awaiting Stone.

414
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,140
So romantic.

415
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,490
What does this legend have to do with my house?

416
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,900
Maybe this ancient house

417
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,720
was the old residence of that general and his wife.

418
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,990
Besides, the meteor streaked across the sky yesterday.

419
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,760
It was probably a sign of the return of his wife.

420
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,870
The story is made up like this.

421
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,000
These Internet celebrities are so good at making up stories

422
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,420
in order to attract people's attention.

423
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,850
Besides, there is another secret

424
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,480
hidden in this ancient house.

425
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,890
There was obviously no one in this ancient house at night.

426
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,740
But the lights and the television were turned on for no reason.

427
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,870
Besides, there were the sounds of people talking from this house.

428
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,430
Yes, I heard that, too.

429
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,030
There are traces of a mysterious man in this ancient house.

430
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,790
Do you think that's the soul of the general?

431
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,170
That's sheer nonsense.

432
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,040
That's sheer nonsense.

433
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,970
There are no ghosts in this world.

434
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,420
Really?

435
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,930
When you had just moved into this house,

436
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,230
why did you call the police and tell them that this house was haunted?

437
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,890
How come you know that as well?

438
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,710
Explain it to us.

439
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,630
I told you so.

440
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,980
There must be a ghost here.

441
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,630
What should I do?

442
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,720
How should I explain it?

443
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,270
What should I do?

444
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,490
Someone saw it.

445
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:07,590
What are you doing?

446
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,570
What a handsome young man.

447
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:11,870
Nan Hua, you're back.

448
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:12,590
Who are you?

449
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,900
Why are you giving Jin Xia a hard time?

450
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,730
Who are you, handsome man?

451
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,500
This has nothing to do with you.

452
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,130
You're trespassing on a private house by doing this.

453
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,390
If you don't leave now,

454
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,740
I won't go easy on you.

455
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,300
Don't be so fierce.

456
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,830
Are you the mysterious man

457
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,190
in the ancient house?

458
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,170
I guess it's him.

459
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,270
It must be him.

460
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,150
Is he that general?

461
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,950
No, he isn't.

462
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:33,750
No, no, no.

463
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,030
He's my boyfriend.

464
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:40,270
Boy... Boyfriend?

465
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,640
Why is there no signal for my mobile phone?

466
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,150
Oh no. I didn't save the data just now.

467
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,550
Is it out of battery?

468
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,700
Nan Hua interfered with their signals.

469
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,500
I have an idea.

470
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:05,800
It's effective.

471
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,590
Leave now.

472
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,540
Otherwise, I'll call the police.

473
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,990
Just call the police.

474
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,650
We're not doing anything bad.

475
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,810
Ding Yanhai, Nan Hua needs you!

476
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,310
I'm coming! I'm coming!

477
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:26,310
Who is this young man?

478
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,050
There are so many handsome guys in this town.

479
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,270
I'm an auxiliary officer in this town.

480
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,550
If you need anything, just tell me.

481
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,280
Don't give my buddy a hard time.

482
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,550
You're just an auxiliary officer.

483
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,710
Who are they?

484
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,940
A group of Internet celebrities.

485
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,340
They came because of the meteor yesterday.

486
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,470
Let me tell you.

487
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,020
You came to the wrong place.

488
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,440
Although the meteor shower

489
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,500
fell here,

490
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,330
the meteorite is no longer here.

491
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,390
Where is the meteorite?

492
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,270
The meteorite

493
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,770
is kept by the mayor of our town.

494
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,400
It's not something you can see just because you want to.

495
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,630
If you want to see it,

496
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:04,380
come with me.

497
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,270
If you don't want to see it, just forget it.

498
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:06,960
Okay.

499
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,230
Let's go.

500
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:08,990
Don't lie to us.

501
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:09,670
Let's go.

502
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,660
Let's go.

503
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,040
There are signals.

504
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,830
-The signals are back. -The signals are back.

505
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,890
There are signals.

506
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,150
This is ridiculous.

507
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,950
But after all, we're not

508
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,410
really dating each other.

509
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,550
Nan Hua has agreed

510
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,750
to be your boyfriend.

511
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,480
He's a man of his word.

512
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,250
Why are you still hesitating?

513
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,380
If two people are together,

514
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,240
it's surely because of love.

515
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,300
How can it be because of the impulse after getting drunk?

516
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,630
You're so stubborn and refuse to admit it.

517
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,040
I want to talk to you about us.

518
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,920
Now, are we considered as...

519
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,810
We're both tired today.

520
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,030
Why don't we take a rest first?

521
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:33,870
If you want to tell me anything, you can say it later.

522
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,870
There's no need to talk about it now.

523
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,830
Okay.

524
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,250
Even so,

525
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,980
Nanhua has never said that he likes me.

526
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,660
He agreed to be my boyfriend because he had no choice.

527
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,670
Being muddleheaded like this,

528
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,800
he is going to sell the earrings for me.

529
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,970
He is going to make such a big sacrifice.

530
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,740
What if I don't want to

531
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:03,230
have a real romantic relationship by then?

532
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:09,630
[Friends, have you heard of the legend of the Wife-awaiting Stone?]

533
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,780
You don't know about this ancient house

534
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,540
which was once hit by a meteor, do you?

535
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,030
Last night, there was a romantic

536
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,500
Andromeda meteor shower on the coast of the Wangqi Town.

537
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,870
One of the meteors

538
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,210
[Friends, have you heard of the legend of the Wife-awaiting Stone?]

539
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:20,430
flew to the oldest ancient house in this town.

540
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:24,830
[Friends, have you heard of the legend of the Wife-awaiting Stone?]

541
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,810
There are over 500,000 likes!

542
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,800
How many people have watched this video?

543
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,670
Oh no.

544
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,030
Nan Hua.

545
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,540
What's wrong?

546
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,190
I don't think you can hide your secret anymore.

547
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:50,920
It's late at night now.

548
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,850
I'll go open the door.

549
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,630
Wait.

550
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,220
What if those Internet celebrities have come again?

551
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,480
I'll open the door. You should hide well.

552
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,350
-Xiaochuan, why are you here?
-Jin Xia.

553
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,590
I saw a video about you on TikTok.

554
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,850
Do you know how popular your house is now?

555
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,390
What's wrong?

556
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,230
I've just seen

557
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,560
the power of those Internet celebrities.

558
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,170
Why are you frowning?

559
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:34,220
Do you know that the price of your house has soared up?

560
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,310
As long as you sell it now,

561
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:38,870
your dream of being a rich woman will come true.

562
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,180
Really?

563
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,400
Of course.

564
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,390
Jin Xia.

565
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,970
You want to sell the house?

566
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,740
No.

567
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,450
Do you think I'm that kind of person who cares for nothing but money?

568
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,540
I'm going to live in this house till my death.

569
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,400
It's her fault.

570
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,910
She wants to get rich through her best friend,

571
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:55,310
so she's trying to lure me to sell the house.

572
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,630
Yes, it's me.

573
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,370
I'm the one who wanted to count on her best friend but failed.

574
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,400
I have to take the blame for no reason.

575
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,520
I will never sell the house.

576
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,650
Don't worry.

577
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,590
I...

578
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,780
The relationship between you and him is progressing fast.

579
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,190
Xiaochuan.

580
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,110
What nonsense are you talking about again?

581
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,370
I'm talking nonsense?

582
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:30,390
The movie about you two has become a reality show of romantic love.

583
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,880
Speaking of romantic love,

584
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,760
I have so much to learn.

585
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,450
Don't listen to him talking nonsense.

586
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,460
He's just like a kid who loves watching TV.

587
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,060
He watches everything on TV.

588
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,320
Jiang Xiaochuan, why did you come here?

589
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,550
Why are you changing the subject

590
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,210
in front of me so abruptly now?

591
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,440
Xiaochuan.

592
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,750
Why did you come to see me?

593
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:56,430
Jin Xia, your house collapsed.

594
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,910
As your best friend,

595
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,630
shouldn't I come to see whether you're fine

596
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,090
and whether you need help?

597
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:04,780
Xiaochuan, I know you are the best.

598
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,030
But I really don't need your help.

599
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,040
Really?

600
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,950
You don't need money to renovate the house?

601
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,280
You don't need a helper?

602
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,880
I can complete the renovation myself.

603
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:20,190
It's just that the costs of the materials are quite high.

604
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,140
Now there are not only external problems with Taiping,

605
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,180
but its foundations and pipes

606
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,010
also need to be reinforced again.

607
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,030
Now I don't have a job

608
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,230
or any savings.

609
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:32,520
I can only rely on Jin Xia.

610
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,460
I'm sorry, everyone.

611
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,590
I didn't have time to tell you just now.

612
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,050
Actually, all our company's funds have been

613
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,390
invested in the big show which will be held next month.

614
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:47,240
I can't receive my salary this month.

615
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,650
How come your boss did something like that?

616
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,650
Ask him to learn about the Labor Law.

617
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,070
What can I do?

618
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,930
They said they would also give us the bonuses later.

619
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,230
It's all my fault.

620
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,310
I hardly have any savings after living for such a long time.

621
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,230
I'd rather be like Professor Du,

622
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,500
monsters or nine-tailed fox spirits,

623
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,100
who have only lived for several hundred years.

624
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,380
The television is usually like this.

625
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,440
How many idol dramas have you watched?

626
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,200
Good.

627
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,190
Ding.

628
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,470
Bro, I'm exhausted.

629
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,510
Thank you for your help today.

630
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,700
Bro, you're welcome.

631
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,290
So what happened to those Internet celebrities later?

632
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,510
They all took photos of that fake meteorite.

633
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,270
Don't worry.

634
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,500
I've told them that

635
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,800
trespassing on a private house

636
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,750
and infringing on portrait rights will lead to a serious outcome.

637
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,910
They won't dare to come again.

638
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:39,670
That's good.

639
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,950
How come I've never seen this young man before,

640
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:46,080
and you've never introduced him to me?

641
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,910
Alright. He's that...

642
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:48,550
Hello.

643
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,910
My name is Ding Yanhai.

644
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,100
I'm an auxiliary officer in our town.

645
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,030
I'm also his good buddy.

646
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,030
Hello, I'm Jiang Xiaochuan.

647
00:28:59,030 --> 00:28:59,890
I'm her best friend.

648
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:00,830
I'm an anchor.

649
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,830
You can also call me Jiang Xiaochuan.

650
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,980
Xiaochuan.

651
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,190
Yanhai.

652
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,590
You're so beautiful.

653
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:07,910
You're so handsome.

654
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,810
Nice to meet you.

655
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,150
Nice to meet you. You're so beautiful.

656
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,710
Boy, you're so handsome.

657
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,390
That's enough.

658
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,360
She's so fierce.

659
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,710
So why did you come here?

660
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,130
Right.

661
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,720
I'm here to give some money to my buddy.

662
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,430
Bro, this is your reward

663
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,510
for cutting squids for six hours today.

664
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,470
But some of them were not cut well.

665
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:34,670
So a small amount of money was deducted.

666
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,220
I just found a job to do chores today.

667
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,690
I didn't make much money.

668
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,130
I'm sorry, Jin Xia.

669
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,730
I forgot to tell you about it.

670
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:52,120
It's okay. No matter how small the amount is, it's still money.

671
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,720
Many a little makes a mickle.

672
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,990
Thanks for your hard work.

673
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:57,150
Why do you have to make yourselves so pitiful?

674
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,590
Why don't you just open this house

675
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,990
to the public so that people can visit it?

676
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,840
I'm sure you'll make a lot of money.

677
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,370
Can you stop causing trouble?

678
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,900
Don't you know what's going on with Nan Hua?

679
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,830
But you know how popular you're on TikTok today,

680
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,790
don't you?

681
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,670
If you still keep it a secret under this circumstance,

682
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,600
it'll only make people more suspicious and curious. Okay?

683
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,600
It's better to take the initiative

684
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,900
and take advantage of it.

685
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,750
Propagate the idea that this ancient house

686
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:21,230
is the origin of the Legend of Wangqi Town.

687
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,840
Let's talk about it next time.

688
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,580
Compared with your suggestion,

689
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,870
the Legend of Wangqi Town is something I'm more curious about.

690
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,470
I've never heard the complete story.

691
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,400
Tell me about it.

692
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,190
Really?

693
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,750
You've been the owner of this house for such a long time.

694
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,250
You still don't know this legend?

695
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,240
You don't have to be so surprised, do you?

696
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,280
Why don't you tell me about it?

697
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,240
Let me tell you.

698
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:48,510
Legend has it that a long time ago,

699
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,460
there was a brave

700
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,790
and battlewise general in Wangqi Town.

701
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,550
One day, this general came across

702
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,680
a beautiful woman.

703
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,130
They fell in love at first sight.

704
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,960
They soon became boyfriend and girlfriend.

705
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:11,760
Not long after that, they were engaged to each other secretly,

706
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,810
and then got married.

707
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,270
The general who was immersed in the sweetness of love

708
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,430
didn't know that his beloved wife

709
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:25,080
was actually a goddess who had gone down to the mortal world secretly.

710
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,390
After members of the Heavenly Kingdom knew about this thing,

711
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,430
they sent some Heavenly Soldiers to

712
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:32,390
take the goddess away forcibly when the general was out for a battle.

713
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:34,950
When the general returned home,

714
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,110
he didn't know where his wife had gone,

715
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,900
so he waited outside the house for a long time.

716
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,950
He waited for her all his life.

717
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,960
His affections for her remained unchanged,

718
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,240
and he turned into a stone in the end.

719
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,300
This is the origin of the Wife-awaiting Stone.

720
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,510
This story is quite sad, isn't it?

721
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,310
You're right.

722
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,510
No, no, no.

723
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,430
It's not like that.

724
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,710
So,

725
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,670
as people who come from another place, you don't know the story.

726
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,150
I grew up here.

727
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,790
The version my mom told me when I was a kid

728
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,710
was not such a beautiful story.

729
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:15,110
Then what's the content of your version?

730
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,700
Do you want to listen to the dark version?

731
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,870
Legend has it that a long time ago...

732
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,470
When did he change his clothes?

733
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,390
There was a brave

734
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:35,870
and battlewise general in Wangqi Town.

735
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,430
One day, this general came across

736
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,870
a beautiful woman.

737
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,310
Isn't this exactly the same as the story she told just now?

738
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:47,270
Can you be patient and listen to me finish telling the story?

739
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:47,830
Okay.

740
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,740
Go on.

741
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,470
The general knew from the beginning that

742
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,790
he had met an immortal goddess

743
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,370
who could use magic.

744
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:03,360
But they still disregarded the differences between immortals and mortals,

745
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,680
and got married.

746
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,920
They loved each other very much.

747
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,490
But the goddess never grew old,

748
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,110
and she could also use magic.

749
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:15,110
The general's sister was quite jealous of her

750
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,310
and coveted her power.

751
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,440
While the general was out for a battle,

752
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,300
his sister killed his wife

753
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,150
with cruel witchcraft.

754
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,000
She also took away her divine power

755
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,070
and eternal life.

756
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,560
After the general knew the truth,

757
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,290
he felt extremely miserable.

758
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,620
He couldn't accept this fact.

759
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:37,950
In this case, he stayed outside

760
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,190
this house alone and guarded it,

761
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:44,350
with the delusion that his wife would come back again.

762
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:50,510
In the end, he became a Wife-awaiting Stone.

763
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,720
As for his frightening sister,

764
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,270
due to the fact that she obtained immortality,

765
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,730
she has been travelling to

766
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,510
different corners of this world till now.

767
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,909
I prefer Xiaochuanâ€™s version.

768
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,590
This story has been

769
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,270
passed down from generation to generation by our ancestors.

770
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,060
When I was a kid,

771
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,080
my mother even scared me with the story of this general's sister.

772
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,870
She said if I didn't go home before 6 p.m.,

773
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:23,600
the general's sister would come and take me away.

774
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,960
So, have you heard of that legend?

775
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,110
Although to some extent,

776
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,880
it has been adapted on the basis of reality,

777
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,730
it's just a rumor after all.

778
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,460
It has been adapted?

779
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,620
Then what's the original version?

780
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,540
A man waiting for someone he isn't sure about

781
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:44,480
has been awaiting that person silently in the ancient house for a thousand years.

782
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,550
So the prototype of that legend

783
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:48,370
is you?

784
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,980
Anyway, I don't think we should open the house to the public.

785
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,550
If we make it too widely known by others,

786
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,610
I'm afraid it won't be good for both Jin Xia and Taiping.

787
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,460
I agree.

788
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,500
Let's not cause trouble anymore.

789
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:08,840
So what trouble will we have if we make it too widely known by others?

790
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,060
Well,

791
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,950
Nan Hua is so handsome.

792
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:20,100
What if he attracts some crazy female fans?

793
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:23,460
It'll be bad if they harass him, right?

794
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,650
Yes, yes, yes. You're right.

795
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,700
I think it'll be all right if they harass him.

796
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,350
If they know that

797
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,640
my buddy is not a human,

798
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,950
that will be a big trouble, right?

799
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,690
I don't understand what you mean.

800
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,700
Bro.

801
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,560
Your efforts in keeping it confidential

802
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,830
are quite useless.

803
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,370
Do you still want to hide the truth from me?

804
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,880
On the first day when Jin Xia moved into this house,

805
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,000
she called the police and said there was a Peeping Tom in her house.

806
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,010
But my master and I

807
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,880
couldn't see that person no matter how hard we tried.

808
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,660
Why?

809
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,910
Because that so-called pervert

810
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,280
was invisible to us.

811
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,240
Later, Jin Xia secretly hired a swindler

812
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,400
to exorcise ghosts.

813
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,680
However, she was blackmailed by that swindler's son, who was a local ruffian.

814
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,810
That day, Jin Xia suddenly became a martial arts master.

815
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,190
She beat three strong men away by herself.

816
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,540
I thought it was also

817
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,250
because of that mysterious invisible man.

818
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:37,970
After that,

819
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,580
Jin Xia coveted my buddy's beauty.

820
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,750
Not only did she not drive him away,

821
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:45,260
but she also took advantage of him when he was drunk.

822
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,340
She even posted a video on Moments to announce their relationship officially.

823
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,940
[Jin Xia]

824
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,590
In the video, I found that

825
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,280
my buddy looked like the man who saved me when I was a kid.

826
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,770
It's been more than ten years.

827
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,590
His look hasn't changed at all.

828
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,530
When I first met my buddy,

829
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,790
the situation was quite weird, too.

830
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,700
The pot even flew to the mid-air.

831
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,360
When we had dinner,

832
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,280
the bowl suddenly drifted up.

833
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,320
Maybe you can find a reason to explain these things.

834
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,510
But my buddy directly flew to the mid-air,

835
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:19,080
generated air waves and broke the meteorite.

836
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,660
I don't think that was magic, right?

837
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,190
Moreover,

838
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:26,740
Bro, it seems that you don't even have an ID card.

839
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,150
I need to have an ID card?

840
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:30,260
Of course.

841
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,400
What kind of person can keep his look unchanged

842
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,040
for several dozens years?

843
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,320
He can even get invisible

844
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,710
and fly up to the sky to generate air waves.

845
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,630
He also doesn't have an ID card

846
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,230
and his identity is mystery.

847
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,240
Right, Jin Xia?

848
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,980
You're exaggerating it by saying that he flew to the sky.

849
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:06,760
It's just that he jumped a bit high.

850
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:07,670
Besides,

851
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:10,710
that meteor disintegrated in the mid-air.

852
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,180
Nan Hua wasn't the one who broke it.

853
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,100
No need to explain, Jin Xia.

854
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,100
At this point,

855
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,930
we can't hide it from him anymore.

856
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,740
Ding,

857
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,260
I'm not an ordinary person indeed.

858
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,150
But I'm not a monster or a ghost.

859
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,110
Nor am I an alien.

860
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,860
I can't tell you the details yet.

861
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,520
Can you keep it a secret for me?

862
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,620
Yes.

863
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,940
But can you promise me something?

864
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,310
What is it?

865
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:47,390
From now on,

866
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,960
can you stop treating me as a stranger?

867
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,070
Even if we can't be friends,

868
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:55,150
we can at least greet each other when we meet each other.

869
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,030
Sure.

870
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,230
Yes!

871
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,380
It looks like there is still much room for

872
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,110
development between you and I.

873
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,750
Don't you think their conversation is weird?

874
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,640
I'm used to it.

875
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,890
It smells weird, too.

876
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,130
There's a sweet smell.

877
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:29,180
It's also mixed with a smell of scorched food.

878
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:30,470
Oh no!

879
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,180
Bro, let me help you.

880
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:42,070
Your boyfriend is really nice.

881
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:49,310
Actually, he's not exactly my boyfriend.

882
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,140
Ma'am, Nan Hua is so good.

883
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,820
Why are you still hesitating?

884
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,890
What else are you not satisfied with?

885
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:57,760
It's not that I'm not satisfied.

886
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,260
I just don't know

887
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:01,490
whether he really likes me

888
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,970
or he is nice to me because of

889
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:07,070
the so-called romantic relationship which has lasted for a thousand years.

890
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,260
You're already worried about

891
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,190
whether he really likes you.

892
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:13,220
It seems that you have feelings for him.

893
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,790
You've started to understand how to love a man now?

894
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:18,230
Stop talking about that.

895
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:21,130
You're the one who encouraged me to like him.

896
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:21,990
To figure out whether

897
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,030
he likes you or not, you can ask him directly, right?

898
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,920
I feel embarrassed to ask him about it.

899
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,850
Dinner is ready.

900
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,200
Dinner is ready.

901
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:31,990
Let's go.

902
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,080
Why do you keep staring at my best friend?

903
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,030
I always feel that Xiaochuan looks familiar to me.

904
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,280
Have we met each other before?

905
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,350
Have you watched my live streams?

906
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,880
I don't think so.

907
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,500
Let me tell you. Just ignore him.

908
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,570
He always uses the same trick to accost others.

909
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,020
He said the same thing when he met Nan Hua.

910
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,080
Don't believe a word of his nonsense.

911
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,660
He's a super sycophant.

912
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,360
He butters up whoever he sees.

913
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:16,390
How could you say that, Gossiper?

914
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,900
I wonder why you are so lucky

915
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,750
to have found such a good man like my buddy

916
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,150
and such a cute best friend like Xiaochuan.

917
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,920
You called me Sister-in-law when you needed help.

918
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,680
When you didn't need my help, you called me Gossiper.

919
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,600
You little brat, you're...

920
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:31,360
When did I call you Sister-in-law?

921
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,030
Don't imagine it here.

922
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,070
Who allowed you to eat at my house?

923
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,230
Get out!

924
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,650
Let's eat.

925
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:44,510
Bro.

926
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:48,520
Jin Xia has the final say at our home.

927
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,950
Bro.

928
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:59,270
I was kicked out by my mom today.

929
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:01,950
In order to accompany you to look for a job,

930
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,880
I forgot to buy soy sauce for my mom.

931
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:06,220
My mom didn't know what was important and what was urgent.

932
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,980
She even hit me with a spatula.

933
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,510
I haven't eaten anything yet till now.

934
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:14,870
I'm so hungry.

935
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,220
Jin Xia.

936
00:42:20,430 --> 00:42:23,230
Why don't you let him have dinner before he leaves?

937
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:41,480
Chuan, aren't you staying here tonight?

938
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:42,460
It's so late now.

939
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,440
Where will I sleep if I stay here?

940
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,520
You only have one guest room now.

941
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,110
The three of us will sleep in the same room?

942
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,530
I don't mind.

943
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,390
Bye. Be careful on the way.

944
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,510
Okay.

945
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:59,150
So, has the car for your ride sharing arrived?

946
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,460
I didn't select the location of this place.

947
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,730
It's at the intersection ahead.

948
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:03,260
Okay. We'll take you there.

949
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,940
No need. It's a few steps away.

950
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,740
Be careful on the way.

951
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,200
Send me a message when you get home.

952
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,230
I'm leaving.

953
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:09,940
Bye.

954
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,240
Excuse me.

955
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,020
Bye.

956
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:19,930
Bro, can't I stay at your home?

957
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:22,210
I can sleep in the living room. It's okay.

958
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,780
Buddy, your home is just next to ours.

959
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:26,140
But...

960
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,650
I'm afraid of going home alone.

961
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,300
As a girl, Xiaochuan is not afraid of that.

962
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,460
As a man, why are you afraid of that?

963
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,720
Hurry up. Just go home.

964
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:39,870
Okay.

965
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:42,670
Rest early, Bro.

966
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:43,690
See you tomorrow.

967
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:44,510
Good night.

968
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,270
Good night, Bro.

969
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,720
Oh no.

970
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,060
The food packed by Xiaochuan is still here.

971
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,120
She didn't take it.

972
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:53,110
It's not too late to take it to her now, right?

973
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:53,860
Right.

974
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:54,800
I'll take it to her.

975
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,590
I'll go with you.

976
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:56,790
I'll go with you, Bro.

977
00:43:57,830 --> 00:43:59,290
Then you can take it to her.

978
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,920
Thank you.

979
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:03,740
Bye.

980
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,760
Jin Xia is a bad woman.

981
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,220
She doesn't deserve my buddy at all.

982
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:13,920
Xiaochuan.

983
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:14,820
Xiaochuan!

984
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,560
Ding, why are you here?

985
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,790
You forgot to take the food you had packed.

986
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:28,820
Thank you.

987
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:31,470
Ding, you're so nice.

988
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,250
But who was that man just now?

989
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,850
A car driver for my ride sharing.

990
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:37,650
Ride sharing?

991
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:39,880
In a remote town like ours,

992
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,950
you could call for the service of a luxury car like this?

993
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:42,930
I'm just lucky.

994
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,330
I'm leaving.

995
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,500
Take care, Xiaochuan.

996
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,020
Bye.

997
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:48,710
Bye.

998
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:50,960
Hello, sir.

999
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,340
Why are you laughing?

1000
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:33,620
Nothing.

1001
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,660
I just thought of something.

1002
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,740
You remembered the past?

1003
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:40,590
No.

1004
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:42,480
I just thought that

1005
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:45,410
you had said you would never sell the house.

1006
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,960
I'm quite happy.

1007
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,030
To figure out whether

1008
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:52,310
he likes you or not, you can ask him directly, right?

1009
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:54,440
I feel embarrassed to ask him about it.

1010
00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:59,390
If I don't sell the house,

1011
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,290
you'll have to stay with me forever.

1012
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:16,230
It will be great if we can

1013
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:19,320
stay together forever.

1014
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:23,170
Then you'll have to cut squids all your life.

1015
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:26,930
After all, it'll cost a lot of money to renovate this house.

1016
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,630
Men always tell lies.

1017
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,470
[My dear friend, take the money first. You can pay it back to me gradually when you get your salary.]

1018
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:52,130
My best friend is the most reliable person.

1019
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:26,480
[Jin Xia]

1020
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:32,200
How was your inspection

1021
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,730
on the Wangqi Town?

1022
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:36,240
It went well.

1023
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,360
Get the contract ready tomorrow.

1024
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,250
We'll make an investment here.

1025
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:45,440
We must turn the Wangqi Town

1026
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,530
into a top-class tourist town.

1027
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:48,900
Got it.
