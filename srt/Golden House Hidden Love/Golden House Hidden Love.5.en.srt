00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,190
In the several thousand years of human history,

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,070
there have been many unsolved mysteries.

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,990
Are the stories of Dayu controlling the flood and Nvwa mending the sky myths?

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,600
Why would the advancement of human civilization

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,800
surpass its current situations?

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,830
There are all kinds of speculations.

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,790
But in fact, the truth

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,790
dates back to the ancient times.

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,420
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,740
the highly developed

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:36,390
prehistoric civilizations once existed on Earth.

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,710
Back then, the ancient people

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,110
mastered the scientific civilization far more advanced than that in modern society.

15
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,190
Their high-level genetic modification technology

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,310
even enabled them to develop

17
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,430
human potential to the greatest extent.

18
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,990
They could absorb the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth

19
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,850
to stay alive and even exert extraordinary energy.

20
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,750
However, a tragic doomsday disaster

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,430
made those human beings almost extinct at that time.

22
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:01,750
Countless lives

23
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,950
and brilliant civilizations were destroyed overnight.

24
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:07,000
Only a small number of ancient people

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,590
survived the doomsday

26
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,360
after escaping to the underground in time

27
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,830
and entering into a frozen hibernation state.

28
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,490
After that,

29
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,220
through tens of thousands of years of self-repair,

30
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,510
our Earth conceived new intelligent lives again,

31
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,770
namely, the ancestors of modern people.

32
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,110
And the ancient people sleeping in the underground areas

33
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,510
woke up one after another

34
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,190
and returned to the land.

35
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:28,910
They saw

36
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,870
the new primitive humans who were still trying to make fire by drilling wood.

37
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:32,950
Out of good intentions,

38
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,070
they taught the younger generations

39
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,070
many technologies, such as farming, metallurgy,

40
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,830
construction, flood control, and precautions against natural disasters.

41
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,759
Many great civilization miracles

42
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:43,150
were the masterpieces made

43
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,880
by our ancestors with the help of ancient people.

44
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,789
At that time, the new human beings

45
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,280
[Fuxi Temple]

46
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:52,000
considered the ancient people with extraordinary energy as deities.

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,729
They built temples for them and worshipped them.

48
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:58,229
As the official historians of various countries exaggerated the stories about them,

49
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,750
many legendary ancient myths have been passed down till now.

50
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,270
In this way,

51
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,470
most ancient people around the world

52
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,390
fitted into the new world with the identities

53
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,550
of deities.

54
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,860
But there were also some low-profile ancient people

55
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,320
who chose to live in seclusion in deep mountains to escape from the mortal world.

56
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,110
However,

57
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,350
people's worship towards the deities

58
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,430
also gradually generated fear and desires.

59
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,230
The rulers feared that the power of deities

60
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,860
would become a threat to their royal power.

61
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,430
But they were also greedy

62
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,150
for immortality and the extraordinary power.

63
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:31,810
Therefore,

64
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,750
they used various excuses

65
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,750
to start wars

66
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,880
against the deities from time to time.

67
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,870
The ancient people were outnumbered

68
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,350
and were no match for the huge armies in the end.

69
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,950
They almost became extinct.

70
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,630
Little did they know

71
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,000
that by imparting the knowledge of weapon forging to the new humans,

72
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,200
they unwittingly unleashed a disaster upon themselves.

73
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,870
Although the ancient people who lived in deep mountains

74
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,430
survived this disaster,

75
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,950
they were hunted by the rulers continuously.

76
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,270
They were even slandered

77
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,550
and considered as horrible mountain spirits or ferocious ghosts.

78
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,910
In the blink of an eye,

79
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,790
those who had been regarded as deities became devils that everyone wanted to kill.

80
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,270
As everything keeps changing in the world,

81
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,950
no one knows the existence of the ancient people anymore.

82
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,310
Only those anecdotes and peculiar stories about ghosts and monsters

83
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,390
have been passed down from generation to generation.

84
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,110
And the tiny minority of ancient people who have survived

85
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,790
are still secretly hiding

86
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,670
in those covert corners in the world till now.

87
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,680
Open your mouth.

88
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,310
Jin Xia, it's time to eat.

89
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,190
Jin Xia. Jin Xia!

90
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,870
What is it?

91
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,270
Are you okay?

92
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,910
I'm fine. What's wrong?

93
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,400
You've been in there for an hour.

94
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,110
I was afraid something had happened to you.

95
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,310
I fell asleep.

96
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,130
It's good you're fine.

97
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,730
The dishes are getting cold.

98
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,829
Get ready.

99
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:21,510
I'll heat up the food.

100
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,500
Then we can eat.

101
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:24,550
Okay.

102
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,110
By the way, can I stop singing?

103
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,230
Okay.

104
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,070
Did I…

105
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,110
Did I have a wet dream just now?

106
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,270
So many dishes!

107
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,310
Yes.

108
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,950
This house is old,

109
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,670
but it has complete kitchen supplies.

110
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,470
So I can cook all kinds of dishes.

111
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,480
Thank you for all the trouble.

112
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,070
I can eat anything.

113
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,990
How can you eat anything?

114
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,030
Food is essential

115
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,550
for our psychological and physical health.

116
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,470
Speaking of which,

117
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,600
I saw you have a lot of instant noodles.

118
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,350
Those are bad for your stomach.

119
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,510
As long as I'm here,

120
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,350
I won't let you make do with those.

121
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,600
Thank you.

122
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,190
By the way,

123
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,070
why is your voice hoarse?

124
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,870
I'm fine. I just need some rest.

125
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,440
Is it because you sang for too long?

126
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,310
Sorry.

127
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:00,990
It's just

128
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,270
that we've only known each other for three days,

129
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,790
and you can go through walls and be invisible.

130
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,190
That's why I… I'm sorry.

131
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,250
It's okay. You don't need to explain.

132
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,550
You are a girl who is forced to live with a man.

133
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,510
It's only normal that you're feeling insecure.

134
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,510
I can understand.

135
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,750
Besides, it's good to be alert.

136
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,150
Enough with the talk.

137
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:22,950
Let's eat.

138
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,750
They won't taste good when cold.

139
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,030
Okay.

140
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,510
They all look so delicious.

141
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,070
Yummy!

142
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,750
Have some more if you like it.

143
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:45,710
Thank you.

144
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,230
But

145
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,520
I can't take my time to enjoy it today.

146
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,830
I haven't finished my design draft yet.

147
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,350
I'm only halfway there.

148
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,890
The deadline is tomorrow.

149
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:01,390
Thank you.

150
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,670
The deadline is tomorrow,

151
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,650
so I might have to stay up all night for it tonight.

152
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,670
Jin Xia.

153
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,230
I have a favor to ask.

154
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,630
Go ahead.

155
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,260
Can you show me your draft

156
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,480
after it's done?

157
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,310
That's… not a problem.

158
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,310
Are you interested in jewelry design?

159
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,910
I have to tell you

160
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,270
I'm not that good.

161
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,840
Don't get your hopes up.

162
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,470
No.

163
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,820
Actually,

164
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,630
you designed meteor-chip earrings last time.

165
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,700
Maybe this time you can design

166
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,510
some jewels related to me, too.

167
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,210
Oh, that's why.

168
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,820
Sure.

169
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,190
Thank you.

170
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,190
In return,

171
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,070
give me your phone. Let me fix it.

172
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,150
You even know how to fix a phone, too?

173
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,710
I often got bored during the thousands of years.

174
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,470
I studied it for a while,

175
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,550
so I know a little about it.

176
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,230
Then, thank you,

177
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,830
my omnipotent roommate.

178
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:18,870
Let's eat.

179
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,070
Okay.

180
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:40,870
Start work!

181
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,110
Is Jin Xia doing well?

182
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,470
Thank you.

183
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,110
I wonder if she's hungry.

184
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,760
It's finally fixed.

185
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,480
Ding Yanhai.

186
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,440
The hot water is ready. Go take the shower.

187
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,660
Mom.

188
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,390
You said

189
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,190
our neighbor, Jin Xia,

190
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,340
lived alone, right?

191
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,950
She told me so.

192
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,870
Does she have to

193
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,350
turn on so many lights if she's living alone?

194
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,080
What lights?

195
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,280
Come and take a look.

196
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,280
The living room, the bedroom,

197
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,040
and the kitchen.

198
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,630
The lights are all on.

199
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:46,960
Is it necessary?

200
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,630
You're right.

201
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,750
I didn't expect

202
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,750
this girl to be so wasteful.

203
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,390
Really?

204
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,160
I've met her before.

205
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,110
She looked like a frugal girl.

206
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,230
How can you tell?

207
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,190
I guess because she's just a girl

208
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,180
and she lives

209
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,870
in such a big old house alone,

210
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,070
she must be scared.

211
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,270
That's why she turned on so many lights.

212
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,310
That's not right.

213
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,010
Look. She is in the bedroom.

214
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,290
Why is the TV in the living room on?

215
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,730
There's no need to do that, even if she's afraid of the dark.

216
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,350
I told you

217
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,830
this house was weird.

218
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,360
Enough.

219
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,910
Mind your own business.

220
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,090
Go take the shower.

221
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,910
If the water gets cold, we'll have to reheat it.

222
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,110
-It'll be a waste of gas.
-Got it. Got it.

223
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:53,560
The last one.

224
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:54,910
Done.

225
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,200
Take it to Nan Hua.

226
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,670
But...

227
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,150
what if he recognizes everything?

228
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,030
Then won't he be sure

229
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,230
that I'm the one he's waiting for?

230
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,870
No.

231
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,030
The past is gone.

232
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,910
I have to persuade him

233
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,510
not to miss the past anymore.

234
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,550
He's very handsome,

235
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,620
but I've decided

236
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,960
not to marry anyone.

237
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,670
Nan Hua.

238
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,110
Nan Hua?

239
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,640
Were you really so fascinated?

240
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,060
It's my first time watching a drama.

241
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,720
I didn't expect it to be so fun.

242
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:52,860
I've finished the design draft.

243
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,030
Didn't you say you wanted to take a look?

244
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,670
Really?

245
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,110
Coming.

246
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:57,870
Come on.

247
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:03,630
Here.

248
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,110
Thank you.

249
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,990
There isn't any of your old stuff there?

250
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,350
I spent the whole night drawing.

251
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,050
Strictly speaking, what you drew

252
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,150
are not antiques.

253
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,070
It's been integrated with modern aesthetics

254
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,330
and Western elements.

255
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,030
Like the costumes in the dramas,

256
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,950
they didn't really exist in ancient times.

257
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,790
I did a lot of research

258
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,190
and looked up many historical information.

259
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:58,510
I didn't expect it to be so unauthentic.

260
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,920
Authentic antiques

261
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,550
are very different from modern aesthetics.

262
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,310
The border like this

263
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,910
and this kind of color

264
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,280
didn't exist back then.

265
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,550
She didn't even care about catching a cold.

266
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,680
[Address: No. 66, South District, Fuhai International]

267
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,400
Isn't she used to sleeping with the lights on?

268
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,630
Why did she turn off the light today?

269
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,910
I'm late!

270
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,550
I forgot to set an alarm after the phone was fixed.

271
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,310
When did I fall asleep?

272
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,550
I'm late!

273
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,350
Where is my purse?

274
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,350
Where is my purse?

275
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:43,990
Where is it?

276
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,510
It's on the chair at the door.

277
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,070
Thank…

278
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,960
Thank you.

279
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,680
You've been watching TV all night?

280
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:58,760
Is it really so good?

281
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,150
I've always wanted a TV.

282
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,030
Thanks to you.

283
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,590
It's good.

284
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,950
You can be so happy just by watching TV.

285
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,200
Watch and learn more.

286
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,530
Learn how modern people speak and behave.

287
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,440
I'm going to be late.

288
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:20,070
Take your time. I'm leaving.

289
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,830
Bye.

290
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,750
Routes are countless. Safety is foremost.

291
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,190
Okay, bye.

292
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:25,990
Bye.

293
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:53,390
Luckily,

294
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,550
I'm not late.

295
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,350
It's you.

296
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,190
What do you want?

297
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,950
We're here to seek justice, of course.

298
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:04,550
Look.

299
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,550
You beat us up and injured us like this.

300
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,330
You don't think you have to pay for the medical fees?

301
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,350
You owed my mom 20,000

302
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,160
and now 20,000 for each of us.

303
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,310
That makes 80,000 in total.

304
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,590
80,000?

305
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,990
How dare you!

306
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,090
In broad daylight and in a public place,

307
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:19,950
what do you want?

308
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:20,790
Don't fight.

309
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,610
Listen.

310
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,550
This is what you should pay for.

311
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,480
Not a penny less.

312
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,430
Do you think you can threaten us

313
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,160
with a few auxiliary officers?

314
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,460
I've consulted a lawyer.

315
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,790
The police are to protect the law-abiding citizens like us

316
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,390
who've been hurt by you.

317
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,620
You two were flirting.

318
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,630
Be careful that you'll be reported.

319
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,270
What auxiliary officers?

320
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,870
What flirting?

321
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,960
You don't admit it, do you?

322
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,630
It's fine.

323
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,830
If you don't pay us,

324
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,670
we'll come here every day.

325
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,020
We can talk to your boss and your colleagues.

326
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,990
We'll talk to them every day.

327
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:48,590
Let's see when you'll lose your job.

328
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,830
If you change your job,

329
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:50,990
it doesn't matter.

330
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:51,870
Wherever you go,

331
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,200
we'll go there with you.

332
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,340
You guys are...

333
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,510
What's going on?

334
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:07,950
Ms. Xi.

335
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,590
Jin Xia, they are...

336
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,670
They are...

337
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:16,880
Are you the boss?

338
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,470
Yes. What's wrong?

339
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,740
Your employee hurt us yesterday.

340
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,590
We're here for medical fees.

341
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,590
Hurt?

342
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,390
You guys

343
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,720
were hurt by a little girl like her?

344
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:34,790
Believe me.

345
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,700
We have CCTV footage as evidence.

346
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,630
Besides, when she fights,

347
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,950
she doesn't look like a girl.

348
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,070
Ms. Xi,

349
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,270
they were indeed injured because of me.

350
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,440
But they started it.

351
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,550
My act was just self-defense.

352
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,790
All right, stop making a scene at work.

353
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,990
What will others think if they see this?

354
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,250
Go to the office first.

355
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,150
If my student hurts you,

356
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,120
I'll ask her to compensate you.

357
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:02,270
Let's go upstairs and have a cup of tea first. Okay?

358
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,070
No wonder she's the boss.

359
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,950
She is reasonable.

360
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:06,910
Let's go.

361
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,340
Please.

362
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,530
Don't touch anything.

363
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:23,870
Not bad.

364
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,200
I shouldn't have pitied you

365
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,190
and asked so little

366
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,000
if I knew you had such a good job.

367
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,270
Don't go too far.

368
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,830
Ms. Xi.

369
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:38,750
Sorry.

370
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,770
I just answered a call.

371
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,230
Sorry to keep you waiting.

372
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:41,920
It's okay.

373
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,510
Sit down and talk.

374
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,510
Ms. Xi, here's the thing.

375
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,750
I just moved.

376
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,730
It's an old house.

377
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,230
I thought there was a ghost in the house,

378
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,490
so I hired a sorceress.

379
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,310
I didn't expect the sorceress was a fraud.

380
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,400
She did nothing

381
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,830
but still wanted to charge me 20,000 yuan.

382
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,500
Nonsense!

383
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,670
How could my mom be a fraud?

384
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,390
Besides,

385
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:01,680
do you dare to deny the fact

386
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,660
that my mom got hurt to help you?

387
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,350
Hurt?

388
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,150
She just fell down, okay?

389
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,150
You're a rogue.

390
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,970
Let your boss see our injuries.

391
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,390
Look, this is not a minor injury.

392
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,100
Look.

393
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,390
Alright, I understand the situation.

394
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,990
So how much compensation do you want?

395
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,340
Ms. Xi.

396
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,710
20,000 each. 80,000 in total.

397
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:31,910
80,000?

398
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,430
After you take the money,

399
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,020
you won't bother her anymore?

400
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,190
What I want is

401
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,990
a price that will make you never show up again.

402
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,920
Ms. Xi, what are you talking about?

403
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,400
I'm helping you solve the problem.

404
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,550
Then...

405
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,320
30,000 each.

406
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,790
120,000 in total.

407
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,310
120,000?

408
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,630
Are you crazy?

409
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,350
Okay. I see.

410
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,270
Ms. Xi.

411
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:04,820
Hello?

412
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,250
Are they here?

413
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,160
Ask them to come up.

414
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,970
Ms. Xi, did you invite guests?

415
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,160
It's the police.

416
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,540
How dare she call the police?

417
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,450
Sit down.

418
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,150
What are we afraid of?

419
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,510
Justice is on our side, even if the police come.

420
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,310
Really?

421
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,430
Ms. Xi, the police are here.

422
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,550
You may leave.

423
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:28,670
Hello.

424
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,480
Hello.

425
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,390
Are you Ms. Xi?

426
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,580
Did you call the police?

427
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,980
Yes, I called the police.

428
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,070
What is it?

429
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:37,960
Officers,

430
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,550
this lady

431
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,990
invited us up for tea.

432
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,070
We are all good citizens.

433
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,190
I don't know what you're talking about.

434
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,430
I don't know them.

435
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,060
They came up here to make trouble.

436
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,230
They even blackmail my students

437
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,230
for 120,000 yuan.

438
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,350
Nonsense!

439
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,950
Officers, we didn't do that.

440
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,230
Nonsense?

441
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,150
It was all filmed by the camera.

442
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,470
The amount of extortion is deemed as massive if it's over 10,000 yuan.

443
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,830
In a serious case, the suspect can be sentenced to more than three years of imprisonment.

444
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,960
Am I right, officer?

445
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,170
You do know the law.

446
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,550
This woman...

447
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,030
You're so vicious.

448
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,430
Officers, she set us up.

449
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,790
Don't say anything.

450
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:12,510
Let's talk at the police station.

451
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,160
Let's go.

452
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,870
The next time you need to negotiate,

453
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,470
choose a place with cameras.

454
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,030
You know what to say

455
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,750
when you record the statement or are subpoenaed.

456
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,110
To achieve something,

457
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,530
you need the right timing,

458
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,460
the right place,

459
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,610
and the right people.

460
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,470
Any one of them is indispensable.

461
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,820
What? You know martial arts?

462
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,230
I don't.

463
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,230
Then how did you

464
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,290
hit them like that?

465
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,950
It's just a coincidence.

466
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,340
It's okay if you don't want to tell me.

467
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,730
We need to go to the meeting now.

468
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,660
We've already wasted 15 minutes.

469
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:06,790
Let's go.

470
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,190
What are you waiting for?

471
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,360
Thank you, Ms. Xi.

472
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,710
You're welcome.

473
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,270
Today's focus

474
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,430
is still on the new products that will be released soon.

475
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:20,720
Have you finished

476
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,250
the drafts I asked you to do?

477
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,270
Yes.

478
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,240
All done.

479
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,310
Very good.

480
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,310
I attach great importance to the launch of the new products.

481
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,430
As you all know,

482
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,920
I haven't published my new work abroad for five years.

483
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,510
I hope everyone here

484
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,070
can take it as seriously as I do.

485
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:35,870
Okay?

486
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,030
Okay.

487
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,590
Once your design is chosen,

488
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,230
you will get the right to sign your name.

489
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,260
Not only that,

490
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,710
I will also select a winner

491
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,270
from the chosen list.

492
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:49,190
This person will design a whole set of wedding clothes

493
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,520
and publish it

494
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,190
on my new national fashion show.

495
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:53,950
Oh my.

496
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,890
We can publish it with our teacher!

497
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:56,950
That is great.

498
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,270
International show.

499
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,630
I wish it could be me.

500
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,620
Please hand in your design drafts.

501
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:02,910
Let me have a look.

502
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,170
Ms. Xi, please take a look.

503
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,030
Oh no.

504
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,430
What's wrong?

505
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,830
Ms. Xi, I left home in a hurry.

506
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,830
I think I left my design draft at home.

507
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,590
Jin Xia,

508
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:29,020
how could you forget such an important thing?

509
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,620
I'm sorry, Ms. Xi. I'm sorry.

510
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,150
It's okay. Go back and get it.

511
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,410
I still have some time.

512
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,420
I just moved.

513
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,430
My house is more than 40 kilometers from here.

514
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,430
It'll take more than two hours for me to go home and come back.

515
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,450
You won't make it then.

516
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,390
In two hours,

517
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,350
I'll have to go to the airport to fly to Milan.

518
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,670
Ms. Xi, can I take a photo of them for you?

519
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:47,070
Jin Xia,

520
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:50,630
I need to see the original color and details of the drafts.

521
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:55,950
Forget it.

522
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,870
Scan and fax it to me later.

523
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,130
But considering the distorted color of the fax

524
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,530
will affect my judgment,

525
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,110
don't take part in the tryout this time.

526
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,270
Okay.

527
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:13,910
Jin Xia.

528
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:26,510
Nan Hua?

529
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,830
Ms. Xi, I'm sorry.

530
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,430
This gentleman said he had something urgent

531
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,310
to see Jin Xia.

532
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:36,220
Who is he? He's so handsome.

533
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,510
I don't know.

534
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,550
Gosh.

535
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,550
Ms. Xi, excuse me.

536
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,030
He is my friend.

537
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,350
You may leave, Liu.

538
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:48,990
Yes.

539
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,030
Why are you here?

540
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,000
I noticed that you had forgotten your design draft,

541
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,390
so I brought it here.

542
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,370
I hope I'm not disturbing you?

543
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,430
You're so reliable.

544
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,270
How did you know I work here?

545
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,870
I saw the business card

546
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,550
on your desk in your room last night.

547
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,150
Your company's name is on it.

548
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,030
They were together last night.

549
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,390
They were together last night.

550
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:19,070
They seem to be in that kind of relationship.

551
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:19,950
Really?

552
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,620
Yes, so soon.

553
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,150
Jin Xia,

554
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,340
come back for the meeting now that you've got the draft.

555
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,350
Ms. Xi is waiting.

556
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:33,950
Okay.

557
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,000
I'll get to work now.

558
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:37,710
Okay, go ahead.

559
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,070
I'll wait for you outside the company.

560
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:39,620
Okay.

561
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,110
Ms. Xi.

562
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,300
Finally off work.

563
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,460
Where is Nan Hua?

564
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,430
Why is he lying here?

565
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,650
What happened?

566
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,310
I don't know.

567
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,510
-He just fell.
-I don't know what's going on.

568
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,970
-Should we call 120?
-Yes.

569
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,550
Nan Hua! Excuse me.

570
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,050
Why are you so cold?

571
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,670
Are you okay?

572
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,190
I'm sorry.

573
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:42,940
I thought

574
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,910
I could hold on

575
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,090
and not cause you any trouble.

576
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,390
Jin Xia, what's going on?

577
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,390
Should I call 120?

578
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,470
No, Ms. Xi!

579
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,870
He's… fine.

580
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,950
He's just having an episode of hypoglycemia.

581
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:02,580
He'll be fine by having some sweets.

582
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,550
Does he have any sweets with him?

583
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,150
Sweets?

584
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:10,550
Thank you, Miss.

585
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,950
You're with him anyway.

586
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:17,310
If he's running out of spiritual energy, a kiss will solve it all.

587
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,640
I don't want to kiss him!

588
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,440
I can't care that much now.

589
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,490
What's going on?

590
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,070
Why is it useless?

591
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,410
He's a little cold.

592
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,900
More than a little.

593
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,530
What should I do?

594
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,530
He's getting warmer!

595
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,120
Nan Hua, how are you?

596
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:52,980
I'm sorry.

597
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:56,430
I made you embarrassed in public

598
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,670
and even troubled your teacher.

599
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,070
I promised

600
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,370
I wouldn't trouble you again to recharge me.

601
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:04,350
No, it's all my fault.

602
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,950
I forgot

603
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,630
that you can't stay away from the old house for too long.

604
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,710
And I even asked you

605
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,000
to wait for me to get off work in the studio.

606
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,830
I'm sorry.

607
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:13,870
It's okay.

608
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,740
Thanks to your recharging,

609
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,400
I'm in an excellent state now.

610
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,310
Really?

611
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,350
Don't worry.

612
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,150
But was the charging just now

613
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,670
a little delayed?

614
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,670
Maybe it's because we're too far away from the tree.

615
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,630
I see.

616
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,470
Do you want to eat out today?

617
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:38,550
Why?

618
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,070
You traveled a long way

619
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:43,190
to deliver the design draft for me regardless of your safety.

620
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:43,950
Shouldn't I

621
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,550
treat you to a meal as a gesture to say thank you?

622
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:47,990
Okay.

623
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,950
Which restaurant do you want to eat at?

624
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,840
There's one in the town.

625
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,030
Okay.

626
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,680
[100-year-old Brand]

627
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:14,500
Didn't you say you don't remember anything?

628
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,159
Then why do you still remember this restaurant?

629
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,650
My memory was only vague because of my lack of spiritual energy.

630
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,550
It's not like I really lost my memory.

631
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,310
Besides, after meeting you,

632
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,600
my memory is recovering gradually.

633
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:34,710
Here's the signature dish you ordered, Yipin Pot.

634
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:35,870
Thank you.

635
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:36,710
Thank you.

636
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:39,909
Nan Hua?

637
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,560
That's not right.

638
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,320
At your age…

639
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,860
you're the son of Nan Hua?

640
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,159
Yes.

641
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,200
Your dad hasn't come for dinner for a long time.

642
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,380
How is he?

643
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,470
He passed away.

644
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,890
I'm sorry.

645
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,650
I didn't know.

646
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,150
It's okay.

647
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:12,370
It was a long time ago.

648
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,760
Your father

649
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,440
used to come to my restaurant for dinner.

650
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,170
I have a deep impression of him.

651
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,790
Up to now,

652
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:22,770
it's been 20 years.

653
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:27,070
You still remember him?

654
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,910
It's all because of my daughter.

655
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,290
Back then,

656
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,150
she had a secret crush on your dad.

657
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:34,990
Then

658
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,070
your dad suddenly stopped coming.

659
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,030
She cried

660
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,620
for a month for that.

661
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:47,580
Boss, what kind of person

662
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,390
was Mr. Nan Hua like?

663
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,330
He was a bit of a solitary man.

664
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,990
Every time he came to eat,

665
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,330
he would

666
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,990
be eating quietly in the corner.

667
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,610
He never talked to anyone.

668
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,670
I was the only one who could have a little chat with him.

669
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:02,550
What a pity.

670
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,950
He was such a good young man.

671
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,790
He left earlier than me.

672
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,440
Look at me.

673
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,390
I'm old and always nagging.

674
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,070
Please don't mind me.

675
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,110
Of course not.

676
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:19,750
It's okay.

677
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,250
All right, I won't hold you up.

678
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,290
Enjoy your meal.

679
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:24,200
Thank you, boss.

680
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,080
No problem.

681
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,650
I didn't know that you had such a romance.

682
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:32,650
Come to think about it,

683
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,050
you're good-looking, after all.

684
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,590
It's expected

685
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,800
that you have secret admirers.

686
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,000
This dish is delicious.

687
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,060
It's true that people are divided into groups.

688
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,870
Your old friend's cooking is like yours.

689
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:50,690
Excellent!

690
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,390
He's not my friend.

691
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:58,130
I don't have any friends.

692
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,160
I see.

693
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,470
You have a long lifespan,

694
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,270
so you're afraid

695
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,400
your friends will leave you one by one.

696
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,310
I understand.

697
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,640
That's what it's like in the dramas.

698
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:17,540
No.

699
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:23,310
Birth, aging, illness, and death are only human nature.

700
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:26,100
You won't wallow in pain once you've accepted it.

701
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,990
Then why don't you make friends?

702
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,930
Lord Zhao wants to invite High Immortal Nan Hua out of the mountain.

703
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:48,400
Old man,

704
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,290
I advise you to tell us where he is.

705
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:56,000
Try to be sensible now that you're so old already.

706
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,080
Good.

707
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,300
Retreat.

708
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,320
In order to find me,

709
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:32,020
those in power wouldn't let go of any clues.

710
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,380
They even started wars.

711
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,340
And everyone who had contact with me

712
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:37,750
will be implicated

713
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,930
and be the victims.

714
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,850
But even if I compromised

715
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,660
and chose to help one side,

716
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,910
the other side would always try their best

717
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:46,990
to change sides.

718
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,560
My friends couldn't have a happy ending, no matter what.

719
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:54,470
Taiping.

720
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:58,750
I'm sorry.

721
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,830
I promise you.

722
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,270
I will stay here forever

723
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:10,730
and protect your descendants for generations.

724
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,110
So I understood

725
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:34,030
that people like me couldn't have friends.

726
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,550
In the long years,

727
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,630
I learned to wait for the person I should be.

728
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,080
I tried to keep a low profile

729
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,890
and stop dragging others into this mess.

730
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:47,470
In this way,

731
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,350
I just need to do my best

732
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,810
to defend only one person.

733
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,270
I will protect that person

734
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,890
even if I have to fight against the whole world.

735
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,150
So,

736
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,300
you approached me

737
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,830
just because I may be

738
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,390
the one you've been waiting for?

739
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:10,710
Yes.

740
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,830
If, I mean, if.

741
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,620
What if I'm not the person you're waiting for?

742
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,750
Then I will disappear

743
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,840
from your world forever

744
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,960
and have nothing to do with you any longer.

745
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:36,030
Can't we be friends?

746
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,510
It's delicious.

747
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,600
What is this dish called again?

748
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,110
It's so d-delicious.

749
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,230
This is chicken brewed with Huadiao wine.

750
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,020
I like this restaurant

751
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,550
because the owner

752
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,610
makes mellow Huadiao wine himself.

753
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,070
It's a good ingredient that thousands of taels of gold can't buy.

754
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,840
And they're very generous.

755
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:13,630
For example,

756
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,890
there is at least 250 grams of wine soup in this dish.

757
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:22,390
250 grams?

758
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:23,830
Yes.

759
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,830
I'm doomed.

760
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,030
It's been a long time since I went on a long journey alone.

761
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:00,910
Sir.

762
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,470
Is this the bus bound for the downtown?

763
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,310
Yes.

764
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:08,570
You haven't swiped your card yet.

765
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,630
Swipe my card?

766
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,770
[Wangqi Town] [Fuhai Building]

767
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,230
Excuse me.

768
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:12,830
Excuse me.

769
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,410
He's acting so weird. What is he doing?

770
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:29,570
He doesn't even know how to swipe a card.

771
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,480
He doesn't even know that.

772
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,170
Sir, you can use cash, too.

773
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,150
Oh! Cash is okay, too?

774
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,150
How much is it?

775
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,230
25 yuan.

776
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:46,320
Since Jin Xia came, I stopped working.

777
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:50,470
It seems I need to earn more money and cut down the expenses.

778
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,730
Sorry, sir.

779
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,380
[Wangqi Town] [Fuhai Building]

780
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,510
I can only walk.

781
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:09,280
But I don't know, after consuming so much spiritual energy, whether I can…

782
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,120
I can't care that much.

783
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,410
Scan and fax it to me later.

784
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,630
But considering the distorted color of the fax

785
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:25,030
will affect my judgment,

786
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:27,470
don't take part in the tryout this time.

787
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:29,750
Okay.

788
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,520
Jin Xia.

789
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:42,910
Nan Hua.

790
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:44,870
That fool.
