1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,410
What are you doing?

3
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:16,590
I'm making a wish upon the meteor.

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,440
Making a wish?

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,270
I remember you don't believe

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,180
astrologers' interpretations of celestial events.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,580
Why are you being so superstitious now?

8
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,880
It's not a superstition. It's about hope.

9
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,670
Hope?

10
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,350
People in my times made wishes upon a meteor

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,760
not because they believed meteors would make their wishes come true

12
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,780
but because meteors were rare.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,980
The act of wishing upon a meteor represents the belief that miracles can happen.

14
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,420
Miracles can happen?

15
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,310
Then let me make wishes upon the meteor.

16
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,870
I hope the war will end soon,

17
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,349
and there will be no starvation in the world.

18
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,210
I also hope everyone is born equal

19
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,590
so that my mother

20
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,120
won't be looked down upon because of her family background.

21
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,539
What is this?

22
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,510
It's a meteor.

23
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,380
I believe your wishes

24
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,840
will come true someday.

25
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:23,670
Is this for me?

26
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,000
Yes.

27
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,320
It's done.

28
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,100
I can't believe it.

29
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,880
I have a house now.

30
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,460
I can't believe

31
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,000
you got a mortgage that will take you thirty years to pay off

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,330
and bought a house in such a remote area.

33
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,090
Jin Xia, are you going to build a resort in the suburb?

34
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,180
Congratulations.

35
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,320
You're a mortgage slave now.

36
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:01,920
Thank you.

37
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,970
But it doesn't matter.

38
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:03,970
My house is so big.

39
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,390
I can rent a room to someone

40
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,070
and use the rent the tenant pays to pay for the mortgage.

41
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,130
I'm not that worried about the mortgage.

42
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,190
I'm more worried that with the house,

43
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,960
you'll gradually stay away from city life.

44
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,090
Your house is more than 50 kilometers away from the city.

45
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,280
It's a bit far,

46
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,350
but I have a car.

47
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,370
Most of the time, I work at home.

48
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,329
Making clothes

49
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,300
and working on my designs.

50
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,030
I don't have to go to the company every day.

51
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,780
Besides, if there's something urgent I need to deal with at the company,

52
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,260
I'll stay and sleep at the company for a couple days.

53
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,520
It's not safe for a girl to live alone now.

54
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,270
If something bad happens to you,

55
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,280
I won't be able to come to help you quickly.

56
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,280
The house is located in a seaside town where residents there are nice.

57
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,079
You don't have to worry about me.

58
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,030
Well, that's not true.

59
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,150
Are you okay?

60
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,490
It's you.

61
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,670
I've finally found you.

62
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,710
What should I do?

63
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,360
No.

64
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,280
Though I don't know if you're a ghost or not,

65
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,220
it would be unkind of me

66
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,550
if I just leave you here.

67
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,980
You win.

68
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,540
What should I do?

69
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,270
Got it.

70
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,190
Wait for me. Be good.

71
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,310
Your legs.

72
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,020
You must be very tall.

73
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,690
I've given you all my quilts.

74
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,150
You should feel warm enough.

75
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,850
You'll be fine, right?

76
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,380
Smells good.

77
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,620
Where am I?

78
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:38,860
The ghost.

79
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,360
The meteor.

80
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,909
Was it my dream?

81
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,270
It's you.

82
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,350
I've finally found you.

83
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,600
Why did it happen on the first day after I moved in?

84
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,990
I'm so tired, Yellow.

85
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,150
Why am I on the bed?

86
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,940
All my quilts were...

87
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,710
Darn it.

88
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,210
That ghost saved me

89
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,160
and covered me with this quilt.

90
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:28,710
Fine.

91
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,720
I should be nice to him.

92
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,750
Smells good.

93
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,110
Morning.

94
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,630
I made you breakfast.

95
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,290
Time was limited so I just made a simple one.

96
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,420
Just make do with it.

97
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,060
Thank you for what you did last night.

98
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,930
You're welcome.

99
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,830
Without you,

100
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,790
I would have become a ghost like you.

101
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,590
Is the food cooked by a ghost really edible?

102
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,960
Take a look at these.

103
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,360
What are they?

104
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,350
They're the draft design and the quotation. I've got them ready.

105
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,370
I thought they wouldn't be ready until next week.

106
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,370
Actually, I got them ready long ago.

107
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,570
I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to feel suspicious.

108
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,549
But now...

109
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,730
I see.

110
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,610
You're a scheming ghost.

111
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,940
Are you going to make a historical drama here?

112
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,420
Why do you want to decorate the house this way?

113
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,070
[Total Renovation Fee: 2,000,000 RMB]

114
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,170
[Total Renovation Fee: 2,000,000 RMB]

115
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,310
200,000 RMB?

116
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,060
That is too much.

117
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,470
Do you have a cheaper plan

118
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,430
of a decoration with a modern style?

119
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,550
Miss Jin, it's not 200,000.

120
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,470
It's 2 million.

121
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,550
[Total Renovation Fee: 2,000,000 RMB]

122
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:13,260
One, two, three, four, five...Seven digits.

123
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,300
[Total Renovation Fee: 2,000,000 RMB]

124
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,710
Two million?

125
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,870
Are you kidding me?

126
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,620
I'm not.

127
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,630
Taiping is so beautiful.

128
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:21,800
To renovate it,

129
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,310
you must use top-class materials and hire the best decorators.

130
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,830
You want me to spend so much money

131
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,360
renovating this shabby house?

132
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,080
I didn't even spend so much buying it.

133
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,800
Taiping is not a shabby house.

134
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,920
It just hasn't been renovated for a long time.

135
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,140
Its beauty remains.

136
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,940
It's definitely a shabby and cheap house.

137
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,030
Why do you think

138
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,030
I bought a house in this remote area?

139
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,230
You bought it because you like the peace and tranquility of the suburb.

140
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,600
The house is near the sea and faces the sun.

141
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,610
It's a pleasure to live here.

142
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,570
I bought this house because I'm afraid I'll

143
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,370
have no money for the food and shelter when I'm old.

144
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,690
Let me tell you.

145
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,110
Women in my family

146
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,550
will all live a long life.

147
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,120
My grandma is 80 years old.

148
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,860
She's very healthy now.

149
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,030
I'll probably live a long life, too.

150
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:14,630
And it's very likely that nobody will marry me.

151
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,450
I'll have to live alone when I'm old.

152
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,600
This house

153
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,520
gives me protection and a sense of security.

154
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,560
Now I can keep making money

155
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,820
and save it to pay off the mortgage.

156
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,980
After I retire,

157
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,090
in my own yard,

158
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,410
I'll grow vegetables and raise chickens.

159
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,680
It's good to be self-sufficient.

160
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,850
Nobody will marry you?

161
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,080
But with your appearance and talent,

162
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,960
you'll be chased by men introduced by matchmakers.

163
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,790
You've been away from the real world for too long.

164
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,600
Do you know how high the divorce rate is

165
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:49,890
for people born in the 1990s in this year's census report?

166
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,710
It's 49.3 percent.

167
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,750
Do you know what it means?

168
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,050
It means almost half of the married couples

169
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,230
got divorced.

170
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,880
So?

171
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,190
Getting married is like a gamble with a 50-50 chance of winning.

172
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,240
Instead of trying to get married, I'd rather buy a house.

173
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,550
Instead of expecting others to bring me happiness,

174
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,430
I'd rather rely on myself.

175
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,030
I don't agree with you,

176
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,880
but I understand.

177
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,090
Miss, what was your original budget?

178
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:30,950
What budget?

179
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,410
The budget for renovating the house.

180
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,050
50,000 RMB.

181
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,670
50,000 RMB?

182
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,630
That's too little for my Taiping.

183
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,980
It's not your Taiping.

184
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,930
I bought this house.

185
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,510
I've been living here for over a thousand years.

186
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,910
It's understandable that I hope to spend more renovating it.

187
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,470
It's understandable.

188
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,860
But I won't increase the budget.

189
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,270
50,000 RMB.

190
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,450
That's too little.

191
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,030
The bathroom can only be a bath module.

192
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,240
Isn't that good?

193
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,020
Taiping shouldn't be made

194
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,620
into a cookie-cutter condo.

195
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,390
How can you say it's cookie-cutter?

196
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,030
It's the beauty of minimalism.

197
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,990
Here, take a look.

198
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,790
This kind of ancient bathroom is old-fashioned.

199
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,110
Nobody likes it.

200
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,390
Nobody uses this kind of large carved bathtub nowadays.

201
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,590
It's old-fashioned?

202
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,620
The classical design is always the most beautiful.

203
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,430
Miss Jin.

204
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,040
You're a designer.

205
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,590
Your understanding of beauty is too shallow.

206
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,790
I'm afraid you won't be a good designer.

207
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,620
Shallow?

208
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,080
At the company, I have to overwork.

209
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,330
At home, I get criticized by a ghost.

210
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,710
Sorry about my words.

211
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,600
I need to go to the real estate agency.

212
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,120
Why?

213
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,350
I'm selling the house.

214
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,150
I'll find you a buyer

215
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,210
who would like to spend 2 million decorating the house.

216
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,040
I'm leaving.

217
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,150
What's wrong?

218
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,390
I feel a little dizzy.

219
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,300
Have a good rest.

220
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,210
We'll talk later.

221
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,110
What's going on? The withered tree comes to life again?

222
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,710
Yesterday it was...

223
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,220
Forget it.

224
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,780
Whoever encounters this strange happening,

225
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,840
will need some time to understand it.

226
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,960
She didn't eat a bite.

227
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:51,070
It's been so long since I got along with someone last time.

228
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,730
I should be careful with my attitude from now on.

229
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,570
What happened?

230
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,390
My car!

231
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,590
Oh, no.

232
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,230
How could it be hit by the meteor?

233
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,970
Can I claim for the loss on my insurance?

234
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,150
Forget it. I'll deal with it when I get back.

235
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:20,910
Ms. Jin.

236
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,790
Who are you?

237
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,650
Did you call the police and say there was a peeper in your house?

238
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,310
You're the officer from yesterday.

239
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,710
Yes, what a coincidence.

240
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,550
You began to patrol so early.

241
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,270
No.

242
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,830
My house is next to yours.

You live here?

Ms. Chen is...

246

My mom.

247

Oh.

248
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,430
Hello.

249
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,110
By the way,

250
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,310
I went home too late last night.

251
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,570
So I didn't bother you.

252
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,670
Have you solved the problem?

253
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,500
What problem?

254
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:54,670
Well,

255
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,460
about that ghost.

256
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,040
Oh, that thing.

257
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,180
Actually, I had a nightmare.

258
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,480
It was a vivid nightmare.

259
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,530
I made a mistake.

260
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,750
I'm sorry.

261
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,830
It's okay. I'm glad you're fine.

262
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,070
But you should be more careful

263
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,940
since you're a girl who lives alone.

264
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,200
Can I have your WeChat?

265
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:13,950
Yes.

But I'm not a police officer yet.

271
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,510
I'm a student at the police academy.

00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,840
I'll graduate in a year.

273

Now I'm an intern auxiliary officer.

Oh, I see.

275
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,790
Officer Ding, you're so hard-working and responsible.

276
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,650
You'll be a good cop in the future.

277
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,600
Thank you.

00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,830
Just call me Ding.

I'll call you Jin Xia.

281
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,710
No problem, Officer Ding.

282
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,190
Sorry, Ding.

283
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,070
I have something else to do. I should go now.

But didn't you buy the house not long ago?

293
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,250
Is it difficult to sell it?

Miss Jin.

295
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,230
I remember you were quite satisfied with this house.

296
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,990
It took you a lot of time and effort to get the mortgage

297
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,470
and buy the house.

298
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,730
Why are you selling it?

299
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,110
Because...

300
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,910
Wait. I cannot say it's a haunted house.

301

Even if he believes it,

303
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:44,560
it's even harder to get the haunted house sold.

304
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,950
Because I'm going to work in Paris soon.

305

I'll need lots of money to cover my expenses abroad.

So you were excited.

No, you were scared.

It was the first day after you moved into that old house.

352
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,430
I guess it was because you were not used to the new place and had a nightmare.

353
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,720
That was impossible.

Is it because I didn't say it clearly

364

I'm telling you a horror story.

He may be a ghost, but he is a good ghost.

371
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:26,390
He may be an alien like Do Min-joon.

372
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,590
Aliens can be bad.

373
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,480
Have you watched the Alien films?

374
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,110
The movies you like

375
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,630
are so different from those I like.

376
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,990
It's not important.

377
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,020
Let's stop chatting.

378
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,830
I came to ask you to help me.

379
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,220
Can you give me

380
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,150
some useful advice?

381
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,660
Useful advice?

382
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,540
As you said,

383
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,750
it's no use calling the police.

384
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,370
It's no use selling the house.

385
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,510
How about

386
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,400
you do everything he asks you to do?

387
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,790
I'd rather find a ghost hunter to deal with him.

388
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,670
It's late.

389
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,510
Are you going back home now?

390
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,670
My teacher will be back in two days.

391
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,870
I've only finished half of the designs.

392
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,840
My drawing board and my materials

393
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,730
are all at home.

394
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,740
The designs I finished are also at home.

395
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,210
My goodness, Jin Xia.

396
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,710
If I can't finish my work,

397
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,750
I won't get paid.

398
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:39,790
If I can't get paid, I won't have money to pay the mortgage.

399
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,280
If I can't pay off the mortgage,

400
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,270
my life

401
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,390
will be ruined.

402
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,160
Then go back.

403
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,690
I should get my draft designs and come back?

404
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,630
Let's go.

405
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,990
Wait, it'll be at night when we arrive.

406
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,470
I'm busy tomorrow.

407
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,380
You either go home with me tonight

408
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,070
or go home on your own tomorrow.

409
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,990
No.

410
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,150
Xiaochuan, you can't leave me alone.

411
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,750
You are my best friend.

412
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,030
Please, go with me.

413
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,990
Go with me.

414
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,710
Jin Xia.

415
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,230
You're embarrassing yourself.

416
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:09,710
Let's go.

417
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:10,990
Okay.

418
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,110
Let me get changed.

419
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,200
We've arrived. I'm so nervous.

420
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,310
Are you ready?

421
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:21,670
Let's go.

422
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,460
Wait.

423
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,230
What's wrong?

424
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,230
Didn't you say

425
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,440
your car had been hit by the meteor?

426
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,270
Yes.

427
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,260
The roof of the car was damaged. I saw it.

428
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,360
What happened?

429
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,080
Good question.

430
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,110
In my yard,

431
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,110
these is a pit caused by that meteor.

432
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,700
The pit must still be there.

433
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,890
When did the light get fixed?

434
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:09,870
Yesterday it was...

435
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,330
What?

436
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,980
Nothing. Lower your voice.

437
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,890
What's that sound?

438
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,910
What sound?

439
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,510
Didn't you hear it?

440
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,620
I heard nothing, but I can feel you're heavy.

441
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,870
Let's go home first.

442
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,130
You open the door.

443
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,790
I don't know the password.

444
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,070
Where is the pit?

445
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,870
Where is that pit?

446
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,020
Where is that pit as big as an adult?

447
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:03,030
What a big pit.

448
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,300
The car is not damaged and there's no pit.

449
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,890
Was everything just my illusion?

450
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,560
It's fine. If you're ill, go see a doctor.

451
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,840
Let's go into the room.

452
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,550
I see nobody.

453
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,360
You scared me.

454
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,910
He's here. I'm not lying.

455
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,270
He's this tall.

456
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:16,820
Tell me.

457
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,510
Why did you trick me into coming here?

458
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,630
I'm not lying.

459
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,790
This is his decoration plan.

460
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,270
A luxurious haunted room.

461
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,090
It's all true.

462
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,260
Welcome home.

463
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,120
You're so handsome.

464
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,950
Are you okay?

465
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,820
What are you doing?

466
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,950
It's not true that ghosts are afraid of millet.

467
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,670
The millet cannot hurt him.

468
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,550
Let's try with dog blood.

469
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,240
No. He's so handsome.

470
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:07,780
He is a...

471
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,660
Miss Jin.

472
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,350
How many more times do I have to repeat?

473
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:12,400
I'm not a ghost.

474
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,870
The light was flashing just now.

475
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,880
That's because, first,

476
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,910
the wires are aging.

477
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,730
Second, when I'm emotional,

478
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,910
my spiritual energy overflows and it disturbs the electrical current.

479
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,540
Just turn the light off and turn it on again.

480
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,340
That makes you more like a ghost.

481
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,290
When you're fighting,

482
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:31,350
you're like a couple.

483
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,320
Are you okay? He's a ghost.

484
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,630
He said he was not a ghost.

485
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,480
You believe him?

486
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,890
If he said so...

487
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:41,830
Miss Jin.

488
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,350
After you left today,

489
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,380
I thought about what you said.

490
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,720
You're willing to leave?

491
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,230
No.

492
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,350
I would like to

493
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,520
pay the mortgage with you.

494
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,150
What?

495
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,340
I'll pay the mortgage with you.

496
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,130
Of course, the house is still yours.

497
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,950
I'll also pay

498
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,890
for the renovation.

499
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:08,720
Is that okay?

500
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,220
Okay, okay.

501
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,890
What are you doing?

502
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,050
This is such a good offer.

503
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,370
Why are you hesitating?

504
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,100
He'll pay half of the mortgage.

505
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,990
He'll also pay for the renovation.

506
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,020
Accept his offer.

507
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,860
Even if you don't,

508
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,290
I can't leave.

509
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:24,580
You asked me why I stayed here before.

510
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,730
I didn't tell you the truth.

511
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,420
It was because I didn't want to scare you.

512
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:33,230
Actually, I'm not just staying here and waiting for someone.

513
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,310
I stay here

514
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,260
because this is the only place where I can collect spiritual energy.

515
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:41,550
What is spiritual energy?

516
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,110
In short,

517
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,070
by collecting spiritual energy which is the energy in nature,

518
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,510
I'll gain life energy.

519
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:53,500
Gain life energy?

520
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,870
That makes you more like a ghost.

521
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,650
It's hard to explain.

522
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,880
But I am indeed trapped here.

523
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,270
Poor thing.

524
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,990
Let him stay.

525
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,470
Accept his offer.

526
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,400
What offer?

527
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,190
You're so kind.

528
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,030
How about I sell this house to you?

529
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,630
Okay, I'll buy the house.

530
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,970
I disagree.

531
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,340
He disagrees.

532
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,740
Why?

533
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,430
Because Miss Jin,

534
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,030
I think

535
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,510
you're the one I've been waiting for.

536
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,000
Is this your draft design?

537
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,960
Yes.

538
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,060
Sorry I took it without telling you.

539
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,540
Wait a moment.

540
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,450
These are meteor-like gemstone earrings.

541
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,450
They belong to me.

542
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,190
Although I don't remember where they came from,

543
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,100
I think

544
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,730
it has something to do with the person I've been waiting for.

545
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,340
The earrings you drew

546
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,150
are quite similar to them.

547
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,480
They're antiques.

548
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:21,150
This...

549
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,870
This must be a coincidence.

550
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,690
Coincidence?

551
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,750
They're too similar.

552
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,060
Yes, they're almost the same.

553
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,460
Come on, tell us.

554
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,430
How did you get the inspiration for this design?

555
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,070
Inspiration?

556
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:42,700
I remember last night,

557
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,560
I smelled the scent of Chinese medicine.

558
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,270
And then I got the inspiration.

559
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,000
The smell of Chinese medicine?

560
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,600
What kind of Chinese medicine's smell could give you inspiration?

561
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,910
The smell had multiple layers.

562
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,070
And it also smelled like mint.

563
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,690
Mint?

564
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,910
Is this it?

565
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,260
I think so.

566
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,590
This sachet was made by me and no one else knows how to make it.

567
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,030
It has been with me for many years.

568
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,350
It can refresh people

569
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,410
and help people remember what happened in the past.

570
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,710
Why are you wearing this?

571
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,310
To help me remember my past.

572
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,960
Your past?

573
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:36,990
I see.

574
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,090
The smell of it

575
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,060
helped you remember your previous life

576
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,720
so you could draw this pair of earrings.

577
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,870
So you're the one he's been waiting for.

578
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,550
Stop joking.

579
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,350
I remember you don't believe anything about ghosts.

580
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,390
Now you believe in reincarnation?

581
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,340
I got it.

582
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,470
He saw my draft

583
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,010
and made a pair of earrings

584
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:04,370
according to the draft.

585
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,920
You want to fool me?

586
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:06,480
I...

587
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,040
Why does he need to fool you?

588
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,960
What can he get from you?

589
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,000
Your money?

590
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,480
He is going to pay half of your mortgage.

591
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,500
Your love?

592
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,800
He's out of your league.

593
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,610
Miss Jin, I'm not a liar.

594
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,520
You may think the earring thing is a coincidence.

595
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,790
But there's one thing that is by no means a coincidence.

596
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:28,580
What is it?

597
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,210
The meteor.

598
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,800
That day, the meteor fell from the sky.

599
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,390
At that time, I didn't have enough spiritual energy

600
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,450
to stop the meteor.

601
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,780
But somehow,

602
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,910
I got charged more spiritual energy

603
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:39,910
because of you.

604
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,630
Got charged?

605
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,990
Do you remember that day,

606
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:56,390
we accidentally

607
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:59,250
got very close to each other?

608
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,790
How close?

609
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,560
Because you helped me get charged spiritual energy,

610
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,830
I regained my long-lost extraordinary energy

611
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,160
and stopped the meteor.

612
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:18,750
Regained your extraordinary energy?

613
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,350
Before that,

614
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,060
due to a lack of spiritual energy,

615
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,190
my extraordinary energy had almost disappeared.

616
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,190
I only had some basic energies left.

617
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,430
After I met you,

618
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,530
I regained my high-level extraordinary energy.

619
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:31,130
This can't be a coincidence.

620
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,510
So romantic.

621
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:35,710
It's like

622
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:39,080
you're his power bank.

623
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,990
It's more like

624
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,630
my energy was absorbed by him.

625
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,190
Ghosts in movies all did that.

626
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,550
Miss Jin, I will never hurt you.

627
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,210
If you're really the person I've been waiting for,

628
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,470
I will also take care of you, protect you,

629
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,710
and try my best to fulfill all your wishes.

630
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:59,710
Please trust me.

631
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,190
Let's call it a day.

632
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,380
I need time to digest it.

633
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,550
Let's talk tomorrow.

634
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,340
Sir.

635
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,190
Which room do you live in?

636
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:23,980
I'm scared to sleep alone.

637
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,150
Can you protect me? Let's sleep in the same room.

638
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,480
You can sleep in my room.

639
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,240
Wait.

640
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:31,170
Bye.

641
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,970
It hasn't sprouted for decades.

642
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,270
Will it wither again soon?

643
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,429
When did the light get fixed?

644
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:11,429
-What?
-Nothing.

645
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,510
She's back.

646
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,630
I knew you would come back.

647
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,630
Ouch! I was so excited that I forgot to use magic to go through the wall.

648
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,690
Didn't you hear it?

649
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,260
I heard nothing, but I can feel you're heavy.

650
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,350
Let's go home first.

651
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,600
You open the door.
