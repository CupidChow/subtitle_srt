[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,150
In the several thousand years of human history,

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,040
there have been many unsolved mysteries.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,950
Are the stories of Dayu controlling the flood and Nvwa mending the sky myths?

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,560
Why would the advancement of human civilization

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,760
surpass its current situations?

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,800
There are all kinds of speculations.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,760
But in fact, the truth

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,760
dates back to the ancient times.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,400
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,720
the highly developed

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,360
prehistoric civilizations once existed on Earth.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,680
Back then, the ancient people

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,080
mastered the scientific civilization far more advanced than that in modern society.

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,160
Their high-level genetic modification technology

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,280
even enabled them to develop

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,390
human potential to the greatest extent.

18
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,960
They could absorb the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,820
to stay alive and even exert extraordinary energy.

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,720
However, a tragic doomsday disaster

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,390
made those human beings almost extinct at that time.

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,710
Countless lives

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,910
and brilliant civilizations were destroyed overnight.

24
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,960
Only a small number of ancient people

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,560
survived the doomsday

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,330
after escaping to the underground in time

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,789
and entering into a frozen hibernation state.

28
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:14,450
After that,

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,180
through tens of thousands of years of self-repair,

30
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,480
our Earth conceived new intelligent lives again,

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,740
namely, the ancestors of modern people.

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,080
And the ancient people sleeping in the underground areas

33
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,480
woke up one after another

34
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,160
and returned to the land.

35
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,870
They saw

36
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,830
the new primitive humans who were still trying to make fire by rubbing wood.

37
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,920
Out of good intentions,

38
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,030
they taught the younger generations

39
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,039
many technologies, such as farming, metallurgy,

40
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,800
construction, flood control, and precautions against natural disasters.

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,729
Many great civilization miracles

42
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,120
were the masterpieces made

43
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,850
by our ancestors with the help of ancient people.

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,759
At that time, the new human beings

45
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,900
[Fuxi Temple]

46
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,960
considered the ancient people with extraordinary energy as deities.

47
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,690
They built temples for them and worshipped them.

48
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,200
As the official historians of various countries exaggerated the stories about them,

49
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,720
many legendary ancient myths have been passed down till now.

50
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,240
In this way,

51
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,440
most ancient people around the world

52
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,360
fitted into the new world with the identities

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,520
of deities.

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,840
But there were also some low-profile ancient people

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,300
who chose to live in seclusion in deep mountains to escape from the mortal world.

56
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,070
However,

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,320
people's worship towards the deities

58
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,400
also gradually generated fear and desires.

59
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,200
The rulers feared that the power of deities

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,840
would become a threat to their royal power.

61
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,390
But they were also greedy

62
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,120
for immortality and the extraordinary power.

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,780
Therefore,

64
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,720
they used various excuses

65
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
to start wars

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,850
against the deities from time to time.

67
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,829
The ancient people were outnumbered

68
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,320
and were no match for the huge armies in the end.

69
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,920
They almost became extinct.

70
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,600
Little did they know

71
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,960
that by imparting the knowledge of weapon forging to the new humans,

72
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,160
they unwittingly unleashed a disaster upon themselves.

73
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,840
Although the ancient people who lived in deep mountains

74
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,400
survived this disaster,

75
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,920
they were hunted by the rulers continuously.

76
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,240
They were even slandered

77
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,510
and considered as horrible mountain spirits or ferocious ghosts.

78
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,880
In the blink of an eye,

79
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,750
those who had been regarded as deities became devils that everyone wanted to kill.

80
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,240
As everything keeps changing in the world,

81
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,920
no one knows the existence of the ancient people anymore.

82
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,270
Only those anecdotes and peculiar stories about ghosts and monsters

83
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,350
have been passed down from generation to generation.

84
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,070
And the tiny minority of ancient people who have survived

85
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,750
are still secretly hiding

86
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,640
in those covert corners in the world till now.

87
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:35,680
Thank you,

88
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,400
Xiuning.

89
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,310
Nan Hua?

90
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,760
Nan Hua?

91
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,600
Did you hear that?

92
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,100
What?

93
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,380
Xiaochuan is pregnant.

94
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,450
The child's father is Mr. Li,

95
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,180
who asked you to design the welfare park and service building.

96
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,110
Right. Let Nan Hua take your pulse.

97
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,520
Is it convenient?

98
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,480
No need.

99
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,180
I'm fine. Don't bother.

100
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,120
That means this scumbag...

101
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,080
met other ancient people before.

102
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,790
Jin Xia.

103
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,750
What's wrong? You don't feel well?

104
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,950
I feel a little dizzy.

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,760
He...

106
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,080
knew this long ago.

107
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,800
Nan Hua, you...

108
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,560
So terminal lucidity can happen to me too.

109
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,830
Nan Hua!

110
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,720
A long time ago,

111
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,800
in a mysterious ancient state in the East,

112
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,510
there was a girl

113
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,640
who was talented in both literature and martial arts.

114
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,280
She was the noble eldest princess of this state

115
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,060
and a brave and battlewise female general.

116
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,050
Her name is...

117
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,820
Li Xiuning.

118
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,200
Li Xiuning grew up

119
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,160
with the viscount Li Chuchen.

120
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,920
They were very close.

121
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,080
She naively thought

122
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,780
she would always be with Chuchen,

123
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,550
reading books and practicing martial arts

124
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,880
for the rest of her life.

125
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,640
Until one day,

126
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,240
Li Xiuning accidentally saved a very special woman

127
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,190
by the edge of a cliff.

128
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,060
Her name is Nan Hua.

129
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,300
She recommended High Immortal Nan Hua to the viscount,

130
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,240
hoping Nan Hua, a very capable person,

131
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,500
can help Chuchen realize his ambition of ruling the world.

132
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:49,200
Then, Li Xiuning put on her military uniform

133
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,090
and marched out for battle.

134
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,220
However, Li Xiuning didn't expect

135
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,860
when she was bravely fighting the enemies on the battlefield,

136
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,270
Chuchen and Nan Hua had decided to retire together.

137
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,510
It had never occurred to her

138
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,950
that Chuchen, who doted on her and loved her,

139
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,910
would abandon her

140
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,440
for another person one day.

141
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,480
Li Xiuning began to hate them because of love.

142
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,940
She secretly started a coup and made the viscount imprisoned.

143
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,210
His life was in danger.

144
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,230
So High Immortal Nan Hua risked her life to save him.

145
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,280
She planned to kill High Immortal Nan Hua

146
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,810
when she was badly injured.

147
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,570
Unexpectedly,

148
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,000
instead of taking revenge on her,

149
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,110
Nan Hua, who still had strength to fight back,

150
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,270
divided her immortality into two parts

151
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,130
and gave them to Chuchen

152
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,740
and her respectively.

153
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,200
Nan Hua said

154
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,420
to the ambitious viscount,

155
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,820
immortality was a gift.

156
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,840
But to her, who was stubborn and paranoid,

157
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,600
immortality was punishment.

158
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,070
After finishing her words,

159
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,540
High Immortal Nan Hua disappeared forever.

160
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,440
Li Chuchen couldn't accept the fact that his best friend was gone.

161
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,470
He mistook himself for Nan Hua

162
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,020
and waited stubbornly at the same place.

163
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,850
Li Xiuning didn't know how to face Chuchen

164
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,260
and decided to turn around and leave.

165
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,700
With her departure,

166
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,710
1,000 years have passed.

167
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,050
During the 1,000 years,

168
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,330
Li Xiuning lived a wandering life

169
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,090
and experienced ups and downs.

170
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,500
Finally, she figured it out.

171
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,960
The world was meaningless to her.

172
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,950
She wanted to die to break free.

173
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,480
Before she ended her life, she secretly went to see Chuchen for the last time.

174
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,320
She didn't expect that although 1,000 years have passed,

175
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,200
Li Chuchen was still in the ancient house,

176
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,800
waiting for someone who would never come back.

177
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,320
At that moment,

178
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,840
Li Xiuning found the ultimate meaning of her life:

179
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,520
to atone for her sins towards Chuchen.

180
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,080
So, with the identity of Jiang Xiaochuan,

181
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,940
she started a plan.

182
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,910
The plan is called

183
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:11,250
Golden House Hidden Love.

184
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,080
When I was little,

185
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,120
I always called you Grandma.

186
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,200
In the blink of an eye,

187
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
I grew up.

188
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,200
But you were still so young.

189
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,560
I thought

190
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,990
you would always be Miss Xiuning.

191
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,900
Who would have thought...

192
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,920
Who would have thought you would have really become a grandma?

193
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,780
If I had known this,

194
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,160
I wouldn't have called you that.

195
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,910
Jun,

196
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,400
there are a lot of trustworthy people.

197
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,520
Open your heart.

198
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,770
Mr. Li, I've invited Miss Jin Xia here.

199
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,550
Got it.

200
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,110
Jin Xia.

201
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,800
Xiaochuan is old?

202
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,710
What do you mean? What happened?

203
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,600
Actually, I'm not very sure.

204
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,440
But I guess

205
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,270
with her spiritual energy drained,

206
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,160
her body functions have also rapidly aged along with it.

207
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,690
What are you talking about?

208
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,720
I mean...

209
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,190
just like Mr. Nan Hua,

210
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,990
she is not a person of our era either.

211
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,600
Actually, I'm not her lover.

212
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,040
In fact,

213
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,360
based on seniority, I've been calling her Grandma.

214
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,830
Grandma?

215
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,530
Our family has served her and received her favors

216
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,180
for generations.

217
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,270
When I was still a child,

218
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,040
the person in my position

219
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,600
was my grandpa.

220
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,680
In short,

221
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,720
she is the real president of Qingshi Group.

222
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,920
How is this possible?

223
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,760
I've known her for 10 years.

224
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,160
She's my best friend.

225
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,150
How could I know nothing?

226
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,740
She deliberately hid it from you.

227
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,870
After all, she has planned this for so many years.

228
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,730
She wouldn't give it away easily.

229
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,920
Planned? Planned what?

230
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,800
The Golden House Hidden Love plan.

231
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,000
Golden House... Hidden Love?

232
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,120
Do you know the person by your side, Mr. Nan Hua,

233
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,150
also the former viscount Li Chuchen,

234
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,590
had a younger sister?

235
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,980
Grandma's original identity

236
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,480
was Li Chuchen's younger sister, Li Xiuning.

237
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,400
It's a long story.

238
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,170
Grandma made a mistake back then.

239
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,270
High Immortal Nan Hua died because of her.

240
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,640
Then she got half of Nan Hua's energy

241
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,870
and shared immortality with Li Chuchen.

242
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,120
They have never met each other in the past 1,000 years.

243
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,790
Until more than 100 years ago,

244
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,810
Grandma decided

245
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,280
to atone for her sins

246
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,760
before the last flowering phase of the ancient tree arrives.

247
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,350
So she made the Golden House Hidden Love plan

248
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,150
and spared no efforts to find you.

249
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,800
I'm sorry.

250
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,300
I need to digest what you said.

251
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,320
Why me?

252
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,670
Because you look like High Immortal Nan Hua

253
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,910
a lot.

254
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,380
Maybe your appearance

255
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,480
can help Li Chuchen with what's been haunting him.

256
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,990
So... it was not fate

257
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,320
that made me buy that house

258
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,480
or meet Nan Hua.

259
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,590
They were arranged by someone.

260
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,630
Yes.

261
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,040
Grandma knew

262
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,580
you would be disappointed if you know the truth.

263
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,840
She has tried her best to make it up to you.

264
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,840
She plans to leave all her assets

265
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,870
to you.

266
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,420
The legacy of Ms. Zhou Yinting

267
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,790
is just a cover.

268
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,960
Most of the assets you received in the end

269
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,040
come from Grandma.

270
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,120
Grandma Zhou was part of Xiaochuan's plan too?

271
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,750
Yes.

272
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,830
Actually... Grandma has done a lot silently.

273
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,730
Now, because of Lin Jiarui,

274
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,200
she has taken back

275
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,460
everything she gave to Ms. Zhou Yinting.

276
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,290
Lin Jiarui got nothing in the end.

277
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,080
Due to the severe blow,

278
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
he died of a heart attack on the spot.

279
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,760
He died?

280
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,920
Grandma has tried her best

281
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,650
to do everything she could.

282
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,320
She wanted to return her energy to Chuchen

283
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,000
after everything is over,

284
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,270
so that he can get a complete utensil

285
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,020
and true immortality.

286
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,040
But...

287
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,290
she didn't expect the ancient tree to be burnt down.

288
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,839
Now her spiritual energy has been drained.

289
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,359
How is Xiaochuan now?

290
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,680
She doesn't want me to tell you.

291
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,840
But...

292
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,600
the situation is terrible.

293
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,320
Will you... go see her for one last time?

294
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,620
Should I call you Jiang Xiaochuan

295
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:46,800
or Li Xiuning?

296
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,680
Jin Xia,

297
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,060
I'm sorry.

298
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
I've been lying to you all this time.

299
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,110
You can have anything you want,

300
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,140
as long as I have it.

301
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,020
I can make it up to you.

302
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,800
I want to hear the truth.

303
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,390
Go ahead.

304
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,730
Have you ever...

305
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,840
treated me as a friend sincerely?

306
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,130
If you asked me this

307
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,650
10 years ago,

308
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,000
maybe I wouldn't even want to answer it.

309
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,080
Back then,

310
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,880
my life was meaningless

311
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,050
and I didn't care about what others think

312
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,320
or if I was misunderstood.

313
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,960
But now,

314
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:41,640
I actually want to leave a good impression

315
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,760
on you

316
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,160
before I die.

317
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,280
Jin Xia,

318
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,580
you are my only and best friend

319
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,800
in my life.

320
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,560
Surprise!

321
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,010
Xiaochuan, why are you here?

322
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,340
Of course I'm here to congratulate you and celebrate.

323
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:15,730
This is for you.

324
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,000
Thank you.

325
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,430
Chuan.

326
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,690
I'm gonna get married.

327
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,080
Congratulations.

328
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,790
Can you... be my bridesmaid?

329
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,230
Of course.

330
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,480
Congratulations.

331
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,170
What are you talking about?

332
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,280
Get better as soon as possible.

333
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,680
Jiang Xiaochuan, got it?

334
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,110
You lied to me.

335
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,440
How can you just die?

336
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,210
I want to get better too.

337
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,080
But I'm afraid I can't.

338
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,930
Why? Why?

339
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,200
We can think of a way.

340
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,220
Just like Chuchen,

341
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,580
my immortality

342
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,880
is over.

343
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,920
Jiang Xiaochuan, don't fall asleep.

344
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,720
Jiang Xiaochuan, wake up!

345
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,760
Jin Xia,

346
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,810
thank you for being willing to forgive me.

347
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,910
Forgiveness

348
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,450
is the last thing I deserve

349
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,360
in my life.

350
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,430
Live well.

351
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,160
Jiang Xiaochuan.

352
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,640
Jiang Xiaochuan! Get up!

353
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,840
Don't fall asleep, Jiang Xiaochuan!

354
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,880
I haven't forgiven you yet.

355
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,950
Get up, Jiang Xiaochuan.

356
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,460
Get up.

357
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,800
Jiang Xiaochuan.

358
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,280
Why?

359
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,290
Why have you all left me

360
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,070
and made me all alone?

361
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,460
Why?

362
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,550
Why?

363
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,370
Jiang Xiaochuan, wake up.

364
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,910
You're back.

365
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,650
You are afraid of the dark, right?

366
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,470
I've repaired the street lamps.

367
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,710
But if you're still afraid,

368
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,740
I can come to pick you up every day.

369
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,280
Okay.

370
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,940
I'm almost done sweeping.

371
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,920
Wait a moment.

372
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,980
I'll go cook later.

373
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,120
Time for dinner.

374
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,380
Go wash your hands.

375
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,400
We should clean up the sofa

376
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,850
and put the books in order.

377
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,830
Nan Hua, what should I do?

378
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:32,550
You took care of everything at home.

379
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,280
You took good care of me.

380
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,130
You've spoiled me.

381
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:45,190
What... What should I do in the future?

382
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,000
You promised me

383
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,490
you'll be happy.

384
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,490
You should eat well,

385
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,110
sleep well, and work hard.

386
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,810
No matter what happens,

387
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,040
you should strive

388
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,690
to get the life you want.

389
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,200
I... promise you.

390
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:09,610
But...

391
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,640
now,

392
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,400
I... I can't do it at all.

393
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,660
But Nan Hua,

394
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:45,490
I'm not the person you've been waiting for.

395
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,990
Everything destined to happen between us

396
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,890
is just a lie.

397
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,060
No matter who you are

398
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,040
and whether you are the one I've been waiting for,

399
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,440
I don't care anymore.

400
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,200
To me,

401
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,850
the most important thing now

402
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,580
is to fulfill my promise to you.

403
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,400
We will be together.

404
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,660
We will work together,

405
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,510
pursue our dreams together,

406
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,880
and experience every important first together.

407
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,230
When you're in a predicament,

408
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:30,050
I'll come forward and face it with you.

409
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,690
I will also take care of your health

410
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,100
and be by your side all the time.

411
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,960
But you haven't fulfilled

412
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,960
any of the promises you made to me.

413
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:19,770
The Settlement Plan.

414
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,490
What are you doing so early in the morning?

415
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,390
I'm working on our date schedule tomorrow.

416
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,510
They are actually the things I've wanted to do with someone

417
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,240
over the past 1,000 years.

418
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,550
We can't do everything you've wanted to do over the past 1,000 years within just one day.

419
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,360
Take our time.

420
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,510
We... have plenty of time.

421
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,320
Okay.

422
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:52,640
The work plan.

423
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,490
Study management.

424
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,710
Run a studio with Jin Xia.

425
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:05,440
She'll be responsible for making creations,

426
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,480
and I'll be responsible for the studio's operation.

427
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,710
The life plan.

428
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,600
Have a baby

429
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,320
with Jin Xia.

430
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,080
If she's willing,

431
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,440
we can have more children

432
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,160
to form a lively big family

433
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,710
and then accompany them to grow up.

434
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,960
The dating plan.

435
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:21,200
Have a romantic relationship with Jin Xia for the rest of my life

436
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,000
and grow old with her.

437
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,430
Do everything she wants with her.

438
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:31,950
Fool.

439
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,350
What should I do?

440
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:40,000
You haven't finished any of the things...

441
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,480
in your plans for your whole life.

442
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:40,880
I'm sorry, Nan Hua.

443
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,940
You had always wanted to carry out the settlement plan,

444
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,199
but I didn't do it with you.

445
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,680
I'm very regretful too.

446
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,520
But...

447
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,350
there is nothing I can do.

448
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:33,460
I'm just an ordinary person.

449
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,970
[Five years later]

450
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,470
This way, please.

451
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,430
What's ahead of us is the most famous scenic spot in this town,

452
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,400
the ancient house attracting meteors.

453
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,160
Is it the house

454
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,920
that was hit by meteors a few times?

455
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,510
Yes.

456
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,460
I guess you have heard

457
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,110
about the legend of Wangqi Town.

458
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,790
A few thousand years ago, a general

459
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:26,800
kept waiting at the door

460
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,200
for his wife, who had gone out, to come back.

461
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,740
In the end, he became a Wife-awaiting Stone.

462
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,490
And this place is the former residence

463
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,470
of the general and his wife.

464
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,650
Someone once said

465
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,160
the frequent visits of meteors

466
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,890
are the signs of the return of the general's wife.

467
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,800
Can we go in and have a look?

468
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,760
Sorry.

469
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,840
This is a private house. It's not open to visitors.

470
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,600
And the owner hasn't come back for a long time.

471
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,520
No one is home.

472
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:50,800
Okay.

473
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,800
Take some photos.

474
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,510
Representatives of the companies,

475
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,920
thank you for coming to the bid opening meeting.

476
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,000
The bidding meeting

477
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,520
for the ancient-style wedding-themed resort project in the tile factory

478
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,650
will officially begin in half an hour.

479
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,110
Please get ready

480
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:14,310
to submit the bidding documents and relevant materials.

481
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,730
Secretary Ding. Secretary Ding?

482
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,200
Secretary Ding!

483
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,880
The bidding is about to start.

484
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,760
Xiang, where are my bidding documents?

485
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,110
Don't you have them?

486
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,810
I think I forgot to bring them here.

487
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:46,070
Then what should we do?

488
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,400
How about going back to get them now?

489
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,200
It'll be too late if I go back now.

490
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:54,970
Yanhai.

491
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:58,430
Mr. Li, why are you here?

492
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,210
You forgot to take the bidding documents with you,

493
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,270
so I brought them to you.

494
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,740
[Bidding documents]

495
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,370
Thank you so much.

496
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:05,950
You are my savior.

497
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,850
But how did you know I didn't take them with me?

498
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,680
When I carried you into your room last night,

499
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,140
I saw them at your bedside.

500
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,590
They were still there before I came out this morning.

501
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,320
I'm sorry.

502
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,620
I was so forgetful.

503
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,510
It was not your fault.

504
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:21,400
Today is the death anniversary of Mr. Nan Hua and Grandma.

505
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,730
Even I am a bit absent-minded.

506
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,700
In the future,

507
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,810
I won't be so forgetful anymore.

508
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,800
Xiang, what about my other documents?

509
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,160
Everything is ready.

510
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:44,900
[The bidding meeting for the ancient-style wedding-themed resort project in the tile factory]

511
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,420
Qingshi Group, please check.

512
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,440
How time flies!

513
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,630
Another year has passed.

514
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,150
Brother, how are you doing over there?

515
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,000
Brother, I'm the president's secretary now.

516
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,620
I'm waiting for you to come back so that I can assist you.

517
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:45,560
Don't worry.

518
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,830
The group is doing very well now.

519
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:49,510
We got

520
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,640
a very big development project today.

521
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,330
I haven't forgotten the wills

522
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:54,860
of you or Xiaochuan.

523
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:59,080
The town is developing better and better.

524
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,610
There are a lot of tourists here.

525
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,710
The price of my house

526
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,390
has quadrupled.

527
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,910
My mom is so happy.

528
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,400
So don't worry about anything.

529
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,600
Just come back.

530
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,980
You'll really come back, right?

531
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,840
You will.

532
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,400

533
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,190
I miss you.

534
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,880
You told him too many things.

535
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,120
But I'm afraid he doesn't want to hear them.

536
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,650
Tell him more about Jin Xia.

537
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,280
That woman is so busy.

538
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,430
I don't know where she is.

539
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,760
Good morning, everyone.

540
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,000
Next, I'm going to analyze

541
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,660
my end-of-term works for you:

542
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,490
Ancient.

543
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:34,160
The inspiration comes from the legendary ancient people.

544
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,900
In the prehistory before the modern civilization,

545
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,980
there was an ancient civilization.

546
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,690
Their technology was far more advanced.

547
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,820
The ancient people have immortality,

548
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,780
great wisdom, and powerful extraordinary energy.

549
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,800
Unfortunately, due to a doomsday catastrophe,

550
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,260
they were almost extinct.

551
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,670
A few of the ancient people survived

552
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,630
and were worshiped

553
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:54,210
as deities by modern people's ancestors.

554
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,450
Although the ancient people are capable of everything,

555
00:41:56,450 --> 00:42:00,440
they are gentle, innocent, and kind.

556
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,790
They are as pure as white paper.

557
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,600
If you look closely, you will find

558
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,440
the Suzhou embroidery I chose this time

has combined the characteristics of Suzhou embroidery in different times.

560
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,220
And I made some improvements.

561
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,640
The ancient people have long lifespans.

562
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,790
Their lifespans are long enough for them

563
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:18,120
to span the entire history of China.

564
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,800
It combined and absorbed

565
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,000
the cultural essence of all dynasties.

566
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,410
Just because their lifespans are so long,

567
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:28,140
they've experienced too many partings.

568
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,310
So they

569
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:31,990
know better than anyone else in the world

570
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:35,840
that the most precious thing is sincere and simple feelings.

571
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,430
So this time, I chose cotton and linen

572
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,800

Are there really ancient people in the world?

576
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,600
no.

Is it really you?

746
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,280
It's me.

747
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,240
You're really back, Brother.

748
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:48,800
It's me.

749
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,460
So this time, you won't disappear again, right?

750
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,490
You're back and you'll stay here forever, right?

751
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:53,890
Yes. Yes.

752
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,440
Brother, in the past five years,

753
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:57,940
I ate well, slept well,

754
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,800
and worked hard every day

755
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,070
as you told me.

756
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:02,830
Whether in good times or bad times,

757
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:04,030
I have never given up.

758
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:05,280
Wait.

759
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:08,370
You told him that?

760
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,370
No.

761
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,440
Brother.

762
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:13,390
You better not have.

763
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,210
Alright, Yanhai. Alright.

764
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:21,750
Right, Nan Hua,

765
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:25,080
since you have come back,

766
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,770
is it possible for Xiaochuan to come back too?

767
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:36,590
Xiuning sacrificed

768
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:39,650
the white cherry tree's spiritual energy completely.

769
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,880
She's dead

770
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:43,540
and gone.

771
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,880
I'm sorry to hear that,

772
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:00,510
but according to Li Yingjun,

773
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,660
Xiaochuan always said

774
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,840
immortality was a curse to her.

775
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,560
Maybe leaving like this

776
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:10,770
can make her have nothing to worry about.

777
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:21,480
Alright.

778
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:22,800
Since my brother is back,

779
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:23,900
it's a good thing.

780
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:25,460
Jin Xia,

781
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:26,830
don't be too greedy.

782
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:28,800
Okay.

783
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:30,670
Right, Brother,

784
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,080
since you're back,

785
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,230
do you want to go back to Qingshi Group to work?

786
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:37,360
The position of the president is still reserved for you.

787
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:40,070
I'll start from the grassroots level.

788
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:40,720
Okay.

789
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:42,020
Anyway,

790
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:43,810
I can be with you every day in the future.

791
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:44,980
It's really great.

792
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:47,570
You can't.

793
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:48,650
Nan Hua promised me

794
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:50,850
he will travel around the world with me.

795
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:51,640
Really?

796
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:53,520
I'll go with you too.

797
01:01:53,660 --> 01:01:54,430
No.

798
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:56,040
Why not?

799
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:58,110
Jin Xia, you're so petty.

800
01:01:58,270 --> 01:01:59,720
Petty?

801
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:01,610
Nan Hua is my husband.

802
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:02,660
Nan Hua.

803
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:05,900
Brother.

804
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:10,050
Let's travel another time, just the two of us, okay?

805
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,680
I don't think it's appropriate.

806
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:12,950
It is appropriate.

807
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,920
How about France? It's very romantic.

808
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,040
I don't think it's a good idea.

809
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,800
Ding Yanhai, get out!

810
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:18,640
Brother.

811
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,080
-Nan Hua.
-Brother.

812
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:22,780
Brother.

813
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:24,980
-You are not allowed to go with him.
-I won't go.

814
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:25,510
Brother.

815
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,560
Brother, go with me. Go with me.

816
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,960
Brother, look. She's bullying me.
