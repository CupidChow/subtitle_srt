00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,190
In the several thousand years of human history,

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,070
there have been many unsolved mysteries.

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:15,350
Are the stories of Dayu controlling the flood and Nvwa mending the sky myths?

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,390
Why would the advancement of human civilization

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,800
surpass its current situations?

7
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,830
There are all kinds of speculations.

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,790
But in fact, the truth

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,790
dates back to the ancient times.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,270
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

11
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,740
the highly developed

12
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,630
prehistoric civilizations once existed on Earth.

13
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,580
Back then, the ancient people

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,400
mastered the scientific civilization far more advanced than that in modern society.

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,030
Their high-level genetic modification technology

16
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,180
even enabled them to develop

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,990
human potential to the greatest extent.

18
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,840
They could absorb the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth

19
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,540
to stay alive and even exert extraordinary energy.

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,790
However, a tragic doomsday disaster

21
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,300
made those human beings almost extinct at that time.

22
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:01,750
Countless lives

23
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,390
and brilliant civilizations were destroyed overnight.

24
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,840
Only a small number of ancient people

25
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,500
survived the doomsday

26
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,880
after escaping to the underground in time

27
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,630
and entering into a frozen hibernation state.

28
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,510
After that,

29
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,940
through tens of thousands of years of self-repair,

30
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,170
our Earth conceived new intelligent lives again,

31
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,450
namely, the ancestors of modern people.

32
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,850
And the ancient people sleeping in the underground areas

33
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,550
woke up one after another

34
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,190
and returned to the land.

35
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:28,910
They saw

36
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,550
the new primitive humans who were still trying to make fire by drilling wood.

37
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,810
Out of good intentions,

38
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,990
they taught the younger generations

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,009
many technologies, such as farming, metallurgy,

40
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,150
construction, flood control, and precautions against natural disasters.

41
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,580
Many great civilization miracles

42
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,039
were the masterpieces made

43
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,670
by our ancestors with the help of ancient people.

44
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,600
At that time, the new human beings

45
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,789
[Fuxi Temple]

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,600
considered the ancient people with extraordinary energy as deities.

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,670
They built temples for them and worshipped them.

48
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,229
As the official historians of various countries exaggerated the stories about them,

49
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,750
many legendary ancient myths have been passed down till now.

50
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,150
In this way,

51
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,370
most ancient people around the world

52
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,330
fitted into the new world with the identities

53
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,550
of deities.

54
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,790
But there were also some low-profile ancient people

55
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,150
who chose to live in seclusion in deep mountains to escape from the mortal world.

56
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,030
However,

57
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,160
people's worship towards the deities

58
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,270
also gradually generated fear and desires.

59
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,120
The rulers feared that the power of deities

60
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,579
would become a threat to their royal power.

61
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,460
But they were also greedy

62
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,640
for immortality and the extraordinary power.

63
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:31,630
Therefore,

64
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,660
they used various excuses

65
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,690
to start wars

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,820
against the deities from time to time.

67
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,710
The ancient people were outnumbered

68
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,850
and were no match for the huge armies in the end.

69
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,160
They almost became extinct.

70
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,300
Little did they know

71
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,530
that by imparting the knowledge of weapon forging to the new humans

72
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:51,430
they unwittingly unleashed a disaster upon themselves.

73
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,730
Although the ancient people who lived in deep mountains

74
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,320
survived this disaster,

75
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,690
they were hunted by the rulers continuously.

76
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,090
They were even slandered

77
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,850
and considered as horrible mountain spirits or ferocious ghosts.

78
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,770
In the blink of an eye,

79
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,270
those who had been regarded as deities became devils that everyone wanted to kill.

80
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:09,870
As everything keeps changing in the world,

81
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,340
no one knows the existence of the ancient people anymore.

82
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,230
Only those anecdotes and peculiar stories about ghosts and monsters

83
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,329
have been passed down from generation to generation.

84
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,380
And the tiny minority of ancient people who have survived

85
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,710
are still secretly hiding

86
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,579
in those covert corners in the world till now.

87
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:49,800
The baby has been born.

88
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,590
When you left,

89
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,870
Mrs. Bian next door just got pregnant.

90
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,950
Now the baby has been born.

91
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,340
Mr. Nan, sorry to bother you.

92
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,590
Mr. Bian, what can I do for you?

93
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,410
You are knowledgeable.

94
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,920
I would like to ask you

95
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,350
to name my son.

96
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,030
Me?

97
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,520
Then call him Taiping.

98
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,230
Peace is the most precious thing in the world.

99
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,040
Taiping, you feed it.

100
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,320
Okay, Mr. Nan Hua.

101
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:10,630
Here.

102
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,110
It's been 60 years.

103
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,670
Will you come back?

104
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,290
May I ask if you are Lord Li Chuchen?

105
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,150
Chuchen?

106
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,190
You'll sleep with me.

107
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,270
It's such a big house.

108
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,550
But you insist on letting me sleep with you.

109
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,110
What is this?

110
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,740
What's wrong?

111
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,470
What is this?

112
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:14,590
Sorry.

113
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,320
This is my bed.

114
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,950
How... How did you get in?

115
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,540
I locked the door, right?

116
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,410
I came in through the wall.

117
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,400
You said you're not a ghost, right?

118
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,320
Sorry.

119
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,120
You came back in a hurry.

120
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,850
I forgot to close the secret door.

121
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,540
This coffin is made of ebony.

122
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,310
It's corrosion resistant, dustproof, and mothproof.

123
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,550
It's the most suitable for long-term sleep.

124
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,310
Now you should believe that he's a ghost, right?

125
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,310
Maybe he's just

126
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,990
an alien with strange hobbies.

127
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,150
It's amazing.

128
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,310
Don't worry, Miss Jin.

129
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,830
From now on, as long as you are in this house,

130
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,710
I will never barge into this room.

131
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,930
I'm going to sleep... in the living room.

132
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,860
Bye.

133
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:27,670
He really can walk through the wall.

134
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,990
He really can walk through the wall.

135
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,330
He really can walk through the wall.

136
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,090
So exciting.

137
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,180
So exciting.

138
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,390
Is it necessary to be so worried?

139
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,590
Chuan.

140
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,400
Obviously, Nan Hua

141
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,670
is not a bad person.

142
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,270
Considering what he's capable of,

143
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,830
he would have done it long ago if he wants to hurt you.

144
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,060
Instead of hurting you,

145
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,310
he has always protected you.

146
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,030
You want to find a roommate, right?

147
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,790
In my opinion,

148
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,500
he's so good.

149
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,790
Just accept him.

150
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,840
You know I want a human roommate, right?

151
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,880
Is he a human?

152
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,950
What does it matter?

153
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,030
The competition in society is so fierce now

154
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,549
because there are too many people.

155
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,110
Have you forgotten why you wanted to buy a house?

156
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,350
Because you were under too much pressure at work

157
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,380
and you had no sense of belonging.

158
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,510
Because your ex-boyfriend was unreliable

159
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,680
and you felt lonely.

160
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,150
And because the landlord kept picking on you

161
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,780
and you didn't want to make do with it.

162
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,710
Aren't these problems caused by humans?

163
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,110
You

164
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,590
always said you want to die alone.

165
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,510
You are just passive.

166
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,230
You, a wedding dress designer,

167
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,830
don't believe in marriage?

168
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,270
Don't you have any yearning for a wedding dress?

169
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,550
I think it's a good thing that Nan Hua appeared.

170
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,390
A good thing?

171
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,670
He has endured the most severe injury in the world.

172
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,840
So he became the gentlest man in the world.

173
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,310
What nonsense are you talking about?

174
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,630
You said it like you know him.

175
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,470
I just think

176
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,960
you need a chance to be a better person.

177
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,500
Nan Hua is that chance.

178
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,620
Jiang Xiaochuan.

179
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,700
What?

180
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,460
I find that you are sometimes wise

181
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:48,900
and sometimes stupid.

182
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,790
Do you have a schizotypal personality disorder?

183
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,860
You have a schizotypal personality disorder.

184
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,580
Sleep.

185
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,140
I'm just kidding, Xiaochuan.

186
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,310
Don't touch me.

187
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,360
It tickles.

188
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,350
Come on.

189
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,170
Okay.

190
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,250
Good night.

191
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,170
[Property agent: Liu]

192
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,340
[Property agent: Liu]

193
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,310
Miss Jin,

194
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,750
we have listed your house.

195
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,910
Aren't ghosts afraid of cats?

196
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,640
Could it be that he's not a ghost?

197
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,950
But he...

198
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,380
If he's not a ghost,

199
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,490
it won't matter if I try it again, right?

200
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,150
It smells so good.

201
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:13,990
You're awake.

202
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,230
What's that smell?

203
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,190
Coffee?

204
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,430
I think it's from outside.

205
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,590
That... probably...

206
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,510
is the smell of offerings.

207
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,630
Offerings?

208
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,440
I can do this.

209
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,620
There is breakfast.

210
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,750
You're awake.

211
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:05,870
Morning.

212
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,000
I prepared a morning meal for you.

213
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,050
Breakfast.

214
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,300
Can I eat now?

215
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,370
Of course.

216
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,990
Aren't you afraid of becoming offerings?

217
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,190
Delicious.

218
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,190
Have a taste.

219
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:26,950
Here.

220
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,840
No.

221
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,230
It's really good.

222
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,320
No, thanks.

223
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,340
Tell me what this is called.

224
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,150
Beef in a Five-inch Plate.

225
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,190
-What?
-What?

226
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,870
Beef in a Five-inch Plate.

227
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,120
The cooking method is actually very simple.

228
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,020
Cut the marbled beef into pieces,

229
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,620
fry them, wash them, dry them,

230
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,730
and put them in the prepared bone soup

231
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,850
to stew them for half an hour with low fire.

232
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,540
When they are cooked, pick them up and cover them with starch evenly.

233
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,310
Lastly,

234
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,910
apply the thin pastes

235
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,880
made with egg liquid, flour, and lard

236
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,870
and use high heat to fry them.

237
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,570
Although I don't understand,

238
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,550
I think it's amazing.

239
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,980
Yes. He seems to have some misunderstandings about simplicity.

240
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,860
I've been studying cooking for 1,000 years.

241
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,340
Practice makes perfect.

242
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:18,950
It's so delicious.

243
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,600
Why do you keep staring at us?

244
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,390
I'm sorry. My bad.

245
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,370
Because it's been so long

246
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,270
since I had a meal with someone.

247
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,430
Right. There's also lean meat porridge in the kitchen.

248
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,390
I'm going to take a look.

249
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,570
Nan Hua is such a good cook.

250
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,770
He even knows how to repair a house.

251
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,390
He does housework too.

252
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,240
He's the most suitable person to be your roommate.

253
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,320
You said "person".

254
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,990
Is he a human?

255
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,670
Why are you still thinking about this?

256
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,390
Come on. Let me analyze it for you.

257
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,430
He can't leave this house, right?

258
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,550
He will

259
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,830
stay in this house anyway.

260
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,270
If your new roommate finds out

261
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,350
your house is haunted,

262
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,520
the price of this house will plunge,

263
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,230
not to mention the rent. Right?

264
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,390
So,

265
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,920
just calmly accept Nan Hua.

266
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,180
She's here.

267
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:39,240
Coming.

268
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:58,780
Master... Murong?

269
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,150
Miss Jin?

270
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,530
Yes, it's me.

271
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,030
Finally, you are here.

272
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,020
The porridge is ready.

273
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,310
Where is Miss Jin?

274
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,240
She has a guest. She went to open the door.

275
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:13,690
What is this?

276
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,330
Where are you?

277
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,210
Miss Jin is not married yet.

278
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,840
I'm a man.

279
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm afraid others will think too much if they know I'm here.

280
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,660
I'd better make myself invisible first.

281
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,160
It can save a lot of trouble.

282
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,700
Very considerate

283
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:27,920
and thoughtful.

284
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,250
This is...

285
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,960
Where is he?

286
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,470
He went invisible because he's worried he might disturb your guest.

287
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:41,730
Invisible?

288
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,940
The ghost I mentioned

289
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,920
can make himself invisible.

290
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,270
Don't panic. Let me take a look first.

291
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,020
He's not in this room.

292
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,730
He must have hidden somewhere.

293
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,810
No need to look for me. I'm right here.

294
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,630
Jin Xia, good for you.

295
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,720
You found a sorceress secretly.

296
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,109
I had no choice.

297
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:30,790
Abracadabra.

298
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,090
Master, your talisman doesn't seem to work.

299
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,230
He's a ghost king. It's a bit tricky.

300
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,690
Bring me a bowl of clean water.

301
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,030
Drink this bowl of holy water,

302
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,910
and he can't hurt you anymore.

303
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,860
But actually...

304
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,780
he has never hurt me.

305
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,710
This time, I invited you here

306
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,720
to help him rest in peace.

307
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,460
I'm not gonna drink the holy water.

308
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,470
Don't be silly.

309
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,780
Ghosts are manifestations of lingering resentment.

310
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,000
He approached you

311
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,270
to absorb your energy

312
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,840
and occupy your body.

313
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,060
Don't be bewitched by him.

314
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,800
Drink it.

315
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,630
This elixir is very rare.

316
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,470
Enough!

317
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,550
You... You evil ghost!

318
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,310
Don't come near me! Con't come near me!

319
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,710
Abracadabra.

320
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,790
I'm a disciple of Master Sanmao.

321
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,590
I'm not afraid of ghosts or deities.

322
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,700
With the skills of my master,

323
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,420
I'm gonna eliminate all evil spirits.

324
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,630
In the name of God of Heaven and Earth,

325
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,780
all problems shall stay away from people.

326
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,070
All demons and ghosts shall turn into dust.

327
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,660
Abracadabra.

328
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,960
The exorcism spell.

329
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,250
I remember.

330
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,870
Remember? Remember what?

331
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,790
I remember for your selfish desires,

332
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,430
you said my clansmen were evil spirits.

333
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,880
And then you injured and killed us in the name of justice.

334
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,760
Don't you want to see ghosts?

335
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,850
I'm gonna let you see one today.

336
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,170
A ghost! A ghost!

337
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,800
There is a ghost in broad daylight!

338
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,140
I saw a real ghost!

339
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,730
What happened to her?

340
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:46,900
An illusion.

341
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,040
I showed her an illusion she's afraid of.

342
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,860
The fear in humans arises from their hearts.

343
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,070
Why?

344
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,930
Why won't you believe me?

345
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,720
I'm sorry.

346
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,660
I was too scared to control myself.

347
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,700
What are... these?

348
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,660
Coffee beans. Don't worry.

349
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,740
Coffee... beans.

350
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,610
What's wrong? What happened to you?

351
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,230
I just... remembered

352
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,990
actually, I'm an ancient...

353
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,830
An ancient m-merchant...

354
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:46,860
An ancient person.

355
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,390
What... is an ancient m-merchant?

356
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,900
Miss Jin,

357
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,690
please lend me your index finger.

358
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:02,370
What do you want to do?

359
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,070
I'm going to show you my memory.

360
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:24,670
Kill him! Kill him!

361
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:30,270
Kill him! Kill him!

362
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,270
Ancient people.

363
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,730
A-Ancient people. Ancient people.

364
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,280
Why is his arm so cold?

365
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,530
No.

366
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,170
No.

367
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,500
The hospital.

368
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,180
Let's go.

369
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,170
Be careful.

370
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,510
Well.

371
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,660
What... What happened?

372
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,980
I can't get out when I don't have enough spiritual energy.

373
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:13,780
No, you're too cold.

374
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,430
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

375
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,870
If I had believed you...

376
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,440
Will you turn into dust

377
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,550
like they portray in TV dramas?

378
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,330
You want me to disappear, right?

379
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,080
No.

380
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:26,470
No, I don't want you to disappear.

381
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,810
It's all my fault.

382
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:29,970
I'm sorry.

383
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,340
Don't disappear.

384
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,290
Please don't disappear.

385
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,950
It's okay.

386
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,870
Because it's you,

387
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,130
it's okay.

388
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,420
I'm sorry. Sorry.

389
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,230
I'm losing my spiritual energy.

390
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,510
Losing your spiritual energy?

391
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,070
What does that mean?

392
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,710
Does that mean you don't have enough energy

393
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,870
and you need to be recharged?

394
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:53,590
Recharged?

395
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,210
How?

396
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:05,910
I don't know how.

397
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,220
How to recharge him?

398
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,890
Don't disappear.

399
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:14,400
I know a way.

400
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:16,450
Let's try it first.

401
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,750
Then thank you, Miss Jin.

402
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,730
I need to go back to the coffin to rest for a while.

403
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,380
The coffin?

404
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,410
It's in my room.

405
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,000
Let's go.

406
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,500
Be careful.

407
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,150
He has told you many times

408
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:48,930
he's not a ghost.

409
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,370
Why did you find a sorceress to torture him?

410
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,000
I... I just wanted to help him.

411
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,440
I didn't expect it to be so serious.

412
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,240
Is this how you help him?

413
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,310
Even if he is a ghost,

414
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,510
he saved your life.

415
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,820
You wanted to offer him salvation.

416
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,870
Did you ask him if he is willing to be reincarnated?

417
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,350
Did you respect his wishes?

418
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,760
Ghosts should be reincarnated, right?

419
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,220
Women should get married.

420
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,570
Women who don't get married or give birth to a child can't be counted as women.

421
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,310
That's not the same.

422
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,460
You are my friend.

423
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:20,590
Why do I feel

424
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:21,820
you've been defending him?

425
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,630
I... I am doing this for your own good.

426
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,490
Think about it.

427
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,160
I'm gonna make a call and ask for a leave.

428
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,550
Ask for a leave?

429
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,590
I can't leave you here, right?

430
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,340
Otherwise, you'll say I don't treat you as a friend

431
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,440
and I'm not on your side.

432
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,420
Xiaochuan,

433
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,380
thank you.

434
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:49,990
You're welcome.

435
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,150
Tell me

436
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,190
what ancient people are later.

437
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,020
Okay.

438
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,480
It's been so long. Is he okay?

439
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,030
Yesterday...

440
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,140
What are you doing?

441
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,950
I'm here to apologize to Miss Jin.

442
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,560
For what?

443
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,750
I was rude to you yesterday.

444
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,900
I'm really sorry.

445
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,070
It was a special situation. I understand.

446
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,790
And you only kissed my forehead.

447
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,620
You are being too exaggerated.

448
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,330
You... get up now.

449
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,070
Put this on.

450
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,300
Miss Jin, you don't blame me?

451
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,730
Of course I don't blame you.

452
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,000
It was my fault.

453
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,460
If it weren't for me,

454
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,110
you wouldn't have been hurt like this.

455
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:25,250
Right. Are you... feeling better?

456
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,050
I'm fine now.

457
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,440
That's good. That's good.

458
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,940
You don't need to blame yourself.

459
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,190
Actually, what happened yesterday is a blessing in disguise.

460
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,160
If you hadn't thrown coffee beans on me,

461
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,210
I wouldn't have remembered so many things.

462
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,080
I even remember

463
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
why I am allergic to coffee.

464
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,030
So...

465
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:48,550
So...

466
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,890
why are you allergic to coffee beans?

467
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,610
Ancient people

468
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,380
have no immunity

469
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,410
to many new things nowadays.

470
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,560
Some of us are allergic to rice.

471
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,740
Some of us are allergic to salt.

472
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,140
While some of us are allergic to fine silver.

473
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,620
I'm a bit special.

474
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,230
I'm allergic to coffee.

475
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,950
So there are no ghosts in this world?

476
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:19,830
Only ancient people... who fear salt or silver?

477
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,840
Legends of ghosts and gods

478
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,570
are just rumors over the centuries.

479
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,270
I know it's hard to make you believe these things.

480
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,530
After all, I don't have

481
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,480
any solid evidence.

482
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,490
But Miss Jin,

483
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,680
I swear...

484
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,740
I will never lie to you.

485
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,440
Otherwise...

486
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,000
Otherwise, I'll die from soaking in coffee.

487
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,250
What are you talking about?

488
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,140
Then...

489
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,920
I believe you.

490
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,350
Really?

491
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,770
After all, no ghost

492
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,040
would be afraid of coffee.

493
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:56,370
Right.

494
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,520
You said you would pay the mortgage with me

495
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,480
and design for me free of charge. Does it still count?

496
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,850
Of course.

497
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,010
That's good.

498
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,610
I mean...

499
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,880
the point is

500
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:11,130
it doesn't matter who my roommate is.

501
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,110
Even if he can't go invisible or walk through walls,

502
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,140
it doesn't mean he's a good roommate.

503
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:18,710
Roommate?

504
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,250
You mean...

505
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,220
I mean...

506
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,220
I agree to let you live with me.

507
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:28,230
And don't sleep in the living room again.

508
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,230
I've cleaned up the guest room for you.

509
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,500
You can sleep in the guest room tonight.

510
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:32,430
Really?

511
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,220
But we need to make three rules.

512
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,740
I'm all ears.

513
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:37,910
First,

514
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,130
you can't take off your clothes easily.

515
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:45,780
Okay.

516
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,310
Second,

517
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,180
you can't use magic at home.

518
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,120
I mean... your extraordinary energy.

519
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,340
You can't go through walls, go invisible,

520
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,320
or float.

521
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,760
No problem.

522
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:57,110
Okay.

523
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,830
Third,

524
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,320
can you not live in this coffin for now?

525
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,380
I'm really scared if it's in this house.

526
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,830
Okay. When the house decoration is finished,

527
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,300
I'll move the coffin to the guest room.

528
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,300
I won't make you feel uncomfortable.

529
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,180
Thank you.

530
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:17,020
Right. One more thing.

531
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,230
From now on, you must keep a low profile.

532
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,850
Don't let others know

533
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,250
I live with a man.

534
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:25,970
Of course.

535
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,490
Miss Jin's reputation comes first.

536
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:29,920
I will never let anyone find out I live here,

537
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,660
just like I did in the beginning.

538
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,670
Okay.

539
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,160
If...

540
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,250
If someone sees you,

541
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,910
we'll just tell them

542
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,480
that... you're here to repair my house

543
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,430
and you live here temporarily.

544
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,300
Okay?

545
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,080
Okay.

546
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:44,700
Good.

547
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,990
Did I make four rules?

548
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:51,580
And there is the fifth rule.

549
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,580
Jiang Xiaochuan, when did you wake up?

550
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,020
I woke up when you were listening to the story.

551
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,550
The fifth rule Miss Jiang just said is...

552
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,540
You need to teach her how to get along with men

553
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,790
and how to overcome her fear of intimate relationships.

554
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,060
What nonsense are you talking about again?

555
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:15,110
But... I don't know much about these either.

556
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,740
Don't worry. You can do it.

557
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:20,510
But I'm afraid I don't have enough time.

558
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,910
Don't think about such nonsense.

559
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,880
Forget about time.

560
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:28,260
Falling in love usually happens in the blink of an eye.

561
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:28,990
Yeah.

562
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,390
Yeah.

563
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:32,850
What are you talking about?

564
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,670
It's good to be single.

565
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,510
Being single makes me feel good.

566
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,840
Always and forever.

567
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,870
Really?

568
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,450
Do you really think you are single

569
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,000
because you like to be alone?

570
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:48,920
What else could the reason be?

571
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,960
It's not true that girls in this era

572
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,190
don't need love.

573
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:55,380
They are just disappointed in love.

574
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:56,170
When they were young,

575
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,120
they thought love in fairy tales was so beautiful.

576
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,140
When they grew up,

577
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,170
they found love is complicated and realistic.

578
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,250
They have been disappointed many times. So they shut themselves off.

579
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,620
This is called love incompetence.

580
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:06,520
What nonsense is this?

581
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,380
So it's not that they don't need love.

582
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,219
It's a kind of

583
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,560
physical and mental expression

584
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:14,110
of not compromising.

585
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,760
I remember you said

586
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:24,060
she might be the one that you've been waiting for for 1,000 years.

587
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,610
It's a misunderstanding. Definitely.

588
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,000
Only gentle and sincere people

589
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,870
like Nan Hua

590
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:34,690
can warm your cold heart.

591
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:35,530
So,

592
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,909
you just need to think of yourself as the person he's been waiting for.

593
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:41,510
He will warm you and protect you.

594
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,659
Both of you can get what you need.

595
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,110
What are you talking about?

596
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,110
You're his power bank.

597
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:51,449
If you accidentally hurt him again,

598
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:53,639
you need to kiss and hug him to save him.

599
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,409
You are intimate, but you are not lovers.

600
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:57,560
Why don't you

601
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,120
just make do with it and become a couple?

602
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,620
Who wants to make do with it?

603
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,860
Look at yourself. It's good that you can make do with it.

604
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,660
I'm going to be late.

605
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,700
Oh no.

606
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,900
Your house is over 50 kilometers from my company.

607
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,070
I'll be late if I go there by bus.

608
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,390
I'll drive you there.

609
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,720
Okay, let's go.

610
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:28,820
Wait.

611
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,220
I don't know if there's anything wrong with that car.

612
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,070
What's wrong with it?

613
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,760
It's... You don't remember?

614
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,300
Don't worry. I've fixed it.

615
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,700
You fixed it? How?

616
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,310
Guys, I'm in a hurry to go to work.

617
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:40,680
Let's talk in the car, okay?

618
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:42,460
Safety first.

619
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:43,960
Why don't we take the car for maintenance first?

620
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,040
Take a taxi today.

621
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:48,120
If you're worried,

622
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,590
I can go with you.

623
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,580
I thought you can't leave this house, right?

624
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,710
Actually, when I have enough spiritual energy,

625
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:55,970
I can leave here.

626
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,870
In the past, every time I wanted to go out,

627
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,940
I needed to spend much time accumulating spiritual energy.

628
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,380
But now...

629
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,390
maybe I don't need to.

630
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,980
You just came out with us like this.

631
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,080
Is it really okay?

632
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,560
It's okay.

633
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,340
Because of Miss Jin,

634
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,510
I have plenty of spiritual energy now.

635
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,670
It's okay as long as I don't stay out for too long.

636
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,150
It's fine.

637
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,340
You're with him.

638
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,450
If he runs out of spiritual energy,

639
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,880
just kiss him, and he'll have spiritual energy again. Right?

640
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,430
No.

641
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:45,970
I will never do that.

642
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,950
It's inappropriate to have casual body contact.

643
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,670
It was my fault for being rude yesterday.

644
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:53,010
I've been reflecting on myself.

645
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:57,030
Even if I die from the exhaustion of spiritual energy someday,

646
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,420
I will never offend you again.

647
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,680
It's not that serious.

648
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,680
Anyway, let's just hurry up

649
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,710
and go home soon.

650
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,570
It won't take long.

651
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,230
I don't think your spiritual energy will be used up.

652
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,750
Is the car okay?

653
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:23,180
It seems... to be fine for now.

654
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,110
Did you really fix the car?

655
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:26,860
Yes.

656
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:28,640
How did you fix it?

657
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:31,520
There's a garage 1 km away from the house.

658
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,530
I went to buy some parts,

659
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,630
and it took me an afternoon to fix the car.

660
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,470
How do you know these?

661
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,060
I've practiced the Mo family's mechanism skills.

662
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,830
Also, when cars were just introduced,

663
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,250
I did some research.

664
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,100
I know a trick or two.

665
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,550
The Mo family's mechanism skills?

666
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,060
It sounds like something that only exists in novels, right?

667
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,600
Will the car break down halfway?

668
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,880
Don't worry.

669
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,510
The meteor only damaged the car roof.

670
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,830
The interior and the electric motor are fine.

671
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:02,490
That's good.

672
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:06,160
Jin Xia, you're lucky.

673
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,950
Nan Hua is not only handsome

674
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,120
and responsible,

675
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,980
he is also an all-rounder.

676
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,900
I'm flattered, Miss Jiang.

677
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,090
In fact, in the past 1,000 years,

678
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,840
if it weren't for these new knowledge and new things,

679
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,950
I'm afraid

680
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,940
I would have been very bored.

681
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:44,550
The city has actually become like this.

682
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,470
It's really been so long since I came out.

683
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,000
She was scared when she saw the light flickering.

684
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,540
I've fixed the aged wires.

685
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,750
I guess the light won't flicker anymore.

686
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,230
It's almost dawn.

687
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,920
I haven't done that yet.

688
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,810
Nan Hua has got up?

689
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,230
Where did he go?

690
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:11,640
What is he doing so early in the morning?

691
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,880
I wonder if Miss Jin is awake.

692
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:42,560
Yesterday...

693
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,480
What are you doing?

694
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:47,550
I'm here to apologize to Miss Jin.

695
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,500
He was doing this just now?

696
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,160
This fool.
