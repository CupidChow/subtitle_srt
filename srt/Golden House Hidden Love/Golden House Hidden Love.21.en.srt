[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,150
In the several thousand years of human history,

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,040
there have been many unsolved mysteries.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,960
Are the stories of Dayu controlling the flood and Nvwa mending the sky myths?

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,560
Why would the advancement of human civilization

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,760
surpass its current situations?

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,800
There are all kinds of speculations.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,760
But in fact, the truth

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,760
dates back to the ancient times.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,400
Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,720
the highly developed

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,360
prehistoric civilizations once existed on Earth.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,680
Back then, the ancient people

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,080
mastered the scientific civilization far more advanced than that in modern society.

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,160
Their high-level genetic modification technology

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,280
even enabled them to develop

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,390
human potential to the greatest extent.

18
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,960
They could absorb the spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,820
to stay alive and even exert extraordinary energy.

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,720
However, a tragic doomsday disaster

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,400
made those human beings almost extinct at that time.

22
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:01,720
Countless lives

23
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,920
and brilliant civilizations were destroyed overnight.

24
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,960
Only a small number of ancient people

25
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,560
survived the doomsday

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,330
after escaping to the underground in time

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,789
and entering into a frozen hibernation state.

28
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:14,450
After that,

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,190
through tens of thousands of years of self-repair,

30
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,480
our Earth conceived new intelligent lives again,

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,740
namely, the ancestors of modern people.

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,080
And the ancient people sleeping in the underground areas

33
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,480
woke up one after another

34
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,160
and returned to the land.

35
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,870
They saw

36
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,830
the new primitive humans who were still trying to make fire by drilling wood.

37
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,920
Out of good intentions,

38
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,030
they taught the younger generations

39
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,039
many technologies, such as farming, metallurgy,

40
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,800
construction, flood control, and precautions against natural disasters.

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,729
Many great civilization miracles

42
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,120
were the masterpieces made

43
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,850
by our ancestors with the help of ancient people.

44
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,729
At that time, the new human beings

45
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:51,890
[Fuxi Temple]

46
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,960
considered the ancient people with extraordinary energy as deities.

47
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,690
They built temples for them and worshipped them.

48
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,200
As the official historians of various countries exaggerated the stories about them,

49
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,720
many legendary ancient myths have been passed down till now.

50
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,240
In this way,

51
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,440
most ancient people around the world

52
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,360
fitted into the new world with the identities

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,520
of deities.

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,840
But there were also some low-profile ancient people

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,300
who chose to live in seclusion in deep mountains to escape from the mortal world.

56
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,070
However,

57
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,320
people's worship towards the deities

58
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,400
also gradually generated fear and desires.

59
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,190
The rulers feared that the power of deities

60
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,829
would become a threat to their royal power.

61
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:29,390
But they were also greedy

62
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,120
for immortality and the extraordinary power.

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,780
Therefore,

64
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,720
they used various excuses

65
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
to start wars

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,850
against the deities from time to time.

67
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,829
The ancient people were outnumbered

68
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,320
and were no match for the huge armies in the end.

69
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,920
They almost became extinct.

70
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,600
Little did they know

71
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,960
that by imparting the knowledge of weapon forging to the new humans

72
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,160
they unwittingly unleashed a disaster upon themselves.

73
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,840
Although the ancient people who lived in deep mountains

74
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,400
survived this disaster,

75
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,920
they were hunted by the rulers continuously.

76
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,240
They were even slandered

77
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,510
and considered as horrible mountain spirits or ferocious ghosts.

78
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,880
In the blink of an eye,

79
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:08,750
those who had been regarded as deities became devils that everyone wanted to kill.

80
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,240
As everything keeps changing in the world,

81
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,920
no one knows the existence of the ancient people anymore.

82
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,270
Only those anecdotes and peculiar stories about ghosts and monsters

83
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,350
have been passed down from generation to generation.

84
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,079
And the tiny minority of ancient people who have survived

85
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,750
are still secretly hiding

86
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,640
in those covert corners in the world till now.

87
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:29,030
Once upon a time,

88
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:35,390
[Crying]

89
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,100
there was a mysterious ancient oriental kingdom.

90
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,230
One day, a concubine of the king's gave birth to a prince.

91
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,200
The prince's mother was a lowly slave

92
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,650
so she had no right to bring up her son.

93
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,240
The little prince was sent to the queen's palace to be brought up by the queen.

94
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,800
The prince grew up with and lived with

95
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,470
the queen's eldest daughter who was also the eldest princess.

96
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,040
The two had a harmonious relationship.

97
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,110
Because the queen had never borne a son,

98
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,700
the little prince, as the eldest son of the king's, was made the viscount.

99
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,760
The viscount, whose mother was a concubine,

100
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,550
was benevolent and peace-loving.

101
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,180
He even sympathized with slaves.

102
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,050
So he was criticized for being too kind and many argued that he wouldn't be competent.

103
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,750
Before the eldest princess went on an expedition,

104
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,950
she introduced a very special lady to the viscount.

105
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,320
The lady was High Immortal Nan Hua.

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,160
Nan Hua was very powerful but she was not a deity

107
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,950
but a mysterious ancient woman.

108
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,080
Under her guidance,

109
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,080
the viscount pointed out social problems and made people solve them.

110
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,540
He also adopted many new policies such as the abolition of slavery.

111
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,150
He also implemented an examination system for selecting officials.

112
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:44,890
[Examination Hall]

113
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,240
People of any family background or gender were given the right to sit the examinations.

114
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,080
Women and those not from noble families were allowed to sit the examinations.

115
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,890
[Exorcism]

116
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,280
He was strongly against superstitions and the belief in gods and ghosts.

117
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,870
Instead, he preached the benefits of learning science.

118
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,670
However, the good deeds done by the viscount were misinterpreted and misunderstood.

119
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,000
In the end, he was seen as an enemy

120
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,030
[Do not hurt anyone.]

121
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,030
[Yes.]

122
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,650
by the royal family, aristocrats and even women and slaves.

123
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,440
But the viscount didn't give up his dreams.

124
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,830
He kept working hard even though he failed many times.

125
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,560
Nan Hua worried about him a lot.

126
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,560
Later, the viscount's mother was made a victim

127
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,310
who was accused of bringing bad luck for the country

128
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,080
and was thus exiled.

129
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,710
The viscount felt hopeless and painful.

130
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,350
Comforted by Nan Hua, the viscount gradually understood

131
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,630
that some things couldn't be changed overnight.

132
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,400
It might take thousands of years of hard work

133
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,600
to be done by generations of people to realize his dreams.

134
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,880
Then he wanted to leave the palace which was full of liars.

135
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,400
So he gave up his title as the viscount.

136
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,659
He planned to live in seclusion with Nan Hua in deep forest.

137
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,390
But before they set off,

138
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,950
the viscount got involved

139
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,190
in a long-planned royal coup.

140
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,140
His life was at stake because of it.

141
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,860
When he was dying,

142
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,409
he still regretted

143
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,330
that he wouldn't be able to see the fair world that would exist about a thousand years later.

144
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,130
Nan Hua didn't want the viscount to die with regret

145
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,600
so she sacrificed her life

146
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,340
and gave her immortality of life to the viscount.

147
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,450
Then she disappeared from the world.

148
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,630
After the viscount woke up, he felt heartbroken.

149
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,790
Then there was something wrong with his memories.

150
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,310
He mistook himself for Nan Hua

151
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,180
and had a wrong impression

152
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,600
that he had promised the viscount that he would keep waiting until the viscount came back.

153
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,130
Then he stayed in the golden house and refused to leave.

154
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,870
He had waited

155
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,000
for over a thousand years.

156
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,640
He has remembered that he is Li Chuchen.

157
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,760
Finally.

158
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,640
You're awake.

159
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,040
Are you okay?

160
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,760
Yes.

161
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,000
Are you sure?

162
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,960
Don't worry.

163
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,600
I'm fine.

164
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,750
I have enough spiritual energy now.

165
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,320
That's good.

166
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,280
By the way, are you hungry?

167
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,350
Would you like to eat something?

168
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,480
Do you want me to make you some food?

169
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,720
I've been practicing cooking these days

170
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,390
according to the recipe you left on the stove.

171
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,920
Let me tell you...

172
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,780
I'm not hungry.

173
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,200
Are you thirsty?

174
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,929
Let me get you a cup of water.

175
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,360
No, thanks.

176
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,000
I want to go out for a walk.

177
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,690
Where are you going?

178
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,720
I'll just walk around.

179
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Let me go with you.

180
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Can I go alone?

181
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,870
Of course.

182
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:00,750
Take care.

183
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,820
I've never seen Nan Hua like this.

184
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,670
Looks like the memories about what happened in ancient times

185
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,930
have really shocked him and made him sad.

186
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:31,920
Jin Xia.

187
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,260
Why are you here?

188
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,580
-I am following Nan Hua.
-I am following Big Bro.

189
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,120
Are you slacking off?

190
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,030
Do the cleaning!

191
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,300
-Mom.
-And...

192
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,920
Pay attention to those corners. Get them clean.

193
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,600
Don't slack off.

194
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,810
Okay, okay.

195
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,630
Go back now.

196
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,520
I'm on holidays.

197
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,360
But I have to do the cleaning.

198
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,800
Big Bro.

199
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,800
Nan Hua.

200
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,560
Big Bro.

201
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,360
Why does he look so sad?

202
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,160
He needs me.

203
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,010
I can read his mind so I know he's feeling sad now.

204
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,870
Nonsense.

205
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,080
You're stalking him.

206
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,310
This is the pot calling the kettle black.

207
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,160
What about you?

208
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,250
You're sneaking around in strange clothes

209
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,640
and peeping at him.

210
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,630
Let me tell you.

211
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,830
According to the law,

212
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,670
a peeper will be detained for at least five days.

213
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,090
I'm following him because I am worried about him.

214
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,590
What's going on with Big Bro?

215
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,830
When I was stalking him just now,

216
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,580
I felt something was bothering him.

217
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,080
He looked so down.

218
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,600
Have you done anything

219
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,680
that made him feel hurt?

220
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,480
No.

221
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,240
Nan Hua...

222
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,230
You'd better ask him yourself.

223
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,960
See if he's willing to tell you.

224
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,560
Dear Jin Xia.

225
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,960
Please.

226
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:17,030
Tell me.

227
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,440
You're so unprofessional.

228
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,080
Why didn't you switch your phone to the silent mode?

229
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,340
I'm not a professional spy.

230
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,380
Who is this?

231
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,180
[Ms. Chuan]

232
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,320
Xiaochuan?

233
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:32,010
[Ms. Chuan]

234
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,660
Hello, Xiaochuan.

235
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,400
What’s up?

236
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,200
It's really inconvenient for me right now.

237
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,230
Jin Xia, I'm pregnant.

238
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,350
What? You're pregnant?

239
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,960
Can I go see you now?

240
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,560
Of course. Hurry up.

241
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,120
You got me.

242
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,710
How did you get pregnant?

243
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,710
Whose child is it?

244
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,640
Tell me.

245
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,230
It's mine.

246
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,150
Are you going to give birth to the child?

247
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,920
The child's father will send me abroad

248
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,800
so I can better prepare for the coming of the child.

249
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,510
Abroad?

250
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,560
Why can't you give birth to the child in China?

251
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,750
I'll be able to take care of you if you don't go abroad.

252
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,550
I need to go abroad because this child will be an illegitimate child.

253
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,520
Xiaochuan.

254
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,450
Is the child's father...

255
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:45,650
It's Li Yingjun's.

256
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,440
Li Yingjun? Who is Li Yingjun?

257
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,070
He is the Mr. Li who paid Big Bro to design the building.

258
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:54,920
Nan Hua.

259
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,350
Nan Hua.

260
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,330
Were you listening?

261
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,670
What?

262
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,010
Xiaochuan is pregnant.

263
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:05,880
The child's father

264
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,270
is the Mr. Li who paid you to design the welfare park

265
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,960
and the service building.

266
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,040
Mr. Li?

267
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,950
When did you two start to date?

268
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,010
Why didn't you tell me?

269
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,330
And how come you're pregnant with an illegitimate child?

270
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,990
He's the only son in his family

271
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,320
and the heir to Qingshi Group.

272
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,560
I'm just a KOL.

273
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,950
His family will definitely look down on me.

274
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,960
This is a huge thing.

275
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,160
Why didn't you tell me about it before?

276
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,480
I was weighing

277
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,960
whether I should be his girlfriend or not.

278
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,680
So I didn’t tell you about it and...

279
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,680
Jiang Xiaochuan, I can forgive you for not telling me.

280
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,590
But how could you say those words?

281
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,080
What?

282
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,640
You're not just a KOL.

283
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,990
You shouldn't think that he's out of your league.

284
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:47,870
Let me tell you.

285
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,760
You are the best woman in the world.

286
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,490
You're good enough for any man.

287
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,660
I remember when I was feeling inferior,

288
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,800
you encouraged me to be brave and fight for love.

289
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,930
You really did that.

290
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,240
Now it's your turn to be brave.

291
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,040
But why are you like a coward now?

292
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,870
In my eyes,

293
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,740
Jiang Xiaochuan is always confident and brave.

294
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,320
Times have changed.

295
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:16,560
People don't value the family background of their marriage partners very much.

296
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,420
Let me tell you.

297
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,280
If you still love each other,

298
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,480
don't care about those things.

299
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,880
I'll always support you.

300
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,160
If you don't love him anymore,

301
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,080
we'll discuss

302
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,760
what to do with the child.

303
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,840
I'll always be with you, okay?

304
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,550
I'm sorry, Jin Xia.

305
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,270
I'm not as brave as you think.

306
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,520
There're things I dare not face.

307
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,800
Don't apologize.

308
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,920
We can

309
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,980
face all the difficulties together.

310
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,710
Everything's going to be fine.

311
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,590
Right, Nan Hua?

312
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,200
Nan Hua.

313
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,800
Sorry, I'm a little tired.

314
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,320
I'm going back to my room.

315
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,860
You guys continue.

316
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,550
Big Bro.

317
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,200
What's going on with him?

318
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,000
Something's bothering him.

319
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,010
You don't need to mind others' business.

320
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,200
All right.

321
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,800
It's okay.

322
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,600
Chuan, this is for you.

323
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,300
It's fruit tea. It is good for pregnant women.

324
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,030
Thank you.

325
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,590
I searched for some information just now.

326
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,360
There're many things the pregnant woman should be careful with in the early stage of pregnancy.

327
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,960
You need to drink more water and exercise less.

328
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:09,050
You'll get edema legs if you stand or sit for too long.

329
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,670
Let me give you a massage

330
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,790
to your improve blood circulation.

331
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,640
Are you Jin Xia or Nan Hua?

332
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,890
You just can't stop talking and being so helpful.

333
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,400
Look who I'm serving.

334
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,740
I'll only do these things for you.

335
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,640
Why are you looking at me?

336
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,600
Have you decided whether you'll go abroad?

337
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,330
You don't want me to leave?

338
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,020
Think about it.

339
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,710
We've known each other for ten years

340
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,470
since college.

341
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,430
We see each other every week.

342
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,160
If you go abroad,

343
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,690
it'll be difficult for me to see you again.

344
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,120
Nan Hua is with you.

345
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,540
He will take care of you for me.

346
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,990
He can never replace you.

347
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,840
You are my best friend.

348
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,160
My BFF.

349
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,210
You're like my sister.

350
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,440
You know?

351
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,510
Jin Xia.

352
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,240
I'm not as good as you think.

353
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:36,680
Yes, you are.

354
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,200
Nan Hua is a very good person.

355
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,320
If he hadn't appeared in my life,

356
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,890
you would be my last and my only dearest person

357
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,400
in this world.

358
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,640
So, I'd like to

359
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,080
share my advice on how you should

360
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,390
deal with the big thing that may influence your whole life.

361
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,470
Come on, tell me.

362
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,030
Is Mr. Li nice to you?

363
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,670
He is very good

364
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,070
and very responsible.

365
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,270
Really?

366
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,520
Okay, I trust you.

367
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,980
Anyway, in the future,

368
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,190
no matter where you are,

369
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,240
and no matter what happens,

370
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,840
I, Jin Xia,

371
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,760
will always try my best

372
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,670
to support you, Jiang Xiaochuan,

373
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,870
and your child.

374
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:33,270
Keep going forward. Don't be afraid.

375
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,560
Okay?

376
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,050
Your words are so embarrassing.

377
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,800
I'm serious, Miss Jiang.

378
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,880
If you hadn't encouraged me,

379
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,850
I wouldn't have bought this house,

380
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,760
I wouldn't have met Nan Hua,

381
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,770
and he and I wouldn't have fallen in love with each other.

382
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,560
So, now,

383
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,560
I'll try my best to support you

384
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,280
as you supported me in the past.

385
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,680
You would meet him sooner or later.

386
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,160
It's your destiny.

387
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,160
My destiny?

388
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,040
Actually,

389
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,910
I'm not the one Nan Hua was waiting for.

390
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,820
Actually,

391
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,320
he was waiting for himself.

392
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,640
What do you mean?

393
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,120
He has remembered everything.

394
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,760
Things

395
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,100
are a little complicated.

396
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,350
It's a long story.

397
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,750
In the ancient times, Nan Hua's name

398
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,680
was actually Li Chuchen.

399
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:23,800
So he waited over a thousand years

400
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,540
just because of a lie he unconsciously made by himself.

401
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,600
Just because of a promise he imagined,

402
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,600
he imprisoned himself in the house.

403
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,070
What a fool.

404
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,790
Xiaochuan, you're asleep.

405
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,820
It's said that pregnant women get tired easily.

406
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,000
Have a good rest.

407
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,640
Why is he still not asleep?

408
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,690
Feeling sleepless?

409
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,750
I am thinking about something.

410
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,800
What is it?

411
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,240
After my memories about the ancient times came back,

412
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,000
I could know the connections between many things.

413
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,360
I could know why those things happened and why things are what they are now.

414
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,560
But I couldn't remember all the things about the ancient tree.

415
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,020
This ancient cherry tree?

416
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:12,840
I remember at first, there was a pair of cherry trees.

417
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,190
One could produce pink cherry blossom and the other could produce white cherry blossom.

418
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,200
But after I got the life

419
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,830
of the real Nan Hua,

420
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,910
only the one with pink blossom left.

421
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,060
Is it because

422
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,950
after the real Nan Hua died for you,

423
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,950
the white cherry tree

424
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,590
disappeared with her?

425
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,870
Maybe.

426
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,120
Why aren't you in bed?

427
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:40,680
I...

428
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,350
Since you woke up,

429
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:48,000
we haven't stay alone together today.

430
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,880
I missed you.

431
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,740
I'm sorry for paying little attention to you today.

432
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,230
It's okay.

433
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,480
You're not in a good mood.

434
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,710
Is it okay for me to still call you Nan Hua?

435
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,320
Should I call you Li Chuchen?

436
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,960
It's just a name.

437
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,950
Besides, I've been using the name Nan Hua for too long.

438
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,280
I don't think I can use a different name now.

439
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,070
Forget it.

440
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,510
I'll consider the name as a memento of the real Nan Hua.

441
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,120
Do you mind it?

442
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,000
Of course not.

443
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,660
I just don't want you to be sad.

444
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,320
I know you well.

445
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,690
Knowing that someone died for you,

446
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,980
you must feel extremely painful.

447
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,600
Besides,

448
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,920
you waited over thousands of years.

449
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,850
But it turned out to be an illusion.

450
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,880
No one could be okay with it.

452
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,040
I want to go back to Globefish Town.

453
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,430
Globefish Town?

454
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,530
Can you go with me?

455
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,550
No matter where you want to go in the future,

456
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,300
I'll go with you.

457
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,500
Isn't the lamp the new lamp I put here not long ago?

We can go now.

Don't you have to work today?

483
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,610
I'm on holiday.

484
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,600
Really?

485
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,820
Of course.

486
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,800
Then...

00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,860
Let's go together.

488
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,470
Good.

489
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,980
What's the thing you wanted to tell me?

490
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,270
I want to tell you

491
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,440
that you should have a good breakfast.

492
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:34,560
This is why

493
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,270
you pressed my doorbell early in the morning today?

494
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,790
Yes. Can't I do it?

495
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,080
You can.

496
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,550
You can. Let's go.

497
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,240
So I'm not Nan Hua,

498
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,750
but Li Chuchen.

499
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,200
This is so unbelievable.

500
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,910
So, Big Bro,

501
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:14,110
why did you think of yourself as Nan Hua?

502
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,450
I read some ancient medical books.

503
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,060
In modern people's terms,

504
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:20,840
I think I suffered dissociative amnesia.

505
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,280
Dissociative amnesia?

506
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,950
What kind of disease is that?

507
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,600
With the disease, I refused to recall particular information

508
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,530
because I couldn't accept the fact

509
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,440
that the real Nan Hua died for me.

510
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,560
The memory loss was the result of stress reaction.

511
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,100
But wasn't your memory loss

512
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,300
caused by a lack of spiritual energy?

513
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,240
The insufficiency of spiritual energy

514
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,280
only made me forgetful these years.

515
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,820
This explains why at that time, you could remember everything about the past

516
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,420
but failed to recall what happened initially.

517
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:57,910
You're basically right.

518
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,170
Xiaochuan,

519
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:09,100
aren’t you surprised at this?

520
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,330
Jin Xia told me about it yesterday.

521
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,700
I was surprised when I first heard it.

522
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,560

used to be the capital of my motherland, an ancient kingdom.

527
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:33,230
It was also the place where I first met High Immortal Nan Hua and got to know her.

528
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,290
I want to go back there and have a look.

529
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,720
I also

530
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,610
want to say goodbye to the real Nan Hua there.

I'm fine. It's because of my carsickness.

Big Bro, I remember you know how to do pulse diagnosis.

549
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,880
Can you take Xiaochuan's pulse and see how her health is?

00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:28,720
Don't bother.

554
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,560
Just a pulse examination.

555
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,720
It'll be no bother.

556
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,520
I went to my Ob-GYN the other day.

557
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,110
The doctor said I was fine.

558
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,740
Don't make a fuss.

559
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,320
After Nan Hua takes my pulse,

560
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,120
he'll be nagging.

561
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,240
It'll be annoying.

562
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:44,480
But you...

563
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,680
It's okay.

564
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,600
I'll call Yingjun.

565
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,960
I haven't told him that I'm here.

566
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,410
The charging thing cannot go wrong again.

567
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:09,450
I must be here.

568
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,110
But your health...

569
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,190
As long as the Golden House Hidden Love Project is successfully finished,

570
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,850
I won't have to be troubled by this body anymore.

571
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,680
That's all.

572
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,480
Every time I eat dishes cooked by Big Bro, I get so full.

573
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,510
Big Bro's cooking is so amazing.

574
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,470
Really?

575
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,960
Then you clean the table and do the dishes.

576
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,670
Why?

577
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,160
Because you ate the most.

578
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,920
You also ate a lot.

579
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,540
Because they were delicious.

580
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,050
Let me clean the table and do the dishes.

581
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,280
You just do your work.

582
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,670
Let me help you.

583
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,000
[Lin Jiarui]

584
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,000
[Reject] [Answer]

585
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,230
Mr. Lin?

586
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,080
Hello?

587
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,000
Jin Xia.

588
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:23,880
Who is it?

589
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,680
Yes, go ahead.

590
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,320
The previous owner of my house.

591
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,150
I

592
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,550
haven't decided yet.

593
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,040
Okay, I'll get the paperwork done as soon as possible.

594
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,320
Okay, bye.

595
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,640
What is it?

596
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,770
What haven't you decided yet?

597
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,710
I haven't had time to tell you about it.

598
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,370
When I was in Taiwan,

599
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,020
Zhou Yinting...

600
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:05,360
Nan Hua, I'm sorry.

601
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,380
I'm old.

602
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,360
I'm dying.

603
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,340
I'm not able to make up for your loss.

604
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:17,679
I...

605
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,120
I can only give you

606
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,760
all my legacies.

607
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,590
Mom, what are you talking about?

608
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,679
I can't accept them.

609
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,159
They

610
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:48,280
should have belonged to you.

611
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,159
I borrowed them

612
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,080
and kept them for you.

613
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,080
Even if I'm willing to accept them,

614
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
I

615
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,990
have no right of inheritance.

616
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,100
You don't need to worry about that.

617
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,750
You are my grandson.

618
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:17,540
You have the right of inheritance.

619
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:22,090
Mom, how can Mr. Nan be your grandson?

620
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,480
He's not my son.

621
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:30,510
Nan Hua is the son of my illegitimate child.

622
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,550
Mom, you have an illegitimate child?

623
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:38,920
I'll let Nan Hua

624
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,560
be a member of our family.

625
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,400
Nan Hua.

626
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:59,150
I'll give you back

627
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:03,010
everything that I owe you.

628
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,760
Grandma Zhou wanted you

629
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,730
to inherit her listed company?

630
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:30,230
Yes, but I haven't decided

631
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,220
whether to accept her gifts.

632
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,000
Why not?

633
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,130
Didn't she say they should have belonged to you?

634
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,380
They're not gifts.

635
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,640
She is returning your things to you.

636
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,600
Her company's business is mainly about the auction of jewelry collections.

637
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,800
Her company has collaborated

638
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,270
with many fashion companies.

639
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,320
If you own that company,

640
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,850
Jin Xia will have very useful social capital.

641
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,240
Don't take my interests into consideration.

642
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,650
Follow your heart.

643
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,680
You interests are his interests.

644
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,010
That's so much money.

645
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,470
You must accept her legacies.

646
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,280
Xiaochuan.

647
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,210
Let him make his own decision.

648
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,690
I'll think about it.

649
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,570
We're going to the place where the old ancestral hall was tomorrow.

650
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:27,100
Let's go to bed early today.

651
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,280
Okay.

652
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,670
What Xiaochuan said made sense.

653
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,630
If I hope to help Jin Xia

654
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,410
with the operation of her studio,

655
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:43,000
good contacts and social capital

656
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,130
are indispensable.

657
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:48,990
But with my current ability and knowledge,

658
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,250
I won't be able to manage Ms. Zhou's company well.

659
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,280
It'll take me a lot of time to learn to manage the company.

660
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,030
Besides, I might need to leave Wangqi Town

661
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,090
and go on business trips everywhere.

662
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,060
Will I be able to do those things?

663
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,440
What can I do to make Jin Xia happy?

664
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,990
We met for the first time.

665
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,760
The coolest ghost in the world.

666
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:43,550
The best tenant in the world.

667
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:55,640
The best family members in the world.

668
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,200
The perfect lover in the world.

669
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,330
The man who loves Jin Xia the most in the world.

670
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,520
In the past, you always helped me live a better life

671
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,830
and supported my decisions.

672
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,530
In the future, I hope I'll help you live a better life,

673
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,520
and support your decisions.

674
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,430
So, Nan Hua,

675
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,730
do whatever you want to do.

676
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,000
I mean it.

677
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:58,080
I have something to tell you.

678
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,670
What is it?

679
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,760
The day you moved into that house

680
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,580
was not the day when we met for the first time.

681
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,330
We met for the first time

682
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,960
half a year ago.

683
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,720
[The first time that Jin Xia had visited the house.]

684
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:17,810
Here, Miss Jin.

685
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,750
As you can see,

686
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,720
the area of the yard is big.

687
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,880
There're also many plants here.

688
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,000
The price of the house is really reasonable.

689
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,350
Another person who wants to buy this house.

690
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,510
Be careful.

691
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,080
Let me see how long they can stay here.

692
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:43,400
What happened?

693
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,460
The doors haven't been repaired for a long time.

694
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,520
So they aren't in a very good condition.

695
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,180
It's the wind.

696
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,280
Wind?

697
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,020
There was no wind.

698
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:03,850
Is this house a haunted house?

699
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,910
No, it's impossible.

700
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,310
Absolutely impossible.

701
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:07,080
Impossible.

702
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,920
You must be excited.

703
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:11,800
Don't you like things

704
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,950
that have something to do with supernatural things?

705
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,030
Of course.

706
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,910
If you're a ghost here,

707
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,760
please show up and be my friend.

708
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,390
I don't need friends.

709
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,600
Why can't I use my spiritual energy now?

710
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,180
Has my spiritual energy been exhausted?

711
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:49,150
She can see me?

712
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,400
This is...

713
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:07,850
It's a cherry tree.

714
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:08,990
Cherry tree?

715
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:10,690
It's withered tree.

716
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,350
The tree is too old.

717
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,040
No one takes care of it. So it's a withered tree now.

718
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,430
If you buy this house

719
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:18,130
and take good care of it, it will blossom again.

720
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:28,850
Miss Jin, let's go inside.

721
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,620
Be careful.

722
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,560
Miss Jin, please come in.

723
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,080
No one has lived in the house

724
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,850
since the period of the Republic of China.

725
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:40,720
Why not?

726
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,950
I guess the owner of house moved to Taiwan Province.

727
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:44,610
Then the house remains spare.

728
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,880
I see.

729
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,600
It looks like a new house.

730
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,400
The landlord must have simply renovated it.

731
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,880
The house can be sold more easily if it's renovated.

732
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,510
By the way,

733
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,250
do you work in the town?

734
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,580
No, I work in the city.

735
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:58,910
Then why don't you buy a house in the city?

736
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:02,160
Well, living in the city doesn't give me a sense of belonging.

737
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,280
I'd better not live my life in the city.

738
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,070
That makes sense.

739
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:05,560
Did you choose this house

740
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,200
partly because of the legend connected with the town?

741
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:08,990
Legend?

742
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,190
You haven't heard of it?

743
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,070
No.

744
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:14,800
Wangqi Town took its name

745
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,950
from the Wife-awaiting Stone

746
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,120
which is a famous scenic spot.

747
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,200
Legend has it that thousands of years ago,

748
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,080
there was an infatuated general

749
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,520
who kept waiting at the door of his house

750
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,120
for his wife to come back.

751
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,630
In the end, the general turned into a stone.

752
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:28,390
Legend has it that if his wife is reincarnated and comes back,

753
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:30,080
this stone will turn back into a man

754
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,840
and fall in love with his wife again.

755
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,990
So now tourists who come to the town

756
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,280
will touch the stone

757
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,680
and see if they are connected with the general.

758
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,940
Let's take a look here.

759
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:42,910
It's quite romantic.

760
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,240
Romantic?

761
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,030
I think it's a sad story.

762
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,870
Think about it. Thought he has a good reason to do it,

763
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:57,330
he has been waiting there thousands of years

764
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:00,920
for a person who might never come back.

765
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:05,400
He must feel very lonely.

766
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,380
Why can I use my spiritual energy now?

767
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:38,990
Haven't you decided yet?

768
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,310
Actually, I quite like it.

769
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:44,160
It's just a little far away.

770
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:45,720
Then buy a house in the city.

771
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:49,440
Then I can only afford an apartment with one bedroom.

772
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,520
A small apartment is also good.

773
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:53,480
I want to let my grandma live in my new house.

774
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,070
If the new house is too small, Grandma won't be able to live in there.

775
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:57,130
Then you can rent a bigger apartment.

776
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,140
I don't want to live in a rented apartment anymore.

777
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,760
My monthly salary is low.

778
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,420
Half of it will be used as rent.

779
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:04,720
I think it's better to pay the loan.

780
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:07,370
Then I can have a house to live in when I'm old.

781
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:12,280
What?

782
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:13,550
Since you can't decide who to do,

783
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:14,810
flip a coin and decide.

784
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,940
That's not a serious decision-making process.

785
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,800
Do you have any practical advice?

786
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,470
My advice

787
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:25,960
is that you let fate decide for you.

788
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:30,420
If the side of number is up, you buy it. If the side of flower is up, you don't buy it.

789
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:31,710
Okay.

790
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,080
So, have you decided?

791
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,880
I haven't checked which side is up.

792
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,640
People say

793
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,170
when you're tossing a coin,

794
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,560
you already know what you really want.

795
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,000
Got it?

796
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:02,870
Yes, madam.

797
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,610
You're welcome.

798
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,560
Will she buy the house?

799
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:05,720
From that moment,

800
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,680
I always hoped

801
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,590
that you would come back.

802
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,840
So you were there that day?

803
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:18,990
Yes.

804
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,800
I didn't understand it before.

805
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,080
But now I seem to have understood it.

806
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,800
I cared about you so much

807
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,730
not because you were the one I was waiting for.

808
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,230
I think

809
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,590
when we met for the first time,

810
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:56,070
I got to know what it felt like to fall in love with someone for the first time.

811
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,080
Nan Hua.

812
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:05,040
Jin Xia.

813
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:11,910
I love you.

814
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,080
I love you too.
