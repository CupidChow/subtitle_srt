1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,900
Why are you doing this difficult thing?

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,700
I only put effort into the things that I like.

3
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:04,640
When I look back,

4
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,640
I’ll remember the feelings and people who helped me build it.

5
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,830
What are you doing here during the school break?

6
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:09,920
I came to get something.

7
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:16,240
Do you know that Lune and I promised to get married when we were adults?

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,720
If you’re going to keep your relationship a secret, then don’t make it obvious.

9
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,780
Please take good care of Star.

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,390
Go to bed.

11
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,250
I’ll go.

12
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,780
If you give me a goodnight kiss.

13
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,380
(You can use only a pencil and an eraser in this exam.)

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,500
(Good luck with the exam.)

15
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,070
(If you are ready, you can begin now.)

16
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,250
So this is yours.

17
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,010
Thank you for letting me borrow it.

18
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,100
Is your name Lune?

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,490
Yes.

20
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,590
I’m Sera.

21
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,170
It’s funny if we say our name together.

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,340
Sera-Lune sounds similar to Sailor Moon.

23
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,550
He’s so handsome.

24
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,210
He’s so hot.

25
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,180
Lune.

26
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,490
What’s wrong?

27
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,300
Why are they staring at me? Isn’t it strange?

28
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,210
It’s because now you are a hot guy.

29
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:40,699
You will get used to it.

30
00:03:42,482 --> 00:03:43,992
Hello, everyone.

31
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:44,722
Hey.

32
00:03:47,622 --> 00:03:51,122
Star, you look prettier after the school break.

33
00:03:52,322 --> 00:03:54,132
Unlike you, Ivy.

34
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:55,082
Why? What’s wrong with me?

35
00:03:56,562 --> 00:03:57,402
You are as pretty as always.

36
00:04:05,222 --> 00:04:07,712
What do you think about my new joke?

37
00:04:07,732 --> 00:04:08,592
You’re shocked, aren’t you?

38
00:04:10,762 --> 00:04:11,382
You, rascal.

39
00:04:11,402 --> 00:04:12,822
Good safe.

40
00:04:13,552 --> 00:04:14,212
Lune.

41
00:04:14,902 --> 00:04:17,152
I save the seat next to me for you.

42
00:04:20,262 --> 00:04:22,122
Stop it, both of you.

43
00:04:22,152 --> 00:04:23,852
You are fighting from the beginning of the new semester.

44
00:04:24,582 --> 00:04:25,402
Lune.

45
00:04:30,112 --> 00:04:31,462
Do you know me?

46
00:04:31,682 --> 00:04:32,852
Of course.

47
00:04:33,312 --> 00:04:35,312
Can I take a picture with you?

48
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:46,942
Yes.

49
00:04:48,092 --> 00:04:49,542
Let’s do this pose.

50
00:04:57,202 --> 00:04:58,262
That’s enough.

51
00:04:58,292 --> 00:04:59,632
Wait a sec.

52
00:05:00,112 --> 00:05:03,062
Can you put your hand on my head?

53
00:05:10,942 --> 00:05:13,112
Can I borrow him?

54
00:05:15,112 --> 00:05:17,112
Lune, I’m rooting for you this semester.

55
00:05:21,762 --> 00:05:23,432
She’s rooting for him.

56
00:05:26,562 --> 00:05:28,142
Now, Lune has a fan.

57
00:05:28,822 --> 00:05:30,342
We are yesterday’s news.

58
00:05:30,612 --> 00:05:31,432
Excuse me.

59
00:05:32,152 --> 00:05:34,692
Do you want to take a photo with us?

60
00:05:34,712 --> 00:05:36,322
No, it’s okay.

61
00:05:58,162 --> 00:05:58,977
(1. I miss you.) (2. Love, love, love.)

62
00:05:59,001 --> 00:05:59,782
(3. I’m bored.) (4. I feel so sleepy.)

63
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:04,572
(Look at the back.)

64
00:06:06,582 --> 00:06:08,352
(5. Kiss, kiss.)

65
00:06:17,342 --> 00:06:17,942
Lune.

66
00:06:18,702 --> 00:06:19,602
What the heck are you doing?

67
00:06:20,122 --> 00:06:21,892
I told you to get your wisdom tooth removed.

68
00:06:38,802 --> 00:06:41,682
(Hold your arms straight in front of you)

69
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:44,212
(Clasp your hands together.)

70
00:06:44,482 --> 00:06:46,962
(Clasp them tightly.)

71
00:06:48,412 --> 00:06:49,222
(That’s right.)

72
00:06:49,892 --> 00:06:51,042
(Hold them tightly.)

73
00:06:51,582 --> 00:06:52,372
(Good.)

74
00:06:53,282 --> 00:06:55,042
May I go to the bathroom?

75
00:06:56,192 --> 00:06:58,442
May I go to the bathroom?

76
00:07:11,282 --> 00:07:12,622
Here.

77
00:07:13,912 --> 00:07:15,362
Stop it.

78
00:07:15,392 --> 00:07:16,242
Do you want me to stop?

79
00:07:16,572 --> 00:07:18,712
I have to go to the bathroom.

80
00:07:18,732 --> 00:07:20,712
Okay. I’ll wait here.

81
00:07:33,862 --> 00:07:34,712
Lune.

82
00:07:37,262 --> 00:07:40,232
Where have you been?

83
00:07:46,342 --> 00:07:49,272
I’ve been in the classroom. Why?

84
00:07:49,292 --> 00:07:54,422
No, I mean you are so good-looking.

85
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:56,032
How could I have never noticed you before?

86
00:07:56,952 --> 00:08:01,362
We are living in the same neighborhood but I never saw you.

87
00:08:01,382 --> 00:08:02,022
Huh?

88
00:08:02,242 --> 00:08:03,722
I’ve secretly admired you.

89
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:05,362
Will you go out with me?

90
00:08:10,672 --> 00:08:11,412
No.

91
00:08:12,322 --> 00:08:14,482
You can’t ask him out. He has a girlfriend.

92
00:08:15,122 --> 00:08:16,612
His girlfriend is also here.

93
00:08:19,282 --> 00:08:20,292
Star.

94
00:08:24,202 --> 00:08:26,902
I thought you two were just friends.

95
00:08:31,602 --> 00:08:33,262
Star and I are dating.

96
00:08:36,872 --> 00:08:40,272
But you can’t tell anyone about it.

97
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:41,382
Can you keep it a secret?

98
00:08:43,682 --> 00:08:44,662
Please.

99
00:08:48,132 --> 00:08:49,002
I…

100
00:09:14,682 --> 00:09:16,682
How long have you known about it?

101
00:09:20,682 --> 00:09:24,562
Since we went to the water park.

102
00:09:25,362 --> 00:09:28,262
Why didn’t you tell me?

103
00:09:28,962 --> 00:09:32,632
I think you must have your reason to keep it a secret.

104
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:36,612
That’s right.

105
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:42,432
I’m worried that you…

106
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:46,432
I’m not going to do anything to Lune.

107
00:09:46,782 --> 00:09:47,932
It’s not about that.

108
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:48,912
I…

109
00:09:52,102 --> 00:09:53,062
I…

110
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:57,942
I don’t want to hurt your feelings.

111
00:10:10,602 --> 00:10:11,662
You knew?

112
00:10:16,342 --> 00:10:17,682
How long have you known about it?

113
00:10:21,252 --> 00:10:27,602
Since you wrote the farewell message at the junior high gradation.

114
00:10:39,452 --> 00:10:40,592
I’m sorry.

115
00:10:43,722 --> 00:10:46,182
You don’t need to apologize to me.

116
00:10:47,582 --> 00:10:51,492
I’m happy that someone will take care of you for me.

117
00:10:54,572 --> 00:10:55,722
Thank you, Ivy.

118
00:11:03,252 --> 00:11:04,302
It’s best for us…

119
00:11:05,842 --> 00:11:07,512
to be friends.

120
00:11:10,672 --> 00:11:11,742
No matter what happens,

121
00:11:14,032 --> 00:11:15,482
I will always love you.

122
00:11:19,732 --> 00:11:20,392
Come here.

123
00:11:55,272 --> 00:11:57,452
This is too touching.

124
00:12:01,452 --> 00:12:03,092
I got to go.

125
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:04,882
I have to leave early today.

126
00:12:05,252 --> 00:12:06,062
Fine.

127
00:12:13,902 --> 00:12:15,262
Why he’s in such a hurry?

128
00:12:15,422 --> 00:12:16,562
Jewel.

129
00:12:16,882 --> 00:12:18,452
The class ends early today.

130
00:12:18,482 --> 00:12:19,602
Did you bring your outfit?

131
00:12:20,412 --> 00:12:22,502
Our football match is moved to every Friday.

132
00:12:22,752 --> 00:12:23,502
I forgot.

133
00:12:23,922 --> 00:12:25,002
I already have a plan.

134
00:12:26,132 --> 00:12:26,652
I got to go.

135
00:12:26,672 --> 00:12:27,192
Wait.

136
00:12:27,222 --> 00:12:28,012
Jewel.

137
00:12:28,692 --> 00:12:30,692
Why is he in such a hurry?

138
00:12:32,322 --> 00:12:33,982
Ivy, I got to go.

139
00:12:34,012 --> 00:12:35,252
Sure.

140
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:38,862
I have an errand to do.

141
00:12:39,252 --> 00:12:39,872
See you.

142
00:12:53,062 --> 00:12:55,892
Now, there are only us left.

143
00:13:19,682 --> 00:13:20,612
I want to order a drink.

144
00:13:21,112 --> 00:13:22,072
What would you like to order?

145
00:13:29,962 --> 00:13:32,452
Where is the other staff?

146
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,022
The other staff?

147
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:35,762
Which one?

148
00:13:35,802 --> 00:13:36,472
What’s his name?

149
00:13:36,492 --> 00:13:37,652
His name…

150
00:13:42,532 --> 00:13:43,532
I’m kidding.

151
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:45,562
There are only two staff in the café.

152
00:13:45,802 --> 00:13:46,992
He takes a leave for one week.

153
00:13:47,012 --> 00:13:48,172
I don’t know what he’s doing.

154
00:13:49,152 --> 00:13:50,172
One week?

155
00:13:50,602 --> 00:13:51,792
Now, I’m in trouble.

156
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,332
I was planning to watch a movie with my girlfriend.

157
00:13:53,862 --> 00:13:54,782
What a bummer.

158
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:57,882
What would you like to order?

159
00:14:04,972 --> 00:14:06,402
I’m waiting in the same room as the last time.

160
00:14:06,432 --> 00:14:08,982
Come to see me when you finish your practice.

161
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:14,692
What do you want me to help you?

162
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:16,882
I got a new unfinished artwork.

163
00:14:17,112 --> 00:14:18,452
I want to complete it.

164
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,452
I want to do it well this time.

165
00:14:21,492 --> 00:14:23,952
Alright. I’ll help you. Give me a second.

166
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:24,542
Come.

167
00:14:45,322 --> 00:14:47,322
I’ll take the before photo.

168
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:48,002
Sure.

169
00:14:52,562 --> 00:14:55,482
One, two, three.

170
00:14:57,932 --> 00:14:58,542
How is it?

171
00:14:58,942 --> 00:14:59,812
Nothing special.

172
00:15:17,952 --> 00:15:19,262
I told you to wear an apron.

173
00:15:19,842 --> 00:15:22,642
Otherwise, your clothes might get stained.

174
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,772
I don’t paint often.

175
00:15:39,442 --> 00:15:40,132
Done.

176
00:15:51,812 --> 00:15:54,612
Draw clouds right here.

177
00:16:17,182 --> 00:16:19,682
What are you doing? It’s dirty.

178
00:16:19,702 --> 00:16:20,612
White.

179
00:16:20,972 --> 00:16:22,272
I knew you would be here.

180
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:24,832
I came to give you the worksheets from Miss Ploy’s class.

181
00:16:24,862 --> 00:16:26,832
It got mixed up with my stuff.

182
00:16:28,732 --> 00:16:31,232
Nana, you can put it right there.

183
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:41,972
What are you two doing?

184
00:16:41,992 --> 00:16:42,842
It looks fun.

185
00:16:43,612 --> 00:16:44,252
I…

186
00:16:45,322 --> 00:16:47,762
I’m just working on an unfinished artwork.

187
00:16:48,402 --> 00:16:49,842
Can you teach me how to do it?

188
00:16:53,202 --> 00:16:58,212
I already have a plan with my friend today.

189
00:16:58,712 --> 00:16:59,972
With Jewel?

190
00:17:00,902 --> 00:17:03,092
But I saw he left.

191
00:17:06,332 --> 00:17:08,412
I’m going to have dinner…

192
00:17:09,122 --> 00:17:10,102
with Ivy.

193
00:17:11,392 --> 00:17:12,852
I’m going to have dinner with her family.

194
00:17:14,342 --> 00:17:15,082
Really?

195
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:18,032
Is your friend coming to have dinner with us?

196
00:17:18,052 --> 00:17:19,622
I’ll call and tell Mom.

197
00:17:19,822 --> 00:17:20,612
Ice.

198
00:17:20,942 --> 00:17:21,972
Hello, Mom.

199
00:17:22,452 --> 00:17:24,452
Ivy invited a friend to have dinner with us today.

200
00:17:33,312 --> 00:17:35,402
Lune, where are you taking me?

201
00:17:44,642 --> 00:17:45,442
This is my secret spot.

202
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:48,462
I often came here when I was young.

203
00:17:49,002 --> 00:17:51,002
I felt better every time I came here.

204
00:17:58,682 --> 00:18:00,452
How was your talk with Ivy?

205
00:18:00,842 --> 00:18:01,702
It was great.

206
00:18:02,602 --> 00:18:04,362
Ivy is very understanding.

207
00:18:05,302 --> 00:18:08,442
But I’m still worried about her.

208
00:18:19,172 --> 00:18:21,462
I had a talk with her earlier.

209
00:18:24,662 --> 00:18:26,902
I promised her that I would take good care of you.

210
00:18:37,772 --> 00:18:38,802
Sit tight.

211
00:18:40,432 --> 00:18:42,482
Ready? One, two, three.

212
00:18:48,102 --> 00:18:49,132
It’s going too high.

213
00:18:49,512 --> 00:18:50,932
It’s going too high.

214
00:19:01,762 --> 00:19:03,762
If you want to come here, you can always tell me.

215
00:19:03,782 --> 00:19:04,932
You can come here any time.

216
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,622
Don’t show this kind of smile to anyone.

217
00:19:13,442 --> 00:19:14,382
What kind of smile?

218
00:19:14,682 --> 00:19:15,472
Like this?

219
00:19:16,452 --> 00:19:17,282
Like this?

220
00:19:17,312 --> 00:19:18,022
Like this?

221
00:19:19,932 --> 00:19:21,502
All of them.

222
00:19:25,262 --> 00:19:26,642
What should I do?

223
00:19:28,642 --> 00:19:30,372
I started to get jealous of you.

224
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:33,312
Jealous?

225
00:19:34,982 --> 00:19:37,092
A girl confessed to you today.

226
00:19:40,532 --> 00:19:41,832
And…

227
00:19:44,262 --> 00:19:45,962
You are getting more handsome.

228
00:19:50,662 --> 00:19:51,412
Don’t worry.

229
00:19:51,782 --> 00:19:54,672
You are the only one who sees this side of me.

230
00:20:01,512 --> 00:20:06,881
Hold my hand, let your heart tell you what’s right

231
00:20:06,882 --> 00:20:08,012
You are now mine.

232
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,482
I’m a jealous girlfriend.

233
00:20:11,392 --> 00:20:13,012
Don’t act cute with anyone.

234
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:15,012
Do you get it?

235
00:20:17,432 --> 00:20:17,972
Yes.

236
00:20:31,432 --> 00:20:32,582
Hello, Sera.

237
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:35,282
Star, I’m at the café.

238
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:37,602
I’m waiting for you in front of the café.

239
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:39,322
Huh?

240
00:20:39,702 --> 00:20:42,292
Star, you didn’t forget our meeting, right?

241
00:20:45,772 --> 00:20:48,632
Sera, I totally forgot it.

242
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:50,822
Can you wait for me? I’m going to see you now.

243
00:20:50,852 --> 00:20:51,922
It’s okay.

244
00:20:51,952 --> 00:20:53,722
Where are the other friends?

245
00:20:57,492 --> 00:21:02,102
I forgot to ask them. I’ll call them right now.

246
00:21:02,422 --> 00:21:04,462
Sera, please don’t be mad.

247
00:21:05,262 --> 00:21:06,502
Okay.

248
00:21:09,252 --> 00:21:11,062
I forgot about the meeting with Sera.

249
00:21:16,182 --> 00:21:18,342
Huh? My coworker’s address?

250
00:21:20,752 --> 00:21:21,822
Are you crazy?

251
00:21:22,292 --> 00:21:23,932
Are you a loan shark to collect debt from him?

252
00:21:25,402 --> 00:21:26,562
No.

253
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:29,522
How much do you want to tell me his address?

254
00:21:30,452 --> 00:21:31,282
You must be rich.

255
00:21:31,972 --> 00:21:33,302
But I don’t want money.

256
00:21:33,862 --> 00:21:36,182
Then what do you want? Tell me.

257
00:21:37,072 --> 00:21:38,102
You are the one who offers it.

258
00:21:40,372 --> 00:21:40,962
Hey.

259
00:21:41,752 --> 00:21:44,002
I wrote down all the drink recipes.

260
00:21:44,042 --> 00:21:45,892
Don’t break any glass.

261
00:21:45,922 --> 00:21:47,282
Otherwise, it will be deducted from my wage.

262
00:21:47,492 --> 00:21:48,802
I’m going to watch a movie with my girlfriend.

263
00:21:48,822 --> 00:21:49,652
I trust you with the café.

264
00:21:59,412 --> 00:22:00,232
What’s up, Lune?

265
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,862
Can I have a Plurijuice?

266
00:22:04,392 --> 00:22:05,462
I’ll call you back.

267
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:08,922
Jewel sounds busy.

268
00:22:09,212 --> 00:22:10,742
White’s phone is turned off.

269
00:22:11,552 --> 00:22:13,822
Ivy isn’t answering my call.

270
00:22:16,232 --> 00:22:17,412
Hello, Ivy.

271
00:22:17,762 --> 00:22:18,562
Where are you?

272
00:22:18,592 --> 00:22:19,492
Are you busy?

273
00:22:20,062 --> 00:22:22,882
I forgot about my meeting with Sera.

274
00:22:22,922 --> 00:22:24,332
She wants to meet everyone.

275
00:22:24,352 --> 00:22:25,802
I’m already home.

276
00:22:25,822 --> 00:22:27,372
I’m about to have dinner with my family.

277
00:22:27,412 --> 00:22:28,982
I don’t think I can go see you.

278
00:22:29,562 --> 00:22:31,762
White, dinner is ready.

279
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:33,762
(What do you have for dinner?)

280
00:22:34,392 --> 00:22:35,672
Is White at your house?

281
00:22:36,052 --> 00:22:39,812
Yes, there was an incident. So I have to take him home with me.

282
00:22:39,852 --> 00:22:43,792
His phone is dead. In case, you are going to call him.

283
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:47,422
That’s why Lune can’t contact him.

284
00:22:47,902 --> 00:22:50,672
Okay. It’s alright. I’ll call you later.

285
00:22:51,022 --> 00:22:52,672
I’m sorry, Star.

286
00:22:52,902 --> 00:22:53,982
Okay. Bye.

287
00:22:54,182 --> 00:22:55,062
Bye.

288
00:22:56,842 --> 00:23:00,062
Mom, why did you cook so many dishes?

289
00:23:00,082 --> 00:23:02,482
When Mom heard that your boyfriend was coming to have dinner with us,

290
00:23:02,512 --> 00:23:04,012
She prepared all these dishes.

291
00:23:04,052 --> 00:23:05,682
I told you that he’s not my boyfriend.

292
00:23:06,642 --> 00:23:08,022
Then you should get a boyfriend.

293
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:09,862
You only take Star to our house.

294
00:23:09,882 --> 00:23:11,002
I have no one to play with.

295
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:12,502
Shut up.

296
00:23:12,522 --> 00:23:14,202
That’s enough, both of you.

297
00:23:14,222 --> 00:23:15,412
Let’s eat.

298
00:23:15,822 --> 00:23:17,412
White, please help yourself, sweetie.

299
00:23:17,892 --> 00:23:18,772
Yes.

300
00:23:18,812 --> 00:23:20,162
Sweetie?

301
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:22,212
Why can’t I call him that?

302
00:23:22,492 --> 00:23:27,042
I can tell from his face that he’s a good and easy-going boy.

303
00:23:27,062 --> 00:23:29,552
Unlike you, you are picky with your food.

304
00:23:29,592 --> 00:23:31,412
You don’t like taking a shower.

305
00:23:31,572 --> 00:23:37,222
If you are going into her room, I think you need to tiptoe like a ballet dance.

306
00:23:37,922 --> 00:23:38,892
Why?

307
00:23:39,062 --> 00:23:40,372
Like this.

308
00:23:41,322 --> 00:23:42,832
When you go into her room,

309
00:23:42,862 --> 00:23:47,472
you need to make sure not to step onto her dirty clothes and worn-out underwear.

310
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,532
Shut up, you little rascal.

311
00:23:50,982 --> 00:23:51,772
Is that true?

312
00:23:52,152 --> 00:23:55,262
But when she’s at school, she takes care of her friends.

313
00:23:58,982 --> 00:24:00,342
Are you talking about Ivy?

314
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,612
Yes, she takes care,

315
00:24:05,212 --> 00:24:06,032
protect,

316
00:24:07,442 --> 00:24:08,552
and get some sense into us

317
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:12,662
by…

318
00:24:14,372 --> 00:24:14,852
kicking,

319
00:24:16,572 --> 00:24:17,212
punching,

320
00:24:18,652 --> 00:24:20,142
using harsh words,

321
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:23,432
and using her strength to abuse us.

322
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,892
Stop it.

323
00:24:24,902 --> 00:24:26,132
I thought you would say a nice thing about me.

324
00:24:26,162 --> 00:24:27,042
Are you exposing me?

325
00:24:27,072 --> 00:24:28,732
See, Mom? She’s doing it right now.

326
00:24:28,762 --> 00:24:30,342
- Stop it.
- Don’t let her do it.

327
00:24:30,372 --> 00:24:31,652
Just eat your dinner and go home.

328
00:24:31,682 --> 00:24:33,462
Do you want to eat an egg? It’ll shut your mouth.

329
00:24:37,832 --> 00:24:40,462
I won’t forget to ask our friends next time.

330
00:24:40,892 --> 00:24:42,292
I’m sorry, Sera.

331
00:24:42,312 --> 00:24:45,062
It’s okay. Just the three of us are also fun.

332
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,402
Your bracelet is cute.

333
00:24:49,682 --> 00:24:51,252
Yours is also cute.

334
00:24:51,442 --> 00:24:52,212
Really?

335
00:25:02,962 --> 00:25:04,812
Here, a ‘L’ bead.

336
00:25:05,782 --> 00:25:07,452
How did you know that I was looking for it?

337
00:25:07,972 --> 00:25:09,442
I can tell just by looking at you.

338
00:25:09,652 --> 00:25:11,752
I know you’ll make a bracelet with your name.

339
00:25:32,692 --> 00:25:35,192
Here, an ‘E’ bead, the last letter of your name.

340
00:25:40,822 --> 00:25:41,522
Thanks.

341
00:25:47,912 --> 00:25:53,432
Star, do you know Lune always wrote his name on his belongings when he was young?

342
00:25:53,742 --> 00:25:56,972
One day, I forgot to bring my eraser to school.

343
00:25:57,272 --> 00:26:00,502
He cut his eraser and shared it with me.

344
00:26:00,632 --> 00:26:02,452
So his name on the eraser was cut in half.

345
00:26:06,612 --> 00:26:07,362
Really?

346
00:26:09,202 --> 00:26:10,212
Is it true, Lune?

347
00:26:18,212 --> 00:26:19,862
Do you see a ‘S’ bead?

348
00:26:21,862 --> 00:26:23,202
I’m also looking for it.

349
00:26:31,202 --> 00:26:32,052
I found it.

350
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:01,482
Excuse me.

351
00:27:02,312 --> 00:27:04,312
Do you have another ‘S’ bead?

352
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:05,872
That’s all we have.

353
00:27:06,742 --> 00:27:07,892
That’s too bad.

354
00:27:09,542 --> 00:27:10,912
Only the letter is missing.

355
00:27:10,952 --> 00:27:11,862
That’s right.

356
00:27:12,352 --> 00:27:14,352
We both have the letter ‘S’ in our names.

357
00:27:21,612 --> 00:27:25,352
Lune, why don’t you decide who you want to give it to?

358
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:37,392
I’ll give it to Star.

359
00:27:44,032 --> 00:27:44,812
But…

360
00:27:47,452 --> 00:27:50,192
Sera usually doesn’t stay in Thailand.

361
00:28:08,582 --> 00:28:09,262
I drop it.

362
00:28:18,342 --> 00:28:20,722
What flowers do you want? I’ll go get them for you.

363
00:28:26,562 --> 00:28:27,732
- Sunflower. - Sunflower.

364
00:28:32,832 --> 00:28:34,402
We only have one sunflower left.

365
00:28:42,992 --> 00:28:44,002
What’s wrong with my life today?

366
00:28:46,002 --> 00:28:47,302
Welcome.

367
00:28:48,002 --> 00:28:49,302
Jewel.

368
00:28:50,672 --> 00:28:51,972
What are you doing here?

369
00:28:54,282 --> 00:28:55,572
Why are you wearing that?

370
00:28:58,342 --> 00:29:00,342
I…

371
00:29:01,772 --> 00:29:05,392
Jewel, why are you…

372
00:29:05,752 --> 00:29:09,462
I want to learn about part-time jobs.

373
00:29:10,032 --> 00:29:11,862
So I can use the knowledge for my family business.

374
00:29:13,742 --> 00:29:14,822
You are working hard.

375
00:29:16,002 --> 00:29:18,002
Star and Sera, what do you want to order?

376
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:19,682
You should take a seat. I’ll order them for you.

377
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:26,912
I want…

378
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,142
- Butterbeir. - Butterbeir.

379
00:29:30,042 --> 00:29:32,042
We want the same thing again, Star.

380
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:33,702
Let’s go take a seat.

381
00:29:38,962 --> 00:29:40,002
Can you do it?

382
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:41,522
Huh?

383
00:29:42,092 --> 00:29:44,122
Can you make two glasses of the drink?

384
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,752
Say something. You’re scaring me.

385
00:29:59,412 --> 00:30:00,862
Yes, I can make two glasses.

386
00:30:03,332 --> 00:30:04,592
Thank you, buddy.

387
00:30:05,252 --> 00:30:06,562
You are my savior.

388
00:30:31,402 --> 00:30:32,162
What’s wrong?

389
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,692
Heycinedra.

390
00:30:51,602 --> 00:30:52,742
Stop laughing at me.

391
00:30:52,772 --> 00:30:54,072
What are you doing here?

392
00:30:54,612 --> 00:30:58,802
I was lonely. So I asked them to come hang out with me.

393
00:30:59,322 --> 00:31:01,322
It’s too bad that the others can’t join us.

394
00:31:04,402 --> 00:31:07,602
Do you want to come to a birthday party at my house this Sunday?

395
00:31:07,762 --> 00:31:09,122
Your birthday party?

396
00:31:09,732 --> 00:31:10,532
Sure.

397
00:31:11,012 --> 00:31:11,632
Yes.

398
00:31:12,352 --> 00:31:15,212
This will be the party for the aces.

399
00:31:15,702 --> 00:31:18,852
Mr. Wizard, can I order a dessert?

400
00:31:24,012 --> 00:31:25,512
You should go, Mr. Top Wizard.

401
00:31:39,332 --> 00:31:40,932
What’s going on with Nana?

402
00:31:42,262 --> 00:31:43,622
I think she likes you.

403
00:31:46,252 --> 00:31:46,932
I don’t think so.

404
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:50,902
Trust me. I can tell what other girls think.

405
00:31:51,282 --> 00:31:51,862
Really?

406
00:31:52,422 --> 00:31:53,652
Yes.

407
00:31:55,002 --> 00:31:57,002
Why don’t you give her a chance and get to know her?

408
00:31:59,732 --> 00:32:00,482
No.

409
00:32:01,892 --> 00:32:04,902
If you want me to give her a chance, I’d rather give us a try.

410
00:32:08,902 --> 00:32:10,102
What the heck are you talking about?

411
00:32:10,122 --> 00:32:11,762
Think about it.

412
00:32:12,242 --> 00:32:15,892
If I went out with Nana, we would never hit it off.

413
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,512
If it was you, I think I could talk all day.

414
00:32:21,822 --> 00:32:22,942
Both of us would be talking but not listening.

415
00:32:25,062 --> 00:32:28,632
I can’t picture myself being your girlfriend.

416
00:32:28,992 --> 00:32:29,812
That’s true.

417
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:31,332
You can’t stand me.

418
00:32:31,502 --> 00:32:34,582
No. You can’t stand me.

419
00:32:38,732 --> 00:32:42,512
In the meantime, can you help keep her away from me?

420
00:32:42,582 --> 00:32:44,012
I can’t deal with her.

421
00:32:44,052 --> 00:32:46,482
Okay.

422
00:32:48,072 --> 00:32:49,222
You should go home.

423
00:32:49,492 --> 00:32:50,312
Go, go.

424
00:32:52,932 --> 00:32:55,682
This helper is so mean.

425
00:32:55,722 --> 00:32:58,582
She’s not only mean but also capable of kicking your butt.

426
00:33:00,392 --> 00:33:02,652
Get out. Go home.

427
00:33:02,682 --> 00:33:03,252
See you.

428
00:33:03,922 --> 00:33:04,522
See you.

429
00:33:06,702 --> 00:33:07,812
Don’t forget to close the door.

430
00:33:30,002 --> 00:33:32,012
How did you know that Sera likes cherries?

431
00:33:32,252 --> 00:33:33,452
I subtly asked her.

432
00:33:33,892 --> 00:33:36,692
But I thought she probably had a similar taste to me.

433
00:33:38,312 --> 00:33:40,312
Black Forest cake is the best.

434
00:33:42,002 --> 00:33:43,202
Are you talking to her often?

435
00:33:46,032 --> 00:33:46,972
Yes.

436
00:33:48,622 --> 00:33:50,882
I feel like I meet the same type of people.

437
00:33:51,512 --> 00:33:53,162
I’m talking to her every day.

438
00:33:56,162 --> 00:33:59,792
I think Sera will be happy that you make a cake for her.

439
00:34:00,282 --> 00:34:01,062
Right?

440
00:34:04,762 --> 00:34:06,532
Lune, do you see baking powder?

441
00:34:07,562 --> 00:34:09,092
Baking powder?

442
00:34:11,762 --> 00:34:13,502
I might have forgotten it in my bag.

443
00:34:15,192 --> 00:34:16,562
I’ll go check it.

444
00:34:16,942 --> 00:34:17,862
I’ll be right back.

445
00:34:27,692 --> 00:34:29,222
Where’s Star?

446
00:34:29,642 --> 00:34:31,002
She went out to get something?

447
00:34:31,242 --> 00:34:32,282
Are you going out to play golf?

448
00:34:32,642 --> 00:34:33,152
Yes.

449
00:34:36,522 --> 00:34:37,072
Hey.

450
00:34:39,212 --> 00:34:41,542
What stage is your relationship in?

451
00:34:42,342 --> 00:34:43,682
What do you mean by ‘what stage’?

452
00:34:43,902 --> 00:34:45,682
Did you…

453
00:34:48,752 --> 00:34:51,462
Why are asking me that?

454
00:34:52,052 --> 00:34:53,412
It’s a natural thing.

455
00:34:53,442 --> 00:34:55,572
I was a teenager. I get it.

456
00:34:58,822 --> 00:34:59,902
You need to use protection.

457
00:35:02,442 --> 00:35:04,632
Star and I are not thinking about doing it.

458
00:35:05,492 --> 00:35:07,042
I’m not encouraging you to do it.

459
00:35:07,552 --> 00:35:10,342
But you never know when that day will arrive.

460
00:35:10,682 --> 00:35:15,012
I just to teach you how to use it properly. So you won’t mess up.

461
00:35:16,662 --> 00:35:18,452
Uncle, are you going out?

462
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:21,302
Yes.

463
00:35:22,192 --> 00:35:23,892
Make yourself at home, Star.

464
00:35:24,202 --> 00:35:24,722
Yes.

465
00:35:30,022 --> 00:35:30,722
Goodbye.

466
00:35:30,752 --> 00:35:31,832
Goodbye.

467
00:35:35,602 --> 00:35:36,482
What’s wrong?

468
00:35:37,562 --> 00:35:38,382
Nothing.

469
00:35:38,412 --> 00:35:39,382
Did you find baking powder?

470
00:35:56,142 --> 00:35:57,522
Leave it in the oven for 40 minutes.

471
00:35:57,542 --> 00:35:59,522
Let’s prepare the ingredients for the cake decorations.

472
00:36:00,602 --> 00:36:02,382
Do you often bake a cake?

473
00:36:03,532 --> 00:36:07,152
Yes, my mom used to bake a cake for my birthday every year.

474
00:36:07,182 --> 00:36:08,822
She let me decorate the cakes.

475
00:36:10,492 --> 00:36:13,062
My mom is busy these days.

476
00:36:13,302 --> 00:36:15,412
So I bake sweets with Ivy.

477
00:36:22,292 --> 00:36:26,802
I forgot when was the last time that I baked a cake with my mom.

478
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:41,862
From now on, I’ll bake a birthday cake with you every year.

479
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:54,102
Smile, smile, smile.

480
00:36:55,732 --> 00:36:57,732
Lune, your hands are dirty.

481
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:02,102
Are you pranking me?

482
00:37:02,852 --> 00:37:05,172
No. I’ll wipe it off.

483
00:37:06,132 --> 00:37:08,132
This is a dishcloth.

484
00:37:10,852 --> 00:37:11,522
I forgot.

485
00:37:13,782 --> 00:37:17,622
- You almost wiped my face with it. - I’m sorry.

486
00:37:23,412 --> 00:37:25,142
What are you doing?

487
00:37:26,692 --> 00:37:27,472
I’m wiping it off.

488
00:37:33,582 --> 00:37:35,472
Fine. Is this how you’re doing it?

489
00:37:39,332 --> 00:37:40,022
How?

490
00:37:41,262 --> 00:37:41,842
What?

491
00:37:42,432 --> 00:37:43,702
Are you teasing me?

492
00:37:50,292 --> 00:37:51,472
There’s cream on your cheek.

493
00:38:07,602 --> 00:38:08,662
There’s cream on your lips.

494
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:27,762
Lune, you are scaring me.

495
00:38:33,032 --> 00:38:35,232
It looks like you’re going to eat me.

496
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,872
I’ll check out the cherry sauce recipe.

497
00:38:52,292 --> 00:38:53,602
Lune, what is this?

498
00:38:57,612 --> 00:38:58,652
I…

499
00:38:58,932 --> 00:39:00,392
Did you…

500
00:39:00,412 --> 00:39:01,412
No, it’s not what you think.

501
00:39:01,442 --> 00:39:03,242
Star, hear me out.

502
00:39:03,282 --> 00:39:04,892
My dad…

503
00:39:04,932 --> 00:39:06,092
Your dad?

504
00:39:06,132 --> 00:39:07,362
It’s not like that.

505
00:39:08,252 --> 00:39:09,362
Star, listen to me.

506
00:39:09,762 --> 00:39:12,502
I never think about doing it.

507
00:39:12,662 --> 00:39:13,302
I…

508
00:39:13,522 --> 00:39:14,112
I…

509
00:39:14,622 --> 00:39:15,072
I…

510
00:39:15,092 --> 00:39:16,072
I…

511
00:39:17,172 --> 00:39:17,662
I…

512
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:20,622
I don’t believe you.

513
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,032
Star, I…

514
00:39:23,502 --> 00:39:24,252
I…

515
00:39:24,502 --> 00:39:25,562
You have never thought about it?

516
00:39:28,642 --> 00:39:29,172
Huh?

517
00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:33,629
Don’t lie to me.

518
00:39:40,312 --> 00:39:40,872
I…

519
00:39:41,092 --> 00:39:42,502
If you lie to me,

520
00:39:44,402 --> 00:39:46,672
I’ll punish you by…

521
00:40:03,082 --> 00:40:03,802
Then…

522
00:40:12,172 --> 00:40:13,742
I’ll lie to you.

523
00:40:22,342 --> 00:40:23,742
I’ve never thought about it.

524
00:41:03,302 --> 00:41:04,262
Are you sure?

525
00:41:55,492 --> 00:41:58,292
(This is a letter to parents of students who will repeat the same grade in the academic year of 2024)

526
00:42:11,282 --> 00:42:12,572
Hey.

527
00:42:13,512 --> 00:42:14,772
Jewel.

528
00:42:15,442 --> 00:42:16,372
What are you doing here?

529
00:42:17,782 --> 00:42:21,732
I want to ask you to go eat noodles with me.

530
00:42:22,522 --> 00:42:24,702
Wait.

531
00:42:25,912 --> 00:42:26,822
I can’t go.

532
00:42:27,282 --> 00:42:29,282
I waited a long time to meet you.

533
00:42:29,342 --> 00:42:31,282
I have an errand to do.

534
00:42:32,002 --> 00:42:32,882
What errand?

535
00:42:33,152 --> 00:42:34,082
I’ll help you.

536
00:42:34,672 --> 00:42:36,822
No. It’s…

537
00:42:36,852 --> 00:42:39,802
I only ask you to have a meal with me. It’s not that hard.

538
00:42:40,522 --> 00:42:42,522
If you have a job to do, I can pay for it.

539
00:42:46,632 --> 00:42:48,358
After eating noodles, we can go play Lego puzzles.

540
00:42:51,529 --> 00:42:54,220
Everything is not as easy as you think.

541
00:42:57,202 --> 00:42:58,882
But I can make it easy.

542
00:42:59,302 --> 00:43:00,402
Just come with me.

543
00:43:00,932 --> 00:43:02,452
I have many things I want to talk to you.

544
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:06,256
Then talk to someone else. Why did you come to me?

545
00:43:06,278 --> 00:43:09,376
Didn’t you tell me to come to you if I wanted to talk?

546
00:43:09,392 --> 00:43:15,143
But I’m not a public toilet that you can come to or use any time you want.

547
00:43:15,922 --> 00:43:18,118
Everything in your life is easy.

548
00:43:18,702 --> 00:43:20,351
Have you ever put effort into doing something?

549
00:43:23,572 --> 00:43:25,987
Before I can come to see you, I have to…

550
00:43:26,002 --> 00:43:26,620
What?

551
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:27,856
Is it hard?

552
00:43:28,656 --> 00:43:30,652
You just told your driver to take you here.

553
00:43:31,012 --> 00:43:32,220
Are you saying that it was hard to do that?

554
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:34,518
Can’t you hear me out?

555
00:43:34,554 --> 00:43:35,478
Why?

556
00:43:35,782 --> 00:43:37,696
You didn’t listen to me when I told you I have an errand.

557
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:40,605
It was better when we were just strangers.

558
00:43:41,622 --> 00:43:43,238
What do you want from me?

559
00:43:43,885 --> 00:43:45,882
I don’t want to waste my time on you.

560
00:43:58,412 --> 00:43:58,947
Here.

561
00:43:59,049 --> 00:44:01,049
I think my dad already forgot that he had this bottle.

562
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,852
You are a troublemaker. You are a minor but want to drink.

563
00:44:06,262 --> 00:44:07,158
Sera.

564
00:44:08,822 --> 00:44:11,471
Star, thank you.

565
00:44:15,645 --> 00:44:16,969
Happy birthday, Sera.

566
00:44:17,882 --> 00:44:19,085
Thanks, Lune.

567
00:44:19,912 --> 00:44:20,431
Here.

568
00:44:21,202 --> 00:44:22,263
I made it for you.

569
00:44:24,002 --> 00:44:26,249
You made it?

570
00:44:26,954 --> 00:44:27,616
Yes.

571
00:44:27,652 --> 00:44:30,932
That’s why you asked me about cherries.

572
00:44:31,442 --> 00:44:32,365
I was subtle about it, wasn’t I?

573
00:44:32,752 --> 00:44:35,711
Did you two come together?

574
00:44:41,352 --> 00:44:43,652
Come on. Let’s eat the cake.

575
00:44:44,602 --> 00:44:45,798
Have a seat.

576
00:44:45,834 --> 00:44:47,965
Jewel, come and sit with us.

577
00:44:51,432 --> 00:44:52,707
You made this?

578
00:44:52,729 --> 00:44:54,256
I love cherries.

579
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:02,169
Sera, you brought out a lot of food.

580
00:45:02,198 --> 00:45:05,471
This is the first time I’m celebrating my birthday with friends.

581
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,583
The house helper is preparing more food.

582
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,485
Sera, this is already a lot.

583
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,122
This is delicious.

584
00:45:11,158 --> 00:45:12,249
Lune, try it.

585
00:45:23,322 --> 00:45:24,300
This is weird.

586
00:45:27,222 --> 00:45:27,936
What is weird?

587
00:45:28,482 --> 00:45:30,060
Friends can feed each other.

588
00:45:30,802 --> 00:45:31,427
Here.

589
00:45:31,442 --> 00:45:32,700
Eat it.

590
00:45:33,383 --> 00:45:35,382
I think you are the weirdest.

591
00:45:39,849 --> 00:45:41,187
Damn.

592
00:45:53,449 --> 00:45:55,332
Jewel, what are you doing here?

593
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,332
Are you shooting a music video?

594
00:46:09,332 --> 00:46:10,627
What’s wrong?

595
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:16,067
I haven’t seen you look so down like this for a while.

596
00:46:19,102 --> 00:46:19,929
I’ll be fine.

597
00:46:22,009 --> 00:46:24,220
Usually, you are the one who dumps them.

598
00:46:24,503 --> 00:46:26,212
This time, you got dumped.

599
00:46:28,562 --> 00:46:29,202
Is that so?

600
00:46:29,718 --> 00:46:31,885
I’m not even sure that I got dumped.

601
00:46:32,212 --> 00:46:35,769
Damn, Cassanova Jewel.

602
00:46:36,412 --> 00:46:39,318
I was scolded so much that I couldn’t say anything.

603
00:46:41,312 --> 00:46:45,383
I don’t know why it hurts so much this time.

604
00:46:46,522 --> 00:46:47,812
It’s because you care about that person.

605
00:46:53,929 --> 00:46:54,532
How about this?

606
00:46:55,107 --> 00:46:56,292
Do you want to see this person every day?

607
00:47:02,212 --> 00:47:02,954
Yes.

608
00:47:05,078 --> 00:47:06,489
When you don’t see this person,

609
00:47:08,889 --> 00:47:10,263
are you afraid that this person might disappear?

610
00:47:17,192 --> 00:47:17,791
Yes.

611
00:47:19,252 --> 00:47:20,365
This is obvious.

612
00:47:20,952 --> 00:47:22,016
Congratulations, man.

613
00:47:22,052 --> 00:47:24,362
You are falling in love.

614
00:47:24,962 --> 00:47:27,492
Huh? I’m falling in love?

615
00:47:27,885 --> 00:47:31,812
How can I be in love? I don’t even know his name.

616
00:47:32,038 --> 00:47:34,591
So what? You don’t need to know the name.

617
00:47:36,822 --> 00:47:37,929
All you need is the feelings.

618
00:47:42,198 --> 00:47:43,274
Do you want to eat a banana?

619
00:47:45,842 --> 00:47:46,423
No.

620
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:51,347
What are you going to do with your family’s debt?

621
00:47:51,892 --> 00:47:52,903
I don’t know.

622
00:47:53,682 --> 00:47:55,180
I’ll focus on the school first.

623
00:47:55,849 --> 00:47:58,256
If I have to repeat the same grade, I’ll be screwed.

624
00:47:58,285 --> 00:48:01,027
Do you want me to talk to Jane about your pay raise?

625
00:48:01,622 --> 00:48:03,296
Then you don’t need to skip school to work.

626
00:48:03,325 --> 00:48:04,096
No.

627
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:09,383
It would be weird if I asked for a raise while shortening my working hours.

628
00:48:16,502 --> 00:48:18,263
Who put the cup here?

629
00:48:19,652 --> 00:48:22,467
It’s probably the rich boy.

630
00:48:23,242 --> 00:48:26,096
I forgot to tell you. A guy came to look for you here the other day.

631
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,922
I told him to work in exchange.

632
00:48:28,382 --> 00:48:28,860
Huh?

633
00:48:30,122 --> 00:48:33,282
It was so weird. He wanted to see you but he didn’t even know your name.

634
00:48:42,532 --> 00:48:45,500
His name is hard to pronounce. Je…something.

635
00:48:46,432 --> 00:48:47,260
Jewel?

636
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:48,780
Yes.

637
00:48:49,122 --> 00:48:50,569
He looked like a rich boy.

638
00:48:50,612 --> 00:48:53,180
He offered to pay me for your address.

639
00:48:54,672 --> 00:48:55,442
That’s typical of him.

640
00:48:56,102 --> 00:48:57,791
But I didn’t take his money.

641
00:48:58,422 --> 00:49:00,016
I told him to cover my shift in exchange.

642
00:49:00,045 --> 00:49:01,631
I didn’t think he would actually do it.

643
00:49:02,692 --> 00:49:04,554
Look. I have a video of it.

644
00:49:06,932 --> 00:49:07,369
Here.

645
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:20,122
He looked quite determined.

646
00:49:20,612 --> 00:49:21,900
I guess he really wanted to see you.

647
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,540
Did you meet him?

648
00:49:36,198 --> 00:49:38,242
Lune, are you going to use the bathroom?

649
00:49:38,969 --> 00:49:40,445
Yes.

650
00:49:41,622 --> 00:49:42,816
You can use the bathroom upstairs.

651
00:49:45,012 --> 00:49:47,478
It’s okay. I can wait. I don’t want to bother you.

652
00:49:48,312 --> 00:49:51,122
Bother me? You used it before.

653
00:49:51,347 --> 00:49:51,791
Come on.

654
00:49:52,307 --> 00:49:53,782
Sera, it’s okay.

655
00:49:54,234 --> 00:49:55,158
Come on.

656
00:49:55,405 --> 00:49:56,438
Sera.

657
00:50:01,252 --> 00:50:02,176
Are you drunk?

658
00:50:13,202 --> 00:50:14,518
You are definitely drunk.

659
00:50:17,322 --> 00:50:18,031
I’m not drunk.

660
00:50:22,176 --> 00:50:23,172
Then…

661
00:50:24,962 --> 00:50:25,987
How many fingers are there?

662
00:50:30,482 --> 00:50:31,427
Two.

663
00:50:33,056 --> 00:50:36,023
What about this?

664
00:50:45,032 --> 00:50:45,732
Three.

665
00:51:03,002 --> 00:51:03,907
Can I ask you something?

666
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:08,052
Have you ever hated me when we were bickering?

667
00:51:11,832 --> 00:51:12,525
No.

668
00:51:14,692 --> 00:51:15,638
To be honest,

669
00:51:18,022 --> 00:51:20,962
we may know each other better than we think.

670
00:51:28,474 --> 00:51:30,874
Yes, that may be true.

671
00:51:31,652 --> 00:51:36,023
If I didn’t have you and Star, I would have had no one.

672
00:51:37,192 --> 00:51:38,103
What about Lune?

673
00:51:39,238 --> 00:51:40,118
What about Jewel?

674
00:51:40,845 --> 00:51:42,842
They are unlike you and Star.

675
00:51:49,992 --> 00:51:50,962
I’m not going anywhere.

676
00:51:52,562 --> 00:51:53,972
I’ll be here to listen to your nagging.

677
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,911
Don’t say things like that.

678
00:52:06,212 --> 00:52:08,925
But thank you.

679
00:52:14,202 --> 00:52:15,245
What are you talking about?

680
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,783
You are talking nonsense.

681
00:52:35,689 --> 00:52:36,823
I’m cold.

682
00:52:43,222 --> 00:52:44,707
Don’t leave me.

683
00:52:51,142 --> 00:52:51,972
I’ll be here.

684
00:53:07,842 --> 00:53:08,932
Sera, are you waiting to use the bathroom?

685
00:53:09,172 --> 00:53:10,932
No, I’m waiting for you.

686
00:53:11,532 --> 00:53:13,900
Lune, come to look at this.

687
00:53:17,412 --> 00:53:20,445
The stickers that we put on when we were young are still here.

688
00:53:29,522 --> 00:53:32,111
You put that one on. I remember.

689
00:53:37,342 --> 00:53:38,431
I miss it.

690
00:53:40,576 --> 00:53:42,002
Lune, do you miss it?

691
00:53:47,612 --> 00:53:49,245
Sera, I…

692
00:53:49,703 --> 00:53:52,423
Let’s keep our dating a secret for now.

693
00:53:53,842 --> 00:53:54,365
Yes.

694
00:53:55,012 --> 00:53:55,711
Lune.

695
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:59,951
Do you remember this?

696
00:54:04,438 --> 00:54:05,942
You still keep it?

697
00:54:07,592 --> 00:54:10,038
Of course. It’s very important to me.

698
00:54:17,522 --> 00:54:23,442
Do you know that my feelings for you have never changed?

699
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:34,125
Can we start over again?

700
00:54:48,307 --> 00:54:49,158
Sera.

701
00:54:54,562 --> 00:54:56,122
I can’t go back to where we were.

702
00:55:01,932 --> 00:55:02,809
I’m sorry.

703
00:55:30,038 --> 00:55:30,802
Star.

704
00:55:40,592 --> 00:55:41,863
Where have you been?

705
00:55:47,492 --> 00:55:48,874
I went to the bathroom.

706
00:55:57,362 --> 00:55:57,987
Really?

707
00:56:02,932 --> 00:56:03,878
Shall we go home?

708
00:56:10,758 --> 00:56:11,391
Yes.

709
00:56:16,222 --> 00:56:16,663
Let’s go.

710
00:56:25,292 --> 00:56:26,394
(This is obvious.)

711
00:56:26,423 --> 00:56:27,369
(Congratulations, man.)

712
00:56:27,398 --> 00:56:29,856
(You are falling in love.)

713
00:56:30,692 --> 00:56:31,703
Love?

714
00:56:46,802 --> 00:56:49,071
Here is your wage for today.

715
00:56:52,002 --> 00:56:54,962
So you will think of me when you look at it, right?

716
00:57:00,962 --> 00:57:09,042
(Did you get home safely?)

717
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,129
(Text me when you get home.)

718
00:57:43,151 --> 00:57:45,340
(Text me when you get home.)

719
00:57:46,222 --> 00:57:47,885
(Okay. You too.)

720
00:57:54,162 --> 00:57:57,412
(Caramel coffee recipe. Don’t forget it, Jewel!)

721
00:58:03,382 --> 00:58:05,609
Everything in your life is easy.

722
00:58:05,645 --> 00:58:07,231
Have you ever put effort into doing something?

723
00:58:07,542 --> 00:58:08,482
I got it.

724
00:58:09,907 --> 00:58:11,902
I only put effort into the things that I like.

725
00:58:20,482 --> 00:58:21,172
Jewel.

726
00:58:27,172 --> 00:58:28,918
All this time, I might be selfish

727
00:58:32,332 --> 00:58:35,572
But it was because I didn’t know what this was.

728
00:58:40,022 --> 00:58:41,318
Will you give me a chance to prove myself?

729
00:59:15,354 --> 00:59:17,312
(Good night, my girlfriend.)

730
00:59:36,438 --> 00:59:38,432
(Thank you for letting me borrow it.)

731
00:59:42,882 --> 00:59:48,198
(Do you know that my feelings for you have never changed?)

732
00:59:51,352 --> 00:59:53,667
(Can we start over again?)

733
01:00:43,662 --> 01:00:49,042
(Why didn’t you tell me you have a boyfriend?)

734
01:00:54,152 --> 01:00:57,391
From today on, I’ll focus on the comic contest.

735
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,209
Is there a problem in your group?

736
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:02,256
It looks like your friends are having secrets.

737
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,991
Sometimes, I feel like an outsider.

738
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:07,972
I feel bad that we’re keeping the secret from White.

739
01:01:07,994 --> 01:01:09,689
I think you should tell him the truth.

740
01:01:09,711 --> 01:01:10,700
