1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,158
Can you leave me alone?

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,554
That’s right. I’m selfish.

3
00:00:04,697 --> 00:00:05,867
I run away from problems.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,873
If we can prove that Tiwakorn did it,

5
00:00:08,885 --> 00:00:10,415
I will issue a suspension as his punishment.

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,070
If there is a chance for me
to start confronting a problem.

7
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:17,008
My two best friends have finally reconciled.

8
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:18,213
I am lucky to have friends.

9
00:00:18,282 --> 00:00:20,028
They help me to be a better person.

10
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,737
I won’t let the horrible past happen again.

11
00:00:22,753 --> 00:00:25,179
Lune, it happened again.

12
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,921
Do you know I’m afraid to get close to others?

13
00:00:32,626 --> 00:00:34,660
Because I know
I will have to say goodbye to them anyway.

14
00:00:37,577 --> 00:00:38,255
Say goodbye?

15
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:42,299
Yes. My dad often moves.

16
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,308
In the past two years, I attended four schools.

17
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,066
It’s hard for me to have a friend or a boyfriend.

18
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:56,700
But you are an exception.

19
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,299
Huh?

20
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,907
Everyone makes exceptions
for people they feel comfortable with.

21
00:01:04,121 --> 00:01:05,300
Wait, Lune.

22
00:01:05,564 --> 00:01:06,972
Sera, can you leave me alone?

23
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,977
Did you check the company’s documents?

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,700
[Lune, aren’t you going to send me off?]

25
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:18,208
Get the documents ready.

26
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,315
I’ll go check it.

27
00:01:19,986 --> 00:01:21,663
Sera, get in the car.

28
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,704
It happened again.

29
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:07,913
Your dad was that harsh on you.

30
00:03:11,368 --> 00:03:12,064
Yes.

31
00:03:12,622 --> 00:03:16,317
Among all the arguments we have,
this time is the worst.

32
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,100
When will you leave?

33
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:23,867
In two weeks.

34
00:03:24,577 --> 00:03:25,215
Huh?

35
00:03:26,503 --> 00:03:27,504
That soon?

36
00:03:30,412 --> 00:03:31,972
What should I do, Lune?

37
00:03:31,988 --> 00:03:33,809
I don’t want to move again.

38
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:37,915
I made friends for the first time
after moving back here this time.

39
00:03:38,424 --> 00:03:40,504
Real friends.

40
00:03:44,205 --> 00:03:44,906
Sera.

41
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:47,966
Sera, listen to me.

42
00:03:51,697 --> 00:03:55,907
No matter what happens,
we will always be your friend.

43
00:03:58,151 --> 00:04:05,700
I’m sure Star, White, Ivy, and Jewel
will wait for you to come back.

44
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:13,318
I don’t think I will come back.

45
00:04:13,929 --> 00:04:16,866
My dad wants to move and live there permanently.

46
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,202
Let’s make the remaining time with Sera
the most enjoyable moment.

47
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,273
Really?

48
00:04:40,268 --> 00:04:40,902
Yes.

49
00:04:42,326 --> 00:04:47,377
Sera told me that she didn’t have any friends.

50
00:04:48,813 --> 00:04:51,617
So I agreed to be her friend on that day.

51
00:04:53,937 --> 00:04:54,704
That day?

52
00:04:57,537 --> 00:05:00,411
When did you become her friend?
I’ve never asked you before.

53
00:05:01,637 --> 00:05:03,544
The day…

54
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,070
You don’t need to know it.

55
00:05:14,653 --> 00:05:19,660
When I first met Sera,
I recognized we had many things in common.

56
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,263
The more I know and talk to her,

57
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:26,100
I notice that our lives, attitudes,

58
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,074
and personalities are
almost identical as if we are clones.

59
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:31,284
Really?

60
00:05:31,518 --> 00:05:32,113
Yes.

61
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:38,002
That’s why I understand how she’s feeling.

62
00:05:39,398 --> 00:05:41,107
Since we are going to be apart,

63
00:05:43,726 --> 00:05:45,462
I want to do something for her.

64
00:05:51,445 --> 00:05:53,503
Actually, I did wrong to Sera.

65
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,068
I don’t want to repeat it.

66
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:05,902
Sera, do you know the last time
you were leaving the country?

67
00:06:06,377 --> 00:06:08,304
I was in front of your house.

68
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:10,569
I was too afraid to see you.

69
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:13,362
Really?

70
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,307
Why?

71
00:06:19,242 --> 00:06:23,503
I was too afraid to face you
and stand up against those boys.

72
00:06:27,991 --> 00:06:29,060
Sera, don’t worry.

73
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,106
This time, I will go to send you off.

74
00:06:36,113 --> 00:06:37,103
Thank you.

75
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,507
Don’t forget to ask Star
and our friends to come with you.

76
00:06:41,228 --> 00:06:41,813
Yes.

77
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,308
(I will become a new and better person.)

78
00:06:45,816 --> 00:06:47,973
(I won’t repeat the same mistake.)

79
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:50,104
(I will move on to the future.)

80
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,942
(More importantly, I’ll be there for my loved ones.)

81
00:06:58,531 --> 00:06:59,176
Lune.

82
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,504
What are you thinking?

83
00:07:05,522 --> 00:07:06,103
Nothing.

84
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:08,365
I’m thinking…

85
00:07:11,886 --> 00:07:13,765
I want to be a better person.

86
00:07:17,924 --> 00:07:19,016
You can do it.

87
00:07:24,373 --> 00:07:29,307
I’m also thinking
if you first met Sera at the gallery.

88
00:07:31,195 --> 00:07:32,209
Stop it.

89
00:07:32,562 --> 00:07:33,660
Stop digging.

90
00:07:34,684 --> 00:07:37,462
I remember that your eyes were very swollen.

91
00:07:38,642 --> 00:07:40,110
Who made my eyes swollen?

92
00:07:42,976 --> 00:07:43,787
Come here.

93
00:07:43,862 --> 00:07:44,908
I’m sorry.

94
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,303
Come here.

95
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:47,906
Come here.

96
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:49,313
Stop it.

97
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,169
Stop what?

98
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:51,583
Huh?

99
00:07:51,595 --> 00:07:53,026
It’s tickling.

100
00:08:04,202 --> 00:08:05,506
I love you so much. You know it, right?

101
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,531
Irin Pimkittikorn.

102
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:17,863
Wait for me.

103
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:23,410
I don’t want to see your face.

104
00:08:23,812 --> 00:08:24,908
You don’t want to see my face?

105
00:08:25,765 --> 00:08:26,320
Why?

106
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,564
My face looks great.

107
00:08:29,444 --> 00:08:31,307
I’m sick that there’s always a problem
when I’m with you.

108
00:08:31,806 --> 00:08:33,204
All the problems are solved now.

109
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:34,870
Éclair.

110
00:08:35,406 --> 00:08:36,615
There’s a problem. Follow me.

111
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,006
What happens this time?

112
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:40,169
Nana is resigning from school.

113
00:08:40,184 --> 00:08:40,806
Come on.

114
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,092
Go, Tiwakorn.

115
00:08:44,497 --> 00:08:45,417
Do whatever you want.

116
00:08:45,536 --> 00:08:47,908
No. Come with me.

117
00:08:48,202 --> 00:08:48,899
Come on.

118
00:08:54,684 --> 00:08:55,405
Nana.

119
00:09:00,046 --> 00:09:00,851
White.

120
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:02,408
Nana.

121
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,800
Are you resigning?

122
00:09:05,147 --> 00:09:08,468
I don’t know how to face everyone.

123
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,619
If they find out the truth, I don’t know what to do.

124
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:14,067
Nana.

125
00:09:15,881 --> 00:09:17,568
No one will find out.

126
00:09:18,144 --> 00:09:20,511
Only my friends and I know the truth.

127
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,822
My friends won’t tell anyone.

128
00:09:25,772 --> 00:09:26,513
Right, Ivy?

129
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:31,906
Fine.

130
00:09:33,628 --> 00:09:34,575
I won’t tell anyone.

131
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,906
I did the terrible thing to you.

132
00:09:38,361 --> 00:09:40,006
Why are you still being nice to me?

133
00:09:44,044 --> 00:09:45,175
Because you are my friend.

134
00:09:47,731 --> 00:09:52,110
I believe that we can always have a new start.

135
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:55,864
I’m not such a good person.

136
00:09:57,868 --> 00:09:59,062
But because I have my friends.

137
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:02,601
So I…

138
00:10:03,882 --> 00:10:05,059
I want to be a better person.

139
00:10:08,897 --> 00:10:11,904
Nana, you also have friends.

140
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,404
They will always be there for you.

141
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,051
Ivy, say something.

142
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,215
Huh?

143
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,411
Say something.

144
00:10:24,975 --> 00:10:25,582
Oh.

145
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:28,715
I…

146
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:33,540
We were friends.

147
00:10:40,882 --> 00:10:42,004
That’s not right.

148
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:48,802
As far I remember, I, Star, Éclair, and you…

149
00:10:50,582 --> 00:10:52,332
We are friends.

150
00:10:52,997 --> 00:10:53,902
Ivy.

151
00:10:55,086 --> 00:10:57,268
Yes, we are still your friends.

152
00:10:58,342 --> 00:10:59,180
Am I right, Star?

153
00:11:03,238 --> 00:11:04,115
Star.

154
00:11:04,977 --> 00:11:05,606
Yes.

155
00:11:06,735 --> 00:11:08,224
I’m not mad at you.

156
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,507
Forget everything that happened.

157
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:11,706
Let’s be friends.

158
00:11:12,387 --> 00:11:13,804
Let’s have fun together like we used to.

159
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:16,823
Yes.

160
00:11:20,405 --> 00:11:21,972
I’m sorry, Star.

161
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,308
It’s okay.

162
00:11:26,682 --> 00:11:28,216
I’m sorry, everyone.

163
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:36,616
You always act cool.

164
00:11:37,482 --> 00:11:38,969
That’s why Nana falls for you.

165
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,238
Why?

166
00:11:41,794 --> 00:11:42,562
Are you jealous?

167
00:11:43,962 --> 00:11:44,823
It would be crazy if I’m jealous of you.

168
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,164
Why would I feel jealous?

169
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:10,908
Lune, where are you?

170
00:12:12,017 --> 00:12:14,128
When will the result of
the comic contest be announced?

171
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,708
It will be a while.

172
00:12:20,812 --> 00:12:22,321
Where is Lune?

173
00:12:23,413 --> 00:12:26,299
Star, what design are we making?

174
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:30,078
Wait.

175
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,511
This one.

176
00:12:32,631 --> 00:12:34,274
It looks great.

177
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:36,988
Really?

178
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:41,913
When I first designed it,
I wasn’t sure if they would go well together.

179
00:12:42,452 --> 00:12:45,806
But since it has a good concept, I want to keep it.

180
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:47,975
Concept?

181
00:12:50,048 --> 00:12:54,503
I created this design to represent
those who don’t want to follow the rules.

182
00:12:57,111 --> 00:13:01,670
The rules that are written by others.

183
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,216
This outfit will tell them to come out.

184
00:13:14,136 --> 00:13:15,812
Come out and do what you want to do.

185
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:20,819
You did well, Star.

186
00:13:24,264 --> 00:13:25,038
Thank you.

187
00:13:27,195 --> 00:13:28,118
Everyone.

188
00:13:28,736 --> 00:13:29,634
Someone is here to see you.

189
00:13:29,987 --> 00:13:31,187
Hello, everyone.

190
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:33,035
Sera.

191
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,015
Hello.

192
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:36,835
Sera is moving to America.

193
00:13:36,842 --> 00:13:39,906
I take her to see you guys
so we can spend time together.

194
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:41,137
Sure.

195
00:13:41,627 --> 00:13:42,522
Let’s make it special.

196
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:43,082
Sure.

197
00:13:43,096 --> 00:13:45,355
But where shall we take her?

198
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,474
Go golfing?

199
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,612
Or playing soccer?

200
00:13:50,284 --> 00:13:51,875
Or bouldering?

201
00:13:52,175 --> 00:13:57,175
If Sera does all these activities before she goes,
her whole body will be aching.

202
00:13:57,186 --> 00:13:59,462
The activities are adventurous.

203
00:13:59,475 --> 00:14:01,855
They are too adventurous.

204
00:14:01,864 --> 00:14:03,206
Let’s go painting.

205
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:03,910
Swimming.

206
00:14:03,971 --> 00:14:05,417
Let’s go golfing.

207
00:14:06,382 --> 00:14:08,147
It’s too adventurous.

208
00:14:08,155 --> 00:14:08,780
That’s right.

209
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,008
Nice shot.

210
00:14:12,506 --> 00:14:13,306
Swimming.

211
00:14:13,365 --> 00:14:13,911
Yes.

212
00:14:14,714 --> 00:14:15,711
Let’s do paintings.

213
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:16,979
- Yes.
- Right?

214
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:18,794
Everyone.

215
00:14:20,844 --> 00:14:22,815
I’ll go anywhere that you want to go.

216
00:14:24,743 --> 00:14:25,755
Thank you.

217
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:27,819
I’ve never felt this way before.

218
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:29,249
It’s not a big deal.

219
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,757
We are friends.

220
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:41,969
Let’s have a sleepover party
at one of our houses tonight.

221
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,802
That’s a good idea.

222
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,314
Come to my house.

223
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,924
Sure.

224
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,572
My parents will say yes if I tell them
I’ll sleep over at your house.

225
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:54,714
Because they know you.

226
00:15:00,035 --> 00:15:03,908
Everyone, let’s celebrate
Sera’s first sleepover party.

227
00:15:05,346 --> 00:15:07,395
Cheers.

228
00:15:09,976 --> 00:15:11,816
Sera, you haven’t had a sleepover?

229
00:15:11,964 --> 00:15:12,612
Yes.

230
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,975
I didn’t have any friends.

231
00:15:14,282 --> 00:15:16,012
How would I sleep over at my friend’s house?

232
00:15:20,348 --> 00:15:23,420
What do you usually do when you have a sleepover?

233
00:15:27,707 --> 00:15:29,103
Do anything you want.

234
00:15:29,398 --> 00:15:30,571
We can do everything.

235
00:15:32,893 --> 00:15:34,005
Everything?

236
00:15:34,677 --> 00:15:36,615
Yes, everything.

237
00:15:38,933 --> 00:15:40,017
Then…

238
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,311
That’s enough.

239
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:49,816
Hold on. It’s almost done.

240
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,114
Why are girls so obsessed with makeup?

241
00:15:53,591 --> 00:15:54,913
Why am I dragged into this?

242
00:15:58,933 --> 00:16:00,212
When you wear makeup,

243
00:16:02,071 --> 00:16:02,863
you look cute.

244
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:04,459
Give me a kiss.

245
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:05,660
White, go away.

246
00:16:05,804 --> 00:16:07,030
Stop it.

247
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,671
Really?

248
00:16:18,568 --> 00:16:19,380
It’s cute?

249
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,739
Don’t upload it.

250
00:16:22,935 --> 00:16:29,360
♪ Love is love, no need to question why ♪

251
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,648
♪ No need to hesitate, just listen to your heart’s cry ♪

252
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:38,419
♪ Hold my hand, let your heart tell you what’s right ♪

253
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:42,760
Wait.

254
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:45,822
Are we here to party or be their butlers?

255
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:51,827
When will Jewel come?

256
00:16:52,151 --> 00:16:54,337
He said he was going to pick up someone.

257
00:16:55,226 --> 00:16:55,885
Who?

258
00:16:58,391 --> 00:16:59,406
His boyfriend.

259
00:16:59,772 --> 00:17:00,313
Huh?

260
00:17:07,542 --> 00:17:08,804
I’m on a roll.

261
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:10,012
Hello.

262
00:17:10,587 --> 00:17:11,613
Yes, come in.

263
00:17:14,735 --> 00:17:15,412
Guys.

264
00:17:16,754 --> 00:17:18,008
I want to introduce someone to you.

265
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:24,812
Hello.

266
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:28,209
Is he the wizard from the magic café?

267
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:30,023
Yes.

268
00:17:30,755 --> 00:17:31,415
This is Tan.

269
00:17:32,646 --> 00:17:33,401
He’s the wizard…

270
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,477
and my boyfriend.

271
00:17:36,106 --> 00:17:36,837
Huh?

272
00:17:37,332 --> 00:17:40,155
You got here right in time.

273
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,380
They are ganging up on me.

274
00:17:41,638 --> 00:17:43,208
Yes, you should come and help this idiot.

275
00:17:44,386 --> 00:17:45,200
Who did you call an idiot?

276
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:46,742
I’ll take it.

277
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,408
Don’t say that I suck at the game.

278
00:17:49,096 --> 00:17:51,616
Can you cast a spell to help me win?

279
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:53,616
Give it back to me.

280
00:17:57,681 --> 00:17:58,577
Lune.

281
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:01,111
What are you doing?

282
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:16,718
Jewel.

283
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,104
You can sleep with me on the sofa.

284
00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:22,200
No.

285
00:18:23,267 --> 00:18:25,206
You will be uncomfortable.

286
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:28,212
Why?

287
00:18:28,897 --> 00:18:29,737
Are you shy?

288
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,977
Nonsense.

289
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:33,215
Shy?

290
00:18:34,164 --> 00:18:35,303
Why would I feel shy?

291
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,846
Really?

292
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,671
Do you mean it?

293
00:18:42,295 --> 00:18:43,878
Don’t you feel a bit shy?

294
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:45,155
No.

295
00:18:48,306 --> 00:18:48,864
Jewel.

296
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,766
This is our first time sleeping together.

297
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:55,208
Aren’t you going to give me a goodnight kiss?

298
00:18:56,255 --> 00:18:56,811
Huh?

299
00:19:00,387 --> 00:19:01,051
No.

300
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:03,380
My friends might see it.

301
00:19:03,717 --> 00:19:04,415
Come on.

302
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,524
Please, please, please.

303
00:19:09,496 --> 00:19:10,113
Please.

304
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,107
Kiss, kiss, kiss, please.

305
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:18,206
Fine, just one kiss.

306
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,565
Aren’t you afraid that your friends might see it?

307
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:00,560
Yes.

308
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,761
It’s good that we are at Lune’s house.

309
00:20:03,631 --> 00:20:04,609
If we were at my house,

310
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,233
I wouldn’t let you get away.

311
00:20:07,362 --> 00:20:10,468
Why? Do you have handcuffs
and chains in your house?

312
00:20:11,457 --> 00:20:12,460
What are you talking about?

313
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:13,715
You should go to sleep.

314
00:20:25,198 --> 00:20:25,808
Hey.

315
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:27,688
Damn!

316
00:20:28,318 --> 00:20:29,263
You scare me.

317
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,126
Why are you standing up?

318
00:20:31,495 --> 00:20:32,413
Can I sleep on the sofa with you?

319
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:34,307
Aren’t you afraid that I will feel uncomfortable?

320
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,638
The floor here is hard.

321
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,273
Move over.

322
00:20:41,627 --> 00:20:45,066
Who did the flooring? Why is the floor so hard?

323
00:20:57,252 --> 00:20:58,460
Yours is hard too?

324
00:20:58,595 --> 00:20:59,173
Huh?

325
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:02,213
I’m talking about your pillow.

326
00:21:03,348 --> 00:21:06,904
The pillow at Lune’s house is so hard.

327
00:21:10,016 --> 00:21:11,215
You should sleep on my arm.

328
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,317
It’s much softer.

329
00:21:37,103 --> 00:21:38,342
Sera, you can’t sleep?

330
00:21:40,586 --> 00:21:41,161
No.

331
00:21:41,874 --> 00:21:43,606
You too?

332
00:21:44,211 --> 00:21:44,772
Yes.

333
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:48,817
Let’s have a tea party.

334
00:21:50,573 --> 00:21:51,336
Sure.

335
00:22:05,398 --> 00:22:07,308
Here. Chamomile tea.

336
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,662
It will help you sleep better.

337
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:11,118
I like it too.

338
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,206
We have another similar preference.

339
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,851
We have too many things in common.

340
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,016
Thank you so much, Star.

341
00:22:22,046 --> 00:22:23,704
I had a great time today.

342
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,504
Anytime.

343
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:28,811
When you come back next time,
let’s do something fun together.

344
00:22:39,398 --> 00:22:42,016
Star, can I ask you something?

345
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,917
Why didn’t you tell me that you are dating Lune?

346
00:22:51,566 --> 00:22:53,809
I didn’t know how to tell you.

347
00:22:56,455 --> 00:22:59,819
Because I told you that I had feelings for him.

348
00:23:00,324 --> 00:23:01,906
So you were afraid to tell me.

349
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,423
Yes.

350
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,111
I’m sorry.

351
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,103
You should have told me.

352
00:23:17,536 --> 00:23:20,004
If I knew that you two were dating,

353
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,656
I would be more careful
with my actions, not to worry you.

354
00:23:24,906 --> 00:23:26,303
I’m sorry.

355
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:28,164
It’s okay.

356
00:23:29,004 --> 00:23:31,542
You didn’t know.

357
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:39,017
Doggie, you are so cute.

358
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,907
Come here and give me a hug.

359
00:23:46,372 --> 00:23:47,935
Lune and White are funny.

360
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,565
I thought they would never reconcile.

361
00:23:54,565 --> 00:23:58,707
You knew about their fight?

362
00:24:00,051 --> 00:24:00,615
Yes.

363
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:04,703
I came to see Lune and he told me about it.

364
00:24:14,642 --> 00:24:18,223
He was with you that evening?

365
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,106
Yes.

366
00:24:19,634 --> 00:24:24,015
I came to tell him that I was moving to the US.

367
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,215
He was crying.

368
00:24:28,104 --> 00:24:31,415
So we went to a playground near his house to talk.

369
00:24:35,706 --> 00:24:37,295
Playground?

370
00:24:39,428 --> 00:24:42,420
Lune and I often went there when we were young.

371
00:24:42,827 --> 00:24:45,308
There’s only a swing in the playground.

372
00:24:45,608 --> 00:24:46,507
It’s so funny.

373
00:25:17,771 --> 00:25:19,406
Will we get caught?

374
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:20,666
No.

375
00:25:21,172 --> 00:25:22,693
I’ll take her to an elective class.

376
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,108
The teacher won’t notice it.

377
00:25:24,293 --> 00:25:28,102
Lune had been in the class for some time
but he still didn’t remember him.

378
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,062
- That’s right.
- Yes.

379
00:25:30,231 --> 00:25:31,342
Star. Ivy.

380
00:25:32,082 --> 00:25:33,015
Sera.

381
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,517
The uniform you gave me fits perfectly.

382
00:25:41,842 --> 00:25:43,015
That’s true.

383
00:25:43,648 --> 00:25:46,411
If I saw you from behind,
I would probably thought you were Star.

384
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:49,125
Really?

385
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,504
She looks great, right?

386
00:25:52,285 --> 00:25:53,611
Let’s go to class.

387
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:55,816
Alright.

388
00:26:03,944 --> 00:26:04,933
Guys.

389
00:26:06,817 --> 00:26:08,150
Sera, what are you doing here?

390
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,300
Who came up with the idea?

391
00:26:11,209 --> 00:26:12,013
I did.

392
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,308
So Sera can spend as much time with us as possible.

393
00:26:19,784 --> 00:26:20,940
Thank you, Lune.

394
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,028
This is your plan.

395
00:26:24,206 --> 00:26:27,114
If we get caught, you need to take
responsibility for it, Lune.

396
00:26:27,784 --> 00:26:28,369
Sure.

397
00:26:28,893 --> 00:26:30,611
I guarantee that we will never get caught.

398
00:26:30,806 --> 00:26:31,660
I’ll make sure it won’t happen.

399
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:35,220
Okay. Let’s go into the class.

400
00:26:49,467 --> 00:26:53,808
Everyone, did you bring the pencil case
assignment I gave you last week?

401
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:55,013
Yes.

402
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:58,423
If you think your idea is the most creative,
please come out and present it.

403
00:26:58,769 --> 00:26:59,885
I’ll go first, Miss.

404
00:27:00,514 --> 00:27:02,804
This is a pencil toaster.

405
00:27:04,871 --> 00:27:06,015
Your idea is good.

406
00:27:06,151 --> 00:27:07,107
It ejects well.

407
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:10,143
Your idea is lousy.

408
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,220
How great your idea is? Show it.

409
00:27:18,612 --> 00:27:20,108
This is a pencil wheelbarrow.

410
00:27:21,795 --> 00:27:23,435
Did you bring pencils for the whole class?

411
00:27:27,295 --> 00:27:28,914
Lune, what did you bring?

412
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,311
I didn’t know what to bring. So I brought a sink.

413
00:27:58,473 --> 00:27:59,576
Hurry up.

414
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,819
Wait up.

415
00:28:02,531 --> 00:28:03,805
We need to wait for White and Jewel.

416
00:28:04,066 --> 00:28:06,004
They are so slow
and still packing their school bag.

417
00:28:07,099 --> 00:28:10,566
Star and Ivy, you have basketball practice
after this, don’t you?

418
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,506
Yes.

419
00:28:11,764 --> 00:28:13,103
Lune, are you going with them?

420
00:28:14,023 --> 00:28:14,627
Yes.

421
00:28:15,442 --> 00:28:16,606
Sera, do you want to come with us?

422
00:28:17,173 --> 00:28:19,922
I’d love to but I need to go home.

423
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,307
The point is…

424
00:28:23,715 --> 00:28:24,670
What’s wrong?

425
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:29,213
I can’t remember where the school’s entrance is.

426
00:28:30,303 --> 00:28:31,619
I thought it was something else.

427
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:33,219
I’ll walk you to the entrance. Don’t worry.

428
00:28:34,173 --> 00:28:34,917
Really?

429
00:28:35,682 --> 00:28:36,760
Thanks, Lune.

430
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:38,566
Shall we go?

431
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,468
Lune, buy water for us when you come back.

432
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,511
Yes.

433
00:28:47,175 --> 00:28:47,855
Let’s go.

434
00:29:03,064 --> 00:29:03,623
Sera.

435
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,605
Thanks.

436
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,226
I don’t know how to do it.

437
00:29:18,813 --> 00:29:21,100
I’ll show you.

438
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,120
Are you listening?

439
00:29:34,177 --> 00:29:36,125
Hit the ball to bounce back.

440
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,671
That’s right.

441
00:29:40,508 --> 00:29:41,809
You did it.

442
00:30:05,813 --> 00:30:06,508
Ivy.

443
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,580
Hmm?

444
00:30:09,001 --> 00:30:15,108
Do you think we are replaceable?

445
00:30:19,471 --> 00:30:20,664
What are you talking about?

446
00:30:24,453 --> 00:30:27,809
If someone is gone

447
00:30:29,151 --> 00:30:32,009
and one day you meet someone
very similar to that person,

448
00:30:35,446 --> 00:30:39,502
can the new person be
a replacement for the old one?

449
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:47,103
You don’t need to beat around the bush.

450
00:30:48,358 --> 00:30:49,808
You are talking about you and Sera, right?

451
00:30:55,584 --> 00:30:56,413
Yes.

452
00:30:58,946 --> 00:31:03,306
I understand that he wants to make up
for his mistakes in the past.

453
00:31:04,837 --> 00:31:06,958
Sometimes I can’t help thinking…

454
00:31:08,947 --> 00:31:12,408
that he dates me because I’m similar to Sera.

455
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:21,707
Ivy, do you think he chose me to fill Sera’s place?

456
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:28,804
No, he is so in love with you.

457
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,823
And you and Sera are not that similar.

458
00:31:40,193 --> 00:31:43,110
Now, you and Lune are together.

459
00:31:44,601 --> 00:31:45,899
You shouldn’t overthink it.

460
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,202
Let’s live for today. Okay?

461
00:31:53,827 --> 00:31:54,511
Yes.

462
00:31:55,848 --> 00:31:56,864
Thanks, Ivy.

463
00:31:59,925 --> 00:32:00,606
Come on.

464
00:32:00,964 --> 00:32:01,841
Let’s go home.

465
00:32:01,969 --> 00:32:03,915
Stop worrying about it. Okay?

466
00:32:04,837 --> 00:32:06,070
I’ll take you to eat something delicious.

467
00:32:12,242 --> 00:32:15,176
(Now, you and Lune are together.)

468
00:32:15,554 --> 00:32:16,813
(You shouldn’t overthink it.)

469
00:32:23,216 --> 00:32:24,524
Lune, can I see…

470
00:32:31,531 --> 00:32:33,303
Can I see the photo we took the other day?

471
00:32:34,718 --> 00:32:35,325
Sure.

472
00:32:40,168 --> 00:32:40,769
Here.

473
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:43,704
Wait. This is not the photo.

474
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,176
I remember there’s another photo.

475
00:32:49,107 --> 00:32:49,699
Here.

476
00:32:49,948 --> 00:32:50,604
Wait.

477
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,728
I think there’s a better photo.

478
00:32:54,115 --> 00:32:55,408
Can I choose the best photo?

479
00:32:57,533 --> 00:32:58,107
Sure.

480
00:32:58,511 --> 00:32:59,708
Turn on AirDrop on your phone.

481
00:33:06,555 --> 00:33:10,506
Lune, the subscription for
my photo editor has expired.

482
00:33:10,707 --> 00:33:12,314
Can I use the app on your phone?

483
00:33:15,874 --> 00:33:16,462
Sure.

484
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:17,315
Yeah!

485
00:33:20,044 --> 00:33:20,937
Do you want me to do it for you?

486
00:33:21,697 --> 00:33:22,339
No.

487
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,170
[Seraa : Lune, can you send your school’s location to me?]
[Seraa : Thanks.]

488
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,130
[Lune : Sera, where are you?]
[Seraa : I’m almost there.]

489
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,050
[Lune : Star prepared lots of things for you.
She’ll be happy to see you.]

490
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,080
[Seraa : Star is so sweet.]
[Lune : Sera, are you coming to my school tomorrow?]
[If you’re coming, you need to prepare something for the class.]

491
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,010
[Seraa : Yes, I’m going.]
[Do you mean the pencil case?]

492
00:33:43,948 --> 00:33:45,511
Star, are you using
the chatting app to edit your photo?

493
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,780
No, I’m not reading anything.

494
00:33:48,518 --> 00:33:50,417
I don’t know how the chatting app pops up.

495
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,268
The app icons probably look similar.

496
00:33:53,046 --> 00:33:57,804
This is why I can’t find the menu to edit the cheeks.

497
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,708
Star, if you want to look through my phone,
you can do it.

498
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,038
There are no other girls.

499
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,464
I have such a lovely girlfriend.
Why would I have another girl?

500
00:34:17,484 --> 00:34:18,066
Here.

501
00:34:19,013 --> 00:34:20,115
I’m done editing the photo.

502
00:34:32,165 --> 00:34:35,868
Today, Sera told me that
a master thought she was another girl.

503
00:34:36,122 --> 00:34:38,106
He probably thought
she was a student at our school.

504
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,819
Sera played along with him
and talked to him for quite some time.

505
00:34:43,812 --> 00:34:44,515
Really?

506
00:34:45,935 --> 00:34:50,576
I don’t know why the teachers at our school
are so bad at remembering faces.

507
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:54,467
If Sera attends the classes for a while,
they will grade her.

508
00:35:09,168 --> 00:35:09,943
Lune.

509
00:35:10,539 --> 00:35:11,111
Hmm?

510
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:12,617
Can I ask you something?

511
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,696
Shall we go to the magic café tomorrow?

512
00:35:27,871 --> 00:35:28,718
We didn’t go there for a while.

513
00:35:30,808 --> 00:35:32,013
Sure.

514
00:35:32,615 --> 00:35:34,820
It’s a good idea. We haven’t seen Tan for a while.

515
00:35:36,543 --> 00:35:38,405
Shall we ask Sera to come with us?

516
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,703
She seemed to like the café
the last time we went there.

517
00:35:55,165 --> 00:35:56,017
It’s up to you.

518
00:36:00,699 --> 00:36:01,964
See you at school tomorrow.

519
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:03,910
You don’t need to come to pick me up.

520
00:36:05,071 --> 00:36:06,153
I want to go to the school early.

521
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:25,970
When I first met Sera,
I recognized we had many things in common.

522
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,491
I notice that our lives, attitudes,

523
00:36:28,648 --> 00:36:31,253
and personalities are almost identical
as if we are clones.

524
00:36:31,267 --> 00:36:33,006
How did you know that Sera likes cherries?

525
00:36:33,015 --> 00:36:33,935
I subtly asked her.

526
00:36:34,006 --> 00:36:36,531
But I thought she probably
had a similar taste to me.

527
00:36:36,564 --> 00:36:37,409
Sunflowers.

528
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:38,637
Butterbeir.

529
00:36:38,922 --> 00:36:39,988
Chamomile tea.

530
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:41,809
I like it too.

531
00:36:41,888 --> 00:36:43,049
We have another similar preference.

532
00:36:43,099 --> 00:36:45,375
If I saw you from behind,
I would probably thought you were Star.

533
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:49,510
Do you think we are replaceable?

534
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,806
Where have you been?

535
00:36:51,053 --> 00:36:52,408
I went to the bathroom.

536
00:36:52,871 --> 00:36:53,524
Really?

537
00:37:03,005 --> 00:37:03,707
Star.

538
00:37:09,406 --> 00:37:10,059
White.

539
00:37:12,078 --> 00:37:13,073
You came to school early.

540
00:37:13,485 --> 00:37:14,515
Why are you alone?

541
00:37:15,213 --> 00:37:16,022
Where is Lune?

542
00:37:18,182 --> 00:37:18,958
Lune?

543
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:22,670
He hasn’t arrived.

544
00:37:27,602 --> 00:37:29,175
Star, are you okay?

545
00:37:32,448 --> 00:37:33,248
I’m okay.

546
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:45,117
Star.

547
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:53,908
It’s okay not to be okay.

548
00:38:01,274 --> 00:38:02,262
It’s not a big deal.

549
00:38:05,095 --> 00:38:05,902
So far,

550
00:38:08,172 --> 00:38:09,376
you have done well.

551
00:38:44,896 --> 00:38:45,779
I get it.

552
00:38:48,044 --> 00:38:51,965
How it feels to be an outsider.

553
00:38:54,551 --> 00:38:55,867
I know how you feel.

554
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:02,249
I’m sorry for making you feel that way.

555
00:39:02,511 --> 00:39:05,703
It’s okay. That was between me and Lune.

556
00:39:07,522 --> 00:39:09,202
Maybe I was…

557
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:14,113
expecting too much.

558
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:18,506
In reality,

559
00:39:20,982 --> 00:39:22,940
That person had no clues about it.

560
00:39:30,096 --> 00:39:30,913
I know what you mean.

561
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,204
I don’t want to have a fight with Lune.

562
00:39:42,183 --> 00:39:45,611
Why don’t you find a chance and ask him again?

563
00:39:47,441 --> 00:39:49,211
Ask him to go to a place you went to together.

564
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:52,393
Do something you both enjoy.

565
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,500
Or have a simple meal together.

566
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,902
All you need is quality time together.

567
00:40:05,751 --> 00:40:07,008
Quality time?

568
00:40:12,834 --> 00:40:13,740
I’ll give it a try.

569
00:40:20,903 --> 00:40:21,969
Thank you, White.

570
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:27,609
Having you listen to me
and sit with me when I’m crying,

571
00:40:28,655 --> 00:40:30,027
It makes me feel much better.

572
00:40:34,009 --> 00:40:34,914
It’s not a big deal.

573
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,408
Seeing your smile,

574
00:40:40,257 --> 00:40:41,161
that’s good enough for me.

575
00:40:51,777 --> 00:40:56,409
Because you look better when you are lively.

576
00:41:00,757 --> 00:41:03,114
The world without your lively personality,

577
00:41:05,944 --> 00:41:07,100
it would be an unpleasant place.

578
00:41:10,795 --> 00:41:11,773
Star, do you know?

579
00:41:12,921 --> 00:41:16,575
You are very good at
giving positive energy to others.

580
00:41:21,717 --> 00:41:24,060
If one day, you run out of positive energy,

581
00:41:25,582 --> 00:41:26,409
it’s okay.

582
00:41:30,339 --> 00:41:31,464
It’s really okay.

583
00:41:34,183 --> 00:41:35,715
You have done so well.

584
00:41:43,104 --> 00:41:47,008
If one day, you run out of positive energy,

585
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,308
then do the V sign.

586
00:41:51,777 --> 00:41:52,372
Huh?

587
00:41:52,623 --> 00:41:53,881
Do the V sign.

588
00:41:56,063 --> 00:41:56,693
V sign.

589
00:41:59,822 --> 00:42:02,408
If one day you run out of positive energy,

590
00:42:03,724 --> 00:42:04,708
You can recharge it from me.

591
00:42:09,172 --> 00:42:10,125
The service is free.

592
00:42:15,136 --> 00:42:16,326
Thank you, White.

593
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:19,001
It’s not a big deal.

594
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:23,107
We are friends.

595
00:42:48,102 --> 00:42:50,615
(Why don’t you find a chance and ask him again?)

596
00:42:50,772 --> 00:42:52,615
(Ask him to go to a place you went to together.)

597
00:42:52,882 --> 00:42:54,366
(Do something you both enjoy.)

598
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,809
Tiwakorn, you came to school early.

599
00:43:08,206 --> 00:43:09,267
Will it snow today?

600
00:43:09,281 --> 00:43:10,558
It’s snowing. Don’t you see?

601
00:43:10,809 --> 00:43:12,608
Is it that hard to stop bickering me for one day?

602
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,601
Everyone.

603
00:43:18,394 --> 00:43:19,257
Sera.

604
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:22,550
Sera, you came to school earlier than
some real students at this school.

605
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:23,012
That’s true.

606
00:43:23,024 --> 00:43:24,406
Jewel and Lune are not here yet.

607
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,424
Lune probably waits for his dad to give him a ride.

608
00:43:28,086 --> 00:43:30,820
Everyone, I got my flight schedule.

609
00:43:30,987 --> 00:43:31,634
Really?

610
00:43:31,681 --> 00:43:33,957
Yes, it’s next Saturday. The 20th Saturday.

611
00:43:35,089 --> 00:43:35,726
Good.

612
00:43:36,651 --> 00:43:37,211
Why?

613
00:43:37,637 --> 00:43:39,020
Everyone can go.

614
00:43:42,146 --> 00:43:43,762
Star, can you come?

615
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,968
Sure, I will send you off.

616
00:43:49,482 --> 00:43:50,164
Yeah!

617
00:43:51,355 --> 00:43:52,948
I will miss you.

618
00:43:53,659 --> 00:43:55,704
I will miss you guys too.

619
00:43:57,417 --> 00:43:58,016
Come here.

620
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:59,386
Let’s hug.

621
00:44:36,405 --> 00:44:38,406
(Or have a simple meal together.)

622
00:44:38,993 --> 00:44:40,710
(All you need is quality time together.)

623
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,290
[Lune, my mom is leaving
for an overseas business trip tomorrow.]

624
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:58,250
[Do you want to come to my house
and have a simple dinner together?]

625
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,730
[Sure. We barely had a meal together lately.]

626
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,450
[Let’s have a fancy dinner, like in the movies.]

627
00:45:23,328 --> 00:45:24,507
Sera, open the door.

628
00:45:26,241 --> 00:45:27,335
I said open the door.

629
00:45:27,354 --> 00:45:29,202
Why are you always assuming things?

630
00:45:30,587 --> 00:45:31,245
Sera.

631
00:45:34,786 --> 00:45:37,267
No one will understand you.

632
00:45:38,542 --> 00:45:39,903
Sera, open the door.

633
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:41,819
Sera.

634
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:49,711
Sera.

635
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:57,932
Lune.

636
00:45:58,470 --> 00:45:59,666
Why did you prepare so many dishes?

637
00:45:59,964 --> 00:46:01,002
It was because of my dad.

638
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:03,515
He was worried that
we wouldn’t have enough food for you.

639
00:46:03,692 --> 00:46:04,746
So he started cooking in the afternoon.

640
00:46:04,891 --> 00:46:06,662
They are all my favorite dishes.

641
00:46:07,386 --> 00:46:10,602
He’s cooked for you many times
that he knows what you like and don’t like.

642
00:46:12,183 --> 00:46:13,507
Please thank him for me.

643
00:46:14,497 --> 00:46:15,423
Come and sit here.

644
00:46:21,441 --> 00:46:22,182
Thanks.

645
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,402
Your seat is so far away.

646
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:36,928
I want to reenact the dinner scene in Mr. & Mrs. Smith.

647
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,765
But in the movies, they start to kill each other
while having dinner.

648
00:46:41,655 --> 00:46:43,456
That’s true.

649
00:46:44,315 --> 00:46:47,409
But they always get back together
every time they have a fight.

650
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,122
They love each other more after each fight.

651
00:46:54,947 --> 00:46:55,615
Okay.

652
00:46:56,542 --> 00:46:57,204
That’s true.

653
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:58,721
I believe you.

654
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:11,256
Star, Sera got her flight schedule.

655
00:47:13,147 --> 00:47:15,055
Yes, she already told me.

656
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:20,815
I think when we go to send her off at the airport,

657
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,940
We should prepare a big surprise for her.

658
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:29,737
Let’s use what we have in the Art Scrap room
and make a big farewell signage.

659
00:47:30,288 --> 00:47:31,948
Let’s have White play guitar.

660
00:47:32,314 --> 00:47:34,867
This will be the last good memory to give to Sera.

661
00:47:40,004 --> 00:47:40,667
Lune.

662
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,107
Today is our dinner date.

663
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:52,068
Yes.

664
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,702
Can you stop talking about other people?

665
00:48:06,136 --> 00:48:07,131
Star, what’s wrong?

666
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:14,500
I just want…

667
00:48:14,514 --> 00:48:15,223
Want what?

668
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:19,568
You just want to care for Sera.

669
00:48:20,935 --> 00:48:22,208
You just want to do nice things for her.

670
00:48:23,615 --> 00:48:25,103
So you have to give our time to her?

671
00:48:44,303 --> 00:48:45,103
I’m sorry.

672
00:48:47,019 --> 00:48:47,867
Let’s go back to our dinner.

673
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:12,211
Do you think I still have feelings for Sera?

674
00:49:21,811 --> 00:49:22,864
I haven’t said anything.

675
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:24,765
Then what did you mean by what you said earlier?

676
00:49:26,598 --> 00:49:28,020
Sera and I never…

677
00:49:28,033 --> 00:49:29,115
Lune, stop it.

678
00:49:32,046 --> 00:49:33,108
Talk about something else.

679
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:48,940
Star, what’s wrong?

680
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,231
What’s wrong with you, Lune?

681
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:53,430
Is Sera that important to you?

682
00:51:56,438 --> 00:51:57,445
She has a problem.

683
00:51:57,455 --> 00:51:59,904
Right. You never blame her.

684
00:52:00,656 --> 00:52:02,903
You are the one who makes things worse.

685
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:06,707
Can you feel that
our relationship is not going well?

686
00:52:07,245 --> 00:52:08,307
Do you feel it?

687
00:52:09,518 --> 00:52:11,776
It doesn’t feel like we are together.

688
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:14,219
Is that so?

689
00:52:14,828 --> 00:52:15,568
Yes.

690
00:52:16,769 --> 00:52:17,910
You don’t know anything.

691
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:19,608
It would be weird if you knew.

692
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:33,106
Can I ask you for real?

693
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,267
Do you still have feelings for Sera?

694
00:52:39,943 --> 00:52:40,616
Star.

695
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,191
I’ve said many times that
I have no feelings for her.

696
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:46,411
Then why do you care so much about her?

697
00:52:49,993 --> 00:52:51,302
Whatever we’re going to do,
you always ask her to join us.

698
00:52:52,971 --> 00:52:54,329
How am I supposed to feel about that?

699
00:52:57,253 --> 00:52:57,940
Why are you looking at it that way?

700
00:52:57,955 --> 00:52:59,213
Why can’t I?

701
00:53:00,733 --> 00:53:01,507
To be honest,

702
00:53:02,972 --> 00:53:05,302
I start to have doubts because of what you do.

703
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:07,806
Whether you are doing this
because you feel guilty

704
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,108
or you are still in love with her.

705
00:53:16,548 --> 00:53:20,708
If you’re still in love with her, just admit it.

706
00:53:21,051 --> 00:53:22,107
It wouldn’t kill you.

707
00:53:22,204 --> 00:53:23,515
I just want to make up to her.

708
00:53:27,067 --> 00:53:31,118
I just want to give her the happiness
that she never had.

709
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:33,351
I just want…

710
00:53:33,362 --> 00:53:34,024
Lune!

711
00:53:36,917 --> 00:53:38,628
Are you listening to what you’re saying?

712
00:53:42,165 --> 00:53:44,271
Isn’t this love?

713
00:54:09,684 --> 00:54:13,017
On the 20th Saturday, the day Sera leaves.

714
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:18,106
Paradox is holding
the biggest concert in ten years.

715
00:54:19,917 --> 00:54:20,917
Will you go to the concert with me?

716
00:54:23,097 --> 00:54:24,166
Sera, don’t worry.

717
00:54:24,823 --> 00:54:26,211
This time, I will go to send you off.

718
00:54:26,601 --> 00:54:28,404
I did wrong to Sera.

719
00:54:28,675 --> 00:54:30,012
I don’t want to repeat it.

720
00:54:30,373 --> 00:54:34,656
Let’s make the remaining time with Sera
the most enjoyable moment.

721
00:54:36,027 --> 00:54:38,057
I want to be a better person.

722
00:54:38,911 --> 00:54:40,013
You can do it.

723
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:45,408
Yes.

724
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,114
It’s obvious to me.

725
00:54:51,666 --> 00:54:52,612
Lune, you should go home.

726
00:54:53,577 --> 00:54:55,406
We can’t even have a simple dinner together.

727
00:54:58,026 --> 00:54:58,764
Star.

728
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:01,111
Lune, you should go fix the problem from your past.

729
00:55:09,371 --> 00:55:10,616
I can’t do this anymore.

730
00:55:12,416 --> 00:55:13,155
I’m sorry.

731
00:55:18,638 --> 00:55:19,357
Star.

732
00:55:21,682 --> 00:55:22,588
Star.

733
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:40,160
Lune just wants to fix his mistakes.

734
00:55:40,248 --> 00:55:41,870
But he doesn’t balance his time well.

735
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:43,415
Anyone who was in her shoes would overthink it.

736
00:55:43,449 --> 00:55:44,652
She’s also his ex.

737
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:46,160
Lune, you didn’t choose Star to fill my place.

738
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:47,364
But I never thought of doing that.

739
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:48,638
