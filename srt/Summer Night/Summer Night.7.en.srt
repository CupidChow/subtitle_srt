1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,250
This is my secret spot.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,670
I often came here when I was young.

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,510
I felt better every time I came here.

4
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,000
If you have a job to do, I can pay for it.

5
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,310
Everything in your life is easy.

6
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,500
It was better when we were just strangers.

7
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,359
Although she said she only sees me as a friend,

8
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,610
my feelings for her haven’t changed.

9
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,670
I don’t know how to tell White either.

10
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,500
I don’t want to hurt his feelings.

11
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,790
Have you ever hated me when we were bickering?

12
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,420
No.

13
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,960
To be honest, we may know each other better than we think.

14
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:23,810
Who the heck is Sunny?

15
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,350
The post intentionally attacks you.

16
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,250
Forget it.

17
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,820
(Why didn’t you say that you have a boyfriend?)

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,400
Don’t leave me.

19
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,670
Shall we work on the artwork?

20
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,520
No, I got to go.

21
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,530
Wait.

22
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,200
So…

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,830
Last night…

24
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,770
I was very drunk last night.

25
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:20,910
Can you forget it?

26
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,350
Can you pretend that you didn’t see me last night?

27
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,720
The you I saw last night is no different from who you are today.

28
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,230
You say like you know me well.

29
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,500
I told you that we know each other better than we thought.

30
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,350
You don’t even know what my favorite color is.

31
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:45,960
Orange.

32
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:46,850
Wrong.

33
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,100
You like mountains.

34
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,780
I like beaches.

35
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,270
You are the one who likes mountains.

36
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,740
Right.

37
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,110
Barbeque or shabu shabu?

38
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,920
Barbeque. You?

39
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,850
Barbeque.

40
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,470
Cats or dogs?

41
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,160
Cats.

42
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,120
You like cats?

43
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,860
Yes. You also like cats?

44
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,130
Of course.

45
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,810
Why are we talking about these things?

46
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,250
So we can get to know each other better.

47
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,270
How can we know each other better from this small talk?

48
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,720
What is your biggest fear?

49
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,010
Being alone.

50
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,350
Huh? That’s your biggest fear?

51
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:42,930
Yes.

52
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,860
Tell me about it.

53
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,330
It’s going to be a deep talk.

54
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,250
Yes.

55
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,200
I’m a middle child.

56
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,690
I have an older brother and a younger sister.

57
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,750
So your parents kind of favor your brother and spoil your sister.

58
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,970
Yes.

59
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,860
At first, I didn’t think much about it.

60
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,230
I thought that I was fine with spending time alone.

61
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,340
I was fine with doing everything by myself.

62
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,390
I was living like that for a while.

63
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,960
But it turned out that what I thought I was okay with

64
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,240
ended up hurting me the most.

65
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,210
I felt like I was an outsider.

66
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,330
An outsider?

67
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,200
Yes.

68
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,040
Let’s switch to work on the artwork.

69
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,670
I don’t want things to get too serious.

70
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,320
Fine, I’ll help you.

71
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,840
I’ll go to the restroom.

72
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,850
Star.

73
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,400
I want to know who the guy that you like is.

74
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,670
The guy that I like.

75
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:16,240
You talked about him at the school’s festival last semester.

76
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,590
Are you dating him?

77
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,680
Why do you keep it a secret?

78
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,480
No, I’m not dating anyone.

79
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,780
If Star is still single, White will never get over her.

80
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,420
I think so too.

81
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,440
(Why didn’t you say that you have a boyfriend?)

82
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,740
(Why do you keep breaking guys’ hearts?)

83
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,181
(Why do you keep breaking guys’ hearts?)

84
00:07:12,206 --> 00:07:13,366
(Will you tell everyone the truth?)

85
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,260
(Or shall I announce it?)

86
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,260
What the hell does she want?

87
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,830
I don’t know.

88
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,100
What should we do?

89
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,790
Shall we tell everyone the truth?

90
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,550
I’m thinking about it.

91
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,430
Before we tell anyone, we need to talk to White first.

92
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,640
Right, if he hears it from someone else, it will be a big problem.

93
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,070
The longer you wait, the more he will feel hurt.

94
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,920
I’ll tell him.

95
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,730
You should be careful in the meantime.

96
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,620
Sunny definitely means you harm.

97
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,310
Who means harm?

98
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,410
That...

99
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,380
Damn!

100
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,630
When did you get here?

101
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,540
When you were talking about Sunny or something.

102
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,820
What were you guys talking about?

103
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,520
We were talking…

104
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,080
About movies.

105
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,000
Right, movies.

106
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,730
We were talking about Sunny, the actor.

107
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,760
Which one of his movies?

108
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,320
- I Fine… 		- Long Live Love.

109
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,150
Are you sure you were talking about the same thing?

110
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:36,240
We were talking about several of his movies.

111
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,960
I need to go to basketball practice.

112
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,400
Me too.

113
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,610
I don’t know what this feeling is.

114
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,130
May I do this to figure it out?

115
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,970
Hey.

116
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,730
I’m probably too drunk.

117
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,830
You are acting like everything is easy again.

118
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,150
I’m sorry.

119
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:39,570
But…

120
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,860
You don’t need to say anything.

121
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,670
It’s my fault.

122
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,490
I won’t come to see you again.

123
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,290
I’m sorry.

124
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,290
Please do what I ask you to, Bunrod.

125
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,290
Excuse me.

126
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,590
Yes, how can I help you?

127
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,130
Wait a sec.

128
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,500
I want peach tea with konjac crystal pearl.

129
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,970
Are you…

130
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,040
the chauffeur?

131
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,800
No, you got the wrong man.

132
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,420
That’s all you want?

133
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,640
Hey.

134
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,100
Yes.

135
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:03,910
Are you tired from work?

136
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,650
Huh?

137
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,560
No, not really.

138
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,640
Have you had dinner?

139
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,080
No.

140
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:29,190
You haven’t? Then you should go eat. Don’t let yourself feel hungry.

141
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,240
Yes.

142
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,080
What about you?

143
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,970
Have you had dinner?

144
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,920
Are you tired?

145
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,330
No, I’m not prepared for that.

146
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,900
Here is your peach tea with konjac crystal pearl.

147
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,320
Give him a 1,000-baht bill and tell him to keep the change.

148
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,220
Here. Keep the change.

149
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,950
Thank you.

150
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,340
(Shall we tell everyone the truth?)

151
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,850
(I’ll tell White.)

152
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,140
White.

153
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,110
Lune.

154
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,810
The details of the comic contest are announced.

155
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,260
I promise I will work hard on it this year.

156
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,940
I won’t ruin it.

157
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,310
I’m sorry that I ruined it last year.

158
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,370
But this year I will only focus on the work and give no time for love.

159
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,920
Are you over Star?

160
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:04,980
No.

161
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,890
But I’m okay if she has a boyfriend.

162
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,180
But in the meantime,

163
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,990
I don’t want to hear about it.

164
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,740
Is that so?

165
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,780
Yes.

166
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,470
Right now, I will focus on work and friends.

167
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,360
But…

168
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,270
Guys.

169
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,720
We have a big problem.

170
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:45,470
Follow me.

171
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:45,940
What’s going on?

172
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,520
Hurry up.

173
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,230
Come on.

174
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,070
What’s wrong?

175
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,750
Why did you have to throw it?

176
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:58,680
What’s going on?

177
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,830
They are throwing our stuff out.

178
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,240
They are taking our room for the academic team’s tutoring class.

179
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,550
Are we really losing this room?

180
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:16,780
No.

181
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,210
We won’t let them take the room easily.

182
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,520
What do we do?

183
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,760
I have a plan.

184
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,760
Are you here for the tutoring class?

185
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,660
No. I saw that the talisman fell off.

186
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,300
I’m putting it back.

187
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,100
This room is haunted.

188
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,050
If you see the ghost, say hi to it for me.

189
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,520
Are you sure the science nerds will be scared of ghosts?

190
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,490
Will it work?

191
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,900
Anyone can be scared of ghosts?

192
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,740
Ghosts are just electrical signals in our brains.

193
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:20,990
They are not real.

194
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:30,160
The temperatures and air pressures in and outside the room must abruptly drop.

195
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,160
It causes a horizontal prevailing wind.

196
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,760
The transistor in the circuit might be loosened.

197
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,750
There’s smoke.

198
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,850
The ammonium nitrate from the urea fertilizer at our school might spill and mix with sulfuric acid.

199
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,890
But this is an art room.

200
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,300
Why is the printer working?

201
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,850
This printer can be remotely controlled using Wi-Fi.

202
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,040
What does it say?

203
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,370
Give…

204
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,550
my…

205
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,060
room…

206
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:06,800
back.

207
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,680
It ended quite fast.

208
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,910
Guys.

209
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,290
Is this room haunted?

210
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,490
It…

211
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:59,300
Yes, but the ghost…

212
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,310
The ghost is bounded by…

213
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,010
by…

214
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,040
by…

215
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,510
my dad.

216
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,670
What a relief.

217
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,230
The academic team will use another room.

218
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:23,230
If you don’t show any good results like the academic team,

219
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,500
I will need to take the room back.

220
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,700
The higher-ups start to ask me questions.

221
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,630
Okay, Master.

222
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,300
Okay.

223
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,810
Watch your step.

224
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,890
I didn’t expect you guys would work so well together.

225
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,100
You are so good at lying.

226
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,330
From today on, I will focus on the comic contest.

227
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,080
You always said that.

228
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,880
This is our last year in high school.

229
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,010
This is our last chance.

230
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,170
That’s true.

231
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,930
We will be in college next year.

232
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:12,400
I’ll help you too.

233
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,480
Really?

234
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,870
Yes.

235
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,280
Fine.

236
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,790
I’ll help you too.

237
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,470
We can definitely win this.

238
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,360
I’ll help too.

239
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,770
Of course, you are helping me.

240
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,290
Let’s celebrate. What are you waiting for?

241
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,000
Damn.

242
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,290
I’ll have to clean up after you.

243
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,280
Do you have any plans?

244
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,960
Shall we go celebrate?

245
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,570
I already have a plan. Bye.

246
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,970
Why is he in such a hurry?

247
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,190
It’s okay. We can go, just the four of us.

248
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,110
I…

249
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,400
I’m busy.

250
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,630
Why?

251
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,530
I’m having dinner with my dad.

252
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,530
Fine.

253
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:13,970
What about you, Ivy?

254
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,450
I’m having dinner with my mom.

255
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:18,700
Star.

256
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,700
I…

257
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,400
I’m having dinner with my mom.

258
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,100
Great. You have loving families.

259
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,640
Can we take a rain check on it?

260
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,360
Yes.

261
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,340
See you.

262
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,750
See you.

263
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:43,760
Bye.

264
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,310
I feel bad that we are keeping the secret from White.

265
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,180
It’s my fault.

266
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,550
I’m trying to find a chance to tell him but…

267
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,930
But when he said he’s going to focus on the comic contest,

268
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,400
I’m hesitating.

269
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,260
If we tell him, the project will be doomed.

270
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:41,570
Whether we tell him or not, we will hurt him anyway.

271
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,110
Our room is about to be taken back.

272
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,800
I don’t want to see him get hurt.

273
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,100
Why? I’m just worried about him as a friend.

274
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,330
Right now, we need to find out who Sunny is.

275
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,350
Peach tea with konjac crystal pearl.

276
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,120
Yes.

277
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,120
You remember it. You have a good memory.

278
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,480
I’ll get it for you.

279
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,540
And…

280
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,560
I’m fine.

281
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,140
I already ate dinner.

282
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,350
I’m a bit tired.

283
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,480
Pay with a 1,000-baht bill and keep the change.

284
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,810
I haven’t asked you the questions but you answered all of them.

285
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,530
Bunrod.

286
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,340
Do you know the Polyjuice Potion?

287
00:21:57,870 --> 00:21:59,690
What is the Pineapple Potion?

288
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:02,170
Let’s switch our bodies.

289
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,650
Switch our bodies?

290
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,040
What do you mean?

291
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:12,170
Bunrod, why did you take so long?

292
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,840
It’s getting dark.

293
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,570
I’m sorry.

294
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,030
Here is your peach tea with crystal pearl.

295
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,720
I told him to keep the change, Mr. Jewel.

296
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,960
Why are you being so polite?

297
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,600
I’m sorry, Jewel.

298
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:29,490
How is he doing? Is he doing fine?

299
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,190
Has he eaten anything?

300
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,920
Does he look tired from work?

301
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,830
He can’t eat.

302
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,000
He can’t sleep.

303
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,910
He also looks very tired.

304
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,380
Really?

305
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:51,590
His eyes are swollen as if he was crying all night.

306
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,320
What should I do, Bunrod?

307
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:01,290
What do you want to do?

308
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,930
I’m worried about him.

309
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,040
Why are you worried about him?

310
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:23,160
I don’t know but my friend said I’m in love.

311
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,240
But I was not sure if it was love.

312
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,840
So I kissed him.

313
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,300
Why I was such a fool?

314
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,220
We are just strangers.

315
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:41,920
How do you feel?

316
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,450
How do I feel?

317
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:49,680
I have butterflies in my stomach.

318
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,240
When I see him smile,

319
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:58,280
my heart skips a beat.

320
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,560
When I’m with him,

321
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,650
it feels special.

322
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,500
Jewel.

323
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:31,660
About what happened last night, he didn’t mind it.

324
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:45,940
He also said that he feels good when he’s with you.

325
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,300
Really, Bunrod?

326
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,740
Jewel.

327
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,610
Damn it.

328
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,690
Why are you stopping me?

329
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:06,500
Let me go. I’m going to see my true love.

330
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:06,960
Turn around.

331
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:07,760
Let me go.

332
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,800
Jewel.

333
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,130
Am I seeing things again?

334
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,570
This smile, it looks so real.

335
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:28,250
Hey.

336
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,640
You are real?

337
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,980
Yes.

338
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:40,320
Wait. Does it mean you heard everything?

339
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:47,910
What did you say you’re going to tell him?

340
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,510
You heard it.

341
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,090
I have something to tell you too.

342
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,640
My name is Tan.

343
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:33,490
You are always smiling these days.

344
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:35,300
What?

345
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,060
When did I smile?

346
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:42,080
Let’s start again.

347
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,570
I’ll draw background art.

348
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,690
I’ll draw characters.

349
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,490
Then I’ll write dialogue just like before.

350
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,630
Do you know how to draw?

351
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,510
We have a new rule.

352
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,400
You can’t use your phone while we are working.

353
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,400
White, give it back.

354
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,880
Let me send the message first.

355
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,520
Give it back.

356
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,620
(Say it!)

357
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,040
Done!

358
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,920
Me too.

359
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,810
Why did you finish so fast?

360
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,970
I’m leaving.

361
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,410
Jewel.

362
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,590
What about our soccer game?

363
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,260
I haven’t played it for some time.

364
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,800
What?

365
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,500
Lune.

366
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,880
I got to go.

367
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,060
What?

368
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:44,880
You are left behind again, White.

369
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,120
(I submitted the final draft to the webtoon contest. Thank you, everyone. I love you.)

370
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,610
White.

371
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,310
Don’t you feel lonely from being alone?

372
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,090
Why are you here alone?

373
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,380
Where are your friends?

374
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,640
They are busy.

375
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,060
Can I sit with you?

376
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,330
White.

377
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:42,470
Is there a problem among your friends?

378
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,010
No.

379
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,960
What makes you think that?

380
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,380
That…

381
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,180
I often see you being alone.

382
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,960
You don’t seem to be close to them like you used to.

383
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,930
It’s like they have a secret with you.

384
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,750
No.

385
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,690
I think you are overthinking.

386
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,750
They just have their own plans.

387
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,510
Plans?

388
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:37,280
The plans that must exclude you.

389
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,260
Everything that I said,

390
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,750
I said it because I care about you.

391
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,270
Thank you for sleeping over at my place.

392
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,270
(It’s okay.)

393
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,980
You don’t need to hurry.

394
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,620
Ice’s class isn’t over yet.

395
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:10,520
(Okay.)

396
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,700
Then I’ll spend sweet time with Lune in the meantime.

397
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,480
Don’t make it too obvious.

398
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,600
Sunny might secretly take your pictures again.

399
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,660
How will she take a photo when I’m in my house?

400
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:23,220
The photos that she sent were taken in front of Lune’s house, didn’t they?

401
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,610
Don’t you remember?

402
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,610
There’s no security in his gated community.

403
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,570
I heard that.

404
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,010
It’s good that you heard it.

405
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,370
It’s strange.

406
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,280
Usually, the security in my community is quite high.

407
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,990
It’s not easy for non-residents to come into the community.

408
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:43,580
They need to tell the phone number of the house owner they visit and get a stamp.

409
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,240
I’ll talk to you later.

410
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,280
Ice’s class is over.

411
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,810
See you at my house.

412
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:55,410
(Okay. Bye.)

413
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,920
It’s hard for non-residents to go in?

414
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,920
Were the photos taken by a resident?

415
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,880
You are so good-looking.

416
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,230
How could I have never noticed you before?

417
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:18,660
We are living in the same neighborhood but I never saw you.

418
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,270
Sis, let’s go home.

419
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,780
Ice, you go home first.

420
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:29,740
Why?

421
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:30,940
Go.

422
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,080
Okay.

423
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:42,320
Can I talk to you?

424
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,760
When you sleep over at Ivy’s house, don’t your mom say anything?

425
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,470
If it’s Ivy’s house, my mom is fine with it.

426
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,620
When Ivy’s mom is not home, I often go to sleep over there.

427
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,830
My dad is not home often.

428
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,830
So?

429
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,460
I just said it.

430
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,670
In case someone wants to sleep over with me.

431
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,300
Do you want me to sleep over with you?

432
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,420
Yes.

433
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,320
Should I go?

434
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,320
Should I go?

435
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,050
I’ll find a date to sleep over with you.

436
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,860
Pack your stuff.

437
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,000
Don’t you want me to do this?

438
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:01,640
Pack your stuff.

439
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,080
Did you take this picture?

440
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,720
Ivy, how did you know it?

441
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,290
Answer my question.

442
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,780
Did you take it?

443
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,790
I had a crush on Lune.

444
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,080
When I saw him, I couldn’t help taking his photos.

445
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,430
You had a crush on him.

446
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,560
Then why did you create a secret account to attack Star?

447
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,560
Do you want to break them up?

448
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,370
Wait, Ivy. I didn’t create the account.

449
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
Don’t lie your way out of it.

450
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:44,070
The account ‘Sunny’ tries to expose Star.

451
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,940
That’s not me.

452
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,490
I swear.

453
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,830
You took the pictures.

454
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,070
If it wasn’t you, who else would it be?

455
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,900
Maybe…

456
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,690
Maybe what?

457
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,520
When I looked at the picture at school,

458
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,480
your classmate saw it.

459
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,550
She told me to send it to her.

460
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,200
I still like Lune.

461
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:17,030
Why does he have to date Star?

462
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,250
I thought they were just friends.

463
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,230
It’s obvious in the picture.

464
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,490
You are such a fool, Milk.

465
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,700
That’s the photo of friends.

466
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,360
Can you send it to me?

467
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:48,520
Otherwise, I will have to tell my friend that you are a pervert who stalked him home.

468
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,120
Nana?

469
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,560
Hey, do you see Nana?

470
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,730
I saw her walking to the artwork storage room.

471
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,050
The Art Scrap room?

472
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,730
Damn it. White.

473
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,550
I don’t get what you are trying to say.

474
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,340
White.

475
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:45,260
You know how I feel about you, don’t you?

476
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,760
I like you.

477
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:57,330
I have had a crush on you for some time.

478
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,330
Can you give me a chance?

479
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,010
I promise.

480
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,960
I will never hurt your feelings.

481
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,500
I will never leave you alone.

482
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,640
Nana, I’m sorry.

483
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:39,150
I’m not ready to start a relationship with anyone.

484
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,940
Why?

485
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,680
Do you still have feelings for Star?

486
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,400
White, do you know that Star has a boyfriend?

487
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,140
What?

488
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,540
Star has a boyfriend.

489
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,340
Do you know who he is?

490
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,980
Her boyfriend is…

491
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,060
White.

492
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,320
Ivy.

493
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,760
I need to talk to Nana.

494
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:25,100
Can you leave us alone?

495
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:31,630
Yes, I’ll wait for you outside.

496
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,460
Close the door.

497
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,540
You are Sunny, aren’t you?

498
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,200
What are you talking about? I don’t get it.

499
00:40:02,577 --> 00:40:04,017
Stop lying.

500
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:07,084
If you didn’t do it, how did you have these pictures?

501
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,360
What have Star ever done to you? Why are you doing this to her?

502
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,808
If you continue to do this trashy stuff,

503
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,164
I won’t let you get away with it.

504
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:26,142
If you didn’t do anything wrong,

505
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:29,564
what are you afraid of?

506
00:40:31,413 --> 00:40:32,382
Am I right?

507
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,146
What did you talk to Nana about?

508
00:40:45,937 --> 00:40:47,140
Nothing.

509
00:40:47,173 --> 00:40:48,275
It’s a girl stuff.

510
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,048
Are you fighting over me?

511
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,808
You are so full of yourself.

512
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,066
Can’t you tell me what it’s about?

513
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,160
But…

514
00:41:03,582 --> 00:41:05,580
Nana told me…

515
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:10,053
our friends are acting weird lately.

516
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,795
Do you believe her?

517
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,955
Deep down,

518
00:41:29,084 --> 00:41:29,950
I believe her.

519
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,724
I can feel it too.

520
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,137
I feel like…

521
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,337
you guys are…

522
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,204
avoiding me.

523
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,626
To be honest,

524
00:41:58,711 --> 00:42:00,710
sometimes I feel like…

525
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,484
I’m an outsider.

526
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,026
You are overthinking.

527
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:32,915
I’m probably overthinking.

528
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:42,862
Everyone went home.

529
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:46,026
I finished the comics.

530
00:42:46,071 --> 00:42:47,688
You are the first one I show it to.

531
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,120
You finished it?

532
00:42:51,164 --> 00:42:53,288
I’ll read it right now.

533
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,951
(When will you come home? I forgot to bring the key.)

534
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,942
(Star and Lune are waiting outside too.)

535
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,080
Hey.

536
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,146
I can’t read it right now.

537
00:43:11,466 --> 00:43:12,471
I got to go.

538
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,466
Are you leaving me too?

539
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,444
I’m not leaving you.

540
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,626
My mom is not home today.

541
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:36,728
Ice went home but he didn’t have the key.

542
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,804
I’ll read it tonight, okay?

543
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:44,968
I’ll call you.

544
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:11,751
White.

545
00:44:22,782 --> 00:44:24,995
One day, if you become an outsider,

546
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,884
I promise I will bring you back.

547
00:45:21,004 --> 00:45:22,373
I didn’t give this page to her.

548
00:45:25,502 --> 00:45:26,133
Driver.

549
00:45:26,488 --> 00:45:28,764
Can I change my destination?

550
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:52,506
White, are you here to see Ivy?

551
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:53,848
Yes, bro.

552
00:45:54,204 --> 00:45:56,200
Where did you go?

553
00:45:56,231 --> 00:45:58,275
Ivy told me to go out and buy something for her.

554
00:45:58,311 --> 00:45:59,431
I get wet because of it.

555
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:03,208
You can go in and wait with your girlfriend.

556
00:46:03,493 --> 00:46:05,697
I’ll be right there. I need to take a quick shower first.

557
00:46:05,724 --> 00:46:08,168
I told you that I’m not her boyfriend.

558
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:09,742
Really?

559
00:46:09,786 --> 00:46:11,582
I thought it was a couple’s gathering.

560
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,351
Star’s boyfriend is also here.

561
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:21,768
Star’s boyfriend?

562
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,497
Lune.

563
00:47:02,684 --> 00:47:04,186
Are you dating Star?

564
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:17,528
Sunny is Nana?

565
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:25,022
I never thought that Nana would be her.

566
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,880
We were friends when we were in junior high.

567
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:33,244
I think she tried to tell the truth to White.

568
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:37,102
White already submitted the comics to the contest.

569
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:41,395
I think you should tell him before Nana does.

570
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:43,840
To tell you the truth,

571
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:46,053
I feel bad for him.

572
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,257
I’ll call and tell him.

573
00:48:08,506 --> 00:48:09,333
Lune.

574
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,973
Are you dating Star?

575
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:33,253
White, I…

576
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,151
Since when?

577
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:51,493
I said since when?

578
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,573
Last school’s break.

579
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:33,297
I’ve been a fool for all this time.

580
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,453
No, I didn’t mean…

581
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:39,484
Lune.

582
00:49:48,497 --> 00:49:50,490
How could you do this to me?

583
00:49:57,866 --> 00:49:59,860
You know that I have feelings for Star.

584
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,742
I’m sorry.

585
00:50:33,342 --> 00:50:35,120
You are so damn selfish.

586
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:44,568
I was wrong to befriend you.

587
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,840
What kind of friend does this?

588
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:17,946
This is why…

589
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:22,284
you never had friends.

590
00:51:51,075 --> 00:51:52,280
I’ll follow him.

591
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,128
White.

592
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,888
Calm down.

593
00:52:08,924 --> 00:52:10,240
Please hear me out.

594
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:18,506
You knew about it?

595
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:23,982
Yes.

596
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:31,040
Why, Ivy?

597
00:52:32,826 --> 00:52:35,040
I thought you understood me more than anyone.

598
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:42,293
Weren’t you tired of lying to me when you were with me?

599
00:52:44,088 --> 00:52:46,080
All this time, was there anything real?

600
00:52:47,048 --> 00:52:49,040
When you were with me, was there anything real?

601
00:52:55,146 --> 00:52:57,040
Everything was a lie, wasn’t it?

602
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:00,666
I didn’t mean it to turn out this way.

603
00:53:00,702 --> 00:53:03,431
I didn’t mean to lie to you. Ouch!

604
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:11,102
White.

605
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,031
Didn’t you tell me…

606
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:27,813
you would bring me back when I felt like an outsider?

607
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:31,786
Do you know what?

608
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:38,488
You are pushing me further away.

609
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:46,480
You are amazing.

610
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,617
You make me feel like…

611
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:51,742
I am alone.

612
00:53:52,346 --> 00:53:53,740
I have no one left.

613
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,497
I guess I didn’t know you well just like you said.

614
00:54:11,635 --> 00:54:13,662
And I no longer want to know you.

615
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:24,835
You never knew how I felt.

616
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:28,480
You, fool!

617
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:32,133
You also didn’t know how much I care about you.

618
00:54:36,604 --> 00:54:37,653
Do you know what?

619
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:42,480
I felt bad every time I was with you.

620
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,844
I felt bad to see you feeling hurt.

621
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:48,231
I felt bad because I knew that I was hurting you.

622
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:01,946
No matter how terrible I felt, I still wanted to be by your side.

623
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:10,035
Why?

624
00:55:11,111 --> 00:55:13,110
Why it has to be you?

625
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:19,617
I’m sorry.

626
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:23,066
Why it has to be you?

627
00:55:25,093 --> 00:55:26,106
I’m sorry.

628
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:29,884
I’m sorry.

629
00:55:32,222 --> 00:55:33,057
I’m sorry.

630
00:55:35,146 --> 00:55:36,177
Let go of me.

631
00:55:59,004 --> 00:56:00,382
I can’t take it anymore.

632
00:56:10,853 --> 00:56:12,380
Lune, give White some time.

633
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,040
When he calms down,

634
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,920
then we will go talk to him.

635
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,128
White was right.

636
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:28,942
I…

637
00:56:31,031 --> 00:56:32,266
I was selfish.

638
00:56:36,346 --> 00:56:37,422
Lune.

639
00:56:43,004 --> 00:56:44,373
Star, I…

640
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:47,831
I think I should go home.

641
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:51,866
Call me when you get home.

642
00:57:16,097 --> 00:57:17,235
Lune.

643
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:22,666
Sera.

644
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:29,013
What happened to your face?

645
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:33,973
It’s nothing.

646
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:36,311
Sera, why are you doing here?

647
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,360
You’re not good at lying.

648
00:57:46,826 --> 00:57:48,820
Do you want to go to the playground?

649
00:57:56,650 --> 00:58:02,115
Lune, do you remember that we came here almost every day?

650
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:04,693
Right.

651
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:12,524
Every time we came here, we always felt better.

652
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:22,080
After you moved to a new school, I barely came here.

653
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,111
I miss it.

654
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:38,071
Do you want to tell me what happened?

655
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:42,933
I’m okay.

656
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:49,057
You are doing this again.

657
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:52,524
You refuse to talk because you care about other people’s feelings.

658
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,400
You don’t need to tell me.

659
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,408
But I’ll be here for you.

660
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:04,008
When you’re ready to go home, just tell me.

661
00:59:08,133 --> 00:59:09,617
Sera, I’m okay.

662
00:59:14,435 --> 00:59:16,430
But tears are falling from your eyes.

663
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,817
Sera.

664
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:49,662
I’m dating Star.

665
01:00:03,991 --> 01:00:05,200
Wow.

666
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,200
You just dropped a bomb on me.

667
01:00:12,915 --> 01:00:15,688
Did you have a fight with her?

668
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:21,102
No.

669
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:30,631
White just found out that we are dating.

670
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:39,715
Have you been dating her for a while?

671
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:54,977
Yes.

672
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:12,995
To be honest,

673
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,631
I think I get how White feels.

674
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:19,460
You are so cruel.

675
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:28,604
Do you know…

676
01:01:31,306 --> 01:01:40,391
Sometimes being kept in the dark can hurt more than knowing the truth.

677
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:56,231
It hurts to know that the person we have feelings for is dating someone else.

678
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:09,031
But it doesn’t hurt as much as when our best friend lies to us.

679
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:42,906
But this is you.

680
01:02:43,644 --> 01:02:45,640
I understand why you did it.

681
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:55,884
From now on, you shouldn’t care too much about other people’s feelings.

682
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,982
You hurt everyone by doing this.

683
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:49,093
(The number you have dialed cannot be reached at the moment.)

684
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:59,066
(White, I’m sorry.)

685
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,631
(White left the group.)

686
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:25,680
(I submitted the final draft to the webtoon contest. Thank you, everyone. I love you.)

687
01:04:32,168 --> 01:04:33,368
White is still not talking to you?

688
01:04:33,395 --> 01:04:35,360
Can you leave me alone?

689
01:04:35,395 --> 01:04:38,000
Can you tell me what the hell is going on between you two?

690
01:04:38,035 --> 01:04:41,697
I want you to know that everyone tried to protect your feelings.

691
01:04:41,733 --> 01:04:44,350
Everything was my fault. I want to fix it.

692
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,053
I’m willing to do everything to be with you.

693
01:04:48,088 --> 01:04:50,050
Tiwakorn, you need to go to the principal’s office.

694
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:55,386
If we can prove that Tiwakorn did it, we will suspend him.
