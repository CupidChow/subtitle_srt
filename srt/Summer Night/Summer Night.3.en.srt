1
00:00:00,481 --> 00:00:01,831
Everyone, this is my new friend.

2
00:00:01,847 --> 00:00:04,232
From now on, there won’t be only you and me on the team.

3
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,499
There will be you, me, and Lune.

4
00:00:07,311 --> 00:00:08,096
What’s wrong with him?

5
00:00:08,561 --> 00:00:10,287
If you get splashed again, you can come to my café.

6
00:00:10,296 --> 00:00:12,822
It’s a magical café. I can cast a spell to drive your stress away.

7
00:00:12,863 --> 00:00:15,783
I never thought that you would be Paradox’s fan.

8
00:00:15,955 --> 00:00:16,515
Good night.

9
00:00:16,768 --> 00:00:17,373
Good night.

10
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:18,463
Do you like Star?

11
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:19,373
No.

12
00:00:19,388 --> 00:00:20,914
I have a secret to tell you.

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,974
I like Star.

14
00:00:30,651 --> 00:00:33,989
Don’t mess up with us, pr*ck.

15
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,096
Master, this way.

16
00:00:42,244 --> 00:00:42,831
Damn it!

17
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:47,619
Star, let me go.

18
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,106
You didn’t seem to be afraid when you were fighting with them.

19
00:00:49,117 --> 00:00:50,308
Why are you afraid now?

20
00:00:50,322 --> 00:00:53,758
If I am sent to the principal’s office this time, I will be suspended.

21
00:00:55,794 --> 00:00:56,820
Master is not here.

22
00:01:02,668 --> 00:01:05,248
After dressing your wounds, I’ll take you to the teacher.

23
00:01:05,918 --> 00:01:08,807
You need to confess to him that you broke the planter.

24
00:01:13,485 --> 00:01:16,202
Star, can I not go?

25
00:01:16,872 --> 00:01:17,468
Ouch.

26
00:01:18,891 --> 00:01:21,619
Sure, but you need to do something in exchange.

27
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:24,413
What is it?

28
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,207
You need to promise me that you won’t get involved in a fight again.

29
00:01:31,431 --> 00:01:33,105
You also need to study hard.

30
00:01:33,848 --> 00:01:35,260
We will be in high school soon.

31
00:01:38,828 --> 00:01:40,853
The first condition is possible.

32
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:45,619
But your second condition is too hard for me.

33
00:01:46,702 --> 00:01:48,391
It’s not that hard.

34
00:01:48,955 --> 00:01:49,720
I’ll help you.

35
00:01:55,118 --> 00:01:56,465
White, you are smart.

36
00:01:58,373 --> 00:01:59,893
You may not realize it yet.

37
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,608
Even though no one thinks you are smart,...

38
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:07,414
I do.

39
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:19,768
Why don’t you apply to the art club?

40
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,774
Don’t you like drawing comic characters?

41
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:29,982
I saw it on the floor.

42
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,918
I think it’s yours.

43
00:04:25,094 --> 00:04:27,117
Lune, we need to run. Come on.

44
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,619
Wait, Star. What’s going on?

45
00:04:29,851 --> 00:04:31,702
There’s a crazy woman attacking people.

46
00:04:31,743 --> 00:04:32,351
Huh?

47
00:04:33,216 --> 00:04:33,976
Come on.

48
00:04:34,493 --> 00:04:35,120
Wait.

49
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:37,120
This may be my last chance to tell you.

50
00:04:41,445 --> 00:04:42,115
I…

51
00:04:43,785 --> 00:04:44,484
I…

52
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,454
I like…

53
00:04:46,468 --> 00:04:47,108
Ivy.

54
00:04:47,536 --> 00:04:48,230
Ivy.

55
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,743
Ivy, no!

56
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,168
I like…

57
00:04:59,154 --> 00:04:59,869
I…

58
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,706
I like…

59
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,804
Huh?!

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,106
Zombies?

61
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,506
I don’t think it will work.

62
00:05:18,142 --> 00:05:20,613
I think comics these days should be about mafia gangs.

63
00:05:20,847 --> 00:05:24,647
If our comic is about zombies, we’ll need to draw dozens of background characters

64
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,048
That’s true. What about this?

65
00:05:39,936 --> 00:05:41,500
The most popular comic nowadays is BL comics.

66
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:43,982
Lune.

67
00:05:46,407 --> 00:05:47,551
I’ll dress your wound.

68
00:06:03,059 --> 00:06:04,600
But he is bitten by a zombie.

69
00:06:06,928 --> 00:06:10,290
It’s not wrong to have a wound-dressing scene in BL comics.

70
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,977
Where do you get a first-aid kit?

71
00:06:13,057 --> 00:06:14,296
Fine. Forget it.

72
00:06:14,325 --> 00:06:15,514
I’ll just kiss him.

73
00:06:32,614 --> 00:06:33,714
Damn.

74
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,404
When will we get a conclusion?

75
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:40,173
It’s time for school assembly.

76
00:06:51,271 --> 00:06:52,259
Star.

77
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:53,974
Ivy.

78
00:06:54,475 --> 00:06:56,666
Why don’t you rest at home for a few days?

79
00:06:56,797 --> 00:06:57,863
I am much better now.

80
00:06:58,028 --> 00:06:59,242
It’s lonely to stay home.

81
00:07:01,382 --> 00:07:02,456
Walk carefully.

82
00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:16,168
Do you want something from preparing my desk?

83
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,450
I…

84
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:25,570
I’m doing it for everyone

85
00:07:36,312 --> 00:07:39,217
Star, when did you get here?

86
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:43,881
I walked in when you were preparing my desk.

87
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,241
Lune, don’t you join the morning assembly?

88
00:07:55,097 --> 00:07:56,508
I want to put my bag in the classroom first.

89
00:07:58,882 --> 00:08:00,608
What about you? Why don’t you join the morning assembly?

90
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,608
My ankle still hurts.

91
00:08:04,238 --> 00:08:05,817
The teacher told me to wait in the classroom.

92
00:08:06,847 --> 00:08:08,822
Good. You shouldn’t walk too much.

93
00:08:15,797 --> 00:08:18,269
You are so sweet. You prepare the desks for everyone.

94
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:24,600
I…

95
00:08:26,063 --> 00:08:27,020
I’ll join the morning assembly.

96
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,800
Star, be careful. Don’t bump into anything.

97
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:41,063
I got to go.

98
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,560
Wait here.

99
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,414
I’ll buy you lunch.

100
00:09:06,099 --> 00:09:07,355
The hot guy and the hot girl are here.

101
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,881
Let’s go take photos, shall we?

102
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:09,977
The studio is ready.

103
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:16,370
What photos?

104
00:09:16,554 --> 00:09:17,982
Photos for the school promotional poster.

105
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:19,905
I had someone to tell you about it, didn’t I?

106
00:09:20,696 --> 00:09:24,666
Yes, but I already told him that Star is injured.

107
00:09:24,786 --> 00:09:25,773
So I thought you would postpone it.

108
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:27,400
None of us knew about it.

109
00:09:27,588 --> 00:09:29,619
Everyone is ready for the photo shoot.

110
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,451
Can we postpone it?

111
00:09:33,725 --> 00:09:35,822
We can postpone it.

112
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:39,317
Since she can come to school, I think she can do the photo shoot.

113
00:09:39,693 --> 00:09:42,214
If we postpone it for her, a dozen of people will be affected.

114
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,825
How could you say that?

115
00:09:45,657 --> 00:09:48,071
I told you that I already informed your friend about her injury.

116
00:09:56,146 --> 00:09:57,601
Just shooting photos, right?

117
00:09:58,182 --> 00:10:00,294
If I don’t have to walk around, I think I can do it.

118
00:10:01,402 --> 00:10:02,266
That’s it.

119
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:03,820
White, are you okay with it?

120
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:22,198
Okay, are you ready?

121
00:10:30,825 --> 00:10:33,805
White, smile. I’m okay.

122
00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:34,927
I can’t smile.

123
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,520
Let’s smile and finish the photo shoot.

124
00:10:37,785 --> 00:10:38,835
So we can rest.

125
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,004
Next, we will take half-body photos.

126
00:11:19,117 --> 00:11:20,130
It’s a half-body shot.

127
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,722
Her feet won’t be seen anyway.

128
00:11:50,146 --> 00:11:52,488
Look. Your foot is more swollen.

129
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:55,004
It’s okay.

130
00:11:56,045 --> 00:11:57,306
It’s good that we finished the photo shoot.

131
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:01,145
No, it’s not okay.

132
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:03,441
Give it to me.

133
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,063
White.

134
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:06,860
It’s okay.

135
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,103
Star, stay still.

136
00:12:10,847 --> 00:12:12,560
Now, it’s your turn to listen to me.

137
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,168
White, you did well today.

138
00:12:43,237 --> 00:12:46,829
If it was the old you, you would have punched them.

139
00:12:49,257 --> 00:12:51,555
You did great by holding back.

140
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:13,702
Star.

141
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,053
Hmm.

142
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,982
I…

143
00:13:34,088 --> 00:13:35,213
I like…

144
00:13:44,186 --> 00:13:45,371
I like this bottle of water.

145
00:13:48,355 --> 00:13:51,105
It can keep water cool for a long time.

146
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:56,419
What are you talking about?

147
00:14:22,016 --> 00:14:22,851
Lune.

148
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,004
You came so early.

149
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,102
It’ll be a while before the class starts.

150
00:14:29,143 --> 00:14:30,709
I am here to…

151
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:35,868
I am here to help the teacher wipe the floor.

152
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:37,771
Huh?

153
00:14:39,506 --> 00:14:40,770
What’s up with you?

154
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,202
Star, don’t you go have lunch?

155
00:14:47,724 --> 00:14:49,010
I’m not hungry.

156
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,167
Actually, I want to play basketball before the class starts.

157
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:09,706
With my injured ankle, the teacher won’t allow me to play.

158
00:15:13,637 --> 00:15:14,905
But I still want to play.

159
00:15:40,325 --> 00:15:42,069
I’ll play with you.

160
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:49,114
Come on, Star.

161
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,263
Pass the ball to me.

162
00:15:58,802 --> 00:16:00,660
You’re the point guard.

163
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:01,940
Pass the ball to me and I’ll shoot.

164
00:16:03,871 --> 00:16:05,228
You know that I’m the point guard?

165
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:10,230
I heard people say it.

166
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:12,971
Catch it.

167
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,357
Let’s do it one more time.

168
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:36,205
Let’s try again.

169
00:17:19,351 --> 00:17:20,176
Try again.

170
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:51,225
Hold it like this.

171
00:17:56,964 --> 00:17:57,973
Are you listening?

172
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:19,508
I’m okay.

173
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:22,589
Stay still.

174
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,300
Lune.

175
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,260
Hold tight.

176
00:19:21,662 --> 00:19:23,004
You swim pretty fast.

177
00:19:23,783 --> 00:19:25,069
Didn’t you say it’s a competition?

178
00:19:27,714 --> 00:19:28,411
Right.

179
00:19:44,838 --> 00:19:45,900
Did you go easy on me?

180
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,565
No, I did my best.

181
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:53,582
Then let’s call it a tie.

182
00:19:59,174 --> 00:20:00,502
When to confess the feelings to Star?

183
00:20:12,143 --> 00:20:15,268
I mean when should I confess my feelings to Star?

184
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:22,925
What do you think I mean?

185
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,711
I get what you mean.

186
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,100
What about you?

187
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:35,800
Is there anyone you like?

188
00:20:41,237 --> 00:20:42,100
No.

189
00:20:44,407 --> 00:20:45,014
Really?

190
00:20:47,336 --> 00:20:47,979
Okay.

191
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,093
Lune, let’s compete one more time.

192
00:20:55,244 --> 00:20:56,549
We need to find the winner.

193
00:21:13,134 --> 00:21:13,888
Lune.

194
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:19,616
Imagine that you had a crush on someone for a long time.

195
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:23,616
One day, you wanted to confess your feelings to her.

196
00:21:24,312 --> 00:21:25,522
What would you do?

197
00:21:32,694 --> 00:21:34,106
I would keep it simple.

198
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,509
I would just tell her.

199
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:41,317
I would tell her how much I like spending time with her,

200
00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:49,077
how happy I was to watch her doing the things that she loved,

201
00:21:52,697 --> 00:21:55,007
how happy I was to sing our favorite song together.

202
00:21:58,087 --> 00:21:59,604
I would tell her that…

203
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:07,903
I was happiest when I was with her.

204
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:23,807
Damn.

205
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:26,712
That is a great idea.

206
00:22:29,176 --> 00:22:31,407
Then kiss her at the end.

207
00:22:32,906 --> 00:22:35,422
Firstly, I need to practice the lines so I’ll sound as good as you.

208
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:40,567
Do I need to practice kissing?

209
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,094
Lune.

210
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,017
Since you are my first kiss, can you help me?

211
00:22:48,207 --> 00:22:49,854
White, what are you doing?

212
00:22:50,305 --> 00:22:51,645
Go away.

213
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,607
Did she already leave?

214
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:18,948
White.

215
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,973
What are you doing at the gym?

216
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:25,703
Star, I came to…

217
00:23:39,681 --> 00:23:40,731
I came to look for my phone.

218
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,611
I left it here. So I came back to get it.

219
00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:46,105
What about you, Star?

220
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:47,727
What are you doing here?

221
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:49,767
I left my shirt in the locker.

222
00:24:05,536 --> 00:24:06,296
Star.

223
00:24:07,374 --> 00:24:07,992
Hmm.

224
00:24:11,848 --> 00:24:12,703
I…

225
00:24:22,644 --> 00:24:24,106
I should go get the glass that I left.

226
00:24:26,739 --> 00:24:28,117
Didn’t you say you left your phone here?

227
00:24:31,588 --> 00:24:32,306
Right.

228
00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:36,078
White, are you okay?

229
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:54,205
I like you, Star.

230
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:00,703
I really like you.

231
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:07,109
I like you so much.

232
00:25:29,389 --> 00:25:31,509
You don’t need to give me your answer now.

233
00:25:32,653 --> 00:25:35,928
I just want to tell you how I feel.

234
00:25:39,355 --> 00:25:40,662
Is it okay if I try to catch your interest?

235
00:25:43,503 --> 00:25:45,367
Can you at least give me a chance to try?

236
00:25:48,195 --> 00:25:51,579
If I’m not the right guy for you, I won’t force you.

237
00:25:57,007 --> 00:25:58,706
That’s all I want to tell you.

238
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:06,902
I…

239
00:26:08,204 --> 00:26:09,115
I got to go.

240
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,158
Star, go home safely.

241
00:26:39,426 --> 00:26:42,311
Jewel, why are you still here?

242
00:26:42,745 --> 00:26:43,976
I’m waiting for you.

243
00:26:44,877 --> 00:26:45,976
Everyone is at the field.

244
00:26:47,048 --> 00:26:50,072
Right. Today is Monday. We have a soccer match.

245
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:51,800
Did you forget it?

246
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,317
You didn’t come here to meet me?

247
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,115
No, I came here to see Lune.

248
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:02,306
Do you see him?

249
00:27:04,868 --> 00:27:05,468
No.

250
00:27:07,268 --> 00:27:07,994
Forget it.

251
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:10,764
I have an important thing to tell you.

252
00:27:11,608 --> 00:27:13,722
I confessed my feelings to Star.

253
00:27:14,832 --> 00:27:15,517
When?

254
00:27:15,762 --> 00:27:16,911
Right before I came here.

255
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,708
I followed Lune’s advice.

256
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:24,515
After two years of having a crush on her, now I feel so relieved.

257
00:27:29,463 --> 00:27:32,605
Is it good to have Lune helping you?

258
00:27:33,096 --> 00:27:34,124
Yes.

259
00:27:34,893 --> 00:27:39,537
Unlike your advice that always falls short.

260
00:27:43,943 --> 00:27:44,687
I’m sorry.

261
00:27:51,506 --> 00:27:52,637
Jewel, I…

262
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,260
I’m joking.

263
00:27:57,807 --> 00:27:58,814
It’s okay.

264
00:27:59,638 --> 00:28:00,702
Are you going to play soccer?

265
00:28:41,117 --> 00:28:42,469
We are closed.

266
00:28:46,782 --> 00:28:47,808
It’s you.

267
00:28:57,785 --> 00:28:58,899
Haycinedra.

268
00:29:04,013 --> 00:29:05,111
I’ll ask you again.

269
00:29:06,448 --> 00:29:07,653
Do you only think of him as a friend?

270
00:29:08,988 --> 00:29:10,998
Yes, he’s just a friend.

271
00:29:12,137 --> 00:29:16,108
From what you tell me, you seem to have a crush on your friend.

272
00:29:16,644 --> 00:29:17,315
Huh?

273
00:29:18,888 --> 00:29:20,410
It looks like you get jealous over him.

274
00:29:22,466 --> 00:29:23,617
I’m not jealous.

275
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:28,124
Actually, I like the new friend.

276
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:33,976
If you aren’t sure how you feel, why don’t you make it clear?

277
00:29:35,256 --> 00:29:35,980
How?

278
00:29:37,505 --> 00:29:40,204
Why don’t you get close to him?

279
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:44,210
I’m so close to him that we are practically a twin.

280
00:29:44,986 --> 00:29:47,610
No, we need to get closer to him.

281
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:54,506
Like this.

282
00:29:58,488 --> 00:29:59,165
Closer.

283
00:30:26,714 --> 00:30:29,605
When you are this close, you will see it clearly.

284
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,721
But…

285
00:30:32,714 --> 00:30:37,069
don’t get too close, otherwise…

286
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,108
Otherwise what?

287
00:30:41,482 --> 00:30:43,911
Your eyes will be squinting.

288
00:30:45,557 --> 00:30:47,509
I’m not talking to you anymore. You are wasting my time.

289
00:30:48,925 --> 00:30:49,705
Wait.

290
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:54,423
If you have no place to go, you can always come to see me.

291
00:30:55,214 --> 00:30:57,703
You have 18 glasses of drinks left from your previous payment.

292
00:30:58,437 --> 00:31:00,619
What’s your name?

293
00:31:03,434 --> 00:31:04,706
I’m just a stranger.

294
00:31:05,453 --> 00:31:06,411
You don’t need to know my name.

295
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,788
Right. I’ll forget your name in two days anyway.

296
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:36,509
(From what you tell me, you seem to have a crush on your friend.)

297
00:31:45,897 --> 00:31:47,549
Do I really have a crush on you?

298
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,642
When did you get here?

299
00:31:57,074 --> 00:31:57,968
It’s time for the morning assembly.

300
00:32:06,632 --> 00:32:08,638
Jewel, can you teach me how to play?

301
00:32:09,482 --> 00:32:10,106
Sure.

302
00:32:12,994 --> 00:32:13,871
The sunlight is strong.

303
00:32:18,118 --> 00:32:20,416
Look at the ball and the hole.

304
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:21,605
How should I hold the golf club?

305
00:32:21,654 --> 00:32:22,459
Move your hand a little to the right.

306
00:32:22,465 --> 00:32:23,617
Why is it so hard?

307
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:25,355
No, hold it like this.

308
00:32:27,432 --> 00:32:31,711
(If you aren’t sure how you feel, why don’t you make it clear?)

309
00:32:56,198 --> 00:32:58,530
Damn. This is creepy.

310
00:32:58,552 --> 00:32:59,973
What’s wrong with you?

311
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,259
Just hit the ball.

312
00:33:02,254 --> 00:33:03,428
Keep your left arm straight.

313
00:33:04,038 --> 00:33:05,211
Are you sure you are teaching me?

314
00:33:06,454 --> 00:33:08,675
Lune, can’t you do it properly?

315
00:33:17,472 --> 00:33:18,743
What are you eating?

316
00:33:18,777 --> 00:33:19,367
Why?

317
00:33:19,402 --> 00:33:20,225
It’s all over your lips.

318
00:33:20,336 --> 00:33:20,813
Really?

319
00:33:20,829 --> 00:33:22,914
Yes, it’s all over your lips.

320
00:33:28,205 --> 00:33:29,202
What are you doing?

321
00:33:30,933 --> 00:33:31,731
I’ll wipe it for you.

322
00:33:51,139 --> 00:33:51,920
I’ll do it.

323
00:33:52,327 --> 00:33:53,376
What’s wrong with you?

324
00:33:53,549 --> 00:33:55,376
There’s something on Lune’s lips as well. Wipe it for him.

325
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,602
There’s something on your lips. I’ll wipe it.

326
00:34:13,074 --> 00:34:13,863
What’s wrong?

327
00:34:15,617 --> 00:34:17,020
(Why don’t you get close to him?)

328
00:34:25,124 --> 00:34:27,754
(When you are this close, you will see it clearly.)

329
00:34:31,128 --> 00:34:31,816
Damn.

330
00:34:33,151 --> 00:34:34,090
This is not right.

331
00:34:34,108 --> 00:34:35,709
My nose was almost broken.

332
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:37,208
Where are you going?

333
00:34:38,567 --> 00:34:39,234
Jewel.

334
00:34:41,351 --> 00:34:42,909
You have to play games with me today.

335
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,469
Why don’t you play it with Lune?

336
00:34:53,851 --> 00:34:54,811
Don’t do this.

337
00:34:56,314 --> 00:34:57,617
No one can replace you.

338
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:07,687
You and I, we are inseparable.

339
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,943
Don’t bail on me.

340
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:17,905
We are a team.

341
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,394
Fine.

342
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,730
Give me some time.

343
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,685
Don’t let anyone take my place.

344
00:35:30,897 --> 00:35:31,808
Where are you going?

345
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:34,817
You, rascal.

346
00:35:40,402 --> 00:35:41,308
It’s clear.

347
00:35:42,234 --> 00:35:43,505
I don’t have a crush on my friend.

348
00:35:43,823 --> 00:35:44,837
Lower your voice.

349
00:35:45,414 --> 00:35:46,705
You scare my customers

350
00:35:48,161 --> 00:35:49,174
Haycinedra.

351
00:35:55,536 --> 00:35:59,805
I guess it’s just weird seeing my friend become close with someone else.

352
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,902
Are you afraid that you will be forgotten?

353
00:36:05,617 --> 00:36:06,571
I don’t know.

354
00:36:08,274 --> 00:36:10,346
It had been only him and me.

355
00:36:12,878 --> 00:36:15,200
Now, the three of us have to plan and do things together.

356
00:36:16,851 --> 00:36:19,525
So I feel a bit possessive.

357
00:36:20,274 --> 00:36:20,949
There.

358
00:36:22,191 --> 00:36:24,368
You should go talk to him.

359
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:28,456
If you are away from him, he may get jealous over you.

360
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,561
He won’t feel jealous if he sees you and me together.

361
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:39,419
Anyway, it’s clear now that I don’t have a crush on him.

362
00:36:41,591 --> 00:36:43,014
If I didn’t have you, I would have been lost.

363
00:36:44,743 --> 00:36:45,408
Me?

364
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:47,665
Yes.

365
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:53,908
Thank you.

366
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,880
From now on, I won’t need to bother you again.

367
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:08,669
About my other 17 drinks, I’ll give them to you.

368
00:37:19,374 --> 00:37:19,986
Hey.

369
00:37:23,454 --> 00:37:24,765
You don’t need to worry that you will be forgotten.

370
00:37:26,509 --> 00:37:27,121
Huh?

371
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:30,668
Even though two days have passed, I won’t forget you.

372
00:37:36,927 --> 00:37:39,802
Then we are no longer strangers.

373
00:37:44,022 --> 00:37:47,220
Does this mean you will come here again?

374
00:37:51,786 --> 00:37:52,465
I don’t know.

375
00:38:21,428 --> 00:38:24,657
I don’t want to do this biology assignment.

376
00:38:26,757 --> 00:38:28,908
Did you pick the flower you want?

377
00:38:30,134 --> 00:38:30,908
No.

378
00:38:31,411 --> 00:38:32,709
I don’t know how to choose it.

379
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,210
Why don’t we choose from its meaning?

380
00:38:38,595 --> 00:38:40,602
Many flowers have good meanings.

381
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:45,976
My name, Ivy, means friendship, honesty, and loyalty.

382
00:38:46,245 --> 00:38:48,813
That’s exactly who you are.

383
00:38:49,351 --> 00:38:51,468
See? That’s so me, right?

384
00:38:55,056 --> 00:38:56,208
Who matches this flower’s meaning?

385
00:38:56,816 --> 00:39:00,605
Tulip means falling in love wholeheartedly.

386
00:39:17,638 --> 00:39:18,619
I like you, Star.

387
00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:24,758
What about this?

388
00:39:25,294 --> 00:39:30,306
Gerbera means purity, simplicity, and peacefulness.

389
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,514
So did you decide which one you’re going to choose?

390
00:40:34,662 --> 00:40:35,804
What are you looking at?

391
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,300
I’m watching them setting up the event.

392
00:40:42,434 --> 00:40:45,848
Do you know that this club gives everyone the freedom?

393
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,014
They can create anything they want as long as they are design work.

394
00:40:50,056 --> 00:40:53,167
At the end of the semester, they will hold an event to showcase their work.

395
00:41:00,555 --> 00:41:03,982
Why don’t we apply to this club next semester?

396
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:21,318
Even though I don’t know how to make cloth patterns, I can be your model.

397
00:41:22,834 --> 00:41:23,469
Huh?

398
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:26,154
What?

399
00:41:26,807 --> 00:41:27,703
I mean it.

400
00:41:30,011 --> 00:41:33,681
I need to start working out, in case Designer Star wants to hire me.

401
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:38,509
Let’s do it.

402
00:41:43,688 --> 00:41:44,921
Lune, what are you doing?

403
00:41:45,408 --> 00:41:46,136
I’m working out.

404
00:41:48,594 --> 00:41:49,979
Okay, I’ll help you.

405
00:41:50,371 --> 00:41:51,019
How?

406
00:41:54,874 --> 00:41:55,973
One, two, three.

407
00:42:05,068 --> 00:42:06,400
Stop it.

408
00:42:08,576 --> 00:42:09,571
This is embarrassing.

409
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:15,115
Do you know?

410
00:42:18,591 --> 00:42:23,013
I feel very comfortable when I’m with you.

411
00:42:39,192 --> 00:42:41,158
Hello, everyone.

412
00:42:41,171 --> 00:42:42,789
Come closer and join us.

413
00:42:42,917 --> 00:42:44,517
Our theme this year is the regional culture.

414
00:42:44,527 --> 00:42:46,442
If you are interested in joining the sand sculpturing contest,

415
00:42:46,466 --> 00:42:48,228
Please sign up your name at the table behind me.

416
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:50,837
We have a prize for the winner.

417
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:57,585
The prize is this broken-neck goose.

418
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:01,028
The broken-neck goose?

419
00:43:01,764 --> 00:43:03,028
Who would want it?

420
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:04,508
It’s so cute.

421
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,958
I want it.

422
00:43:08,571 --> 00:43:11,152
If you want to join the contest, please come here.

423
00:43:11,176 --> 00:43:11,986
- I want to join.
- I want to join.

424
00:43:18,241 --> 00:43:20,717
Please gather here.

425
00:43:21,084 --> 00:43:27,980
- The sand sculpturing which is the highlight of the design club’s event is about to start.
- Why are they so serious about it?

426
00:43:32,407 --> 00:43:33,005
Lune.

427
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:37,198
Do you also want the broken-neck goose?

428
00:43:37,693 --> 00:43:40,205
No, there are not many contestants.

429
00:43:40,425 --> 00:43:42,004
I feel bad for the organizer. So I join the contest.

430
00:43:43,354 --> 00:43:47,263
The contestants seem to be ready.

431
00:43:47,281 --> 00:43:49,105
They are warming up their bodies.

432
00:43:49,241 --> 00:43:50,428
Are you ready?

433
00:43:50,674 --> 00:43:54,506
Three, two, one, start.

434
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:30,715
It’s done.

435
00:44:39,722 --> 00:44:40,365
How is it?

436
00:44:40,585 --> 00:44:41,619
Is that the Pantheon?

437
00:44:42,062 --> 00:44:42,949
I did my best.

438
00:44:43,257 --> 00:44:43,968
It’s done.

439
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,217
Good job.

440
00:44:55,237 --> 00:44:55,974
It’s done.

441
00:45:11,447 --> 00:45:12,305
It’s done.

442
00:45:23,204 --> 00:45:24,804
Good job.

443
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:30,112
This is for you.

444
00:45:31,297 --> 00:45:32,925
Thanks, Ivy.

445
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,902
How did you injure your hand during the sand sculpturing?

446
00:46:08,131 --> 00:46:09,007
You should go dress your wound.

447
00:46:09,228 --> 00:46:11,026
It’s okay. I only need to wash it.

448
00:46:14,924 --> 00:46:15,853
Why did you work so hard?

449
00:46:17,554 --> 00:46:18,703
Just admit that you are a loser.

450
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,016
Fine, I admit it.

451
00:46:23,074 --> 00:46:25,398
But tonight, I have prepared a bigger surprise.

452
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:27,977
What are you going to do?

453
00:46:29,494 --> 00:46:30,303
Wait and see.

454
00:46:39,337 --> 00:46:39,968
Lune.

455
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,210
Where are the others?

456
00:46:42,491 --> 00:46:43,897
Ivy went to the bathroom.

457
00:46:43,973 --> 00:46:46,365
I didn’t see the other two.

458
00:46:51,228 --> 00:46:52,410
Shall we guess what song they are playing?

459
00:46:58,010 --> 00:46:58,811
- Star.
- Star.

460
00:46:59,063 --> 00:47:03,284
There are millions of stars tonight

461
00:47:03,355 --> 00:47:07,482
But you’re the only star in sight

462
00:47:07,502 --> 00:47:11,690
Our eyes meet when we’re side by side

463
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,131
I want to kiss my star under the moonlight

464
00:47:16,311 --> 00:47:23,586
Tell me where you are, I need your warmth

465
00:47:24,703 --> 00:47:32,968
Tell me where you are, so I can see you in my dream

466
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:38,874
I find love not far from you

467
00:47:42,048 --> 00:47:46,908
I tell my heart, it’s you

468
00:47:58,906 --> 00:47:59,896
- Summer. - Summer.

469
00:48:05,555 --> 00:48:07,262
It would be great if they play the less-known version.

470
00:48:08,149 --> 00:48:09,466
Let’s listen to it now.

471
00:48:33,915 --> 00:48:34,605
Excuse me.

472
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,407
Excuse me.

473
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:43,016
I’m sorry for interrupting the performance.

474
00:48:45,177 --> 00:48:47,204
I want to sing this song for someone.

475
00:48:51,274 --> 00:48:52,666
I’m trying to ask her out.

476
00:48:55,549 --> 00:48:58,921
She changed my world.

477
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:08,471
Thank you.

478
00:49:10,157 --> 00:49:10,927
Star.

479
00:49:14,863 --> 00:49:21,106
I want to tell you that I will always love you.

480
00:49:41,877 --> 00:49:42,610
White.

481
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:58,709
I like someone else.

482
00:51:05,992 --> 00:51:07,527
There are many times

483
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:11,410
My heart wanders off and looks around

484
00:51:14,866 --> 00:51:18,189
I was lost among the crowd

485
00:51:18,952 --> 00:51:21,804
I was confused and anxious

486
00:51:22,183 --> 00:51:24,984
But when I turned around and saw you, everything had changed

487
00:51:24,985 --> 00:51:25,790
Lune.
But when I turned around and saw you, everything had changed

488
00:51:26,567 --> 00:51:29,157
You are right here in front of me

489
00:51:34,182 --> 00:51:34,764
Ouch.

490
00:51:35,348 --> 00:51:36,211
Be gentle.

491
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:42,305
You made a big surprise. Now, you are a wounded bird.

492
00:51:42,438 --> 00:51:43,314
Shut up.

493
00:51:51,367 --> 00:51:55,007
Do you think Star is mad at me?

494
00:51:57,533 --> 00:51:58,205
No.

495
00:51:59,717 --> 00:52:05,112
Before tonight, I already asked her to give me a chance.

496
00:52:07,294 --> 00:52:11,309
But I guess I pressured her too much.

497
00:52:14,376 --> 00:52:15,608
I shouldn’t have said it.

498
00:52:23,091 --> 00:52:26,768
You did well. You weren’t afraid to tell her your feelings.

499
00:52:29,228 --> 00:52:30,100
Unlike me.

500
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,715
Don’t tell me that you…

501
00:52:39,725 --> 00:52:41,019
Shut up.

502
00:52:42,211 --> 00:52:43,811
Don’t overthink it.

503
00:52:44,487 --> 00:52:45,971
The exam is coming up.

504
00:52:46,437 --> 00:52:47,259
People will forget about it soon.

505
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,165
Let’s stop talking about this.

506
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,085
Talking about this?

507
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,468
Talking about what?

508
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:01,700
I already forgot about it.

509
00:53:07,896 --> 00:53:10,155
Damn, it hurts.

510
00:53:11,394 --> 00:53:12,774
It’s done.

511
00:53:14,478 --> 00:53:15,303
You should go home.

512
00:53:16,124 --> 00:53:16,785
Right.

513
00:53:17,789 --> 00:53:18,807
Is that your ride?

514
00:53:20,995 --> 00:53:21,976
That’s right.

515
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:23,626
I got to go.

516
00:53:24,782 --> 00:53:26,906
Don’t go crazy and bite the driver’s ear.

517
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:31,002
After hearing your sarcastic joke, I am now relieved.

518
00:53:32,011 --> 00:53:32,680
I’m leaving.

519
00:53:33,922 --> 00:53:34,602
Bye.

520
00:53:34,782 --> 00:53:35,410
See you.

521
00:53:45,754 --> 00:53:48,565
Coming up here always makes me feel better.

522
00:54:03,503 --> 00:54:05,311
Before the incident, White already confessed his feelings for me.

523
00:54:08,152 --> 00:54:09,814
White has been so nice to me.

524
00:54:12,727 --> 00:54:14,565
But I never see him more than a friend.

525
00:54:17,367 --> 00:54:18,423
That’s why…

526
00:54:21,115 --> 00:54:23,013
I think it’s better to give him my answer.

527
00:54:25,536 --> 00:54:26,314
One more thing,

528
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:30,048
I already have someone in my heart.

529
00:54:41,808 --> 00:54:43,120
I think I should leave.

530
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:45,509
I don’t want your someone to misunderstand us.

531
00:54:45,863 --> 00:54:46,868
He won’t.

532
00:54:49,754 --> 00:54:51,106
He’s very kind-hearted.

533
00:54:59,891 --> 00:55:01,407
He is very lucky.

534
00:55:03,288 --> 00:55:03,900
No.

535
00:55:04,933 --> 00:55:06,306
I’m the lucky one.

536
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:11,814
When I’m with him,

537
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:16,447
He always makes difficult moments feel easier.

538
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,309
Does he know that you have feelings for him?

539
00:55:33,149 --> 00:55:34,610
I think he doesn’t know yet.

540
00:55:48,162 --> 00:55:49,280
Will you tell him?

541
00:55:52,137 --> 00:55:52,762
Yes.

542
00:55:54,891 --> 00:55:56,173
I’m going to tell him now.

543
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:30,562
Lune.

544
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,405
I like you.

545
00:56:42,134 --> 00:56:43,360
Do you feel the same way?

546
00:56:55,976 --> 00:56:56,703
White.

547
00:56:56,762 --> 00:56:57,922
I’ll go wait in the classroom.

548
00:56:57,991 --> 00:57:00,128
Seriously, why are you avoiding Star?

549
00:57:00,149 --> 00:57:01,804
I don’t know how to act when I’m with her.

550
00:57:01,823 --> 00:57:02,937
Give me some time to get over her.

551
00:57:03,435 --> 00:57:05,000
Here, taste my soup.

552
00:57:06,038 --> 00:57:08,798
I have the last assignment for you.

553
00:57:08,837 --> 00:57:09,524
White.

554
00:57:10,195 --> 00:57:11,976
