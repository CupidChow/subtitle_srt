1
00:00:00,398 --> 00:00:01,899
Everyone, this is my new friend.

2
00:00:02,122 --> 00:00:02,807
His name is Lune.

3
00:00:02,905 --> 00:00:04,411
I knew you would be here.

4
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:06,367
From now on, I will come to hide here too.

5
00:00:06,376 --> 00:00:08,008
Can I share the rooftop with you?

6
00:00:08,768 --> 00:00:09,422
Hey.

7
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,885
Why are you following me?

8
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,454
You haven’t paid for the drink.

9
00:00:13,988 --> 00:00:15,211
I don’t want to go there. Just keep the change.

10
00:00:15,425 --> 00:00:18,016
Star is so cute.

11
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:18,631
Huh?

12
00:00:18,647 --> 00:00:20,216
I have a secret to tell you.

13
00:00:21,567 --> 00:00:22,509
I like Star.

14
00:00:24,893 --> 00:00:26,768
Star, your car is ready.

15
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,564
Pa, I think one of my student uniform shirts is missing.

16
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:34,048
There was a small stain on the back of the shirt.

17
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:36,336
Your mom saw it and told me to throw it away.

18
00:00:38,817 --> 00:00:41,706
Your mom will come pick you up at school today.

19
00:00:41,995 --> 00:00:42,745
Why?

20
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,205
She said she wanted to have dinner with you.

21
00:00:46,607 --> 00:00:48,491
She prepared a dress for you. It’s in the car.

22
00:00:48,765 --> 00:00:50,379
It’s very cute.

23
00:00:52,748 --> 00:00:54,080
I love it.

24
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,521
Really? It’s cute, isn’t it?

25
00:00:55,537 --> 00:00:56,817
I’m being sarcastic.

26
00:00:56,865 --> 00:00:59,915
I know. I think it’s too girly.

27
00:01:07,862 --> 00:01:10,124
(Star is a celestial object.)

28
00:01:10,906 --> 00:01:12,605
(It’s an object in the sky.)

29
00:01:13,048 --> 00:01:14,605
(It’s seen by everyone.)

30
00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:18,678
Look at Star. She’s pretty, rich, and smart. She’s so perfect.

31
00:01:18,685 --> 00:01:22,770
She’s a debutante. She does ballet dance and listens to classical music.

32
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,220
Right. She must know how to play the piano.

33
00:01:26,914 --> 00:01:31,921
(Star produces its own light. So it can be seen at all times.)

34
00:01:32,474 --> 00:01:35,202
(But do you know what a star does.)

35
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:44,567
(It burns itself to keep shining.)

36
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:47,494
What’s up, Star?

37
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:48,506
Ivy.

38
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,807
Our teacher is sending you to a spelling bee again.

39
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:56,105
Does the whole school only count on you?

40
00:01:57,404 --> 00:01:59,854
It’s okay. I just want to help her.

41
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:05,001
If you were gone, what would happen to the school?

42
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:16,807
(Many people expect the star to keep shining.)

43
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,245
(Who would really want to see its real nature?)

44
00:03:45,837 --> 00:03:48,546
Your mom didn’t forget to pick you up, did she?

45
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:49,488
No.

46
00:03:50,228 --> 00:03:53,208
She just texted me that her meeting was finishing up late.

47
00:03:55,964 --> 00:04:00,008
It’s okay. I’ll wait with you until your mom arrives.

48
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:03,407
Here.

49
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:05,760
It’s the consent form for the basketball tryout.

50
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,106
Don’t forget to give it to your mom.

51
00:04:21,271 --> 00:04:23,105
Your mom can’t find out about it, right?

52
00:04:29,613 --> 00:04:30,306
Yes.

53
00:04:33,226 --> 00:04:34,377
She won’t understand.

54
00:04:35,637 --> 00:04:37,506
She won't mind if I play basketball for fun.

55
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,660
But being on the school’s team…

56
00:04:57,794 --> 00:04:58,677
Hello, Mom.

57
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:03,663
I will go home soon. I told you I would leave school around 8 pm.

58
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:05,663
It’s only 7 pm.

59
00:05:08,084 --> 00:05:10,635
I’ll be home soon. I’ll have dinner at home.

60
00:05:11,207 --> 00:05:12,130
(My mom is here.)

61
00:05:14,325 --> 00:05:16,162
Okay, I’m on my way home.

62
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,902
Yes, I’m getting a taxi.

63
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,608
(Bye)

64
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,733
Yes.

65
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,817
(My meeting is not over yet. Can I take a rain check on our dinner?)

66
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,102
There are many times

67
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:19,308
My heart wanders off and looks around

68
00:06:19,854 --> 00:06:21,408
My tears are falling

69
00:06:23,688 --> 00:06:26,506
For what it’s worth

70
00:06:27,447 --> 00:06:28,309
I was lost among the crowd

71
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:29,056
Lune.
I was lost among the crowd

72
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:30,521
I was lost among the crowd

73
00:06:31,588 --> 00:06:34,511
Star, why are you still here?

74
00:06:35,087 --> 00:06:36,511
I’m waiting for my ride.

75
00:06:38,077 --> 00:06:39,472
Do you know this song?

76
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,302
I barely know anyone who listens to this version of the song ‘Summer.’

77
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:46,339
Are you…

78
00:06:46,494 --> 00:06:50,776
Don’t tell me that you are Paradox’s fan?

79
00:06:58,601 --> 00:07:00,460
I have this and this one.

80
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:01,900
Is that a real autograph?

81
00:07:02,318 --> 00:07:03,053
Yes.

82
00:07:03,343 --> 00:07:06,348
When I asked Ta for his autograph, my hands were shaking.

83
00:07:08,992 --> 00:07:14,736
Actually, I have their vinyl album but I’ve never played it.

84
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,002
Because you’re afraid that it will get worn out, right?

85
00:07:18,336 --> 00:07:19,002
Yes.

86
00:07:20,094 --> 00:07:21,506
Me, too.

87
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:25,211
Here.

88
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,143
I can’t figure out what song they were playing.

89
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:33,259
The music was buried by screaming.

90
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,912
I never thought that you would be Paradox’s fan.

91
00:07:53,134 --> 00:07:55,312
To be honest, no one knows it.

92
00:07:57,647 --> 00:08:03,862
Besides Ivy, I never talked or told anyone about it.

93
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:05,317
Why?

94
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:07,303
I…

95
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:11,171
I guess everyone expects me to be the school’s perfect golden girl.

96
00:08:11,986 --> 00:08:14,205
No one wants to see a fangirl side of me.

97
00:08:20,725 --> 00:08:21,613
But I want to see it.

98
00:08:23,445 --> 00:08:24,106
Huh?

99
00:08:24,764 --> 00:08:28,709
The song has two versions. Everyone has more than one side to them.

100
00:08:37,805 --> 00:08:46,306
Sometimes, I forget what I want to do or what I want in life.

101
00:09:11,022 --> 00:09:14,608
Then it would be great if there’s a day

102
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,865
that we don’t need to pay attention or care about what other people think.

103
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:23,017
Yes, but that’s impossible.

104
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:40,422
It may be possible.

105
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:46,565
Star, have you ever seen a rainbow at night?

106
00:09:47,527 --> 00:09:48,176
Huh?

107
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:49,371
Let’s go watch it.

108
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,472
Come on, Star.

109
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,442
How would there be a rainbow at this hour?

110
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,731
Wait a second.

111
00:10:07,155 --> 00:10:08,010
It will start in…

112
00:10:08,745 --> 00:10:09,622
Three.

113
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,665
Two.

114
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:13,807
One.

115
00:10:51,388 --> 00:10:54,234
See? Everything is possible.

116
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,223
You said…

117
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,706
let’s not care about what other people think.

118
00:11:10,466 --> 00:11:14,102
Why don’t we go watch the rainbow up close?

119
00:11:14,653 --> 00:11:15,611
I’ve been wanting to do it for some time.

120
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:25,909
Lune.

121
00:12:27,093 --> 00:12:28,671
Do you want to go to the Paradox concert with me?

122
00:12:31,546 --> 00:12:32,179
Yes.

123
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:35,666
It’s really hard to get the tickets.

124
00:12:36,816 --> 00:12:38,122
Let’s pray to the rainbow.

125
00:12:46,888 --> 00:12:47,512
Amen.

126
00:12:51,745 --> 00:12:52,768
Let’s play more.

127
00:13:23,197 --> 00:13:25,211
Master, did you submit the application form?

128
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:33,814
Why did you run to see him?

129
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,306
To get the application form back.

130
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,437
Instead of competing as a duo, we will compete as a team.

131
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,211
Are you talking about the comic contest?

132
00:13:40,349 --> 00:13:41,112
Yes.

133
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:42,625
Why do we need to change it?

134
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,902
From now on, there won’t be only you and me on the team.

135
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,524
There will be you, me, and Lune.

136
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:53,605
If Lune joins our team, we can definitely win the contest.

137
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:56,247
But the story that you and I…

138
00:13:56,257 --> 00:13:56,917
Hey, Lune.

139
00:13:57,108 --> 00:13:58,032
It’s good you are here.

140
00:14:02,349 --> 00:14:03,862
Can you help me with the comic contest?

141
00:14:04,337 --> 00:14:04,949
Huh?

142
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:08,872
I saw your drawing the other day.

143
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:12,004
I want you to help me draw the background art.

144
00:14:13,028 --> 00:14:14,057
But I’ve never done it before.

145
00:14:16,242 --> 00:14:19,299
Come on. There’s always the first time for everything.

146
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,268
So there’s another thing that we do together for the first time.

147
00:14:31,308 --> 00:14:33,410
Okay, let’s write our names down.

148
00:14:35,235 --> 00:14:36,512
I’ll put your name in first.

149
00:14:38,342 --> 00:14:40,976
Nontarat.

150
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:46,213
Then it’s my name, Tiwakorn.

151
00:14:47,534 --> 00:14:48,780
Then Jewel’s name.

152
00:14:50,229 --> 00:14:51,168
Perfect.

153
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:52,651
You draw the background art.

154
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,130
I’ll draw the characters.

155
00:14:54,152 --> 00:14:55,173
Have you ever seen it?

156
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:07,115
Here, enjoy your chocolate and gain weight.

157
00:15:07,928 --> 00:15:11,134
As Valentine’s Day is coming up, your gifts are doubled.

158
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:12,860
Thank you.

159
00:15:14,171 --> 00:15:16,148
Did you send the consent form back?

160
00:15:32,115 --> 00:15:39,908
Sometimes, I forget what I want to do or what I want in life.

161
00:15:43,952 --> 00:15:47,106
Tomorrow is the last day. Do you want me to talk to your mom?

162
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:02,235
It looks something like this.

163
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:05,000
Are you sure?

164
00:16:06,306 --> 00:16:07,005
Yes.

165
00:16:08,564 --> 00:16:10,340
This is what I want to do.

166
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:00,767
Sh*t.

167
00:17:04,528 --> 00:17:05,474
Did you just curse at me?

168
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,103
No, it’s just my exclamation.

169
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:12,825
Star, what are you doing here?

170
00:17:13,134 --> 00:17:14,318
I’m here for the same purpose as you.

171
00:17:14,954 --> 00:17:16,471
Aren’t you here to book the concert tickets?

172
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:25,897
There are four minutes before the sale starts.

173
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:26,912
Let’s set an alarm.

174
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:33,960
Why don’t you turn on the light?

175
00:17:35,229 --> 00:17:37,804
I sneaked in to use the computer without telling the teacher.

176
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:43,419
If I get caught buying the tickets, my mom will find out about the concert.

177
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,364
Can’t you tell your mom about it?

178
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:50,608
She doesn’t know that I’m a fan of the band.

179
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:55,007
She only knows that I got good grades,

180
00:17:56,114 --> 00:17:57,263
and that I’m a good girl.

181
00:17:58,354 --> 00:17:59,170
That’s probably all she knows about me.

182
00:18:01,282 --> 00:18:04,706
If she knows that I’m jumping and screaming in a concert,

183
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,619
she may scream louder than me.

184
00:18:18,146 --> 00:18:19,600
When I was young

185
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:24,463
Mom, is my bracelet pretty?

186
00:18:24,962 --> 00:18:26,592
Yes, it’s pretty.

187
00:18:26,614 --> 00:18:27,626
Let me take a look.

188
00:18:28,985 --> 00:18:30,148
Well done.

189
00:18:30,225 --> 00:18:33,444
I like the translucent, yellow, and white beads.

190
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:43,518
My mom used to like everything that I chose,

191
00:18:45,235 --> 00:18:46,629
everything that I did.

192
00:18:48,465 --> 00:18:49,705
When I grew up,

193
00:18:50,965 --> 00:18:53,607
I guess she has a high expectation of me.

194
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,068
Actually, it’s not only my mom.

195
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,297
To be honest, I also have a high expectation of you.

196
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:17,371
I expect that you will become a famous designer one day.

197
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,708
Everyone will love the clothes that you design.

198
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:28,608
I expect you to be on our school’s basketball team.

199
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:35,705
I expect you to go to the concert of your favorite band and scream louder than the music.

200
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,368
I want to see you do what you like.

201
00:19:46,931 --> 00:19:48,260
You are much better with your words.

202
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:52,368
It only happens when I’m with certain people.

203
00:19:53,762 --> 00:19:55,567
Really? Who are they?

204
00:19:57,515 --> 00:19:58,657
People who I care about.

205
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:22,505
Hello.

206
00:20:24,262 --> 00:20:25,672
It’s the alarm.

207
00:20:34,514 --> 00:20:35,259
Ten seconds.

208
00:20:43,656 --> 00:20:44,348
Three.

209
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:46,041
Two.

210
00:20:46,594 --> 00:20:47,254
One.

211
00:20:49,977 --> 00:20:50,731
Damn it.

212
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,130
(404 Page not found.)

213
00:20:57,367 --> 00:20:59,714
We will never get the tickets.

214
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,139
There’s another way.

215
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:11,066
Let’s go.

216
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:12,318
Go.

217
00:21:12,506 --> 00:21:13,210
Go where?

218
00:21:13,444 --> 00:21:14,105
Come on.

219
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:19,669
Wait, Lune.

220
00:21:20,314 --> 00:21:21,211
Where are we going?

221
00:21:21,371 --> 00:21:22,869
Go to a ticket counter.

222
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,448
But it’s located at the back of the school.

223
00:21:31,177 --> 00:21:32,640
We got wet yesterday.

224
00:21:33,564 --> 00:21:34,745
Is it okay if we get wet again today?

225
00:21:42,717 --> 00:21:43,327
Yes.

226
00:22:06,514 --> 00:22:07,422
The system is down.

227
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:08,562
Huh?

228
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,634
Can you try again?

229
00:22:12,651 --> 00:22:13,906
This is the tenth time I have tried.

230
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:17,118
It’s okay.

231
00:22:17,582 --> 00:22:18,471
Thank you.

232
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,312
Let’s go.

233
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,019
I’m sorry.

234
00:22:37,487 --> 00:22:38,614
Why are you apologizing to me?

235
00:22:39,395 --> 00:22:40,860
This is the rainbow’s fault.

236
00:22:41,512 --> 00:22:42,320
The rainbow?

237
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,804
We made a wish with the rainbow.

238
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:46,890
Do you remember?

239
00:22:47,343 --> 00:22:48,558
I guess it’s not sacred.

240
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,411
I see.

241
00:22:55,235 --> 00:22:56,911
But at least, we have tried.

242
00:22:57,791 --> 00:23:01,905
If there’s another concert, we…

243
00:23:01,992 --> 00:23:04,456
Hey, do you want two tickets, don’t you?

244
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,407
I got them.

245
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:08,863
Two tickets.

246
00:23:10,158 --> 00:23:11,007
We got them.

247
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:22,060
We did it.

248
00:23:24,383 --> 00:23:25,503
I’m so happy.

249
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,041
I guess you have to thank the rainbow now.

250
00:23:47,275 --> 00:23:47,967
No.

251
00:23:48,485 --> 00:23:49,760
I have to thank you.

252
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:59,767
Lune, I didn’t only pray to the rainbow.

253
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,434
But I…

254
00:24:08,874 --> 00:24:10,161
How many laps did you promise to run?

255
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,877
20 laps.

256
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:13,709
This is the last lap.

257
00:24:34,165 --> 00:24:34,863
Lune.

258
00:24:36,832 --> 00:24:37,817
I…

259
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,605
I completed my laps but…

260
00:24:43,705 --> 00:24:47,213
I promised that you would run 40 laps.

261
00:24:51,842 --> 00:24:54,979
I was worried that the rainbow wouldn’t grant me my wish.

262
00:24:59,303 --> 00:25:02,130
Come on. You just need to run another 20 laps.

263
00:25:02,154 --> 00:25:03,299
Please.

264
00:25:03,577 --> 00:25:05,248
Please. Please. Please.

265
00:25:05,257 --> 00:25:06,770
It’s not that far.

266
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:09,256
Yeah!

267
00:25:13,062 --> 00:25:14,874
Good job.

268
00:25:16,937 --> 00:25:18,388
You only focus on the game when you are with us.

269
00:25:19,294 --> 00:25:21,949
I’ll tease you instead.

270
00:25:24,986 --> 00:25:27,103
Why are you walking in together?

271
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:29,802
What did you do?

272
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,309
Why are you looking like that?

273
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:35,311
We went exercising.

274
00:25:57,136 --> 00:25:57,834
Can we go now?

275
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:00,813
Why are you in such a hurry?

276
00:26:01,217 --> 00:26:02,432
Star is having a basketball match.

277
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,361
Jewel, are you coming with us?

278
00:26:07,724 --> 00:26:09,610
No, you can go without me.

279
00:26:10,622 --> 00:26:11,360
Why?

280
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:14,282
What’s wrong with him?

281
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,468
Who are you looking for?

282
00:26:23,868 --> 00:26:24,962
Lune and the boys.

283
00:26:29,134 --> 00:26:29,915
I…

284
00:26:33,357 --> 00:26:35,103
I mean they always come to watch us.

285
00:27:32,013 --> 00:27:33,416
I’m exhausted.

286
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:34,914
Hey.

287
00:27:35,868 --> 00:27:36,765
Don’t talk to me.

288
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:39,869
Do you think our friends are acting strange?

289
00:27:41,545 --> 00:27:42,694
Lune and Star?

290
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:43,525
Damn.

291
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:46,912
See? I know I’m not the only one who notices it.

292
00:27:50,457 --> 00:27:51,244
I don’t know.

293
00:27:52,912 --> 00:27:53,651
Maybe…

294
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:54,764
Maybe…

295
00:27:57,152 --> 00:27:58,645
Maybe Lune likes Star.

296
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:11,416
Let’s ask him.

297
00:28:11,848 --> 00:28:12,520
Lune.

298
00:28:13,697 --> 00:28:14,666
Don’t do it.

299
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:20,703
Do you like Star?

300
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:34,823
No.

301
00:28:35,216 --> 00:28:36,515
See, Ivy?

302
00:28:37,194 --> 00:28:38,816
I told you that your gut feeling was wrong.

303
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,613
Lune doesn’t like Star, right?

304
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:44,920
Yes.

305
00:29:04,887 --> 00:29:05,804
Do you like Star?

306
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,103
Why didn’t I tell him the truth?

307
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,010
(I’m so excited. I didn’t think that we would get the tickets.)

308
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,690
(It’s harder to get the tickets for the event than a big concert.)

309
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:26,130
(See you tomorrow.)

310
00:29:41,222 --> 00:29:43,020
I’m sorry for being late.

311
00:29:50,306 --> 00:29:51,807
Why are you looking at me like that?

312
00:29:52,746 --> 00:29:54,917
I lost my contact lens.

313
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:58,339
Do I look strange?

314
00:29:58,943 --> 00:30:00,158
No, I…

315
00:30:01,317 --> 00:30:02,662
No, you don’t look strange.

316
00:30:02,828 --> 00:30:07,062
You look good.

317
00:30:09,345 --> 00:30:10,103
Really?

318
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:11,805
What’s good about it?

319
00:30:12,194 --> 00:30:15,016
I didn’t wear any makeup or do my hair.

320
00:30:15,801 --> 00:30:17,109
You look cute.

321
00:30:21,857 --> 00:30:23,915
I’m not saying that…

322
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:28,362
I mean you always look great.

323
00:30:28,905 --> 00:30:29,906
You also look great in this style.

324
00:30:33,413 --> 00:30:34,408
Why are you stumbling on your words?

325
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,208
I haven’t said anything.

326
00:30:40,355 --> 00:30:41,164
Let’s go into the event.

327
00:30:43,528 --> 00:30:46,404
Mrs. Duean, I think you should take the side entrance.

328
00:30:46,891 --> 00:30:50,709
A concert is held in the garden today.

329
00:30:51,118 --> 00:30:52,317
Star, are you okay?

330
00:30:52,579 --> 00:30:53,517
That’s my mom.

331
00:31:14,293 --> 00:31:16,309
Mrs. Duean, please follow me this way.

332
00:31:24,152 --> 00:31:25,222
Star, are you okay?

333
00:31:25,576 --> 00:31:26,829
Do you want to go home? I can go with you.

334
00:31:29,828 --> 00:31:30,598
No.

335
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,884
I really want to watch this show.

336
00:31:45,435 --> 00:31:46,102
Star.

337
00:31:47,988 --> 00:31:48,722
Thank you.

338
00:31:53,162 --> 00:31:54,120
The weather is nice.

339
00:31:56,459 --> 00:31:59,860
I’ll think of it as a way to charge my batteries before the basketball tryout tomorrow.

340
00:32:02,405 --> 00:32:03,506
Lune, are you going to watch my tryout?

341
00:32:04,457 --> 00:32:05,125
Of course.

342
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,269
I want to see the legendary three-point shot.

343
00:32:08,656 --> 00:32:10,152
Did you see my three-point shot?

344
00:32:10,594 --> 00:32:13,407
I haven’t shot a three-pointer for some time.

345
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,211
But lately, I’m afraid to shoot a three-pointer.

346
00:32:27,177 --> 00:32:28,650
I missed the shot once and we lost the game.

347
00:32:30,678 --> 00:32:32,964
But you won’t miss the shot tomorrow. I believe in you.

348
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,619
You have to go watch my tryout.

349
00:32:42,207 --> 00:32:42,826
Yes.

350
00:32:44,302 --> 00:32:45,309
It’s now Paradox’s stage.

351
00:32:45,749 --> 00:32:46,712
That’s Ta.

352
00:32:50,085 --> 00:32:54,419
The first song we are going to play today is for those who are in love.

353
00:32:57,859 --> 00:32:59,611
I want to look cute in your eyes

354
00:32:59,949 --> 00:33:00,158
I want you to think I’m lovely

355
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:01,590
That’s the song “En-doo.”
I want you to think I’m lovely

356
00:33:01,591 --> 00:33:01,900
I want you to think I’m lovely

357
00:33:01,942 --> 00:33:05,611
Can we be together like this every day and night?

358
00:33:05,908 --> 00:33:07,917
I want to look cute in your eyes

359
00:33:07,937 --> 00:33:09,702
Can you give it a try?

360
00:33:09,903 --> 00:33:13,902
I want you to open your heart and think of me

361
00:33:22,783 --> 00:33:27,234
Can you rethink about me?

362
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:35,204
Can we be in a serious relationship?

363
00:33:39,014 --> 00:33:41,545
I want to be with you every minute

364
00:33:42,948 --> 00:33:45,635
I want to be a better person

365
00:33:46,903 --> 00:33:49,382
I want to hold you all the time

366
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:53,271
I want to get your attention just like your dogs and cats

367
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:55,044
I want to look cute in your eyes

368
00:33:55,235 --> 00:33:57,117
I want you to think I’m lovely

369
00:33:57,228 --> 00:34:00,854
Can we be together like this every day and night?

370
00:34:01,103 --> 00:34:03,054
I want to look cute in your eyes

371
00:34:03,137 --> 00:34:04,820
Can you give it a try?

372
00:34:05,121 --> 00:34:08,816
I want you to open your heart and think of me

373
00:34:09,551 --> 00:34:10,940
Please give it a try

374
00:34:21,863 --> 00:34:23,805
Can you move the glass on the table?

375
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,057
Excuse me. Do you know where the toilet is?

376
00:34:28,937 --> 00:34:30,408
Go into the building and turn left.

377
00:34:30,663 --> 00:34:31,857
Thank you.

378
00:34:32,016 --> 00:34:32,629
Sure.

379
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:35,660
Is this the building?

380
00:34:36,136 --> 00:34:37,911
- Yes, you can walk in. - Thank you.

381
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:40,605
Star.

382
00:34:42,097 --> 00:34:43,204
What are you doing here?

383
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:48,508
Didn’t I set up your meeting with Professor Paul today?

384
00:34:49,371 --> 00:34:51,268
I…

385
00:34:53,555 --> 00:34:55,939
I asked him to meet me here.

386
00:34:57,127 --> 00:34:58,496
Then why no one told me about it?

387
00:35:03,377 --> 00:35:04,709
Excuse me.

388
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,690
(You have an IELTS exam tomorrow. You should go home early and rest.)

389
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,610
(My meeting today is finishing late. I won’t be back before you go to bed.)

390
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,302
Why did you lie to me?

391
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,217
Paul told me that you postponed your meeting with him today.

392
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:37,102
Did you go to the concert?

393
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:41,702
Is this time for you to go to a concert?

394
00:35:42,392 --> 00:35:44,068
Your IELTS exam is in two days.

395
00:35:45,565 --> 00:35:48,268
Star, I never stop you from going to a concert.

396
00:35:48,426 --> 00:35:51,601
But this is not the right time for it. You postponed the meeting without telling me.

397
00:35:53,336 --> 00:35:54,663
You lied to me.

398
00:35:57,394 --> 00:36:01,623
Between now and exam day, your only focus should be studying for the exam.

399
00:36:02,088 --> 00:36:03,014
Do you hear me?

400
00:36:03,257 --> 00:36:05,528
Tomorrow, I…

401
00:36:05,546 --> 00:36:06,602
Tomorrow what?

402
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:19,725
Are you alright?

403
00:36:21,914 --> 00:36:24,219
I’m afraid to tell my mom about the tryout.

404
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:28,207
Then don’t tell her.

405
00:36:29,545 --> 00:36:32,331
You need to get on the team first.

406
00:36:33,346 --> 00:36:36,109
During the tryout, just forget about everything else.

407
00:36:36,517 --> 00:36:38,109
Don’t think about other people.

408
00:36:40,635 --> 00:36:42,465
Then it would be great if there’s a day

409
00:36:43,207 --> 00:36:45,706
that we don’t need to pay attention or care about what other people think.

410
00:36:51,422 --> 00:36:53,616
Do your best today.

411
00:36:53,946 --> 00:36:55,164
You can think about what to do next after you’re on the team.

412
00:36:55,539 --> 00:36:56,208
Okay?

413
00:36:58,862 --> 00:36:59,911
Thanks, Ivy.

414
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,808
Star.

415
00:37:08,872 --> 00:37:09,628
I’m rooting for you.

416
00:37:17,441 --> 00:37:18,577
Where is Lune?

417
00:37:19,352 --> 00:37:21,377
Lune texted me saying something came up.

418
00:37:23,238 --> 00:37:24,057
Is that so?

419
00:37:33,222 --> 00:37:34,622
Star, what’s wrong?

420
00:37:40,164 --> 00:37:40,871
Nothing.

421
00:37:42,442 --> 00:37:45,362
I’ll go get ready.

422
00:37:49,377 --> 00:37:51,933
The red team is playing offense.

423
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:53,010
She shoots.

424
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,309
The ball goes in.

425
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,850
But you won’t miss the shot tomorrow.

426
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:04,208
You have to go watch my tryout.

427
00:38:14,562 --> 00:38:16,008
Star, did you zone out?

428
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,305
The time in the fourth quarter is running out.

429
00:38:21,361 --> 00:38:23,887
The white team is three points behind.

430
00:38:23,949 --> 00:38:25,505
Star, shoot a three-pointer.

431
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,558
The white team is focusing on their offensive play.

432
00:38:32,632 --> 00:38:33,660
Go, White Team!

433
00:38:36,065 --> 00:38:36,705
Star.

434
00:38:37,094 --> 00:38:37,903
Are you alright?

435
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,825
They crash into each other.

436
00:38:39,914 --> 00:38:40,582
Star, are you okay?

437
00:38:40,601 --> 00:38:41,321
I’m okay.

438
00:38:42,035 --> 00:38:43,108
Ivy, you should go back to the game.

439
00:38:44,349 --> 00:38:45,131
Get up slowly.

440
00:38:49,311 --> 00:38:51,167
Don’t worry. I’ll take care of her.

441
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:58,402
Because you are taking care of her, that’s why I’m very worried.

442
00:39:01,668 --> 00:39:03,737
You need to receive a thorough examination at the hospital.

443
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,413
Your bone may be fractured or broken.

444
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,820
This is your phone. Call your parent.

445
00:39:08,957 --> 00:39:10,703
I need to inform them before I take you to the hospital.

446
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:19,314
Miss, I think my mom is in a meeting.

447
00:39:20,379 --> 00:39:24,620
Can I call her half an hour later?

448
00:39:25,288 --> 00:39:26,253
Sure.

449
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:28,376
I’ll go get more cooling gel.

450
00:39:44,325 --> 00:39:45,011
Lune.

451
00:39:46,228 --> 00:39:48,004
Lune, hurry up. You are so heavy.

452
00:39:48,103 --> 00:39:48,825
Wait a sec, Jewel.

453
00:39:53,737 --> 00:39:54,708
What are you doing here?

454
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,808
You’re so heavy. You almost broke my back.

455
00:39:58,908 --> 00:40:00,868
Miss, I have a headache.

456
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:02,699
Is it bad, Tiwakorn?

457
00:40:02,721 --> 00:40:04,758
I have a throbbing headache.

458
00:40:04,795 --> 00:40:06,185
My heart is beating irregularly.

459
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,660
Star, does your ankle hurt?

460
00:40:08,342 --> 00:40:09,608
The pain is not that bad.

461
00:40:10,521 --> 00:40:11,128
But…

462
00:40:12,641 --> 00:40:15,508
The nurse is going to take me to a hospital. She told me to call my mom.

463
00:40:16,564 --> 00:40:17,711
But I’m afraid to call her.

464
00:40:18,828 --> 00:40:23,306
If she finds out that I join the basketball tryout, she will be mad at me.

465
00:40:24,717 --> 00:40:26,302
I know. That’s why I’m here to help.

466
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,602
Star, give me your phone.

467
00:40:28,983 --> 00:40:29,619
Huh?

468
00:40:36,894 --> 00:40:38,253
Miss, don’t go.

469
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,037
My heart is beating abnormally fast.

470
00:40:42,491 --> 00:40:43,336
Don’t go.

471
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,690
(Hurry up.)

472
00:40:49,237 --> 00:40:49,868
Star.

473
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:51,078
I got to go.

474
00:40:51,114 --> 00:40:52,672
Call your mom.

475
00:40:52,974 --> 00:40:53,819
Tiwakorn.

476
00:40:56,091 --> 00:40:57,321
Are you alright?

477
00:40:58,447 --> 00:40:59,608
I’m fine now.

478
00:41:00,579 --> 00:41:03,109
It must be because of your hug.

479
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,465
Star, did you call your mom?

480
00:41:09,528 --> 00:41:11,324
Can I talk to her?

481
00:41:23,671 --> 00:41:24,404
Here.

482
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,506
Hello, Star’s mom.

483
00:41:29,182 --> 00:41:33,201
(Hello, Star. My lovely darling.)

484
00:41:35,453 --> 00:41:37,912
Your voice impersonation is terrible.

485
00:41:37,931 --> 00:41:39,601
- What do you want me to do? - I’ll do it.

486
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:47,773
He…he…he…hello.

487
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,309
What the hell was that?

488
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,281
We will get caught because of you.

489
00:41:51,296 --> 00:41:52,508
She will never be suspicious.

490
00:41:52,573 --> 00:41:54,426
Guys, how is it?

491
00:41:54,573 --> 00:41:55,626
Ivy, you get here right in time.

492
00:41:55,958 --> 00:41:56,942
Can you pretend to be Star’s mom?

493
00:41:57,545 --> 00:41:58,044
What?

494
00:41:58,062 --> 00:41:59,211
Pretend to be her mom.

495
00:41:59,992 --> 00:42:05,413
Star’s mom, I called to tell you that Star had an accident.

496
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:08,647
My goodness. Is she okay?

497
00:42:09,937 --> 00:42:12,546
From the initial examination, her injury is not serious.

498
00:42:12,565 --> 00:42:15,720
But I want to take her to a hospital to get a thorough examination.

499
00:42:15,937 --> 00:42:19,607
It’s okay I’ll take her to the hospital.

500
00:42:19,752 --> 00:42:22,016
I’ll take her myself.

501
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:24,437
But I have a meeting…

502
00:42:24,749 --> 00:42:25,568
(Meeting.)

503
00:42:28,832 --> 00:42:36,117
Mrs. Duean, you have a meeting with the shareholders this evening.

504
00:42:36,734 --> 00:42:39,078
I don’t think I can pick her up.

505
00:42:39,194 --> 00:42:43,419
But that’s okay. I’ll have my driver take her to the hospital.

506
00:42:43,866 --> 00:42:48,419
Sompob, can you take Star to a hospital?

507
00:42:48,662 --> 00:42:49,220
Som…

508
00:42:49,684 --> 00:42:50,430
Sompob.

509
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,330
(Yes, you.)

510
00:42:52,982 --> 00:42:53,943
Sure, Mrs. Duean.

511
00:42:54,848 --> 00:43:00,478
I 		Can you take Star to wait for my driver in front of the building?

512
00:43:00,499 --> 00:43:02,100
Thank you. Goodbye.

513
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,940
I thought we would get caught.

514
00:43:11,472 --> 00:43:12,960
We are lucky that Ivy’s voice sounds like an older woman.

515
00:43:12,976 --> 00:43:13,922
So the nurse believes us.

516
00:43:14,408 --> 00:43:15,346
Rascal.

517
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:18,422
We end up like this because I let you look after Star.

518
00:43:18,598 --> 00:43:20,422
We’re lucky that the nurse didn’t call her mom with her phone.

519
00:43:21,911 --> 00:43:24,220
Who will be the driver?

520
00:43:31,368 --> 00:43:32,509
I don’t know.

521
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:35,217
Ask Lune. This is his plan.

522
00:43:35,948 --> 00:43:36,869
Who will be the driver?

523
00:43:41,142 --> 00:43:41,940
I didn’t think about that.

524
00:43:42,198 --> 00:43:42,825
Huh?

525
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,524
We are screwed.

526
00:43:51,007 --> 00:43:53,050
How do I look? Do I look like a driver?

527
00:43:55,402 --> 00:43:56,717
Do you need to wear the sunglasses?

528
00:43:57,859 --> 00:43:58,911
You look like a bodyguard.

529
00:43:59,093 --> 00:44:02,151
If I don’t wear them, someone may recognize me when I attend a parent meeting at school.

530
00:44:02,168 --> 00:44:03,002
This is good.

531
00:44:04,847 --> 00:44:05,816
Are you sure?

532
00:44:10,327 --> 00:44:11,324
Close the window.

533
00:44:17,831 --> 00:44:18,610
This way.

534
00:44:18,688 --> 00:44:20,411
This way. I’m Star’s driver.

535
00:44:24,656 --> 00:44:26,659
Are you Star’s driver?

536
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:30,514
Yes, I’ve been working for her family since she was a baby.

537
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,333
I watched her learn how to walk and talk…

538
00:44:32,371 --> 00:44:34,161
I believe you.

539
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:36,057
Please take care of Star.

540
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:37,416
Sure. Thank you.

541
00:44:37,688 --> 00:44:38,382
Thank you.

542
00:44:38,546 --> 00:44:39,296
Thank you.

543
00:44:40,028 --> 00:44:40,906
Thank you.

544
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:45,420
You are…

545
00:44:54,251 --> 00:44:55,921
This is my father.

546
00:44:58,057 --> 00:44:59,866
This miserable-looking boy is my son.

547
00:45:00,161 --> 00:45:03,977
Thank you so much. Did I bother you?

548
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:04,771
No.

549
00:45:05,025 --> 00:45:08,314
If I didn’t help you, my son would be running around to help you.

550
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,302
He wouldn’t be able to eat or sleep.

551
00:45:09,731 --> 00:45:11,604
Dad, stop talking.

552
00:45:11,859 --> 00:45:14,005
We should go to the hospital before it gets late.

553
00:45:15,099 --> 00:45:16,410
Hurry up, Mr. Driver.

554
00:45:16,678 --> 00:45:17,908
You are the driver’s son.

555
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,677
Will you drive or shall I drive?

556
00:45:20,202 --> 00:45:20,908
I’ll drive.

557
00:45:21,925 --> 00:45:23,303
Wait. I’ll drive.

558
00:45:28,573 --> 00:45:29,336
Here.

559
00:45:29,628 --> 00:45:31,268
Your delivery is fast.

560
00:45:33,051 --> 00:45:34,010
Here is your money.

561
00:45:34,241 --> 00:45:35,211
Thank you.

562
00:45:35,684 --> 00:45:37,063
It’s good that you pay the exact amount.

563
00:45:37,081 --> 00:45:38,105
I didn’t bring any change with me.

564
00:45:38,348 --> 00:45:39,709
You always forget it.

565
00:45:48,789 --> 00:45:49,496
Hey.

566
00:45:49,712 --> 00:45:50,305
Hey.

567
00:45:51,125 --> 00:45:51,773
Hey.

568
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,388
Hey.

569
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,127
Hey.

570
00:45:56,026 --> 00:45:56,915
It’s you again?

571
00:45:58,674 --> 00:45:59,940
I haven’t given you the change.

572
00:46:00,097 --> 00:46:01,405
You ran here to give me the change?

573
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:02,908
Yes, yes, yes.

574
00:46:04,245 --> 00:46:06,297
But I don’t have any money.

575
00:46:06,881 --> 00:46:07,758
What’s wrong with you?

576
00:46:08,677 --> 00:46:10,013
I told you to keep the change.

577
00:46:10,031 --> 00:46:10,924
I can’t do that.

578
00:46:11,557 --> 00:46:12,426
That’s a lot of money.

579
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,965
What about this? Give me your hand.

580
00:46:19,604 --> 00:46:20,520
Give me your hand.

581
00:46:24,862 --> 00:46:26,343
I’ll write the name of my café on your hand.

582
00:46:26,499 --> 00:46:27,800
You can stop by any time.

583
00:46:28,321 --> 00:46:30,282
You already paid 1,000 baht. You can get several drinks.

584
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,703
It’s tickling.

585
00:46:39,271 --> 00:46:40,234
I’ll write somewhere else.

586
00:46:40,842 --> 00:46:41,976
Somewhere hard.

587
00:46:42,728 --> 00:46:43,373
Huh?

588
00:46:45,616 --> 00:46:46,936
My chest, I guess.

589
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,306
If that’s what you want.

590
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,108
Do you feel tickling here?

591
00:47:20,054 --> 00:47:20,678
Yes.

592
00:47:21,669 --> 00:47:22,909
I’ll write on your shoulder.

593
00:47:24,688 --> 00:47:25,402
That’s enough.

594
00:47:25,877 --> 00:47:28,768
I have a phone. Type your café’s name on it.

595
00:47:29,933 --> 00:47:30,663
That’s right.

596
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:37,265
Here.

597
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:40,139
If you get splashed again, you can come to my café.

598
00:47:40,786 --> 00:47:45,302
It’s a magical café. I can cast a spell to drive your stress away.

599
00:47:49,817 --> 00:47:50,614
That’s nonsense.

600
00:47:50,853 --> 00:47:51,814
I mean it.

601
00:47:52,534 --> 00:47:54,062
Why don’t you tell me one of your worries?

602
00:47:55,229 --> 00:47:56,602
Why do I need to share it with you?

603
00:47:57,645 --> 00:47:59,256
I don’t even know who you are.

604
00:47:59,397 --> 00:48:00,494
That’s right.

605
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,167
I’m a stranger to you. That’s why you can tell me.

606
00:48:03,657 --> 00:48:05,002
I’ll forget it in two days.

607
00:48:05,437 --> 00:48:06,214
You can trust me.

608
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:08,604
Why are your memories so short?

609
00:48:12,143 --> 00:48:14,567
Because my café is magical.

610
00:48:22,754 --> 00:48:23,614
You are wasting my time.

611
00:48:25,717 --> 00:48:26,946
Don’t forget to stop by.

612
00:48:35,737 --> 00:48:37,502
Don’t forget to apply the ointment as the doctor has ordered.

613
00:48:38,034 --> 00:48:38,690
Yes.

614
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:39,805
Thank you.

615
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:57,912
Lune, where were you today?

616
00:49:01,373 --> 00:49:03,340
I was preparing a medal for you.

617
00:49:03,869 --> 00:49:04,496
Huh?

618
00:49:05,906 --> 00:49:10,512
I bought medal-shaped chocolate to give to you after the tryout.

619
00:49:13,154 --> 00:49:16,121
But the chocolate melted.

620
00:49:17,426 --> 00:49:20,561
So I went to find a fridge to chill the chocolate.

621
00:49:21,577 --> 00:49:22,955
But it was too late.

622
00:49:22,965 --> 00:49:24,703
When I went to the gym,

623
00:49:27,029 --> 00:49:27,823
you were not there.

624
00:49:32,057 --> 00:49:33,361
Lune, you are so silly.

625
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:43,813
Are you going to give me the medal?

626
00:50:02,164 --> 00:50:02,958
That was funny.

627
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,600
That was why I couldn’t find you even though I kept looking for you.

628
00:50:13,128 --> 00:50:14,454
You were looking for me?

629
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:22,170
I mean…

630
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,063
I was looking for everyone.

631
00:50:31,177 --> 00:50:33,275
Why are you laughing? You should go home.

632
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:07,007
Good night.

633
00:51:10,337 --> 00:51:11,016
Good night.

634
00:51:20,297 --> 00:51:23,065
Star, did you have something to say earlier?

635
00:51:27,967 --> 00:51:28,911
Go home safely.

636
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:42,613
Aren’t you going in?

637
00:51:48,152 --> 00:51:48,811
I forgot.

638
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,120
Bye.

639
00:52:39,251 --> 00:52:40,631
White, you are so nice to me.

640
00:52:40,702 --> 00:52:43,448
If you have a crush on someone and want to confess your feelings to that person,

641
00:52:43,557 --> 00:52:44,669
what will you do?

642
00:52:44,721 --> 00:52:47,894
If you are not sure how you feel, why don’t you make it clear?

643
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,708
Am I really having feelings for you?

644
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:54,093
Do you know that I feel comfortable when I’m with you?

645
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,220
When should I tell Star that I like her?
