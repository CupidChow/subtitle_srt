1
00:00:00,102 --> 00:00:01,482
It’s the consent form for the basketball tryout.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,211
Your mom can’t find out about it, right?

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,316
Paul told me that you postponed your meeting with him today.

4
00:00:05,317 --> 00:00:06,413
Did you go to the concert?

5
00:00:06,429 --> 00:00:07,576
You lied to me.

6
00:00:07,912 --> 00:00:09,428
What design are we making?

7
00:00:09,527 --> 00:00:13,217
I created this design to represent those who don’t want to follow the rules.

8
00:00:13,226 --> 00:00:17,457
This outfit will tell them to come out and do what you want to do.

9
00:00:17,555 --> 00:00:19,949
I think when we go to send her off at the airport,

10
00:00:19,955 --> 00:00:21,265
We should prepare a big surprise for her.

11
00:00:21,274 --> 00:00:22,464
You just want to care for Sera.

12
00:00:22,488 --> 00:00:23,851
So you have to give our time to her?

13
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:25,042
I just want to make up to her.

14
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,965
I just want to give her the happiness that she never had.

15
00:00:27,973 --> 00:00:28,912
- I just want… - Lune!

16
00:00:28,925 --> 00:00:30,910
Isn’t this love?

17
00:00:31,223 --> 00:00:32,509
I can’t do this anymore.

18
00:00:34,736 --> 00:00:35,736
What should we do?

19
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:39,908
They both have their own reasons.

20
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:43,317
Lune just wanted to make up for his mistakes.

21
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:45,228
But he didn’t balance his time well.

22
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:47,872
He barely spent time with Star.

23
00:00:48,094 --> 00:00:49,616
But it’s only for now.

24
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:51,977
Whether it’s only for now or not, he shouldn’t do it.

25
00:00:52,241 --> 00:00:53,616
She is also his ex.

26
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,420
Anyone who was in her shoes couldn’t help but overthink it.

27
00:00:57,721 --> 00:00:59,610
You’re right.

28
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:04,207
I think we should arrange for them to meet and talk things out.

29
00:01:04,506 --> 00:01:05,842
If they talk when they calm down,

30
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,297
they may be able to work things out.

31
00:01:07,755 --> 00:01:09,208
Yes, let’s do it.

32
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:12,102
How do we arrange them to meet?

33
00:01:17,931 --> 00:01:18,931
I have an idea.

34
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:22,106
Let’s tell them that you break up with Tan.

35
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,431
You are in the Art Scrap room and feel very down.

36
00:01:25,696 --> 00:01:26,696
Huh?

37
00:01:27,365 --> 00:01:29,635
No! My love is going great. I won’t do it.

38
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,309
Ivy, I’m with you on the idea.

39
00:01:32,562 --> 00:01:36,111
Lune and Star are going to be worried about you.

40
00:01:37,241 --> 00:01:38,561
Think about it.

41
00:01:39,745 --> 00:01:40,745
Let’s do it.

42
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:42,019
No.

43
00:01:42,842 --> 00:01:44,025
I’ll tell Lune.

44
00:01:44,044 --> 00:01:45,044
No.

45
00:01:45,949 --> 00:01:47,213
Let’s follow the plan.

46
00:01:49,155 --> 00:01:50,814
Smack your lips now.

47
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,850
I won’t.

48
00:01:52,764 --> 00:01:54,484
I’m smacking my lips on my friend’s behalf.

49
00:01:56,905 --> 00:01:58,616
White, did you call Lune?

50
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:00,133
Yes, I did.

51
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,510
What about you?

52
00:02:01,752 --> 00:02:03,157
Star said she was on her way here.

53
00:02:05,305 --> 00:02:06,865
You two, pretend that you are fighting.

54
00:02:07,946 --> 00:02:09,210
- What the…? - Come on.

55
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:11,397
Do I really need to punch him?

56
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:12,277
Come on.

57
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:13,666
Do it so it will look convincing.

58
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,358
Why are you on their side?

59
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:18,066
I’m ready.

60
00:02:19,899 --> 00:02:21,207
One, two.

61
00:02:21,616 --> 00:02:22,616
Oh!

62
00:02:23,195 --> 00:02:24,570
I’m sorry.

63
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,911
I thought you would punch me after counting to three.

64
00:02:28,872 --> 00:02:29,872
Is he breeding?

65
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:33,896
Star.

66
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,330
Didn’t you say they were fighting?

67
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:24,201
Lune.

68
00:04:26,902 --> 00:04:28,570
Are you really breaking up with Star?

69
00:05:59,177 --> 00:06:01,300
Actually, I did wrong to Sera.

70
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:03,407
I don’t want to repeat it.

71
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:07,010
I’m thinking I want to be a better person.

72
00:06:08,192 --> 00:06:09,192
Lune.

73
00:06:19,798 --> 00:06:23,214
You said you are trying to move on from your past.

74
00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:25,245
But I don’t think that’s what it is.

75
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,100
You are stuck in your past.

76
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:32,967
You are stuck in guilt.

77
00:06:33,837 --> 00:06:37,214
You are stuck in something that is ruining your present.

78
00:06:41,574 --> 00:06:42,574
I…

79
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:48,170
I just want to fix what I did wrong to Sera.

80
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,800
So I can forget it and move on.

81
00:06:54,254 --> 00:06:55,471
Can you really forget it?

82
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:02,411
- I… - Can you completely forget it?

83
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:08,011
No one can forget their past.

84
00:07:08,552 --> 00:07:11,770
It’s about how you find a way to live with it.

85
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:15,708
Don’t let your past hold you back.

86
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:20,057
Lune, you said you don’t understand Star.

87
00:07:20,094 --> 00:07:22,408
But I think I understand her.

88
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,505
Can I ask you something?

89
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:32,112
Why did you choose Star over me that day?

90
00:07:39,162 --> 00:07:41,106
Star reminds me of who I used to be.

91
00:07:46,362 --> 00:07:52,405
She reminds me of the old me who was full of positive energy.

92
00:07:54,477 --> 00:07:56,408
Sera, do you remember how we became friends?

93
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:57,894
Of course.

94
00:07:58,325 --> 00:08:03,260
I remember you were very kind and gave me a lot of positive energy.

95
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,370
After I transferred to this school,

96
00:08:06,675 --> 00:08:08,355
I shut myself out from everyone.

97
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:11,078
My attitude changed.

98
00:08:11,272 --> 00:08:14,118
I thought it was better to live alone.

99
00:08:14,663 --> 00:08:16,306
Why have I never seen you before?

100
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,976
I usually don’t hang out with anyone.

101
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:19,536
I feel comfortable with being alone.

102
00:08:20,454 --> 00:08:22,735
I thought I could just keep my positive energy to myself.

103
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:26,708
Until I met Star.

104
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:32,705
She’s full of positive energy.

105
00:08:34,185 --> 00:08:35,185
This is great.

106
00:08:37,845 --> 00:08:41,371
She has so much positive energy that she spreads it to everyone around her.

107
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:45,014
Yes, no one can do it like she does.

108
00:08:46,385 --> 00:08:49,348
She helped me get back to being the best version of myself.

109
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,610
Boy, can I stop by one place first?

110
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,348
It’s strange.

111
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:16,816
Scientifically, the like charges repel each other.

112
00:09:18,053 --> 00:09:20,143
My relationship with Star is strange.

113
00:09:22,017 --> 00:09:24,819
We are both positive charges but we are drawn to each other.

114
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:30,811
It’s clear that you didn’t use Star to replace me.

115
00:09:31,722 --> 00:09:33,008
I never had such an idea.

116
00:09:34,828 --> 00:09:36,314
But she sees it that way.

117
00:09:37,022 --> 00:09:38,800
I can tell that is how she sees it.

118
00:09:43,168 --> 00:09:45,902
The more things she and I have in common,

119
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:48,174
The more she feels insecure.

120
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,100
No one can be a replacement for another person.

121
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,613
I don’t think I’m similar to her.

122
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,358
So this is what she meant that day.

123
00:10:04,748 --> 00:10:05,910
(Can I ask you for real?)

124
00:10:06,512 --> 00:10:08,167
Do you still have feelings for Sera?

125
00:10:08,598 --> 00:10:10,605
I’ve said many times that I have no feelings for her.

126
00:10:10,616 --> 00:10:12,817
Then why do you care so much about her?

127
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:15,297
- Why are you looking at it that way? - Why can’t I?

128
00:10:18,696 --> 00:10:19,696
Yes.

129
00:10:33,776 --> 00:10:36,413
(Boy, can I stop by one place first?)

130
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:42,601
(Playground?)

131
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,909
(Lune and I often went there when we were young.)

132
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:49,764
(There’s only a swing in the playground.)

133
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:52,702
(This is my secret spot.)

134
00:10:52,917 --> 00:10:54,604
(I often came here when I was young.)

135
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:56,668
(I felt better every time I came here.)

136
00:11:29,373 --> 00:11:33,004
I know you’re trying to fix your mistakes in the past.

137
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:35,702
Thank you for everything.

138
00:11:37,001 --> 00:11:38,308
You did well.

139
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,365
You don’t need to feel guilty.

140
00:11:41,811 --> 00:11:42,811
It’s okay.

141
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:49,232
I think it’s time for you to turn your back on your past and look ahead.

142
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,130
Don’t let the positive charges that are drawn to each other,

143
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:55,110
push each other away like in the scientific theory.

144
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:06,868
Thank you, Sera.

145
00:12:09,893 --> 00:12:12,965
From now on, don’t give your time for Star to anyone else.

146
00:12:23,469 --> 00:12:24,469
What are you waiting for?

147
00:12:25,672 --> 00:12:26,900
Go to see Star.

148
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,610
Thank you, Sera.

149
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,120
Star.

150
00:13:17,768 --> 00:13:18,768
Star.

151
00:13:21,488 --> 00:13:23,296
Girl, why are you still here?

152
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,767
I’ll get down soon.

153
00:13:40,257 --> 00:13:41,257
Star.

154
00:14:03,931 --> 00:14:06,607
(I want to fix my past.)

155
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,977
(But I end up ruining my present.)

156
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,371
(It seems that my future will never be the same again.)

157
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,210
Star.

158
00:14:58,099 --> 00:14:59,099
I’m sorry.

159
00:15:06,811 --> 00:15:07,811
I was selfish.

160
00:15:08,672 --> 00:15:10,272
I was only thinking about what I wanted.

161
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,660
I was an idiot.

162
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:23,160
I gave our time to someone else.

163
00:15:51,722 --> 00:15:52,722
Star, wait.

164
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,210
If you’re really going to leave me,

165
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:05,979
I want you to know…

166
00:16:10,832 --> 00:16:12,868
that I never chose you to replace anyone

167
00:16:25,306 --> 00:16:27,208
and no one can replace you.

168
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:39,463
The time I spent with you is amazing.

169
00:16:42,514 --> 00:16:43,909
It’s so amazing…

170
00:16:45,626 --> 00:16:47,971
that I don’t know if I will find it again.

171
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:56,306
I really want to be with you.

172
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:20,317
If you want to be with me, then follow me.

173
00:17:35,496 --> 00:17:37,684
Lune, someone might see us.

174
00:17:38,373 --> 00:17:40,853
I want to hold my girlfriend. I don’t care if someone sees us.

175
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,217
Stop it.

176
00:17:49,884 --> 00:17:51,416
I want to be with you forever.

177
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:53,099
Do you hear it?

178
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,072
Don’t say ‘forever’ if you don’t mean it.

179
00:18:03,802 --> 00:18:06,466
I said it because that’s how I really feel.

180
00:18:17,654 --> 00:18:23,671
I want to be with someone who will sing a song out loud with me.

181
00:18:26,878 --> 00:18:29,314
I want to be with someone who stays out in the rain with me.

182
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:36,565
I want to be with someone who wants to play basketball even though she’s injured.

183
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,668
I want to be with someone who is jealous of me.

184
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,890
I want to be with someone who helps me become a better person.

185
00:19:01,017 --> 00:19:02,257
Do you know I love you so much?

186
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:05,860
Yes.

187
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,011
Aren’t you supposed to kiss me now?

188
00:19:27,537 --> 00:19:29,305
Kids, why are you still here?

189
00:19:32,514 --> 00:19:33,669
We are leaving.

190
00:19:50,568 --> 00:19:52,808
Thank you, everyone, for sending me off.

191
00:19:53,515 --> 00:19:56,312
Sera, won’t you come back here?

192
00:19:56,994 --> 00:19:58,814
I’ll try to argue with my dad again.

193
00:19:59,635 --> 00:20:01,801
I’ll find a chance to come back here.

194
00:20:02,974 --> 00:20:04,508
Keep calm when you talk to him.

195
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:07,985
When you come back,

196
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,460
let’s scare the nerdy kids again.

197
00:20:11,514 --> 00:20:13,869
Let’s go to the water park owned by your family.

198
00:20:14,491 --> 00:20:17,051
The last time, I was worried too much about building my muscles.

199
00:20:17,145 --> 00:20:18,777
I won’t miss it the next time.

200
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,509
Yes, I want to go too.

201
00:20:20,743 --> 00:20:21,848
Stop it, both of you.

202
00:20:22,746 --> 00:20:24,202
Sera, you can always call me.

203
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:26,912
If I don’t answer your call, you can call Lune.

204
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:31,019
Yes, I promise that I’ll always stay close to her.

205
00:20:31,457 --> 00:20:32,457
Good.

206
00:20:33,045 --> 00:20:35,472
This time, you came to send me off.

207
00:20:36,047 --> 00:20:37,567
You don’t need to feel guilty anymore.

208
00:20:37,939 --> 00:20:38,939
Okay?

209
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,568
Take good care of Star.

210
00:20:44,211 --> 00:20:46,601
Don’t give your time to other women but Star.

211
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,577
If she’s mad at you again, I won’t help you this time.

212
00:20:51,748 --> 00:20:53,170
Sure. I promise.

213
00:20:57,134 --> 00:20:58,565
I got to go now, everyone.

214
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,604
Thank you for sending me off.

215
00:21:01,641 --> 00:21:02,641
See you, Sera.

216
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,414
Bye.

217
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:08,202
See you.

218
00:21:08,311 --> 00:21:09,551
Let us know when you get there.

219
00:21:12,511 --> 00:21:13,511
Bye.

220
00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:23,016
Things finally worked out.

221
00:21:23,334 --> 00:21:26,117
I hope we won’t have another problem.

222
00:21:26,782 --> 00:21:29,413
When you said that, I’m sure we will have another problem.

223
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
Hello.

224
00:21:41,257 --> 00:21:43,548
(Hello. Is this Star’s mother?)

225
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:47,668
Yes. Why are you calling me?

226
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:52,152
(The president of the parent council resigns before the end of her term.)

227
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:55,980
(We think you are perfect for the job.)

228
00:21:56,262 --> 00:21:58,502
(We want to invite you to discuss the matter at school.)

229
00:21:59,788 --> 00:22:04,610
Thank you for considering me for the job but I’m very busy.

230
00:22:04,816 --> 00:22:08,610
I think you can find other parents who are more perfect for the job than me.

231
00:22:08,856 --> 00:22:11,408
(No one is perfect for the job than you.)

232
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:14,860
(You are the CEO of a major securities company.)

233
00:22:14,936 --> 00:22:17,160
(Your daughter is loved by everyone in school.)

234
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:19,148
(She helps enhance our school's reputation.)

235
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:22,614
(With her academic excellence and role on the school basketball team.)

236
00:22:23,282 --> 00:22:24,282
Huh?

237
00:22:24,322 --> 00:22:25,322
What?

238
00:22:25,795 --> 00:22:26,875
The school basketball team?

239
00:22:27,365 --> 00:22:29,619
(Yes, she is on the school team.)

240
00:22:29,856 --> 00:22:33,112
(She beat a dozen of candidates to join the team.)

241
00:22:35,091 --> 00:22:36,091
Really?

242
00:22:36,908 --> 00:22:40,708
What else does she do at school?

243
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:44,211
(She is good at everything.)

244
00:22:44,385 --> 00:22:46,265
(I can’t tell you all about it in one day.)

245
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:50,711
(If you don’t want to be the president of the parent council, it’s okay.)

246
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,121
(We understand.)

247
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,120
Wait.

248
00:22:54,322 --> 00:22:56,642
Did you say you want to invite me to school to discuss it?

249
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,856
What did Star do?

250
00:23:07,742 --> 00:23:09,271
It won’t be enough if I only tell you.

251
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:10,312
I’ll show you her files.

252
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,564
Star is very talented.

253
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,768
She is good at academic studies,

254
00:23:16,026 --> 00:23:18,509
art, and extracurricular activities.

255
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,968
Her activities stand out more than her academic performance.

256
00:23:20,992 --> 00:23:23,828
We still have the consent form for the basketball tryout in the file.

257
00:23:29,687 --> 00:23:33,305
That’s why you are perfect for the job.

258
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,120
I’m not right for the job.

259
00:23:43,228 --> 00:23:47,503
Everything that Star did was good.

260
00:23:50,302 --> 00:23:51,760
But it’s not the best thing for her.

261
00:23:54,868 --> 00:24:00,275
All she needs to do is study hard when she is in a top school.

262
00:24:01,471 --> 00:24:05,706
After graduation, she won’t continue to do these activities.

263
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,608
Did you watch it last night?

264
00:24:13,765 --> 00:24:14,765
I’m sorry.

265
00:24:15,008 --> 00:24:16,008
It’s okay.

266
00:24:18,977 --> 00:24:19,977
White.

267
00:24:20,588 --> 00:24:23,706
Star is making her costumes in that room, isn’t she?

268
00:24:23,887 --> 00:24:27,229
I brought unused fabrics from home to give her.

269
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:30,309
Do you mean the Art Scrap room?

270
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:31,924
Room 134.

271
00:24:32,194 --> 00:24:33,794
You can put it on Star’s sewing machine.

272
00:24:33,881 --> 00:24:35,008
Okay. Thanks.

273
00:24:39,974 --> 00:24:41,205
The Art Scrap room?

274
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,720
Hey.

275
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,010
Is she Star’s mom?

276
00:24:48,191 --> 00:24:49,256
Yes.

277
00:24:49,762 --> 00:24:52,217
Do you think she heard what I said to Nana?

278
00:24:52,894 --> 00:24:53,894
Of course.

279
00:24:53,973 --> 00:24:55,219
You were loud.

280
00:24:55,629 --> 00:24:57,589
It would be freaking weird if she didn’t hear it.

281
00:24:57,783 --> 00:24:59,269
We are screwed, Jewel.

282
00:24:59,548 --> 00:25:00,548
Let’s go.

283
00:25:00,925 --> 00:25:01,717
Call Lune.

284
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,379
Come on.

285
00:25:02,531 --> 00:25:03,111
Why?

286
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:04,128
Hurry up.

287
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,247
We need to change this room into a science lab?

288
00:25:07,271 --> 00:25:08,817
Do you think Star’s mom will buy it?

289
00:25:09,482 --> 00:25:11,118
I don’t know whether she will buy it or not.

290
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:13,365
But if she sees the room like this, we are screwed.

291
00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:15,208
Where did you get this stuff from?

292
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:18,663
From the aspiring doctors who we made up the ghost story to scare them away.

293
00:25:18,687 --> 00:25:21,906
Damn. Do you think this will be enough?

294
00:25:23,905 --> 00:25:24,905
No.

295
00:25:26,035 --> 00:25:27,211
We need a secret character.

296
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:46,925
Alright, everyone. Let’s begin the separation process.

297
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:48,583
Excuse me.

298
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,737
Is this the Art Scrap room?

299
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:55,505
I think you misheard it.

300
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:57,714
This is a science room.

301
00:25:57,854 --> 00:25:59,417
We hold a science tutoring class here.

302
00:26:01,379 --> 00:26:03,311
They may sound similar,

303
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,814
science and scrap.

304
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:10,625
There is no Art Scrap room.

305
00:26:10,742 --> 00:26:13,016
Who would use that name? It sounds strange.

306
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,280
Who are you?

307
00:26:17,552 --> 00:26:21,986
I’m Master Alec. Nice to meet you.

308
00:26:25,548 --> 00:26:27,620
Why is the mannequin in the room?

309
00:26:31,111 --> 00:26:33,010
It’s not a mannequin.

310
00:26:33,026 --> 00:26:37,096
It’s an anatomic model in street art style.

311
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:38,912
Look how colorful it is.

312
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:45,660
Hey, everyone.

313
00:26:45,881 --> 00:26:47,506
So you are in the Art Scrap room.

314
00:26:48,322 --> 00:26:49,472
I was looking for you everywhere.

315
00:26:49,487 --> 00:26:50,911
I brought these fabrics for you.

316
00:26:52,155 --> 00:26:54,315
Art Scrap? No.

317
00:26:54,454 --> 00:26:56,177
This is a science room.

318
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:59,604
It’s called the Art Scrap. White told me.

319
00:27:01,694 --> 00:27:03,515
No, it’s not.

320
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,191
Hello, the Art Scrap fellows.

321
00:27:06,894 --> 00:27:10,677
The magical drinks from the magic café are delivered to the Art Scrap fellows.

322
00:27:11,177 --> 00:27:12,768
Why the heck do you keep repeating the name?

323
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:15,318
Why? I like the name.

324
00:27:15,823 --> 00:27:16,863
White, how did you come up with the name?

325
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:17,908
You are a genius.

326
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:23,177
These guys stole our stuff from the lab.

327
00:27:24,035 --> 00:27:26,115
What room is this?

328
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,291
It’s…

329
00:27:33,672 --> 00:27:34,672
Mom.

330
00:27:35,423 --> 00:27:38,167
Star, what room is this?

331
00:27:38,642 --> 00:27:39,973
What are you doing here?

332
00:27:46,783 --> 00:27:47,872
What room is this?

333
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,360
If you’re going to eavesdrop on them, you shouldn’t leave the room.

334
00:27:56,367 --> 00:27:59,914
If we did that, it would be too obvious.

335
00:28:01,422 --> 00:28:02,422
I’m confused.

336
00:28:04,238 --> 00:28:05,669
What room is this?

337
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:15,320
It’s the room I often come to do sewing.

338
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:20,408
Star, why are you acting like this lately?

339
00:28:21,345 --> 00:28:22,663
You went to the concert without telling me

340
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:24,914
and forged my signature to join the basketball tryout.

341
00:28:25,709 --> 00:28:28,029
You tried to set up this room as a science lab to fool me.

342
00:28:28,493 --> 00:28:30,611
Are there other things you lied to me?

343
00:28:33,226 --> 00:28:34,226
Star.

344
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:40,931
Answer me.

345
00:28:45,663 --> 00:28:46,663
Star’s mom.

346
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,671
Please don’t blame Star for this room.

347
00:28:51,386 --> 00:28:53,811
It was us who tried to set up the room.

348
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,840
She didn’t do it.

349
00:28:56,293 --> 00:28:57,293
Who are you?

350
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,080
This is none of your business.

351
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,260
I’ll apologize for my son’s action.

352
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,108
You not only lie to me but you also do this nonsense stuff.

353
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,534
You should spend your time doing something more useful.

354
00:29:16,977 --> 00:29:19,170
You told me we would work together. Did you forget it?

355
00:29:23,601 --> 00:29:27,219
Making clothes doesn’t make her a bad kid.

356
00:29:29,238 --> 00:29:30,278
What do you want?

357
00:29:31,005 --> 00:29:32,814
I told you this is none of your business.

358
00:29:33,306 --> 00:29:34,306
Yes, it is.

359
00:29:34,758 --> 00:29:37,862
Star is my son’s girlfriend.

360
00:29:39,254 --> 00:29:40,425
What are you talking about?

361
00:29:49,517 --> 00:29:51,011
Lune and I,

362
00:29:52,877 --> 00:29:54,211
we are dating.

363
00:29:58,154 --> 00:29:59,154
Since when?

364
00:30:03,653 --> 00:30:05,007
Why didn’t you tell me?

365
00:30:12,551 --> 00:30:13,551
Let’s go home.

366
00:30:14,499 --> 00:30:15,509
We need to talk.

367
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,320
Wait.

368
00:30:18,528 --> 00:30:20,158
Since our kids are dating,

369
00:30:20,998 --> 00:30:23,320
it’s not a bad idea for us to get to know each other.

370
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:25,320
How about a dinner?

371
00:30:26,342 --> 00:30:28,134
You will get to know my son.

372
00:30:34,696 --> 00:30:35,696
I’m asking you.

373
00:30:36,277 --> 00:30:37,437
Please have a dinner with us.

374
00:30:40,491 --> 00:30:42,202
You ordered many fancy dishes.

375
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:46,208
I’ll get to the point.

376
00:30:48,434 --> 00:30:53,705
I want your son and my daughter to stop seeing each other.

377
00:30:59,714 --> 00:31:01,434
Star has always been an obedient kid to me.

378
00:31:03,722 --> 00:31:05,703
But after she met your son,

379
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,268
she started to lie to me.

380
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,650
They started to do nonsense stuff together.

381
00:31:11,528 --> 00:31:13,908
She didn’t do anything nonsense.

382
00:31:14,808 --> 00:31:16,274
She just does things that she likes.

383
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,629
Are you saying I don’t know what my daughter likes?

384
00:31:20,054 --> 00:31:21,054
That’s right.

385
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:24,868
Parents should be the ones who know their kids the best.

386
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,314
Mrs. Duean, you ordered many dishes but none of them is Star’s favorite dish.

387
00:31:37,914 --> 00:31:39,605
Why don’t you order again?

388
00:32:05,235 --> 00:32:10,472
You ordered the best food on the menu but none of them is her favorite.

389
00:32:16,155 --> 00:32:19,668
The best thing and the thing that our kids like,

390
00:32:21,296 --> 00:32:22,506
they are not the same.

391
00:32:28,331 --> 00:32:29,717
I just want you to open your heart

392
00:32:31,016 --> 00:32:33,228
and take a closer look at what your daughter wants.

393
00:32:37,133 --> 00:32:38,915
You should go into her room sometimes.

394
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,862
It may help you get to know her better.

395
00:33:20,109 --> 00:33:21,982
(Mom’s work outfit.)

396
00:33:22,823 --> 00:33:25,213
(Mom often falls asleep while wearing a work outfit.)

397
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,112
(Because she is very busy.)

398
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,297
(So the collar shouldn’t be hard.)

399
00:33:29,322 --> 00:33:31,593
(Because it will make her feel uncomfortable while sleeping.)

400
00:33:31,617 --> 00:33:34,918
(The fabric should be breathable because she gets hot easily.)

401
00:33:35,607 --> 00:33:38,634
(Pants are better than a skirt because she walks fast.)

402
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,912
(It will be more convenient.)

403
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:42,509
(She doesn’t like light colors.)

404
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,823
(It’s better to choose a dark color, but not black.)

405
00:33:48,514 --> 00:33:50,564
(I’m not sure if she will like it.)

406
00:33:51,157 --> 00:33:53,837
(But I hope one day she will wear this outfit that I make for her.)

407
00:34:37,823 --> 00:34:38,823
Mom.

408
00:34:44,417 --> 00:34:45,899
Why are you crying?

409
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:52,222
I’m sorry, honey.

410
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:01,810
I never knew what you have been doing.

411
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:08,401
But you know everything about me.

412
00:35:14,582 --> 00:35:18,737
I was so busy with my work that I forgot about our relationship.

413
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,468
You don’t have to apologize to me.

414
00:35:28,776 --> 00:35:30,416
I know you are busy.

415
00:35:32,528 --> 00:35:33,771
I know you are tired.

416
00:35:35,777 --> 00:35:37,979
I know everything that you do, you do it for me.

417
00:35:40,155 --> 00:35:42,407
So I don’t add more worries to you.

418
00:35:47,435 --> 00:35:48,435
That’s why…

419
00:35:50,254 --> 00:35:51,402
everything you see here…

420
00:35:53,868 --> 00:35:55,977
I’m afraid to tell you about it.

421
00:35:59,703 --> 00:36:01,623
You already have too many things to worry about.

422
00:36:04,687 --> 00:36:06,816
It’s my fault that I never asked you.

423
00:36:08,284 --> 00:36:10,124
I never tried to have a conversation with you.

424
00:36:12,351 --> 00:36:14,770
I never came into your room.

425
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:21,262
I thought…

426
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:24,965
if I gave you the best things, it would be enough.

427
00:36:28,093 --> 00:36:29,300
From now on,

428
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:32,217
if you have something you want to do,

429
00:36:33,334 --> 00:36:34,514
you can always tell me.

430
00:36:36,693 --> 00:36:39,604
Don’t worry if I will set a high expectation for you

431
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,200
or what I will think about it.

432
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:45,980
As long as you are happy to do it.

433
00:36:46,736 --> 00:36:47,776
That’s good enough for me.

434
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:55,254
Okay.

435
00:37:25,131 --> 00:37:26,211
What are you looking at?

436
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:29,173
I’m watching them setting up the event.

437
00:37:29,465 --> 00:37:31,980
Do you know that this club gives everyone the freedom?

438
00:37:32,422 --> 00:37:35,977
Why don’t we apply to this club next semester?

439
00:37:52,936 --> 00:37:53,552
Hey.

440
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:57,030
Is this the same annual event that held the sand sculpturing contest last year?

441
00:37:57,069 --> 00:37:58,069
Yes.

442
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,740
It’s held by the club that Star really wants to join.

443
00:38:17,457 --> 00:38:18,616
Star.

444
00:38:18,816 --> 00:38:20,576
Éclair asked you to go to the dressing room.

445
00:38:20,703 --> 00:38:21,417
Don’t forget it.

446
00:38:21,447 --> 00:38:22,457
Yes.

447
00:38:26,964 --> 00:38:27,964
Today,

448
00:38:28,995 --> 00:38:30,214
Star’s dream has come true.

449
00:39:11,848 --> 00:39:12,848
Star.

450
00:39:13,395 --> 00:39:15,026
Do I wear it right?

451
00:39:15,797 --> 00:39:17,176
Let me see.

452
00:39:21,044 --> 00:39:22,044
You wear it right.

453
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,311
Éclair, can you help tuck this in?

454
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,165
Sure, I’ll take care of it.

455
00:39:27,509 --> 00:39:28,069
Don’t forget it.

456
00:39:28,085 --> 00:39:29,085
Star.

457
00:39:29,669 --> 00:39:30,711
Ivy.

458
00:39:33,407 --> 00:39:34,951
My makeup is full glam.

459
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,060
It’s heavier than the makeup I had when we slept over at Lune’s house.

460
00:39:39,426 --> 00:39:40,471
Good.

461
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,414
I want you to look prettiest.

462
00:39:42,792 --> 00:39:44,635
I want everyone to forget your tomboy image.

463
00:39:47,967 --> 00:39:50,312
What about her? Where is she?

464
00:39:52,294 --> 00:39:53,509
She said she was almost here.

465
00:39:56,002 --> 00:39:57,002
Star.

466
00:39:58,392 --> 00:39:59,401
Sera.

467
00:40:06,725 --> 00:40:07,888
Thank you for coming.

468
00:40:08,496 --> 00:40:10,768
Of course, I have to come. This is your big day.

469
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:13,570
I’m lucky that my dad allowed me to travel alone.

470
00:40:15,948 --> 00:40:17,111
Thank you so much.

471
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,219
This is your outfit.

472
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,601
Éclair, please help her.

473
00:41:08,371 --> 00:41:09,371
Star.

474
00:41:10,776 --> 00:41:11,776
Are you okay?

475
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:14,721
Yes.

476
00:41:15,868 --> 00:41:17,764
I’m just nervous.

477
00:41:21,274 --> 00:41:22,920
It’s like I’m dreaming.

478
00:41:25,322 --> 00:41:26,404
I can’t believe…

479
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:29,374
it’s really happening.

480
00:41:33,731 --> 00:41:34,731
Star.

481
00:41:36,924 --> 00:41:38,106
Don’t worry.

482
00:41:38,717 --> 00:41:40,205
It’s normal to feel this way.

483
00:41:41,334 --> 00:41:43,404
This is also my first time on a runway.

484
00:41:44,997 --> 00:41:45,997
Here.

485
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:47,583
I’m so nervous.

486
00:41:48,342 --> 00:41:49,342
Can you feel it?

487
00:41:53,968 --> 00:41:55,564
I’ve been working out since that day.

488
00:41:56,371 --> 00:41:57,371
Do you remember it?

489
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:00,768
Yes.

490
00:42:05,977 --> 00:42:07,045
Thank you, Lune.

491
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:13,281
Lune. It’s time.

492
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:15,063
Please go stand by backstage.

493
00:42:15,223 --> 00:42:16,223
This way.

494
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:21,471
Good luck.

495
00:42:22,872 --> 00:42:24,072
You too.

496
00:43:02,111 --> 00:43:04,503
Wow. She nails it.

497
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:10,561
Star told me that her designs are made from leftover fabrics.

498
00:43:11,057 --> 00:43:13,976
They are a mixture of different sewing techniques and fabrics.

499
00:43:14,257 --> 00:43:15,457
What is the collection called?

500
00:43:15,595 --> 00:43:16,595
Scrap Art.

501
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:19,977
She got the inspiration from the Art Scrap room.

502
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:26,469
The room is full of dreams, joy, sadness, and love.

503
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:29,460
It’s the place where she lives the life she wants.

504
00:43:30,214 --> 00:43:31,808
She gets to do what she wants

505
00:43:32,423 --> 00:43:33,910
and be who she wants to be.

506
00:43:35,262 --> 00:43:37,222
The diversity and the originality of the designs,

507
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,133
They are the reflection of her life and identity.

508
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:06,865
Smile.

509
00:45:09,656 --> 00:45:10,819
Can’t you do it right?

510
00:45:10,835 --> 00:45:11,758
What are you talking about, Ivy?

511
00:45:11,773 --> 00:45:13,420
My arms are longer than yours.

512
00:45:13,438 --> 00:45:14,438
I’m going to fall.

513
00:45:35,804 --> 00:45:38,512
I’m sorry I couldn’t go to Paradox concert with you the last time.

514
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:41,900
I hope this will make up for it.

515
00:45:41,964 --> 00:45:43,414
There are many times

516
00:45:45,703 --> 00:45:48,909
My heart wanders off and looks around

517
00:45:49,324 --> 00:45:50,915
My tears are falling

518
00:45:53,081 --> 00:45:55,983
For what it’s worth

519
00:45:56,798 --> 00:45:58,108
I was lost among the crowd

520
00:45:58,109 --> 00:45:59,744
The lyrics are the less-known version. I was lost among the crowd

521
00:45:59,745 --> 00:46:00,945
I was lost among the crowd

522
00:46:01,078 --> 00:46:03,503
I was confused and anxious

523
00:46:04,177 --> 00:46:07,668
But when I turned around and saw you, everything had changed

524
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,266
You are right here in front of me

525
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:15,108
The sky still looks the same

526
00:46:15,576 --> 00:46:18,213
This summer, I have you by my side

527
00:46:18,402 --> 00:46:22,702
Just like before, only you

528
00:46:23,308 --> 00:46:25,936
Ah ha ah ha ha

529
00:46:26,358 --> 00:46:30,154
The sky still looks the same

530
00:46:30,602 --> 00:46:33,210
This summer, I have you by my side

531
00:46:33,441 --> 00:46:37,971
Just like before, only you

532
00:46:42,878 --> 00:46:45,905
Since you left me

533
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:50,226
The sky is not the way it used to be

534
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:58,561
Summer is not the same without you

535
00:46:59,337 --> 00:47:02,400
Ah ha ah ha ha

536
00:47:02,724 --> 00:47:06,940
The sky is not the way it used to be

537
00:47:07,303 --> 00:47:15,303
Summer is not the same without you

538
00:47:39,755 --> 00:47:41,315
(Beside the fashion design, )

539
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:45,370
(Star’s mom supports her to do everything likes including basketball.)

540
00:47:45,585 --> 00:47:47,657
(Now, she has become a fan of our school’s team.)

541
00:47:47,677 --> 00:47:48,195
Hey.

542
00:47:48,262 --> 00:47:49,317
Hey, how can you do that?

543
00:47:49,605 --> 00:47:51,980
(Our families became close.)

544
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:55,322
(My dad and her mom became close friends.)

545
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:58,669
(They often talk and get advice from each other about parenting and work.)

546
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,680
Good job.

547
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,800
(But she is still a bit overprotective of her daughter.)

548
00:48:07,927 --> 00:48:09,720
(Soon, we became senior students.)

549
00:48:10,056 --> 00:48:12,277
(This is the year for college admission.)

550
00:48:12,748 --> 00:48:15,671
(We are lucky to have Star and Ivy help us with our study.)

551
00:48:16,017 --> 00:48:17,971
Who is the father of genetics?

552
00:48:21,407 --> 00:48:22,739
Stop playing on your phone.

553
00:48:24,091 --> 00:48:25,536
(Or is it our bad luck?)

554
00:48:25,552 --> 00:48:26,671
Why do I have to study?

555
00:48:26,789 --> 00:48:31,277
If we win the comic contest, we will get accepted into the college.

556
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,840
Are you sure that your team will win?

557
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:35,410
Damn.

558
00:48:36,385 --> 00:48:37,629
The result of the comic contest is announced.

559
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,640
Really?

560
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,340
Why can’t I find it on my phone?

561
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:42,690
Let me see your phone.

562
00:48:44,623 --> 00:48:45,979
Damn. We won.

563
00:48:48,979 --> 00:48:51,560
This means we don’t need Ivy’s stupid class.

564
00:48:57,186 --> 00:48:57,871
Wait.

565
00:48:58,048 --> 00:49:01,528
The college admission quota is only for the 1st prize winner, isn’t it?

566
00:49:02,854 --> 00:49:03,979
What prize do we get?

567
00:49:04,585 --> 00:49:05,703
Let me see.

568
00:49:10,188 --> 00:49:11,188
The 3rd prize.

569
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:14,440
Get back, guys.

570
00:49:14,874 --> 00:49:16,674
Where is the handout I told you to print out?

571
00:49:18,023 --> 00:49:19,023
I forgot to bring it.

572
00:49:21,604 --> 00:49:22,758
You forgot?

573
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:25,194
It’s okay.

574
00:49:27,751 --> 00:49:29,724
Because I have a printer.

575
00:49:33,377 --> 00:49:34,416
But I don’t have a computer.

576
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,440
But we can print files through a Wi-Fi connection.

577
00:49:40,094 --> 00:49:41,320
Come on. Wake up.

578
00:49:42,352 --> 00:49:43,352
Wake up.

579
00:49:59,637 --> 00:50:01,335
(In the summer break before our graduation.)

580
00:50:01,336 --> 00:50:01,980
Sera. (In the summer break before our graduation.)

581
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:02,789
Star. (We have a summer vacation at a resort owned by Sera’s family.)

582
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:04,230
(We have a summer vacation at a resort owned by Sera’s family.)

583
00:50:04,231 --> 00:50:05,511
How are you? (We have a summer vacation at a resort owned by Sera’s family.)

584
00:50:05,524 --> 00:50:06,478
Are you adjusting well to the new city?

585
00:50:06,499 --> 00:50:08,034
I’m adjusting quite well.

586
00:50:08,364 --> 00:50:09,616
I have a few new friends.

587
00:50:09,767 --> 00:50:11,616
How are you guys doing?

588
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,219
We are doing very well.

589
00:50:13,534 --> 00:50:14,902
I eat and sleep well.

590
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,220
I also have a lovely boyfriend.

591
00:50:19,201 --> 00:50:20,721
Do you need to do that in front of us?

592
00:50:22,016 --> 00:50:23,976
They are dating. It’s normal for them to do that.

593
00:50:24,183 --> 00:50:25,183
Like this.

594
00:50:26,478 --> 00:50:27,976
Lune.

595
00:50:28,149 --> 00:50:31,108
Will White and Ivy do it too?

596
00:50:33,266 --> 00:50:33,980
No.

597
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:36,733
If she kisses me, she might fall for me.

598
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:37,909
I would be in trouble.

599
00:50:39,259 --> 00:50:40,625
You are full of yourself.

600
00:50:40,728 --> 00:50:42,801
If I have to kiss you, I’d rather kiss a dog.

601
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:46,327
Have fun, guys.

602
00:50:46,557 --> 00:50:47,557
Bye.

603
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,574
Bye.

604
00:50:49,589 --> 00:50:50,589
See you.

605
00:50:53,477 --> 00:50:54,517
Let’s do water activities.

606
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,560
Let’s go.

607
00:50:56,862 --> 00:50:57,862
Get up.

608
00:51:08,912 --> 00:51:12,090
I have flowers in my hands

609
00:51:12,906 --> 00:51:15,127
But I don’t know whom to give them to

610
00:51:16,736 --> 00:51:19,278
Because I have no goals

611
00:51:19,408 --> 00:51:23,050
You are not here with me

612
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:26,791
I have dreams in my hands

613
00:51:28,438 --> 00:51:30,702
But what’s the point of having dreams?

614
00:51:32,242 --> 00:51:36,691
My dreams are meaningless because I have no one

615
00:51:36,951 --> 00:51:38,522
I feel lonely

616
00:51:40,844 --> 00:51:44,077
The person who is destined for me

617
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:48,040
What kind of person will she be?

618
00:51:48,574 --> 00:51:52,109
The person who will walk through the rain with me until the end

619
00:51:52,195 --> 00:51:55,668
The person who will cry and smile under the moonlight

620
00:51:56,232 --> 00:51:59,740
The sweet and sensitive person

621
00:52:00,155 --> 00:52:03,691
who will say ‘I love you’ and give me a goodnight kiss

622
00:52:04,063 --> 00:52:07,232
The person who pulls my ear when I secretly look at her

623
00:52:07,448 --> 00:52:11,179
The person who likes it when I try to make up with her if she’s in a mood

624
00:52:11,214 --> 00:52:13,179
What would it be like if I met this person?

625
00:52:15,531 --> 00:52:19,068
I’m still singing love songs

626
00:52:19,518 --> 00:52:23,051
The lonely and gloomy me

627
00:52:23,548 --> 00:52:26,954
I’m still searching for the person who belongs to me

628
00:52:27,051 --> 00:52:30,832
The person who will give me happiness on beautiful days

629
00:52:31,525 --> 00:52:35,074
When the sky turns bright

630
00:52:35,555 --> 00:52:39,050
When my love becomes meaningful

631
00:52:39,554 --> 00:52:42,977
When my lonely days come to an end

632
00:52:43,057 --> 00:52:46,804
When you are with me and we walk together

633
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,740
I hope this day will come true

634
00:52:49,758 --> 00:52:52,920
Wo oh, I’m looking for you

635
00:52:53,705 --> 00:53:01,705
Wo oh, I’m waiting for the day I’ll meet my destiny

636
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,201
Good job.

637
00:53:25,662 --> 00:53:26,662
Here.

638
00:53:27,257 --> 00:53:28,257
Taste it.

639
00:53:29,102 --> 00:53:30,485
Is it as good as your drink?

640
00:53:30,502 --> 00:53:31,715
Let me taste it.

641
00:53:42,244 --> 00:53:43,244
It’s pretty good.

642
00:53:44,362 --> 00:53:46,819
I forgot to cast the spell.

643
00:53:48,331 --> 00:53:50,628
What is the spell used to stun people?

644
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,269
Stupefy.

645
00:53:53,171 --> 00:53:54,171
Stupefy.

646
00:53:55,388 --> 00:53:56,548
What are you doing?

647
00:53:57,333 --> 00:53:59,830
I already cast the spell. You should act like you are stunned.

648
00:54:02,426 --> 00:54:03,426
Alright.

649
00:54:16,564 --> 00:54:17,564
Thank you, Tan.

650
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:19,601
For coming into my life.

651
00:54:23,448 --> 00:54:26,505
Usually, I didn’t care about other people’s feelings.

652
00:54:27,757 --> 00:54:29,512
I thought everything was easy.

653
00:54:32,428 --> 00:54:33,565
After you came into my life,

654
00:54:34,834 --> 00:54:37,007
I learned many things from you.

655
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:45,718
I know what it feels like when I love someone

656
00:54:50,085 --> 00:54:51,085
You can talk now.

657
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:53,656
Stupefy.

658
00:54:56,315 --> 00:54:57,475
It’s your turn to stay still.

659
00:55:00,324 --> 00:55:04,506
Thank you for helping me find many answers,

660
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:09,211
and for fulfilling the area where I lack.

661
00:55:13,463 --> 00:55:14,955
I’m glad that we met each other.

662
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,220
I don’t want to stay still anymore.

663
00:55:28,757 --> 00:55:30,570
Then don’t.

664
00:55:52,512 --> 00:55:53,512
What are you thinking?

665
00:55:54,502 --> 00:55:58,226
In the past few years,

666
00:55:59,053 --> 00:56:00,533
we went through many things together.

667
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:05,336
What do you think was the worst thing you went through?

668
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,605
It’s probably…

669
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:09,161
when Star rejected my love.

670
00:56:10,008 --> 00:56:11,219
My first rejection.

671
00:56:11,669 --> 00:56:12,813
I was really hurt.

672
00:56:13,506 --> 00:56:16,185
But it also helped us to grow closer.

673
00:56:16,986 --> 00:56:17,986
That’s true.

674
00:56:18,146 --> 00:56:20,410
We became heartbreak buddies.

675
00:56:21,474 --> 00:56:24,377
Thank you for being by my side.

676
00:56:25,728 --> 00:56:26,728
Me too.

677
00:56:26,998 --> 00:56:28,709
I’ll miss you after we graduate.

678
00:56:33,235 --> 00:56:34,235
What?

679
00:56:34,946 --> 00:56:36,167
I mean it.

680
00:56:40,946 --> 00:56:43,225
I’ll miss you too.

681
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
What are you saying?

682
00:56:48,841 --> 00:56:49,841
I say what you said.

683
00:56:55,494 --> 00:56:56,494
White.

684
00:56:58,278 --> 00:57:02,714
Have you ever imagined what it would be like if we were dating?

685
00:57:11,397 --> 00:57:12,397
Yes.

686
00:57:15,548 --> 00:57:16,788
But I don’t think it will work.

687
00:57:23,114 --> 00:57:25,823
You and I, it’s best for us to be friends.

688
00:57:28,034 --> 00:57:29,034
Give it to me.

689
00:57:35,551 --> 00:57:36,551
This.

690
00:57:37,493 --> 00:57:40,333
We will never cross this line and be something else other than friends.

691
00:57:41,035 --> 00:57:42,035
Okay?

692
00:57:52,748 --> 00:57:56,394
Oh, you are fooled.

693
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:56,951
Ouch!

694
00:57:56,992 --> 00:57:58,349
Ouch!

695
00:57:59,028 --> 00:58:00,028
Ivy.

696
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:08,459
Lune, do you remember the first day we met on the rooftop?

697
00:58:14,248 --> 00:58:15,248
Yes.

698
00:58:15,681 --> 00:58:18,757
You were looking for leftover fabrics.

699
00:58:19,077 --> 00:58:22,413
I don’t know what you did but things were falling on you.

700
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:25,798
Yes.

701
00:58:27,395 --> 00:58:29,117
It’s the place where we first met.

702
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:32,712
It’s also where I asked you to go to a concert with me.

703
00:58:35,642 --> 00:58:37,242
It’s the place where we became a couple.

704
00:58:41,035 --> 00:58:42,035
That’s right.

705
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:45,521
That day,

706
00:58:47,139 --> 00:58:48,985
it was a summer night.

707
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:51,979
Just like tonight.

708
00:58:56,231 --> 00:58:57,231
No,

709
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,117
it was different.

710
00:59:02,222 --> 00:59:05,213
Because now we don’t need to keep our love a secret.

711
00:59:17,001 --> 00:59:18,001
That’s right.

712
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:27,200
From now on, there will be only the star and the moon.

713
01:00:02,517 --> 01:00:06,912
I guess we will have to end the haunted room myth.

714
01:00:11,684 --> 01:00:14,805
When thinking that we won’t come here again, it’s quite sad.

715
01:00:20,525 --> 01:00:21,616
Don’t be sad.

716
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,716
Although our legend here has come to an end, we will continue to be friends.

717
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:26,100
We can always create a new legend.

718
01:00:26,216 --> 01:00:26,810
That’s right.

719
01:00:27,057 --> 01:00:30,090
Every time we are together, a disaster always happens.

720
01:00:31,946 --> 01:00:34,709
We will go to the same university anyway.

721
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,583
Except you, Jewel. You failed to get into a university.

722
01:00:38,757 --> 01:00:39,921
I didn’t fail.

723
01:00:40,426 --> 01:00:42,546
I’m waiting to attend a university with my boyfriend.

724
01:00:43,278 --> 01:00:44,410
You’re annoying.

725
01:00:48,191 --> 01:00:49,191
Shall we go?

726
01:00:49,447 --> 01:00:51,447
Let’s go to the hall. I think everyone is waiting.

727
01:00:51,703 --> 01:00:52,703
Yes.

728
01:00:58,730 --> 01:00:59,730
Let’s go.

729
01:01:00,152 --> 01:01:01,672
- What are you doing? - What the heck?

730
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,179
Are you waiting for your boyfriend too?

731
01:01:03,194 --> 01:01:04,194
- Alright. - Let’s go.

732
01:01:04,256 --> 01:01:05,256
Wait up.

733
01:01:27,272 --> 01:01:29,068
(Our graduation day has arrived.)

734
01:01:29,943 --> 01:01:33,789
(White and Jewel are still popular among girls.)

735
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:39,423
(Star is still shining brightly as always.)

736
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:43,008
(Ivy is still acting like her bodyguard.)

737
01:01:45,114 --> 01:01:47,506
(For me, I became a new person.)

738
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:50,911
(I used to walk alone.)

739
01:01:51,982 --> 01:01:52,982
(Now, I have friends.)

740
01:01:55,659 --> 01:01:56,659
(I have a lover.)

741
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:02,365
(I don’t know what the future holds for us.)

742
01:02:03,251 --> 01:02:04,771
(I don’t know what is waiting for us.)

743
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:07,280
(Will we have another fight?)

744
01:02:08,054 --> 01:02:09,574
(Will we continue to love each other?)

745
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:15,022
(No matter how many days, nights, and seasons pass.)

746
01:02:16,939 --> 01:02:21,216
(As long as we hold each other hands tightly.)

747
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:26,302
(I’m confident that we can get through anything together.)
